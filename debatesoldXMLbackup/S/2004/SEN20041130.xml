	<P>I have received notice from Senator Kate Walsh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the plans, if any, she has to increase the number of beds for cancer care to serve the population of 100,000 in north Kildare; if she will give consideration to using some of the existing beds in the Maynooth community unit for such care, in view of the fact that currently St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospice, the Curragh, is the nearest such facility and this imposes undue hardship on patients and their families.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the present position on the provision of a gymnasium at St. Raphael&rsquo;s College, Loughrea, County Galway.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an up-to-date list indicating which primary schools in the Dublin Mid-West constituency, from 1997 to date, requested funding for either building works or repair and refurbishment works; which of those schools were approved for the requested funding to date and, of those, the projects which have commenced or completed; and which of those schools still have their requests outstanding, either not yet approved, refused or not yet at commencement or completion stage.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment<?oasys [jy?>and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. No. 1 is a referral motion whereby the subject matter of motion No. 27 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for discussion. It concerns a change in the fees for licences issued or renewed on or after 1 January 2005. It is proposed to take this item without debate; No. 2, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of motion No. 28 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for discussion. It relates to the fact that all treaty provisions covered by the European Council decision will in future be adopted on the basis of qualified majority voting. It is proposed to take this item without debate; No. 3, Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 5 p.m.; and No. 4, statements on decentralisation, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to conclude no later than 7.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes with the Minister to be called on to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business last week, Senator Quinn called for a debate on road safety, particularly as we approach the Christmas holiday period. Last Sunday, there was an horrific crash on the M50 which was caused because the National Roads Authority decided not to install crash barriers on the median of that motorway. We need to debate this matter.</P>
      <P>To whom is the NRA accountable? In 2001, the Government told the NRA to install crash barriers. Members of Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council have repeatedly tabled motions calling for the installation of such barriers. In 2003, a jury at an inquest into the deaths of three young children stated that no motorway in Ireland should open to traffic in the future until suitable crash barriers are in place. Why is it that this unelected, unaccountable quango can refuse to follow the policy directives of politicians, locally and nationally, and think it can get away with it? Lives are being lost on our roads, particularly during this period. I understand the schedule is tight between now and the Christmas recess but I ask the Leader, if possible, to take up Senator Quinn&rsquo;s suggestion of having a debate on this issue before the recess. Such a debate would provide the NRA with a clear view from this House concerning the policy directives of politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Wednesday, the House had a long debate on Private Members&rsquo; time on the proposals and thoughts of the National Roads Authority. The issue of the proposed M3 motorway going through Tara was discussed at length. <Col N="1483"/>I congratulate the newly appointed Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Haughey, for emerging as the soul of Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>He has shown himself to be courageous and independently minded. Whatever way it works out, he has given a clear indication of his understanding of a complex issue. He reflects the views of many people who are very concerned. I have spoken to many such people in recent weeks. We should come back to the issues that were raised here last week.</P>
      <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday suggested that alternative arrangements could be made concerning the proposed M3, including a motorway connecting Navan and Drogheda. That would rule out the need for a motorway going anywhere near Tara. A number of other proposals should also be examined. The House should heed the points raised by Senator Mansergh in last week&rsquo;s debate. We should demand that the NRA listens to what we have to say. On the basis of what Senator Brian Hayes has just said, however, it is clear that the NRA is inclined to take no notice.</P>
      <P>Recently, I listened to a representative of the NRA speaking on the radio. I have never heard such contemptuous arrogance from any representative of a quango in the attitude he took to people&rsquo;s decently proposed and articulated concerns about Tara. If those of us who participated in last week&rsquo;s debate had heard him speak beforehand, we would have been far more cutting in what we had to say about the NRA. His comments gave me no confidence that I could trust him.</P>
      <P>When does the Leader expect us to return to No. 26 on the Order Paper? One of today&rsquo;s newspapers contains a long article on the appropriateness of a member of the Judiciary not being available for work for a number of years. No. 26 deals with the proposed dismissal of Judge Brian Curtin, which I cannot discuss in the House. However, I can ask when we hope to return to the issue on the basis that the action was rushed through with all haste. It had to be done and could not wait. Nothing was allowed to take precedence over this issue.</P>
      <P>This took place some months ago and in the meantime a hard-working committee of decent politicians from both Houses is working on the matter. As I have said before, they will eventually be hung out to dry on this issue and will get no credit for the work they will have done. I have no doubt a deal will be done eventually behind their backs and we will all be part of this impossible situation. The matter should be brought to a conclusion and we should ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do so in some other way than in the process under way at the moment. I cannot imagine we will ever come <Col N="1484"/>back to this debate before the next general election. Justice delayed is justice denied for the person in the centre of the matter. I hold no brief for the man in question; I have never met or spoken to him. However, I believe our concern is the application of justice and justice is not being applied in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also welcome a debate on the NRA and road safety as raised by Senator Brian Hayes. If we have such a debate we should particularly consider what needs to be done to make trucks safe on our roads. While I do not make any comment on the drivers themselves, the prospects of having a fatality or very serious injury are far greater for a person involved in an accident with a truck. Two recent cases involved people being killed by trucks travelling at very slow speeds. One involved a very elderly person who walked in front of a truck at traffic lights. The truck driver did not see the person, who was killed. One of the witnesses at the inquest into the accident referred to the need for legislation to require additional mirrors on trucks to prevent such accidents in the future.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Education and Science to the House to debate the right to education. I very much welcome the establishment of a body called Education Is Not For Sale, a coalition of teaching unions, students and other education experts. This body has highlighted the effective cut in third level funding evidenced in the recent Estimates, following on cuts made in the previous two years. This has resulted in the sector being very hard pressed in carrying out its duty to educate our young people.</P>
      <P>I notice a report in today&rsquo;s newspapers about the Minister for Education and Science establishing a new statutory body, Education Ireland, to help attract overseas students here. The Minister is reported as saying that the international educational services sector was one of the fastest growing business sectors in the world. I would like the Minister to outline to us what she is doing to ensure that our education system is not a business commodity, rather is a right for people from all sectors of society and at all levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my appreciation to the Leader for arranging a very early debate on the decentralisation programme at 5 p.m. today. I forewarn the Opposition and particularly Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not need to forewarn the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach should name him and shame him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I will do at 5 p.m. I ask the Leader to arrange an emergency debate on the crisis at An Post, where the Communications Workers Union has served strike notice on An Post management in the event of new <Col N="1485"/>work practices being imposed or the loss-making SDS parcel subsidiary being closed. As a former Minister in the Department, the Leader knows it is vital that a strike be avoided, that meaningful discussions take place and that there is no megaphone diplomacy conducted through &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; with Joe Duffy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no control over what happens outside the House. Will the Senator please deal with matters within the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The disruption of postal services at this time of year is industrial suicide and will do untold damage to An Post, its workers and management and the economy. There are 50,000 non-nationals who rely on the postal service to send funds back to their families abroad. In my town of Roscommon, approximately 450 Brazilian workers send money to their families. As the Cathaoirleach will recall, we relied on this money in the 1950s and 1960s. I recall my own family getting cheques from America and Britain which helped to keep families together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business. I do not remember getting any cheques from America. We will arrange for a debate on An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach may not have needed them but many of us did. If he was the youngest of eight children, he would have needed them. It is important that the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources comes into the House to explain the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Parliament is passing far-reaching legislation this week that will require all EU passport holders to have biometric information stored on their passports. We have been told that this is to meet US requirements for visa waivers. This, however, goes beyond those requirements because there is digital face scanning in the US. There should have been greater consultation with national parliaments in Europe on this issue. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs into the House to debate this issue, the costs involved in the issuing of these passports and the effect it will have on states within Europe. What safeguards will there be for the use of biometric information? Will citizens have the right to verify the information as correct? I do not want us to become a surveillance society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the NRA and road safety. There was a debate on one particular road last week but there are other issues of safety, especially in light of the horrific accident on the M50 at the weekend. The NRA is described as having made a U-turn in today&rsquo;s newspapers, where it is working on safety barriers on the Athlone bypass, but more work is needed.</P><Col N="1486"/>
      <P>I have called for a debate on the railways on a number of occasions. Attracting people to use the railways and opening new lines is important, particularly as the western rail corridor report should be available by early 2005. Progress has been made &mdash; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has announced that four new routes will open from 10 January between Dublin and Galway. The new route that starts in Athlone at 7 a.m. and arrives in Galway at 8.20 a.m. will be of great benefit. Hopefully, other commuter rail lines will be opened when the report by Mr. Pat McCann is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>All Members of the House will take the matter I wish to raise seriously. I have asked the Leader on numerous occasions in recent months to provide information about a Gulfstream jet that has been landing at Shannon Airport and last week she kindly furnished me with the information she had succeeded in getting. I read it carefully; it consists of a report from <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>and answers to parliamentary questions in the other House. These are all matters of public record, but they raise serious questions and do not answer the questions I have been asking. It is clear that the Minister was aware of reports that the aeroplane, N379P, had been involved in extraordinary rendition, namely, kidnapping citizens of other countries and taking them to third locations for torture. He also confirmed he was aware of these reports, and now of course we know that this is the subject of international legal action by one of the victims involved and of a protest by the Swedish Government. He confirmed that the aeroplane had landed 13 times up until the end of 2003. The American authorities have never notified the Minister for Transport or the Department of Transport of these landings. The aircraft got a new registration this year, N8068V, and has used Shannon three times already in 2004.</P>
      <P>I would like the Leader to ascertain the reason for this change. It obviously succeeded in one respect &mdash; it misled the Minister. He stated on 19 October that the aeroplane had not used Shannon at all in 2004&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but by 24 November he had to acknowledge three landings under the new call sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator cannot debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not debating. I am asking a question and I want the Leader to get answers to this issue. The Government has repeatedly made a weak case to the effect that it had no information concerning the aircraft being used for these illicit purposes. Eventually it said that the embassy had been told by the United States authorities that it was not used and would not be used in future. Will the Leader ask, in addition to the <Col N="1487"/>question I have already put, that we be told what personnel, at what level, gave the embassy these assurances? As a secret covert operation, it is covered by the plausible deniability doctrine, which is part of United States policy. Unless these questions are answered, we could be in a situation whereby a civilian kidnapped somewhere such as JFK, where one of these kidnaps occurred, could, strapped into an aircraft, land on Irish soil on the way to be tortured at some other destination. No Member of this House can regard this with other than the utmost seriousness. It will only be stopped if these questions are asked, or if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses its power to board that aircraft every single time it lands at Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, published its annual report for 2003 yesterday. It is a fine report and I would like to compliment all those involved on the information it highlights and the number of women&rsquo;s lives saved because of BreastCheck. However, as regards the west of Ireland, there is a line in the report which states: &ldquo;Subject to satisfactory completion of planning processes and the granting of planning permission, it is now projected that screening facilities will be commissioned in early 2007.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The women in the west of Ireland are as entitled as those in the east of the country to receive this treatment. We cannot wait for the full commissioning in 2007. The previous Minister for Health and Children granted &euro;20 million for this particular project. We need the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to intervene, knock a few heads together and ask what has to be done. We cannot wait until 2007. Women will die from breast cancer and this can be prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is widespread concern over the failure of the health boards throughout the country to implement fully and comprehensively regulations and criteria as regards residential child care centres. The social services inspectorate has clearly indicated its dissatisfaction over a whole series of important items, particularly with regard to the requirement that all appointments should be vetted by the Garda prior to being ratified. It seems that only three recent appointments have been treated in such a fashion. Obviously, there is great concern among the caring professions that this should be rectified as a matter of urgency. Will the Leader request the Minister for Health and Children to instruct all health boards to immediately comply with the criteria and requirements for such appointments and for the conditions within those residential centres? That they do not have a written safety and health statement is proof of their avoidance of the regulations put in place by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1488"/>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Leader aware the Minister for Education and Science has set up a new body, Education Ireland, on which I congratulate her? The aim of the body is to make Ireland a centre of educational excellence for international students. Undoubtedly it will attract more overseas students to come and study here which will, inevitably, be of tremendous benefit to the economy and society generally. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House to give us more details about this exciting new initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>On the subject of the roll-out of BreastCheck which I have raised here on a number of occasions, Senator Cox may not be aware that it takes 22 months to roll out the entire BreastCheck programme from beginning to end. The reason it is only starting now for the western area, which includes north Tipperary, is that the Government has not, until recently, given funding to the BreastCheck organisation to allow that happen. Women are dying because of the delay in providing funding for this extremely valuable and effective programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara might be happy to wait for that, but I am not. I am quite happy to have a fight here in this Chamber on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please. Senator O&rsquo;Meara, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Cathaoirleach. Although we have a busy schedule between now and Christmas, I ask the Leader to schedule a debate on Northern Ireland if it is appropriate and feasible. We hope the events taking place now are happening in an atmosphere of hope and optimism. In regard to remarks made by the DUP leader at the weekend, and reiterated today, I appeal for an atmosphere of forgiveness rather than one of recrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>A couple of weeks ago we debated the pros and cons of the national car test. It has come to my notice that Garda vehicles are exempt from the national car test. Surely the safety of garda&iacute; is as important as that of any other citizen in the State. We should not ask garda&iacute; to take cars out on the road which do not have the proper safety measures in place. The Minister announced a traffic corps last week and can bring new cars to Dublin from various divisions around the country. However, he should be asked to ensure the Garda has the proper resources in its vehicles and has proper vehicles to drive when going out on our behalf to fight criminals. The Minister should be asked to address that problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators O&rsquo;Meara and Cox on their concern regarding the delay in extending BreastCheck to the whole country. Both Senators are correct in saying that women are dying because of a lack of this programme.</P><Col N="1489"/>
      <P>On a more cheerful note, I ask the Leader for a debate on the report on the excellent hospice movement which, I am sure, all of us have had the good fortune to avail of from time to time. This worthy institution is, I am sure, supported by all Members and it would be worth looking at the new report with a view to giving the movement further support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on the National Roads Authority, particularly in light of the appalling accident on the M50 which happens to be in my area. This was the site of another accident which resulted in death some time ago, due to the fact that the crash barriers are not in place. It was not today or yesterday that a call was made to the NRA to provide crash barriers. Numerous calls have been made on Fingal County Council to have these crash barriers put in place on the M50 and other major national routes. It is time the NRA listened to public representatives who know what is necessary to help avoid the types of crashes that occurred in the past week and for a number of years. Its response has been that sufficient money was not made available to deal with the issue. Given that roads are being built at a cost of hundreds of millions of euro, I do not understand why additional funding cannot be provided to put safety on our roads first. It is time we had a debate on the NRA and road safety generally.</P>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Leader expect the terms of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works will be taken in the House? I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes and others for a debate on the NRA following the appalling recent accident, and other accidents, and in light of the remarks made here last week, coupled with the remarks of the distinguished Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. It is timely to have a debate on the NRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the requests for a debate on the NRA and road safety. We should include in the debate the option of making crash barriers removable in sections. Such a facility would mean that if a crash takes place, at least traffic could be diverted, avoiding a massive build-up of traffic stretching for miles, as witnessed over the past few weekends. Crash barriers should be removable in sections which is standard practice in Europe.</P>
      <P>On the issue of passports, many people who are planning to travel abroad over the Christmas period are being told by travel agents that their passport must be valid for six months after they are due back home. I understand this is incorrect. The law makes it clear that once one&rsquo;s passport is valid for the day one returns home, it is valid, full stop. This new rule goes against the law and <Col N="1490"/>it needs to be clarified for both the travelling public and travel agents. This is incorrect information which makes a mockery of our laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns of Senator Cox regarding the delay in the roll-out of BreastCheck in the west of Ireland. I raised the issue in this House on many occasions. I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Meara that the Department of Health and Children has not properly funded this service. A woman living in the west of Ireland is more likely to die from breast cancer than a woman living in any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>What is happening in the Department of Transport? I would like the Minister to come to this House to outline when speed cameras, promised last year by the previous Minister, Deputy Brennan, will be delivered. It appears they will not now be introduced until at least 2006. As a result of the Government&rsquo;s dilly-dallying, more people will die on the roads. We are aware that the introduction of speed cameras can reduce road deaths by up to 20%.</P>
      <P>The Department of Transport is hiding behind many issues. It is unfair for county councils and local authorities to take the credit for good decisions and blame the NRA for bad decisions. The NRA does not have autonomy. It comes under the administration of the Department of Transport and we cannot blame it for decisions willy nilly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Ryanair has opened up new routes from Shannon Airport. It is good that I can travel to Shannon and avail of extra routes to Europe and the UK. This is something I cannot do from Dublin Airport because the second terminal has not even been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, raised the need for a debate on road safety, echoing what Senator Quinn said last week. The Road Traffic Bill 2004 will be taken in the Seanad next week. However, I am aware it covers a different matter.</P>
      <P>The Senator also asked to whom the NRA is accountable. We cannot have bodies that have no regard to anybody. The Minister may intervene or speak with such bodies on certain issues. However, it is an independent body. People have for a long time been asking questions regarding crash barriers. The NRA took a unilateral decision not to erect them. Now it is putting them up. Crash barriers are currently being erected on the bypass around Athlone over a distance of three or four miles. I also take the point that such barriers might be demountable in the case of a crash.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of the proposed M3 motorway through Tara. He referred to last week&rsquo;s debate on the matter and congratulated the newly appointed Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Haughey. When I read the newspapers today I took the view, like Senator <Col N="1491"/>O&rsquo;Toole, that Deputy Haughey will be his own person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems a Haughey is needed out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator asked about the progress of a particular inquiry. All I can tell him is that it is sitting as we speak. I suggest that he speak to some of the members of the committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That would not be fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They might be able to tell the Senator when or if it is drawing to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator Tuffy agreed with Senator Brian Hayes on the NRA. She also referred to the new body, Education Ireland, which has been set up by the Minister for Education and Science, and to the new Education Is Not For Sale group. She asked whether the focus in education would be always on the economic aspects or whether there would be room for education of the mind and spirit as well. I very much agree that there is another dimension to education.</P>

	<P>He asked whether there would be time for an emergency debate on An Post. He described the disruption of postal services at this time of year as industrial suicide. Senators Ross and Hanafin asked for a debate on An Post last week and the week before. We postponed having a debate. However, we should now try to have one because none of us knows now whether there is any point in posting Christmas cards. I will, therefore, endeavour to see whether a debate on the issue can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon asked that the Minister for Foreign Affairs be invited to the House to explain the new EU directive on the storing of biometric information on passports. Senator Kitt has on a number of occasions called for a debate on the railways. I will endeavour to facilitate such a debate. He referred to the new routes Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is putting in place. He also agreed on the need for a debate on the NRA.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris questioned the material I gave him. I will speak to him afterwards with a view to furthering the matter. Senator Cox referred to the publication of the annual report of BreastCheck and the need for the Minister to intervene, given that it would be early 2007 before screening facilities would be in place, even though the money has already been granted. Senator O&rsquo;Meara told <Col N="1492"/>us it takes 22 months to roll out the entire BreastCheck programme.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the regulations regarding residential child care centres and the vetting of appointees by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The chief inspector with responsibility for children&rsquo;s residential homes stated on radio this morning that vetting occurs post-appointment. That is worrying. I will therefore ask the relevant Minister to come to the House to debate the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked whether the Minister for Education and Science could come to the House to give us more details regarding the new education body, Education Ireland, which was also raised by Senator Tuffy.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara stated it took 22 months to roll out the BreastCheck programme. She also called for a debate on Northern Ireland, which I had thought of myself. Given the prevarication and pushing back of the date for possible agreement, I am not sure such a debate will be possible but I will make the request. We are all following developments on the issue.</P>
      <P>While Senator Cummins stated Garda vehicles are exempt from the national car test, I am not sure this is so.</P>

	<P>Senator Henry referred to the hospice movement and I agree the issue would make for a good debate as interesting facts are emerging from surveys thereon. Senator Terry called for a debate on the NRA in the context of Sunday&rsquo;s horrific crash, which influences all our comments today.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan will have to inform me of the convention on literary works as I am not aware of it. However, I would be keen to learn more and perhaps Senator Coghlan and I could have a conversation through you, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Browne that crash barriers should be removable in sections. While I do not know of the passport rule he has unearthed, it <Col N="1493"/>would make a good and pithy Adjournment matter.</P>
      <P>I was glad Senator Feighan referred to BreastCheck, an issue which concerns women and men. The Senator also questioned the pace of delivery of speed cameras. In conclusion, he stated that Ryanair had opened new routes from Shannon. While I was delighted to read of this, we should be wary because the routes may be chopped before passengers get on the aeroplanes.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">1.&mdash;Money realised on the making of disposal orders under the Principal Act as amended by this Act shall be used for community development purposes in disadvantaged areas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment was first tabled by Labour Party Members in the D&aacute;il, where the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, rejected it. I am tabling the amendment again because it is a good idea. A lot of money will result from this legislation. Will it simply go to the Exchequer? Will there be no visible relationship between it and the money put into initiatives to help communities affected by crime, particularly with regard to preventative measures?</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I suggested that the moneys could be put into education initiatives. The Minister of State is aware, for example, of a project in Clondalkin, the Carline Centre of Learning, where young people who could potentially be involved in crime in the future are given training and encouraged to take up other options in life. The initial idea was to take young people involved in joyriding and show them how to work on the mechanics of a car, so as to give them a positive attitude to cars, use their energy in a positive way, give them a means of employment in the future and get them back into mainstream education. I would like to see money from the proceeds of crime going into such areas.</P>
      <P>I raised another concern on Second Stage. This legislative initiative is welcome in that it gets money for the Exchequer and returns ill-gotten gains to the public coffers, which is a good thing. However, I am concerned that the criminals involved are still carrying out their businesses with a detrimental effect on other people&rsquo;s lives and communities. Apart from bringing money in, how will this measure ensure that something is done about crime? The Minister of State might respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Tuffy that these moneys should be ploughed back into the areas most affected by crime. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support the amendment. I have been speaking about this matter for quite some time. I think the first legislation in this area &mdash; the Proceeds of Crime Act &mdash; was introduced by the former Minister and Deputy, Nora Owen. <Col N="1495"/>Many of us on both sides of the House argued that the moneys gained from certain criminal activities should be ring-fenced for the communities most affected by disadvantage. Since then there has been significant progress in this area. The Government has outlined, in a kind of statistical manner, the situation in the RAPID areas. We know exactly from the district electoral divisions where areas of disadvantage are greatest.</P>
      <P>There is a need to ring-fence moneys from this procedure so that those communities, which have been ravaged and worst affected by drugs and whose fabric has been virtually destroyed as a result of the drugs trade over the past 20 years, can see tangible proof in this legislation that they will receive money.</P>
      <P>Psychologically, it is important for a community to see that half, one third or one quarter of the money going towards building a swimming pool, for example, has come from some of these gangsters who have murdered people in the community for many years as a consequence of the drugs trade. Not only is it financially important the money is kept for these communities but it is psychologically important because people will be able to point to a new scheme which has been provided as a result of money which has come back to the communities via these people who attempted to kill their children as a result of the drugs trade. It is important we ring-fence this money. I support amendment No. 1 and ask the Minister of State to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has seized in excess of &euro;60 million. I realise the Department is ploughing moneys into crime prevention and so on but any moneys seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau should be additional to those funds and should be put back into the communities which have been ravaged by the scourge of drugs, in particular. Those moneys should go to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than to the Exchequer. I hope the Minister of State will raise that matter with his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I do not believe any right-thinking person would disagree with the suggestion that this funding should be ploughed back into communities which have been ravaged by drugs and all sorts of criminality. I hope the Minister of State will be able to address this matter. Admittedly, given the seven-year period involved, not all of the &euro;60 million would come on stream at the same time. It is preferable that the money will come on stream year after year, depending on when it is released. Moneys coming in from the proceeds of crime should be put back into those communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand why Senators Tuffy and Cummins tabled these amendments. The issue was discussed at length on Second Stage in the other House and, indeed, in committee when the Mini<Col N="1496"/>ster undertook to go back to the Department of Finance to see whether he could elicit a more sympathetic response to it. There are some arguments, in principle, against it. One is that additional layers of bureaucracy would have to be established to monitor the allocation of any such additional funds. This could not be justified unless significant added value in excess of the additional administrative costs could be shown.</P>
      <P>Senators are well aware of the existence of partnership groups, RAPID groups and various other groups which disburse moneys and determine priorities in areas of disadvantage. The ring-fencing of moneys for community-based initiatives in disadvantaged areas, as Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s amendment proposes, would create another such body because clearly one would have to be established to distribute the earmarked funds. Senators must be familiar with the arrangement regarding disadvantaged areas whereby facilities including dormant accounts, the RAPID programme, the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund and partnerships are in simultaneous operation. In order to give flesh and bones to Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s amendment, it would be essential to establish yet another entity to disburse the money in the manner envisaged in that amendment.</P>
      <P>Moreover, we must bear in mind that not all the funds obtained by the Criminal Assets Bureau are drugs-related. Some funds come about as a consequence of tax offences, for example. The acquisition of such funds by the CAB is an uncertain and variable revenue source. This militates against properly planned programmes and locally based community initiatives. The Department of Finance confirmed once again in October that its policy in this area had not changed.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendment refers to the question of the fight against drugs. A recent study by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ranked Ireland fifth in the EU in terms of the amount spent in fighting illegal drugs. We spend some &euro;183 million per annum on prevention, treatment and supply reduction. Senator Cummins also rightly referred to the matter of timing and that the seven-year rule is only now coming into play. Moneys are only transferring to the CAB at this stage and being transferred from the bureau to the Exchequer. It is only now that the Exchequer is beginning to receive the benefit of these funds. The initial case was taken in 1996 and, as the Senators have observed, it was the former Minister, Nora Owen, who introduced the legislation. This legislation, however, was formulated by the current Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and taken up and enacted by former Deputy Owen as a Government measure.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this mean the Minister of State will accept the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The initial case came before the courts in 1996 and continued some time after the enactment of the legislation. The bureau has had funds for some seven years but those funds are only now coming into operation. Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendment No. 6 seeks to shorten the time for the distribution of the funds from the CAB to the Exchequer from seven to three years. This would be welcome news for the Exchequer as the accumulated funds from the past three to four years would become payable immediately. On advice from the Attorney General, however, I cannot agree with that element of the amendment. Acceptance of such a provision could expose the legislation to some constitutional hazard in that a balance must be struck between the acquisition of property rights and the rights of persons claiming ownership in them, and their expropriation by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and ask him to elaborate on the constitutional barriers to reducing the length of time from seven to three years. It would be beneficial if the funds were to come on stream in a shorter period than seven years. The Minister of State might expand on any constitutional prohibition on such a reduction.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 2 proposes the insertion of a definition of &ldquo;drug related initiatives&rdquo; into the Bill as meaning, &ldquo;voluntary and State funded programmes established to discourage people from taking drugs, or established to assist in the rehabilitation of drug users&rdquo;. The insertion of this definition would enable the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the proceeds of crime seized by the State are applied to the appropriate organisations and initiatives, which are focused on addressing the damage caused by those engaged in illegal drug activity. The three amendments are being discussed together but I ask the Minister of State to explain why the constitutional prohibition must be seven years. Can it not be reduced? Will the Minister of State accept the amendment relating to drug-related initiatives, as proposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s response to my amendment and that of my Fine Gael colleagues is that he is concerned that the measure proposed would bring about another layer of bureaucracy and would require another implementation body. I share his concern about that type of approach. The problem for the Carline learning centre, to whose funding difficulties the Minister of State has given assistance, is that it must apply to several bodies for funding and does not know from year to year whether it will have <Col N="1498"/>sufficient funds to carry out its work. The work of the centre is very much related to the work of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The centre advises public representatives that it would like to see definite funding from a particular Department, for example, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While the Department works in this area it needs to become more involved. It must take positive measures to prevent crime or, as in this case, to make reparation for the effects of crime.</P>
      <P>Most communities are, to some extent, disadvantaged by crime. There are people who are so wealthy they may not feel the effects to any extent, but crime is as much an issue in middle class suburban areas as in working class areas. Nevertheless, the effect of crime is greater in some areas than others and some areas have been very much neglected.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the RAPID programme. Yesterday, I heard the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who is responsible for RAPID, speaking about the programme on &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo;. The RAPID programme was announced with great hurrahs some years ago but I cannot see any extra funding coming through the programme. It is completely ephemeral. I would not be surprised to hear a claim that an extra roll of Sellotape had been acquired as a result of RAPID funding. I am sure the Minister of State will contradict what I am saying but whether he will do so with clarity is another matter. We want to see money being made available and making a difference to communities. This is the type of thinking behind the amendment.</P>
      <P>The issue of Garda resources was raised on the Order of Business. The Minister of State is aware of this problem in the areas he represents. Developing communities, such as Lucan south and north Clondalkin, do not have enough garda&iacute;. They experience everything from anti-social behaviour to gangland murders. We need more garda&iacute; on the ground and more Garda resources. Such measures could be funded by means of disposal orders. I do not suggest a partnership approach or piecemeal funding, rather I have proposed that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform use the disposal orders for definite funding of positive community measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand what the Minister of State means when he refers to the ring-fencing issue. The measure proposed in the Fine Gael amendment would benefit his Department and various spending allocations within it. Is it his view that it is a good idea to funnel additional money into drugs related schemes, particularly in communities about which other colleagues have spoken? This is the only chance we will get to do that. Irrespective of the seven-year aspect, this is a new source of money which will come back into the coffers of the State.</P><Col N="1499"/>
      <P>The Minister of State makes the lame argument that the amendment would lead to more bureaucracy and additional administrative pressures. The Department has already conceded on that point with regard to the drugs courts, albeit in the form of a pilot scheme. A new drugs court has been established to help expedite the cases of those who come before the courts for crimes relating to drug habits. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is much maligned in both Houses but it responded fairly and swiftly in this area by establishing a drugs court with a small administrative bureaucracy. The same principle applies to this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s second argument is that the money need not be ring-fenced because it will always be there. If the money goes into a big black hole in the Department of Finance it will be lost to other schemes. On the other hand, there is a connection between money gained through drug related crime and funding of drug-related community initiatives. The Minister of State represents a constituency similar to that of Senator Tuffy and myself. He must appreciate the psychological effect of being able to point to a new facility in a disadvantaged area and telling the people of the area that the money for the facility came from those who had been trying to kill their children over the previous ten years. It is important for the State to make the bold assertion that funding for community facilities has come back from drugs barons into disadvantaged communities. This is an argument of justice as much as anything else. The people who are most affected by drugs crime will see the proceeds of crime being put to good use. For the State to reaffirm itself and tell communities it cares is as important an issue as the issue of finance.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the Government has dramatically increased funding for treatment programmes, particularly community led programmes. That is to be welcomed. Nevertheless, one of the key proposals in the White Paper on volunteerism was to move from annual to multi-annual budgeting so that community groups would know, over a three or four-year period, what they are going to get. If funding was derived in the way proposed in amendments Nos. 1 and 2, the Minister of State could tell disadvantaged communities what they will receive over a period of several years instead of having them rely on year to year funding as they do currently. I ask the Minister of State to look again at this issue.</P>
      <P>Almost all of the drug treatment programmes in my own constituency continually ask that money coming back from the Criminal Assets Bureau be ring-fenced. This is something the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would want to support if the considerations of the Department of Finance in the matter could be put to one side.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1500"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the constitutional scheme of things the Minister for Finance can never be put aside, much as we would all like to do so from time to time. Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s contribution was eloquent and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform welcomed his support for a point of view on this matter. The more money the Department can get for various areas the better.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the general point stands. The Exchequer is a general fund and there is a disposition not to favour specific earmarked funds. For many years in the Department, the funds of suitors were applied for various public purposes. They were used to redecorate the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Cork Opera House. The amount of the fund was contingent and uncertain and had to be used for certain capital projects which arose from time to time. Ultimately, it was found to be unsatisfactory and it was decided to put the fund at the disposal of the Courts Service for the upkeep of the courthouse system. There is now an earmarked fund for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The amendments have the general objective that the money realised be used for community development purposes in disadvantaged areas or for State-funded programmes established to discourage young persons from taking drugs or to assist in the rehabilitation of drug users. These are all services which the State must provide. This contingent and uncertain sum will not fund them with any degree of precision, regularity or reliability. Senator Cummins was anxious that I should read into the record the opinion on the constitutional issue he raised. There were two reasons for the seven-year limitation period. First, there is the question of rights a third party may have to some of the property. The other reason is the constitutional issue, to which I referred. The primary purpose of the legislation is not to enrich the Exchequer with appropriated property but rather to freeze proceeds of crime to deprive those concerned of the benefits of criminal proceeds. The most constant criticism of the legislation has been that it penalises individuals without the individual affected being convicted of any offence. A reduction of the period between the interlocutory order and the disposal order to three years might render the legislation more open to challenge on the grounds that it is penal confiscation without due process. The shorter the period before the forfeiture stage, the greater the chance that the forfeiture may be viewed as penal from a constitutional perspective and thereby invalidate the legislation.</P>
      <P>The period of seven years does not overcome all the relevant periods under the Statute of Limitations but it does address the majority of them. At the end of seven years, any contractual claims against real property will have been defeated, albeit that claims by mortgagees and other claims against real property will not have been defeated in that time. In drawing up the seven-year time limit, a view was taken that the Oireachtas was entitled to strike a balance. It was a balance that <Col N="1501"/>had to be carefully considered in light of constitutional considerations. Seven years was settled on as a defensible period of time. That is why that is written into the legislation. In fact, we have taken the pain of that now because the seven-year period is passing and funds will be coming into the Exchequer, although with no great regularity or predictability, depending on the success of the operations of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy referred to the Carline project, a very worthy endeavour in her constituency. In talking about services that are provided to young persons, it is important to distinguish carefully from where the referrals are coming. Are they coming from schools in the context of children who are not getting all they should from the education system and where an alternative is required? In that case, the referral is essentially educationally based and funding should come from the Department of Education and Science. I understand that the project to which Senator Tuffy referred does receive such funding from the Department of Education and Science. On the other hand, are the referrals coming from social workers engaged in health board care work, where particular persons are seen to be at risk and vulnerable in their family settings? They may require community supports which might include the type of support or services provided by Carline, in which case funding should be earmarked from the health boards.</P>
      <P>As regards the justice system, however, it is not enough to make a generalised appeal to prevent crime. People must be referred to such a service from the probation service or from the juvenile liaison officer at an earlier stage or, ultimately, from the courts. I agree with the Senator that there is merit in that. One of the difficulties in funding organisations such as Carline has been an insufficient funding base in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If there is to be such a funding base, it must be carefully laid down under the Children Act where we are going, what particular service is being provided and how it helps a group that is at risk of offending.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has established a departmental taskforce or project team on youth justice to examine how the scope for rationalising the delivery of services under the Children Act 2001, which provides a modern statutory framework for a youth justice system, can be improved. Submissions were invited, the deadline for receipt of which was last Friday. The purpose of the taskforce is to make decisions. The submissions are currently being examined in the Department and a definite conclusion will be drawn from them. I will also look into the issue raised by the Senator concerning the immediate funding requirements of Carline. In fact, I have already been engaged in that.</P>
      <P>To return to Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s general points on this issue, the Exchequer is not a black hole. At this time of year when we are engaged in the great operations of raising income and <Col N="1502"/>expending money, we know that very well. The Exchequer is a place to which people are reluctant to commit and on which substantial demands are made. That there is one central Exchequer fund enables any Government to determine where its priorities are. There is a case to be made that needlessly earmarking excessive funds can lead to a distortion of priorities. The funds available from this will be committed to the Exchequer and I have no doubt they will be applied for good purposes.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, line 16, to delete &ldquo;State;&rdquo;,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;State,</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) for the avoidance of doubt, &ldquo;criminal conduct&rdquo; shall be construed as involving conduct irrespective of whether that conduct has resulted in a criminal conviction;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment seeks to extend the definition of what actually amounts to criminal conduct. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken a very narrow approach to establishing what criminal conduct means in constituting an offence or more than one offence. Is there a case for a broader definition of criminal conduct? Is there a case, for example, for establishing a definition of criminal conduct irrespective of whether the conduct has resulted in a criminal conviction?</P>
      <P>Many people are engaged in criminal conduct who are never caught or convicted. The amendment would more accurately reflect the literal interpretation of the words &ldquo;criminal conduct&rdquo; which the Minister has chosen. Under the narrow definition proposed in the Bill such people would not be considered to be engaged in criminal conduct. I wonder whether we should establish the <Col N="1503"/>fact that criminal conduct may not necessarily mean or involve a criminal conviction. The amendment could possibly broaden the ambit of the Bill and would certainly make more possibilities available to the Criminal Assets Bureau. I ask the Minister of State to consider that definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments suggest adding to the definition of criminal conduct a provision to construe criminal conduct as involving conduct irrespective of whether that conduct has resulted in a criminal conviction under both the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. Essentially, the Senator is moving these amendments on the basis of putting a matter beyond doubt or for the avoidance of doubt. The Senator&rsquo;s intention is clear enough and has some merit but the basis upon which the 1996 legislation &mdash; with which we are dealing here &mdash; was founded is well established. As I mentioned earlier, it is not penal or criminal legislation, it is civil legislation. It is a civil forfeiture procedure which seeks to sequester the proceeds of a person&rsquo;s crimes, rather than seeking to obtain a conviction against that person.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Bill it is important to realise that it does not constitute legislation which is part of the penal or criminal code. It is called the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill but the remedy provided to the Criminal Assets Bureau under its provisions is civil in character. It concerns a civil forfeiture and for that reason, after the matter had been considered in considerable detail, the Minister was advised by the Office of the Attorney General that the references proposed by Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendments should be avoided in the legislation, lest the balance that exists between civil forfeiture, as against the criminal forfeiture that operates under the Criminal Justice Act 1994, should be upset. It is argued that by clarifying that definition of crime, in the way Senator Cummins understandably advocates, one would upset the balance upon which the legislation proceeds, namely that it is a civil forfeiture procedure.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, to delete lines 33 to 36.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The wording in lines 33 to 36 would reverse a Supreme Court decision and would undermine normal court procedures in an undesirable way. We wish to uphold the existing Supreme Court decision and normal court procedures. It is important that due process is allowed so that the <Col N="1504"/>Act can stand up legally and under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Rather than being brought by way of an originating notice of motion, which is a very basic document, applications should be brought by the Criminal Assets Bureau in the ordinary way by normal detailed pleadings where the case would be set out in some detail with the right to raise particulars and file a defence. The Supreme Court recently upheld the application of normal procedures in the case of McK. <i>v</i>. F. This provision in the Bill seeks to reverse that Supreme Court decision. We accept the Supreme Court decision and our amendment seeks to retain it. Clearly if the procedures which normally apply were upheld by the Supreme Court, the case for changing them just to suit the Criminal Assets Bureau is weak. Leaving the Bill as is will open the way for further legal challenges possibly leading to another very high profile defeat for the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
      <P>The Minister has previously said the amendments benefited defendants and that the matter could be remitted for a plenary hearing. We believe a defendant will be able to apply for the filing of affidavits if our amendment accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is correct to say that the Supreme Court decided in the absence of any expressed provision that the appropriate procedure was by way of plenary summons followed by the exchange of pleadings between the parties. Under the rules of the superior courts, where no expressed procedure is prescribed, all proceedings must be included in that residual category. As no expressed provision was specified in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Supreme Court ruled as a matter of law that in the absence of an expressed provision, the appropriate provision under the rules of court was to proceed by way of plenary summons and exchange of pleadings.</P>
      <P>While the Supreme Court has indicated that on its construction of the rules of court this is the arrangement to be followed, as was its decision in the case to which the Senator referred, it does not mean this must be the procedure. Far from suggesting that this was the appropriate procedure, the Supreme Court was simply construing the rules of court and identifying what procedure, as a matter of law, the rules required. It is still open to the Oireachtas or even to the rules committee in the courts to prescribe otherwise.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill allow the matter to appear on a court list at the earliest opportunity with the full case of both parties set out in a formal manner. As drafted, the Bill proposes that proceedings would begin by way of originating notice of motion, which would be grounded on an affidavit. Hence the Criminal Assets Bureau would be obliged to put its case on sworn affidavit before instituting proceedings. Under the arrangement that has obtained since the Supreme Court decision, the Criminal Assets Bureau is not required to do that and can simply make an alle<Col N="1505"/>gation as I am sure the Senator is aware. Not alone that, this type of procedure with an originating notice of motion grounded on affidavit allows the matter to be brought into the court list at an early opportunity, which is always desirable in a matter of this kind affecting the property rights of an individual.</P>
      <P>Were the alternative procedure to apply, by way of plenary summons and statement of claim, with which Senators are familiar from personal injury litigation, matters could drag on for a number of years and proceedings could proceed in a very dilatory manner, without opportunity to bring the substance of the matter to court prior to the close of the pleadings and the service of a notice of trial, at which point it enters the court list. In the case of a matter, which has originated by a notice of motion, the matter can be brought to the court in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>At that stage the respondent party to the application can put its case on affidavit on oath. The court can then decide, having looked at the case candidly proposed by both sides how the matter can be efficiently disposed of and whether it would require a full trail with evidence heard or whether it can be disposed of on the sworn evidence already before the court. This is the procedure proposed in the Bill. Were we to adopt the alternative procedure, the various pleadings having closed and the notice of trial having been served, the matter would enter a court list and might take a considerable time to be heard.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that the form of procedure in the Bill has been used by the Oireachtas and the court rules committee in other analogous contexts. For example, the enforcement of the planning legislation is done by way of this procedure whereby a notice of motion is issued and served along with an affidavit setting out why the applicant &mdash; often, but not necessarily, a local authority &mdash; maintains a breach of the planning code has taken place and the matter is then brought into a court list where it can be adjourned from time to time but at least the matter is brought expeditiously before the court. This is a far superior procedure than leaving it to the realm of a residual category in the rules of court whereby a case proceeds by way of plenary summons and statement of claim, which may extend proceedings over a long period of time.</P>
      <P>No specification was made as to how the application for an order should be made and in the absence of specific rules of court the Supreme Court decided, as the Senator outlined, in McK. <i>v</i>. F. that the section 3 application was a plenary trial after full pleadings. This is unsatisfactory as it allows any issue about proceeds of crime to be pleaded in general terms so that the parties are not really aware of the case to be made until the trial opens. Under existing legislation, it would be possible for the bureau to start an application on a writ, which would seem very prejudicial to a defendant. Equally the current position means that defendants are under no obligation to specify at an early stage the case they will make. This <Col N="1506"/>can allow for the duplication of proceedings and a multiplicity of hearings with unnecessary costs. The provision that applications may be made by originating motion allows for the hearing to be placed on the court list at the earliest opportunity with the full case of both parties set out in a formal and sworn manner.</P>

	<P>While what the Minister of State has outlined makes sense, if in the absence of their being prescribed elsewhere, the Supreme Court sets out what it considers are the necessary procedures, surely it views these procedures as being fundamental. The Minister of State believes legislators may prescribe an alternative procedure to that which the Supreme Court might prescribe in the absence of the legislators specifying what is required. It could be argued that the need for pleadings is fundamental, which is why the Supreme Court would require them when nothing is specified in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have perused the judgment of the Supreme Court and in no sense did it suggest any fundamental reason for so deciding other than that the rules of court provide that where no procedure is prescribed the procedure by way of plenary summons applies. The Supreme Court did not suggest there is a fundamental reason we must have the plenary procedure other than that the fact that the rules of court had not provided for any other procedure. It is important to realise that order 1, rule 6 of the rules of the superior courts mandates the use of the plenary summons procedure in all instances where there is no other procedure specified. Frequently another procedure is specified under legislation or under the rules of court. If we used the words &ldquo;in a summary manner&rdquo; in legislation for the jurisdiction of the High Court, the procedure by way of special or summary summons will apply.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In this instance, no procedure was specified in the legislation and, therefore, the residual hold-all section of the rules came into force. The Supreme Court is stating that if there is no express provision in the Act as it stands, we are obliged to provide the rules which state that this is the form of procedure for this type of application where nothing else is provided. The Supreme Court did not state there is anything more fundamental than that in arriving at its conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important amendment that was referred to on Second Stage last week, when notice was given of inclusion of two additional provisions relating to hearsay evidence in the context of admissibility documents and a corrupt enrichment provision. The hearsay provision is contained in the new section 16A of the principal Act. As outlined on Second Stage, the need for the provision on hearsay evidence has <Col N="1510"/>arisen following a decision of the Supreme Court in the Criminal Assets Bureau <i>v.</i> Hunt case, delivered on 28 February 2003. In that case the court took the view that the reference at the end of section 8(5) of the 1996 Act to information, documents or other material obtained by bureau officers being admissible in future proceedings did not bypass the rules of evidence but merely allowed such documents to be admitted in accordance with the usual rules, notwithstanding their origin.</P>
      <P>The decision obliges the Criminal Assets Bureau to prove bank records by means of the bankers&rsquo; books evidence legislation, business and administrative records and transactions in land and other property by means of oral evidence, thereby adding a considerable administrative burden to its workload in preparing cases for court. The bureau has expressed concerns about the added administrative burden in proving large volumes of business and administrative records and transactions in land and other property arising from that decision.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment will be restricted only to proceeds of crime cases under the remit of the bureau. Due to the manner in which the provision is worded to refer to documents that are admissible, the measures available to both applicant and respondent or a third party who might make an application under the Act.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) sets out that certain documents are to be admissible in any proceedings where evidence of any fact of which direct oral evidence would be admissible without further proof. The documents concerned are a document which consists of a part of a record of a business or a copy of that document, a deed and a document which purports to be signed by a person on behalf of the business and which states that designated document or documents constitute the record, or part of the record, of the business, or is a copy or copies of such records or documents, or there is no entry or other reference in the records to such matters, provided that in both those instances the person has knowledge of those matters.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) contains an important safeguard that sets out that a document is not admissible under subsection (1) if the court is of the opinion that, in the interests of justice, it ought not to be admitted. Subsection (3) provides that the section is without prejudice to any other enactments and rules of law which authorise documentary evidence. Subsection (4) sets out certain necessary definitions of the expressions &ldquo;business&rdquo;, &ldquo;deed&rdquo;, &ldquo;document&rdquo;, &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;records&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment should facilitate the admissibility in evidence of large volumes of records which are generally of a routine nature and which are not in dispute between the parties. Provisions allowing for the relaxation of the ban on hearsay on documentary records are common in legislation and often essential to make the documents admissible before the court in the absence of their makers or persons who kept them. It is onerous to require for every document that the person <Col N="1511"/>who either made or kept the document to prove the continuity of possession of a document in a case involving a multiplicity of documents. The essential safeguard is inserted that the court has the important residual discretion not to admit a document where the interests of justice so require. Where any question arises, the court can refuse to admit the document without better proof of who made it, in the course of what duty and who has kept it since.</P>
      <P>The other new section 16B contains a corrupt enrichment order provision. This provision deals with the position where someone by means of a corrupt act is able to benefit from the enhancement of value of property acquired arising from the corrupt act. On Second Stage the example was given of a person who bribes a council official to allow him or her to build 60 rather than 50 houses in a development. This amendment will provide for a procedure to go after the additional profit generated by the bribe by obtaining a corrupt enrichment order against the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) defines the concept of unjust enrichment as meaning that a person who derives pecuniary or other advantage or benefit as a result of or in connection with corrupt conduct. Corrupt conduct is then defined by reference to the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Official Secrets Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act. A definition of property is included.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that where it appears to the court on hearing evidence that a person has been corruptly enriched, the court can make a corrupt enrichment order directing that person to pay to the Minister for Finance or other person specified by the court an amount equivalent to the amount by which the court determines the person has been enriched. Subsection (3) provides, until the contrary is shown, for a presumption of corrupt conduct on the part of a defendant when three conditions are fulfilled: that the defendant is in a position to benefit others in exercising his or her official functions, some other person has benefited and the defendant does not account satisfactorily for his or her property or the resources or income from which it is derived.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) provides that the court has power to prohibit disposal of or dealing with the property concerned or prevent diminution of its value. Subsection (5) sets out that the evidence to be furnished to the court by the Criminal Assets Bureau is a belief that the defendant has derived a specified pecuniary or other advantage or benefit as a result of the corrupt conduct, is in possession or control of property acquired directly or indirectly as a result of or in connection with the corrupt conduct and is in possession or control of specified property and that the property was acquired directly or indirectly as a result of or in connection with the property already referred.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) provides for the court to make an order which directs the defendant to file an <Col N="1512"/>affidavit specifying his or her property or income or both and contains a safeguard that such an affidavit is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the defendant or his or her spouse except in perjury proceedings. Subsection (7) applies the provisions of the new sections 14 to 14C, relating to search warrants, orders to make material available, prejudicial disclosure and trust to this provision of corrupt enrichment. The civil standard of proof is applied to these proceedings and the rules of court applicable to civic proceedings are applied to proceedings under this section. The Minister has a considerable interest in the introduction of a principle of this kind into Irish law and Senators will welcome the provision that puts this matter beyond legal doubt and spells it out in the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>These are substantial amendments and form a major part of the Bill before the House. I agree with the Minister of State that they are necessary. However, I wonder why they were not included in the Bill <i>ab initio</i>. I would certainly agree with the corrupt enrichment order which provides that anyone who has benefited from crime should be penalised.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned about the kite which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has flown on a few occasions as regards planners giving permission for 50 or 60 houses. Is there any evidence that cases such as this have arisen, because we have heard the Minister mutter something to this effect on numerous occasions, as if it was the norm every day of the week in local authorities? It has not come to my notice on any occasion that developers would get permission for 60 rather than 50 houses, or whatever. Is there evidence that this practice is widespread throughout the country or is it just something the Minister heard about, anecdotally, and wishes to legislate for?</P>
      <P>We agree with the whole concept of the amendments as put forward. We cannot disagree with anything that gives greater powers to combat crime, to bring criminals to heel and seize their money and we will support such an initiative. However, we wonder why such lengthy amendments are being tabled after the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999 was introduce. They provide much of the meat on the bones of the actual Bill that came before the House initially.</P>

	<P>It was decided not to have a corruption assets bureau and that the Criminal Assets Bureau was the right body for that task. The Senator inquired whether there was any particular conduct that gave rise to what is being proposed here. If one examines the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments by Mr. Justice Flood, there was one obvious example of conduct which this particular provision would apply to in an appropriate case. Clearly, it is a perspective, in effect, but the purpose of a provision such as this is to give far <Col N="1513"/>greater legal clarity to the position of the bureau and that of the person who has been unjustly enriched as a result of corrupt conduct. It gives a clear remedy, which allows the value to be recouped by the Minister for Finance or another person. While it might have been possible to construct this proposal as a general matter of civil obligation, without enactment, clearly, spelling it out in statutory black and white enormously strengthens the capacity of the law to deal with this type of conduct. The Minister took considerable legal and constitutional advice before finally settling on the formula which I am now introducing to the House.</P>

	<P>I would like the Minister of State to clarify a number of matters as regards the new section 16A and subsection (2), which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Evidence that is admissible by virtue of subsection (1) shall not be admitted if the court is of the opinion that in the interests of justice it ought not to be admitted.</P>
      <P FLI="0">What is the reason for the amendment in the first place, since the courts have decided it was not in the interests of justice that various proofs be not admitted? Will that not be decided in any event because that provision is included? I wonder whether the legislation is trying to be clever, but perhaps it is not. It might not ultimately address the problem it purports to deal with. That is something that occurred to me as I was reading the amendment.</P>
      <P>As regards the section dealing with the corrupt enrichment order, I do not have any problem with that, as such, but am concerned, nonetheless, if it relates to an issue such as planning. Where this happens, the damage will still have been done to a community. We are currently hearing a good deal about what happened in previous development planning matters, and whether the correct decisions were made and the reasons behind them. Once land is built on and a particular community is developed, in the building sense, the effects are there and the damage is done. Even though the Exchequer gets its money, will a particular community ever get any redress as regards the problems it has experienced as a result or will it see the perpetrators brought to justice in terms of having to serve jail sentences? Will this mean that some of these people will get away with it, even though they pay money over to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to both points raised by the Senator is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Taking them in sequence, I will deal first with the question of the relaxation of the hearsay rule, as proposed by the Minister. The common law developed the rule that evidence is not admissible if the person submitting it is not available in court to give the evidence on oath and be subjected to cross-examination. In general, it is in the interests of justice that this should always be so, when persons are <Col N="1514"/>giving accounts of the transaction of events from memory.</P>
      <P>However, the application of the rule to the proof of documents has occasioned considerable inconvenience down the years. In the proof of a document the rule requires that not alone should the original be produced in all cases, but that the maker of the document or the person who kept it in the course of his or her business or calling, should be available to prove it. If the document has been out of the possession of that person in the intervening period, the continuity of its possession must be proven to the court&rsquo;s satisfaction and successive keepers or handlers of a document should also be available to give evidence.</P>
      <P>A famous decision was handed down in England and Wales in the 1960s, where a prosecution as regards a stolen car racket collapsed because counsel was not in a position to call the makers of the records for the manufacturers who installed the relevant chassis numbers on the cars and could match them to registration details. So, in the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, the Oireachtas provided for substantial relaxation of the rule as regards documentary matters in the general law of evidence.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed here is the specific relaxation applicable to the Criminal Assets Bureau. It seems a reasonable relaxation. The reason the formula &ldquo;in the interests of justice is improved&rdquo; is being inserted is that in all these matters relating to the proffering of evidence, some residual or ultimate discretion must be left to the court to do justice between the parties. However, it seems that a rigid application of the hearsay rule to documents can, in itself, produce injustice in the sense that it puts far too onerous a burden, either on the prosecuting authority in a criminal case, or on the Criminal Assets Bureau in these civil proceedings. If the rule is being relaxed both parties to the procedure still have to be protected by ensuring there is residual discretion in the interests of justice.</P>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate how the courts will construe that issue. However, where some question of irregularity might arise as regards any particular document, and where it did not appear to come out of the ordinary course of business, the court might require the full traditional form of proof.</P>
      <P>As regards the corrupt enrichment order, Senator Tuffy raised the question of the communities affected by unjust planning decisions. Of course, the Minister for Finance is the personification of the State for the purpose of recouping the ill-gotten gains that have resulted from the corrupt inducement or activity. Clearly, when corruption takes place, that is not in the public good or interest and can have an effect on communities. The only way to compel the wrong doer to disgorge the wrongful benefit which he or she has acquired from corrupt conduct, is to compel him or her to disgorge it back to the community. That is done through the medium of the Minister for Finance in this legislation.</P><Col N="1515"/>
      <P>We could embark on an argument similar to the argument we had on the Criminal Assets Bureau as to whether these moneys would be better committed to specified worthy social purposes on a ring-fenced basis. I assure the House it is not the intention of the Minister, in introducing this provision, to sanction corruption or to suggest that because a clear unequivocal civil remedy is provided for in the legislation that some countenance is being given to this type of activity. In fact, the motivation for this measure is the very activity that has been exposed in recent years. The awareness that there is a powerful civil remedy is a valuable one, though I agree with Senator Tuffy that it is always desirable that persons who contravene the criminal law should also meet their desserts before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am mindful in section 16B of the proposed new section which deals with the corrupt enrichment order, because we debated this matter at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Right. I advocated that the evidential barrier to criminal activity may well be too high and should probably be reviewed when one sees criminals who are known to the community and the Garda walking the streets and because it is not possible to get sufficient evidence to obtain a prosecution they appear to operate with impunity. I note that the evidential barrier is changed in this section.</P>
      <P>Are the nine subsections in section 16B standalone subsections? Subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) states: &ldquo;[Where] the defendant is in a position to benefit others in the exercise of his or her official functions, ... it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that the defendant has engaged in corrupt conduct.&rdquo; That significantly shifts the burden of proof in this scenario. As a stand-alone statement it appears stark but, perhaps, it is contingent on the processing of a whole range of other issues to arrive at that conclusion. If one deals with the subsection on its own it raises questions. I was mindful of this at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights and that we should proceed on that basis when dealing with serious crime. In this instance, perhaps because of some of the activities at the tribunals, the Department and others are mindful of this as money generally can be tracked through the banks and other ways. Therefore, it should be possible to prosecute without going that far. I raise the question in order to hear the view of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision contained in subsection (3) represents a legislative device to which we often have recourse in legislation where we seek to vary the incidence of proof in accordance with the means of knowledge of the parties to a particular proceeding. It is found in some criminal statutes, mainly statutes relating to summary criminal matters, for example, where the possession of a licence is essential to the com<Col N="1516"/>mission of a lawful activity and the burden of proving the existence of the licence is cast upon the accused person rather than on the prosecuting authority.</P>
      <P>In the context of civil proceedings, as these would be envisaged under the legislation, it is open to the Oireachtas to provide for it, as we have done in carefully guarded terms, because the defendant must be in a position to benefit others in the exercise of his or her official functions and another person must have benefited from the exercise. Not alone must one have the official but one must have also the person who has benefited. The third element is that the defendant in this statutory <i>in personam</i> action does not account satisfactorily for his or her property or for the resources, income or sources of income from which it was acquired. That third element has to be established and then, and only then, it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown. It is still open to the defendant to prove the contrary, that the defendant has engaged in corrupt conduct.</P>
      <P>We are laying down a rule about when a court can draw an inference about corrupt conduct and no more than that. That technique is available in criminal statutes but it has to be worded with great care and indicating the precise circumstance which allow us to draw the inference. It has been done in criminal legislation. The courts have been empowered to draw inferences from various matters, for example, in relation to the presence of forensic signs on bodies and so on. Such legislation is in existence and we have simply applied that general principle in specific terms to this particular context to allow the court draw an inference of corruption, which ultimately is an essential inference in the commission of this statutory tort.</P>

In any event the Criminal Assets Bureau can pursue the proceeds of all types of crime. It may not be necessary to extend the functions of the Criminal Assets Bureau as proposed.

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to appear here today to address Members of the House on the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. I would like to start by once again reiterating the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the full implementation of the programme. Since I last appeared here on 2 June this year, a number of key developments have occurred. The second report of the decentralisation implementation group was published at the end of July. In this report the group stated it would report to the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation in the autumn outlining its views on sequencing and timing. It indicated that the <Col N="1518"/>selection of organisations and locations for inclusion in the first phase of moves would have particular regard to the figures emerging from the Central Applications Facility and relevant property and business issues. A report containing full details of priority applications to the Central Applications Facility up to 7 September 2004 was duly published. The names of the Departments and organisations selected to move in the first phase of the programme were announced in the implementation group&rsquo;s report published on 24 November 2004. A further report from the group on the procurement and financial issues relating to property was published on 24 November 2004.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Both reports published last week were first submitted to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, by the decentralisation implementation group, chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn. The reports were published following the Government&rsquo;s approval of all the recommendations contained therein. The first report dealt with the selection of organisations or locations for inclusion in the first phase of moves. The report lists 15 Departments and offices which should be the first to relocate outside of Dublin. This involves 21 projects, 20 locations and the transfer of eight headquarters. Contrary to some media reports, the programme is being phased in as opposed to phased out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention is that this group of organisations will receive initial priority attention in terms of staff transfers and property procurement while still ensuring progress for all the remaining organisations. The headquarters of the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Arts, Sport and Tourism, Defence, Education and Science, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Agriculture and Food, together with the Office of Public Works, are included in this initial phase. Approximately 3,500 Civil Service posts are earmarked to move in this first element in the decentralisation programme. A wide range of Departments and offices are included. Some locations will have more than one Department relocate there. For example, Drogheda is included twice as both the Departments of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Social and Family Affairs have been approved for the first phase, while some Departments and offices have a number of locations included in the list. For example, the Revenue Commissioners will transfer to Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastle West.</P>
      <P>In selecting these Departments and offices, I understand that the group paid particular attention to the figures which emerged from the CAF following the cut-off date for receipt of priority applications on 7 September 2004. It reviewed the overall number of people interested in moving to these locations and the extent to which the jobs available in particular grades at each location are <Col N="1519"/>matched by the applications for these grades, particularly in the case of the senior grades. The selection also had regard to other factors. Locations where the purchase of a site is well advanced or can be advanced quickly, and-or where it seems that a building can be procured quickly, were reviewed and the business-related issues that arose in the relevant individual implementation plans were considered.</P>
      <P>Both the group and the Government are conscious of the challenges that need to be addressed as the implementation process moves forward. These include issues relating to the transfer of departmental headquarters, continued provision of customer services, effective cross-organisation collaboration and the particular challenges to be faced in dealing with professional and technical staff. The best way to overcome these challenges is to select a mix of organisations which is sufficiently representative in terms of the issues that need to be tackled and to have an appropriate geographical distribution.</P>
      <P>At this point I would like to deal with the point raised by some commentators that, with the publication and Government approval of the first phase locations, the remaining locations and organisations have been sidelined or abandoned. Again I would like to stress that this is not the case. In its report, the implementation group points out that it will report again in spring 2005. On that occasion, the group will deal with the organisations and locations not covered in its report of 24 November 2004. To date, the implementation group has demonstrated an excellent track record in delivering reports on time and I have no doubt this trend will continue.</P>
      <P>The Public Appointments Service, formerly the Civil Service Commission, which operates the CAF, has recently notified personnel officers of the names of those in their organisations who wish to decentralise with them. This allows personnel officers to start planning and making appropriate internal reassignments to facilitate the relocation process. Management across the public service will also receive details of those members of their staff who wish to leave the organisation to move to another location under the terms of the programme. Again this information will facilitate medium-term planning in all of the Civil Service and public service organisations involved.</P>
      <P>The next step in the process involves immediate planning for interdepartmental transfers following appropriate consultation with public service management and unions. The organisations listed in the first phase need to receive priority in managing and making the necessary interdepartmental transfers, although these will inevitably affect all Departments to some degree. I have concentrated thus far on the issues relating to those who wish to relocate. Both I and my colleagues are aware that this group represents only part of the picture. There is another group of public servants who for various reasons wish to <Col N="1520"/>continue working in Dublin. From the outset, the Government has stressed the voluntary nature of this programme and the fact that the staff who do not wish to relocate will be offered an alternative public service post in Dublin. We will continue to be conscious of the needs of this group as we move on with the implementation of the programme.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for managing interdepartmental transfers will also address the position of those staff who want to remain in Dublin but who will be required to transfer to other organisations because there will no longer be posts available for them in their existing organisation. The selection of those to transfer will initially be done on the basis of volunteers. If there are insufficient volunteers, the &ldquo;last in, first out&rdquo; principle will apply. The aim will be to ensure that, in so far as is possible, only one move between Departments will take place. Vacancies will arise in Dublin posts as individuals wishing to decentralise move to new organisations. The arrangements will aim to allow those moving to another Department in Dublin to indicate preferences on where they would wish to transfer, although it must be recognised that it will not always be possible to meet those wishes. As the implementation group suggests in its report, the approval by Government and release of the list of &ldquo;first mover&rdquo; organisations, and the issues arising in regard to managing these moves, should provide a structure for discussions between Civil Service management and unions about a range of issues relating to mobility, recruitment and promotion.</P>
      <P>The OPW has provided a schedule of indicative timescales for all the locations listed in the report. It has listed the indicative construction start and completion dates for each location. Allowing for completion of the procurement and planning processes, it can be seen that eight buildings would be completed in 2006, a further nine in 2007 and the remaining four in 2008. I should emphasise that the timelines provided by the OPW are indicative but also add that the indicative construction completion dates are the guide for not just the completion of the construction of a shell of a building, but of a completed, fitted out building ready for occupation.</P>
      <P>All of the participating organisations prepared implementation plans earlier this year. Since then additional information has been made available by the CAF regarding staff numbers by my office regarding property issues. In addition, all organisations now know whether or not they are included in the first phase of moves. Based on this, the implementation group has quite reasonably asked that all organisations produce further more detailed versions of their plans. This will be an invaluable step in the planning process.</P>
      <P>It has been acknowledged over the past number of months that the CAF figures for the State agencies are not as good as those for the Civil Service. A number of factors may have contributed to this, for example, there is an under<Col N="1521"/>standing and experience within the Civil Service of decentralisation and of interdepartmental transfer. This does not exist within the State agencies, where there is little tradition of interagency transfers.</P>
      <P>The implementation group has suggested that the particular nature of the employment relationship to which I have referred can be addressed by the adoption of a more individualised approach to implementation in State agencies.</P>
      <P>On this basis the group identifies seven agencies or locations, involving more than 700 jobs, which should receive initial priority attention. The seven include the transfer of F&Aacute;S to Birr, Bord Iascaigh Mhara to Clonakilty, Comhairle to Drogheda, Sustainable Energy Ireland to Dundalk, the National Safety Council to Loughrea, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to Portarlington, and the Health and Safety Authority to Thomastown in County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The second report dealt with the financial implications of the office accommodation aspects of the programme and the procurement methodology. The key findings are as follows: In the years 2006-10 there is an increasingly negative cumulative cashflow as the site acquisition, construction and lease exit costs exceed the proceeds from the disposal of surplus owned property in Dublin and the rental savings; thereafter, the rental savings act to reduce, and eventually eliminate, the negative cumulative cashflow to the State; from 2026 onwards the cumulative discounted cashflow becomes positive; and at the end of that period, the State owns all the buildings in the decentralised locations and the annual rental savings would continue to accrue. The capital costs of procuring office accommodation in the decentralised locations will be dealt with when the Minister for Finance announces the revised multi-annual capital investment envelopes on budget day.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has been given primary responsibility for delivering the property aspects of the decentralisation programme and I confirm that considerable progress has been made in this regard. The tasks facing OPW include the following: the sourcing of property solutions at the various locations concerned which mainly involves the acquisition of development sites; the procurement of accommodation solutions to the office and facility requirements of the Departments and agencies involved; the rationalisation and consolidation of the use of Dublin office space, both owned and leased, following decentralisation; and the management of the disposal of surplus Dublin office accommodation.</P>
      <P>In late December 2003, the OPW placed advertisements in the national press seeking expressions of interest from those willing to provide suitable good quality modern offices, either existing or under construction, and suitable sites with planning permission or appropriate planning zoning which would facilitate the construction of new office buildings.</P><Col N="1522"/>
      <P>Following the requests for property proposals, the Office of Public Works received in excess of 700 proposed property solutions regarding the decentralisation programme scheduled for the various locations around the country. Detailed evaluation of these proposals has been undertaken and, as already stated, the Office of Public Works has made significant progress in sourcing possible sites at the locations concerned.</P>
      <P>The evaluation process involves the following three-strand approach: An architectural assessment by OPW architects; a valuation process undertaken by both OPW and private sector valuers; and an assessment by reference to the business needs and staff requirements of each decentralising Department or agencies.</P>
      <P>To date, nine property solutions have been agreed in principle and a further 20 plus are at an advanced stage in the acquisition process. I also confirm that the balance of the sites for the remaining locations in the programme are being proactively pursued by the OPW. The locations where solutions have been identified are Carlow, Longford, Newcastle West, Athlone, the Curragh, Sligo, Dundalk, Furbo and Donegal. Regarding Carlow, Longford and Newcastle West, the Chief State Solicitor is currently processing contract documents in respect of sites, and it is expected that the associated acquisition phase will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>State-owned land will accommodate the decentralised buildings scheduled for Athlone, the Curragh, and Sligo, while the proposed location of the Dundalk building will be on land at the Dundalk Institute of Technology. It is proposed to locate the staff relocating to Furbo in an extension to an existing building.</P>
      <P>A broad range of factors will influence the cost of acquiring sites, including, proximity of the site to commercial, leisure and educational facilities; proximity to public transport; access to and from a good quality road network; zoning for development; and the prevailing property market conditions in each geographical area.</P>
      <P>Regarding the programme procurement methodology the group suggested, in its report dated 31 March 2004, the adoption of a public private partnership approach in procuring office accommodation in the decentralised locations, with a preference for a design, build, maintain and finance approach.</P>
      <P>In this regard the OPW has since been advised by the National Development Finance Agency that potential PPP projects need to exceed a certain minimum value in order to generate an economically viable proposition for private sector investment. Relatively few single construction projects within the decentralisation programme would exceed this minimum value. The group has considered the scope for bundling several projects together and offering them <i>en bloc</i> to the market. However, the OPW advice is that this approach would give rise to serious practical difficulties in managing the projects and should not be adopted. Ultimately, the suitability of the <Col N="1523"/>DBMF approach will have to be determined by testing the market for a number of the larger projects.</P>
      <P>In the case of smaller projects and in light of the advice received, the OPW now recommends that a design and build approach be pursued in most cases. This approach should help to advance projects to tender stage at a faster pace because the contract documentation would not be as complex as for DBMF. At the same time, it would allow the OPW to test whether the use of warranty provisions for particular components of the building provides a possible alternative to a comprehensive maintenance contract.</P>
      <P>There may be other locations where the DB tender approach would not be suitable, for example, where an existing building is being acquired, where the OPW can enter into a satisfactory agreement with a developer or where the project is so small that it would not attract sufficient private sector interest. In such cases, a fit-out or traditional procurement will be required.</P>
      <P>In general, a twin-track approach of DBMF and DB will be adopted for the procurement of office accommodation. For those locations, which involve accommodation for at least 300 staff, it is intended that the DBMF approach will continue to be pursued subject to it demonstrating value for money relative to the public service benchmark in each case. In line with the implementation group&rsquo;s recommendation, the OPW has developed, with the assistance of the NDFA, a generic public service benchmark. This is a comprehensive risk-adjusted costing of the project, over its whole life, using conventional procurement. It provides a comparator against which to measure the value for money of the public private partnership. For the remaining locations, a design and build approach will be adopted.</P>
      <P>This parallel approach should give the market an opportunity to demonstrate that it can provide the required office accommodation on a value for money basis but, at the same time, provide assurance about early progress on implementation of the programme; and allow each approach to be compared with, and evaluated relative to, the other. This overall strategy will be reviewed in light of experience with the market during the first phase of implementation of the programme.</P>
      <P>Regarding property disposal, a desire to hold on to large amounts of owned property in Dublin for reasons other than its monetary value to the State would have a negative impact on the programme&rsquo;s financial framework. In addition, the estimated Dublin rental savings are sensitive to securing a match over a reasonable period between Departments occupying regional property and vacating Dublin property. The relocation of Dublin staff to the new offices will take place on a phased basis in most cases, even where there is a full complement of new staff ready to decentralise.</P>
      <P>It is important that the overall property procurement and disposal process be managed in an <Col N="1524"/>integrated way. The OPW will be a decentralisation champion to ensure compliance by Departments with, among other things, the release of space to allow the OPW to take advantage of critical lease disposal dates; agreement as required to interim moves to other buildings in Dublin to ensure efficient property utilisation and to capitalise on market opportunities to sell buildings; and acceptance of building sharing as necessary to allow property disposals, both for staff decentralising and those staying in Dublin.</P>
      <P>From a purely property management point of view with regard to the reduction of leased Dublin offices, the longer the OPW has to dispose of its leased space the lower the lease-exit costs would be.</P>
      <P>These costs would also be reduced if, and to the extent that, the sequencing of moves could be driven by lease disposal and rationalisation opportunities. However, in reality, implementation of the programme cannot be driven entirely by property considerations as people and service delivery issues will also be taken fully into account.</P>
      <P>The minimisation of lease exit costs will be actively managed by the OPW. It is also likely that greater value would be obtained if more owned property was sold and less forced disposal of leased property took place within a short timescale. This may require Departments the headquarters of which are not being decentralised to change accommodation. It should also be possible to sublet even relatively unattractive properties if they are offered to the market at sufficiently competitive prices.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the delivery of the property element of the decentralisation programme amounts to a major challenge for the OPW and will require a concentrated effort from all areas of the OPW in the months and years ahead. I am confident this effort will be forthcoming and that progress to date, which has been significant, will be maintained. In conclusion, I am satisfied the decentralisation programme will be delivered.</P>

	<P>I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, is present for this debate. The Minister of State came to the House almost one year ago, following the last budget on 3 December 2004, when the main topic of discussion was the decentralisation issue. This was mainly because there was little else in the budget until the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, pulled a rabbit from the hat and made his major commitment to different urban centres throughout the country. What was plain at the time to anyone who cared to examine the facts was that what was <Col N="1525"/>promised on budget day could not be delivered. The promises were made for political reasons.</P>
      <P>It was difficult to listen to much of the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. I have rarely heard as much waffle in my time as a Member of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>No commitment to anything is contained in the Minister&rsquo;s remarks. He wandered onto many topics that had little or nothing to do with decentralisation but failed to refer to the commitments given in this Chamber on 3 December last by himself and other Government Members. However, we have come to expect nothing else from the Government.</P>
      <P>Some 12 months later, it is easy to comment on remarks made by Members in the budget debate last year. Nonetheless, it is interesting and humorous to look back at what other Members had to say last year in regard to the workings of decentralisation. Senator Mansergh stated that one of the reasons he was pleased with the budget was because the Minister was up-front about decentralisation. He stated: &ldquo;I am sure Members from all sides are pleased that the decentralisation programme will benefit 53 locations within the extended timeframe.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear this will not happen. The Senator should tell this to the people he represents in Tipperary town, which was promised 200 jobs within three years but will not get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It has already got them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not get the 200 jobs promised on budget day 12 months ago, despite the comments made at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator for or against decentralisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mansergh went on to state: &ldquo;Not only does today&rsquo;s announcement represent a fulfilment of many promises that were made, but it also dispels some of the fears expressed when the national spatial strategy was published.&rdquo; This is rubbish. The national spatial strategy has been cast aside by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it has not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been completely cast aside. The recent announcement with regard to decentralisation further proves this.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney got hot under the collar in last year&rsquo;s debate on decentralisation when he emphatically stated: &ldquo;It will be implemented within the timeframe.&rdquo; We all know this is a joke and that Senator Mooney was completely wrong. <Col N="1526"/>Anyone who considered the figures in last year&rsquo;s budget and noted the &euro;20 million granted under the heading of promoting decentralisation would know that it could not have been developed within the 12 months since the last budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is waffling now. Nobody said it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was stated by every Government Member and the Minister of State himself said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Senator to continue without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State said it. I am glad Senator Leyden is present. To be fair, he often provides light entertainment in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator. I will have some light entertainment for him in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a good sense of humour in County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important somebody would fulfil that function in the Seanad. In the debate last year, Senator Leyden stated he was delighted Roscommon town had received the 230 Land Registry jobs it has clearly not received. He went on to state: &ldquo;It is a great boost to myself.....every cumann member throughout County Roscommon and all the supporters of Fianna F&aacute;il.&rdquo; The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will be interested to hear of this boost for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. Senator Leyden continued:</P>
      <P LI="1">No Government in the history of the State has decentralised 10,500 jobs to the regions. [The Government has not done so either.] This will be implemented within three years. In the lifetime of the Government, all this work will be completed and the staff will be in place.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is rubbish. The best example of how Senator Leyden, in particular, was wrong on this issue is his statement: &ldquo;This development....will help us as we face into the local elections. In Roscommon we have five good candidates and we intend to get four out of the five seats.&rdquo; Fianna F&aacute;il did not get four out of five seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We got 54% of the vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The party did not get four out of five seats. The Senator continued:</P>
      <P LI="1">Due to the decentralisation of 230 jobs to Roscommon, the people will respond and vote for Fianna F&aacute;il in the local elections. We will also get two MEPs elected to Europe in the Connacht-Ulster constituency.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Progressive Democrats are not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1527"/>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not know his facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>As we know from what happened in June last, the people were not conned by the promises made by Senator Leyden and others in the run-up to the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We got 54% of the votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Senator to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>They will not be conned in the run-up to the next general election either. I must contact the local media in Roscommon to highlight Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments in the run-up to the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should watch his own patch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>One telling comment from the Minister of State in this debate was the phrase &ldquo;following appropriate consultation.&rdquo; More than anything else, this is where the idea of the decentralisation scheme announced last year has fallen down. There has not been the appropriate prior consultation to which the Minister referred today. He talks about it now but much of the consultation should have taken place immediately before the announcement was made in last December&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden asked where I and Fine Gael stand in regard to decentralisation. For his benefit and that of the House, I restate that I am fully in favour of decentralisation. A number of my party colleagues expressed their particular personal views&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Richard Bruton, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as did members of Senator Leyden&rsquo;s party who represent Dublin constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We are united.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not take that route. The Senator&rsquo;s party is certainly not united. Members of my party hold different views from my own but the party policy is clear &mdash; we fully support decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator sure? That is a change in policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we were fully aware last year that what was promised on budget day could not be delivered and it has not been delivered.</P>
      <P>I was today provided with a list of the towns that have been cast adrift and will not be included with the early movers. The Minister read into the record many waffly terms that mean nothing to <Col N="1528"/>anybody and certainly not to the people of New Ross, County Wexford, my local town, although I live six miles from there in County Kilkenny. In many respects, New Ross is a town that has not experienced the benefits of the Celtic tiger in the past ten years yet the 130 jobs promised for that town will not be delivered, no more than the jobs promised for Kilkenny city, Waterford city, Dungarvan and elsewhere will be delivered.</P>
      <P>The major argument Fine Gael has with the latest announcement on decentralisation is that it is clearly driven by Ministers. I applaud the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. He got into hot water last year in regard to his posters and leaflets, which were obviously printed before the budget was announced to state that decentralised jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a total lie. It is an untruth. I ask the Senator to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will have his opportunity to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the remark was incorrect, I withdraw it. The perception among the general public was that the posters and leaflets were printed before the announcement was made in the budget.</P>
      <P>I applaud the Minister of State and the Minister. They have clearly ensured that the Laoighis-Offaly constituency will be looked after. However, it is obvious from the latest news on decentralisation that the proposals as they currently stand are driven by Ministers.</P>
      <P>Taking Munster as a region, only Kerry and Limerick are in the early movers category. That is clearly because the Ministers who, as Deputies, represent those constituencies are looking after their own back yards. It is not appropriate, fair or right that Tipperary town, regarded as the poorest town in the country, which Senator Mansergh represents and to which he lives adjacent, will not be looked after under decentralisation because it does not have a Minister representing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Not yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been looked after, to the tune of 20 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Other towns, less fortunate than those in Kerry and Limerick, will not be looked after either.</P>
      <P>The other issue that has arisen since the recent announcement on decentralisation is that for 11 of the 14 towns announced, the jobs to be decentralised there are already decentralised. The civil servants involved are already working outside Dublin and will simply be moved a little further. That will not create any extra decentralisation from Dublin city, which is what we were all supportive of, myself included, when decentralisation was announced.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1529"/>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s party was not supportive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>My party and I were supportive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party never supported decentralisation. The Senator&rsquo;s time is up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am watching politics for a long time because I was interested when I was very young and I have never seen a bigger con job pulled on the people than the announcement of decentralisation in the last budget. As I said in my opening remarks, there was nothing in last year&rsquo;s budget, but the Minister brought up decentralisation in order to cover the absence of anything else. Now, the big announcement from last year&rsquo;s budget, namely, decentralisation, has been grounded. The ship has been holed beneath the water line, so to speak. Contrary to what Senators Mansergh and Leyden or anyone may say about it, what was promised in this Chamber last year will not be delivered. Those who promised it knew at the time that it could not be delivered. No matter what Senator Leyden says to me or my party about our stance on decentralisation, it has not changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will prove it has. I have the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad we have had this debate on decentralisation because it is an issue which will excite many people in towns throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Phelan for sharing his time with me. I called for a debate on decentralisation a little over a year ago, and I come from an area which welcomed any kind of decentralisation. I come from Boyle, which was promised decentralisation. We were told not to ask the hard questions and were promised that everything would be fine. Despite a town site for decentralisation being offered for nothing, Boyle was let down because there was no Minister in that constituency. I contended all along that if a Minister lived in a particular constituency he or she would deliver decentralisation there no matter what criteria were set down. This has happened once again and it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>What Minister has Carrick-on-Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Decentralisation could and should have been a major force for change. I welcome any decentralisation to Carrick-on-Shannon. However, three times the number of jobs being delivered were promised to my constituency. The Minister of State has not delivered on his promise.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1530"/>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Decentralisation could have been a force for change. Following the message from last week&rsquo;s report on the issue, decentralisation is an utter shambles. It is all confusion and a clear deception. That fact cannot be escaped. The Minister of State announced that 10,000 people would decentralise within three years. The figures will not even come close to that. There are firm commitments from 2,000 civil servants despite the promise. I welcome the 2,000, but in politics we have a moral duty to tell the people the truth. Last December the people were hoodwinked. The only difference between this Government and that great highwayman Dick Turpin is that the latter wore a mask. The Government has deceived the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>The people are angry at the contempt the Government has shown for towns and for the entire country. The Minister of State promised 230 jobs to Roscommon. My colleagues and I welcomed those jobs but they will not happen in the lifetime of this Government. They are put back to 2011 and 2012. I do not know. Fine Gael will have to get into power to deliver real jobs for County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael cancelled them again as it did before. I have all the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should instantly sack whatever Sir Humphrey wrote the speech he delivered today. It states: &ldquo;With this parallel approach, the OPW will be a decentralisation champion.&rdquo; There are no champions emerging from this decentralisation report, only chumps. The people are annoyed. I am annoyed because I took the report as a commitment last December. Fool as I am in opposition, I took it that this Government meant to deliver 10,000 jobs. It did not. The Minister of State said the plan was ill thought out by that great former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who was extradited to Europe.</P>
      <P>This Government is divided on decentralisation and can do nothing to whitewash the situation or put a gloss on it. The people have been deceived; we have been deceived. These are not the political messages I want to send to constituents. Senator Leyden and the Minister of State know that, as do I. It is a shame that this Government should carry on a deception like this. It will go down in history as one of the greatest deceptions of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that the remainder of this debate will be at a slightly higher level than it has been. I welcome the Minister of State, the progress being made and the fact that decentralisation is on the road. Obviously we must start somewhere. If one adds in the 700 jobs mentioned as priorities to the 3,600 jobs already noted, one is talking of more than 4,000 jobs. That represents a good start within a year of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is deception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I notice that despite what has been said, the majority of the headquarters &mdash; one of the issues in the debate &mdash; are in the first phase. The Department of Agriculture and Food headquarters will move to Portlaoise, those of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to Killarney, and those of the Department of Defence to Newbridge.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has proved over the past year that the OPW, for which he has responsibility, will be the decentralisation champion. Trim is a wonderful town in many ways and the OPW is lucky to be moving there. The headquarters of the Department of Social and Family Affairs will move to Drogheda and those of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will move to Wexford. Even some of the more far-flung locations, about which people might feel sceptical, such as Kilrush, Listowel, Clonakilty, Newcastle West and Sligo, are also included. That is a fair cross-section sample of the programme.</P>
      <P>The announcement made last week states in paragraph 1(3):</P>
      <P LI="1">We will report to you again in the spring of 2005 about progress in relation to implementation of the programme. We will also deal in that report with the locations and organisations not covered in this report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>In order for decentralisation to be put into effect, partnership consultation is very important. This is a social partnership Government, as its predecessors have been. Assurances are required. There is, particularly in the Civil Service, a very good level of volunteers for a lot of the locations.</P>
      <P>I would like to turn to Tipperary since it was mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a long way to Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1532"/>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>If I have one criticism of the Minister and the list he published, it is that he ignored the Private Security Authority which was opened by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 28 October last. Incidentally, in his speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not part of the decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was something extra which is splendid. People in Tipperary are delighted to see the old Garda barracks, the Department of Agriculture and Food offices and former Royal Irish Constabulary barracks refurbished to a high standard to accommodate the new Private Security Authority. Advertisements have been placed for a chief executive who is likely to be recruited in January. A Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform official is working there two days per week. I am glad the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is driving decentralisation to Tipperary as I would be very concerned if he was not. He said this was the first of a number of moves to County Tipperary by agencies from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform family.</P>
      <P>This may be a presentational problem but there was a reference to Thurles in the Flynn report. It was not included in the list but there was a paragraph about it. It is a kind of hybrid decentralisation. It stated that a total of 200 people from Garda headquarters are due to relocate to Thurles and this includes approximately 115 Civil Service jobs, so one is talking about garda&iacute; and civil servants. It stated that the Central Applications Facility data indicate there is a high level of interest in Thurles among civil servants. It recommended that the Garda Commissioner prepare a joint implementation plan with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform dealing with the overall move and that the plan should be submitted by 14 February 2005 and should include an implementation time with a phased time lapse. That reinforces the point made that the Minister and the Department are driving this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>More waffle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The notion that nothing is happening in Tipperary could not be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of Roscrea. Senators opposite may remember that we recently passed the Garda Ombudsman Bill which provides for a Garda Ombudsman&rsquo;s office. I suppose, strictly speaking and if one is being pedantic about it, it is not decentralisation because a new office is being established. One could say the same of the Private Security Authority. However, part of the decentralisation policy announced last year was that when new agencies were being established, they would be established, by preference, outside the capital which is happening. I have spoken to <Col N="1533"/>the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to the officials driving the decentralisation programme in the Department and I am very confident that all the decentralisation plans announced under that Department will happen.</P>
      <P>Another fallacy in interpretation is the notion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Tipperary is going to win the All-Ireland as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I spent 20 minutes on the radio this morning and I think people were very happy when I finished.</P>
      <P>It is a fallacy to think that only those moves mentioned in the announcement will happen by 2008 and that everything else will happen afterwards. Ministers and Departments are driving the process forward and if I know the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and his Department, they will drive it forward. It has nothing to do with whether there is a Minister in south Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has shown his good faith in the programme by opening this Private Security Authority in Tipperary town at the end of October.</P>
      <P>In the Budget Statement, there is no mention of a three-year timeframe. That was said outside the D&aacute;il, not in it. Clearly, that was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>A lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;somewhat over-optimistic. Given the amount of work done and progress made, I would not use that to condemn the programme as a shambles or anything of the kind. Once people can see that the programme is going to roll, it will encourage further interest among those who may have been hanging back to see if it was really going to happen.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Leyden, referred to the record of the parties opposite on decentralisation. I was involved in the Leader&rsquo;s office 20 years ago and remember a decentralisation programme was announced in 1981 but it was promptly cancelled when Fine Gael and the Labour Party came into office. The same happened in 1982. It was part of The Way Forward but it was promptly cancelled. It was only when Ray MacSharry returned as Minister for Finance in the late 1980s&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was promised again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Decentralisation was introduced then as a cost saving measure &mdash; as an economy &mdash; because costs were less down the country.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with this nonsense about the national spatial strategy and decentralisation. I have said before, but it clearly needs to be repeated, that this was a very clear commitment given. It is a promise being delivered from the last <Col N="1534"/>election. The Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto stated that it would complete and implement the national spatial strategy aimed at building up the strength of all regions. It further stated that it would continue its commitment to the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies and that it recognised the particular importance of this programme to well-placed and substantial towns that do not have a lot of industrial employment.</P>

	<P>I do not think it was Fine Gael policy that decentralisation should only have gone to places which were hubs and gateways.

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that Tipperary was not a hub or a gateway. The Buchanan report recommended concentrating all development in a few large centres but people both inside and outside this House need to be reminded that this country is a democracy.

	<P>The national spatial strategy mentioned decentralisation once and only in passing. It was primarily about the private sector activity &mdash; industry, services and infrastructure &mdash; which was needed. Decentralisation is complementary to the national spatial strategy. In any case, if one thinks about it, not all activity is concentrated in gateways and hubs with no activity elsewhere. A hub means that things go on around it and a gateway means that things pass through it and do not get stuck under the gateway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Nearly all the hubs and gateways have experienced decentralisation from previous programmes.</P>
      <P>If one considers the entire decentralisation programme, including past actions and the present scheme, it constitutes a well-balanced programme. I am aware of the significant difference that an announcement of decentralisation and the prospect of its implementation has made <Col N="1535"/>to Tipperary town. A number of major investments have been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is my fourth time to participate in a debate on this issue. These debates included one in this House and three at committee level. Senator Mansergh has no right to criticise Senator John Paul Phelan and others for the low level of debate. I sat through the previous debate in this House and appealed to Members on both sides to take a rational, constructive and philosophical view on our approach to this matter. I have been consistently supportive of decentralisation. I also listened to Senator Leyden speak during the previous debate. Senator John Paul Phelan would not be doing his duty as a public representative if he did not analyse that speech and tear it to pieces. That is what it deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is what brought the issue to a new low. If we are lucky enough to get something for our constituencies, it occasions a speech at constituency level. When the issue is discussed in this House, we should at least make an attempt to address it from a national perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I did both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true. I have no criticism of the broad view Senator Mansergh took on the issue. That is the way to proceed, by looking at both the local and national aspects.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1536"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the public is entirely confused about the matter.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I am somewhat in agreement with the Government&rsquo;s position. I do not understand Fine Gael&rsquo;s position on this issue. There is only one position on decentralisation and that is to be completely supportive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The approach I would take if I were an Opposition Member, and which I am tempted to take as an Independent, is to put the Government to the board each month to tell us how many new jobs have been brought forward. The Minister of State knows I raised such a proposal in the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. I will be seeking this information on a monthly basis in an attempt to determine the progress being made. This data should be measured as we go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>One wonders if Senator O&rsquo;Toole received any confirmation that this information would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I pleaded with the Minister of State during the previous debate in this House to admit that the decentralisation programme could not be done in three years. I contended that the timescale, which was unattainable, represented the worst aspect of the scheme and would bring the project into disrepute. This afforded an opportunity for the Government to admit the programme could not be implemented in three years but that it would put its best foot forward and see what could be achieved. I congratulate Mr. Phil Flynn on the work he has done. He and his colleagues have considered the matter carefully and offered a strategy for success. I welcome his proposal, although it does not do enough. I would like to see more of the same.</P>
      <P>We are not looking at this in the same way as the Minister of State may have done in his previous life. It is a question of urban-rural balance. On a philosophical level, I completely support the idea of decentralisation and endorse the notion of more Civil Service and public service jobs around the country. Moreover, I do not have a difficulty with people moving from Clonmel to Killorglin, for example. This creates new jobs in a particular location and the more flexibility that is built into the system the better. However, it is also fair for Senator John Paul Phelan to say that such moves do not constitute decentralisation. Semantically, it is provincialism rather than decentralisation but there is nothing wrong with that. I welcome such movements as a positive change.</P>
      <P>The situation is akin to that of electronic voting. It is a great idea that has been destroyed because people have lost confidence in it. I agree with Senator Mansergh that the announcement of <Col N="1537"/>decentralisation to a town or area brought a great burst of optimism, encouragement, enthusiasm and confidence, and drew additional employment and investment possibilities into the localities. However, we must consider all those towns that were not on the list last week. They have gone up the hill and down again. This is unfair and should not have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Such an eventuality was entirely predictable and people have been left disappointed. I am not speaking of Deputies and Senators but of local community activists, local urban councils, tidy towns committees, tourism committees and development groups. They have been assessing sites and considering whether sufficient accommodation is available for the decentralised facilities. I have visited three of those towns in the past six months, one of which has come through on the final list while the other two have not.</P>
      <P>One can only imagine the effects of having the rug pulled from under people in these localities after waiting so long for decentralisation. This cannot be right. Situations such as these drag all politics down and the strategy becomes merely another political promise. It is fair enough for Senator Mansergh to observe that previous Governments of different complexions have promised a decentralisation strategy but did not deliver. This is a fair political point. It is fair enough for Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to say on this occasion that they are going to deliver. If they succeed in doing so by the next election, they are entitled to say that they presented a policy and achieved it to a verifiable extent.</P>
      <P>However, a year ago, the Government promised to deliver 10,000 decentralised jobs in three years. It does not help the situation to conduct long debates in which the Government claims it did not really promise a three-year timeframe. The Government trumpeted that timeframe to the extent that it was mentioned in every discussion of the issue. I recall exactly the words that were spoken in this House and I know what people understood the Minister of State to mean. His quotes in the last week are correct. We have diagnosed all this before. I put the question to the Minister of State on two occasions whether he would put on the record that the programme could not be achieved in three years. He refused to do so. This is not about weasel words or an attempt to sort people out. The important issue is that we have failed people.</P>
      <P>There was a significant debate in the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the question of State agencies. I told the Minister of State I had been in consultation with the relevant trade union, which indicated what was achievable in that sector. The trade union representatives raised issues that must be apparent to anyone and to Members of all parties. I welcome <Col N="1538"/>what the Minister of State has said today but one wonders why the amended programme had to be handed down by Mr. Flynn. The Minister of State is a bright man and can see these difficulties as clearly as I can. Why did nobody in the Government stand up and admit that it had taken a second look at the programme and realised that a longer timeframe was necessary?</P>
      <P>One does not need to go to the wire in saying that it will take two, three, four years or whatever. I agree with the Minister of State that the timeframe does not matter. If foundations are being laid and other preparations made in a town, its residents will be aware that building may take two years and another two for employees to commence work. They can live on that hope. I would prefer to see a six-year plan implemented. People will believe that plans will actually be realised once they see progress has begun. It is in this area that the trust and confidence has been lost.</P>
      <P>It is also fair to say that this change has given sustenance to what I call the &ldquo;Dublin view&rdquo;, which envisages little outside the Pale. This is the perception that it is untenable to send people as far as Naas, never mind Kilkenny, Listowel, Killarney or Killorglin. The Minister of State is aware there is a strongly held view in Dublin that it is impossible to send people that far. The people who express this view include some who grew up as far from Dublin as I did. A couple of years in Dublin changes their attitude completely. It is important that we make this work. We must point out to many people in Dublin that the quality of life in provincial Ireland is every bit as good as in Dublin, and better in many cases.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Hand in hand with this proposal must go the necessary improvements to meet the infrastructure deficit. Senator MacSharry, who has spoken eloquently on this issue, must be given total confidence in the future prospect of a rail service to Sligo on an hourly basis. We will say we have a train service when we do not have to look at a timetable because we know that the train leaves at 17 minutes past the hour every hour. This must be our objective.</P>
      <P>There will not be a difficulty recruiting staff for provincial locations. In the last decentralisation programme, the number of people who applied to move to Listowel was four times the requirement. It might be argued that some of those applying were based in Limerick. So what? Their moving to Listowel would create jobs in Limerick for others. What is important is that jobs be created in Listowel, Kilrush and Newcastle West. Eighteen months ago, I spoke in the House about a proposal from the urban councils in Listowel, Kilrush and Newcastle West to link the three towns in a development package. The package has worked to the benefit of all three towns. There is no difficulty recruiting people in those towns. There is little difficulty in persuading staff in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to go to Killarney. There has been increasing interest in that location recently. When people <Col N="1539"/>move to smaller towns they will not go back to Dublin.</P>
      <P>I ask politicians to have confidence in decentralisation. I cannot blame the Opposition for having a go on this issue. It has been seriously misled. Important points have been made by Opposition speakers and a political row must take place on this issue. However, once the political points have been made, I ask people to look at the broader issue and at the philosophy of urban-rural balance. We must allow people to experience the quality of life in provincial Ireland.</P>
      <P>This morning we heard of a report from the BMW region which shows that people in Connacht spend approximately one quarter of the time commuting compared with those in Dublin. These are important issues. I recently spoke to someone who had changed jobs and now, instead of spending two and a half hours per day commuting, he spends half an hour. He suddenly finds himself with an additional two hours in every day. He has ten hours, more than a day, per week free. There are things we can offer but other things must be done to make them possible.</P>
      <P>Today on the Order of Business, Senator Kitt brought to the attention of the House the new rail commuter service between Athlone and Galway. Developments such as this are as important as the decentralisation programme. They give a quality to decentralisation. Someone who lives on that railway line can work or go shopping in Galway without having to worry about driving or parking. The same needs to be done on the Sligo to Limerick line. Such developments are all part of decentralisation. Regional airports must also be supported. Instead of making a political row, we should all get behind this movement.</P>
      <P>I ask for complete openness from the Government on the issue. I ask Government to tell us the problems before someone like Mr. Phil Flynn must unearth them and bring them to our attention. Can we not look at the question like reasonably open people with creative minds, see how it can best be done and make it work? Decentralisation is crucial for the future of the country. No public representative in his or her right mind could opt against it.</P>
      <P>My colleagues who represent the Dublin area and who object to decentralisation remind me of the reactive view to traffic bypasses which was prevalent in rural Ireland 15 years ago. Dublin people, in general, are in favour of decentralisation. However, the voluntarism, which the Government now says is part of the programme, must be clearly emphasised. If it had been a central part of the debate from the beginning that no one would be forced to move and that arrangements would be made to ensure that families were not split up, there would have been much less trouble from the representative unions of the workers involved. Anyone could have foreseen these difficulties. The Minister of State and people on both sides of the House must have <Col N="1540"/>foreseen them. If such fears had been dealt with from the beginning we might have proceeded to a debate on the philosophy and the rights and wrongs of what we are trying to do. The Government came up with a good idea and then left the door wide open to ten solid arguments against making it happen. They included the timeframe, the family issue and the question of whether or not people would be forced, whether by whitemail or blackmail, into moving. Objectors lined up to take on the Government. We must make sure that people trust what they hear from politicians.</P>
      <P>Those towns where decentralised Departments or agencies are located will derive a significant bonus, which has not been properly quantified. I ask the Minister of State to examine the spin-offs of decentralisation. New communities will be built. Football teams, drama clubs and local theatres and cinemas will all benefit. Decentralisation involves more than commercial development, selling houses and shopping. It also involves improving the quality of life.</P>
      <P>The Government has utterly mishandled the issue although the Minister of State has played a blinder in the past fortnight. The media have not laid a glove on him. He has come through unscathed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The artful dodger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>He is the artful dodger. He has played a blinder, however he did it. I accept that he did not know about decentralisation before last year&rsquo;s Budget Statement. I believe Senator Phelan was mistaken in what he said. However, the Senator was right to underline what had previously been said in the House. It had to be analysed and proven.</P>
      <P>We must look at the importance of urban-rural balance and of infrastructure. All of Ireland can get its place in the sun. Decentralisation is a good idea and must be properly handled. We must consider the views of the workers&rsquo; representatives and listen to what the unions have to say. We can meet most of their demands. We must look at the family requirements of the people involved in the programme. We can meet those demands. We must recognise that agencies cannot, in the main, be decentralised in the same way as Departments. Taking all of these factors together we must set a timescale which is deliberate and clear and goes beyond three or four years. I would like to see all starting times within the next ten years.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on this question on a previous occasion I said we should hope to have the programme completed in not less than ten years. It could not be done earlier than that. That would be a reasonable objective which people could support. I would support it.</P>

If he does not, Mr. Phil Flynn will tell him the same thing in six months time. Meanwhile, I wish the Minister of State good luck with the media. They cannot lay a hand on him.</P>

	<P>From his experience as president of a major nationwide organisation, he knows the needs of rural Ireland. I know of no better person to assist in this regard. In last year&rsquo;s budget Deputy McCreevy had the commitment and foresight to ensure that Ireland gains an urban-rural balance by announcing details of a major decentralisation programme. This was a monumental and far-reaching decision because for the first time entire Departments and their Ministers were moved outside Dublin. This did not happen in previous decentralisation announcements. Some eight Departments and their staff are to be moved outside Dublin, which gives weight and credibility to the national spatial strategy. The latter strategy was not the only one that had to be followed, however. Towns within the national spatial strategy have been included, as well as those that were not, including Roscommon.</P>

	<P>This is the build up. I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole whose approach has been most constructive. Mr. Phil Flynn was appointed to <Col N="1542"/>oversee the implementation of the programme, not to unearth anything about it. Let us get that right. I would like to have seen the PIAB relocated outside Dublin as well. It would have been a help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

	<P>The Opposition has been trying to destabilise and derail the process of reviving the regions over the past 12 months.

	<P>The Opposition is doing everything it can to oppose it but we will have it.

	<P>He said:</P>
      <P LI="1">The results on the concentration of population and the quality of life, both in over-populated and under-populated areas, are matters on which I and many others agree. We can see the ill effect of both situations. The decentralisation programme would have cost a further £45 million and that was a material consideration which had to be taken into account. It was one of the main factors in cancelling the programme, which led to our decision not to go ahead with the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this very important debate. Apart from the waste of time in the past ten minutes, this is a very important debate. I hope we can concentrate on the main issues at hand. I listened carefully to the speech made by the Minister of State. Unfortunately he has not addressed our major concern, which is the decline in the number of decentralised posts from 10,000 to 3,500 and what will happen to the missing numbers. We now have a decentralisation programme, which has as its target the relocation of no more than 3,500 civil servants. It is time to stop pretending that any more than that number will be relocated.</P>
      <P>I have read the implementation report published last week and the press release issued by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. The Minister in that statement, and the Minister of State today, have been quite clear in what they say. However, let us remember our new starting point. Since last week we now have a decentralisation programme for 3,500 civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Fewer people will be decentralised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>At the most, 3,500 people will be decentralised over a number of years. What was announced last December has gone and no longer exists. To a large extent it never existed in the first place as has now become very clear. This is a severe blow to the towns of Roscrea and Thurles in my area. The Minister of State will be familiar with Roscrea as he lives very close to it. Roscrea has disappeared from the decentralisation map. The Civil Defence project is separate from the decentralisation programme. Having read the speeches of the Minister of State and the <Col N="1550"/>Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the implementation reports, neither Roscrea nor Thurles appear anywhere.</P>
      <P>A reference is made to Thurles, stating that the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have a little chat about the town sometime, somewhere, maybe. However, that is not enough as no target is set for Thurles and it is not mentioned in the programme. Like other counties, Tipperary has simply disappeared from the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation plans. Any attempt to suggest otherwise is not true. It is a case of live horse and eat grass, maybe some day. I am quite clear that it simply will not happen under this Administration, which is a real pity.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I actually believed what the Government announced last December. Many other people also believed this, including the local authorities, which started to plan. Other agencies, chambers of commerce and people in communities throughout the country started to prepare for decentralisation. However, it was never a real plan. How could it be? How could so many people be decentralised in that period of time? As Senator Leyden said, he announced the Roscommon decentralisation shortly before the general election in 1992, which was no coincidence. I remind the Senator that was 12 years ago. However, the much more ambitious programme announced by the then Minister for Finance last year was to happen in a much shorter timeframe. In reality it was never going to happen.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the impact of this change. Decentralisation is very good for towns because more people come to live in a town and decision-making also becomes decentralised. However, decentralisation needs to be planned and carried out in a coherent and integrated fashion. It could not have been done in the way the Government announced last December.</P>
      <P>As I live in a regional town, Nenagh, I know that apart from the economic benefit for a town and a region, real decentralisation would create real promotion prospects within a county. The decentralisation of an entire Department will allow a person starting at a clerical or other lower-grade level to aspire to be promoted within the region or county. The scattered nature of the decentralisation programme gives rise to a particular problem. For example, in many cases those working for the Revenue Commissioners in Nenagh who get promoted effectively must leave. Many such people have told me that they end up commuting to Dublin for years in the hope that they will be transferred back to Nenagh, Limerick or Port Laoise. More decentralised offices throughout the country would offer more career options without the necessity for dreadful commuting.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State a question. He referred to report of the Central Applications Facility, CAF. Why are the Revenue Commissioners not included in the CAF?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1551"/>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>They are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I can speak to the Minister of State separately about the matter. My information is that at least some sections of the Revenue Commissioners are not using the CAF. For some individuals this might be causing a difficulty. Having a central applications facility should mean that either everybody is in or nobody is in. Otherwise two streams are operating and some Departments can be selective about whom they do and do not have. For the sake of fairness to the public servants involved, it is important that all applications go into the one facility.</P>
      <P>I come back to the impact on the wider public in Roscrea and Thurles. From talking to people I know there is not only disappointment and disbelief, as other speakers have said, although we might not have thought it possible, it has engendered even greater cynicism about political decisions and when political announcements are made. There is no doubt that last December&rsquo;s announcement was specifically timed with six months to go to the local elections. The Government side will dispute that but there is objective evidence that was the case. To be that cynical about people&rsquo;s futures and about towns such as Roscrea and Thurles is appalling. We are talking about real people and communities.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State knows that the midlands have not done as well as other parts of the State. While some towns are doing well economically, they do not match the level of growth and expansion in cities and larger towns. There have been many job losses in midland towns in recent years and that has had an impact. Decentralisation would have levelled the playing field and people would have felt that they were getting a share.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation map now, however, concentrates on the area around the Pale within easy commuting distance of Dublin. The Government is doing that because it is easy to deliver in the short-term. It is within commuting distance and it is more likely that civil servants will take it because they can still live in Dublin and commute to Drogheda or Navan. Those areas that are doing well will do better and those areas that need to do better will not, they will not get the leg up that would have meant so much.</P>
      <P>Others have mentioned balanced regional development, which has become a clich&eacute;. I welcome the announcement by Ryanair that it is to invest in Shannon Airport and I hope it works because the region needs a lift. If Shannon Airport develops, there are exciting prospects for tourism and the economy. If it does not work, however, there will be serious consequences. In terms of what the Government can deliver, decentralisation is a powerful tool that could help balanced regional development and this was a missed opportunity.</P>
      <P>Entire areas have been left out and only 3,500 civil servants will now be decentralised. I appeal to the Minister of State to go back to the drawing board. Mr. Phil Flynn has delivered implemen<Col N="1552"/>tation reports that are well thought out and costed &mdash; it was interesting to see how long it will take to make this break even financially. There is a strong case to be made, however, for rolling out a balanced regional programme, even if it is over a longer period, to move beyond the Pale to areas like the Minister of State&rsquo;s own county. Is this the way the programme will continue and will we be completely left out? Is there any prospect of getting back in or will it never happen? What happens now will determine what the next Government will be able to do. There will be a new Government after the next election but what happens now will limit the choices of that next Administration.</P>
      <P>The scenario now is very different. The electorate is even more cynical and towns have been let down. Roscrea and Thurles will not receive any decentralised Department and will suffer the resultant economic impact. Unfortunately, this is yet another broken Government promise, a sorry state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the comprehensive speech he gave. It is a script we should keep because it is very detailed.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, established the decentralisation process a year ago. We always criticise Ministers for not laying out their objectives and working towards them but he set out his stall and tried to achieve his goals. There was nothing wrong with laying out the grand design of where we want to go with decentralisation. I applaud his vision. Too many are willing to run away from what he said. He laid out the plan and said that it showed where we wanted to go. A decentralisation committee was set up under Mr. Phil Flynn, with whom I had regular dealings when I was Minister for Public Enterprise. If there is a way to do something, he will find it.</P>
      <P>The next step was to work backwards towards the realisation of what we hope to do and this is what the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has laid out for us today. We were constructive in setting up the implementation group. The press releases last week were not sufficiently positive, however, this is not the end of decentralisation but the beginning. It should have been presented in a more positive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>With so many spin doctors, it is a surprise that it did not get more positive coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I know about decentralisation. At the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s, when my brother was the Minister for Education, Athlone benefited from the transfer of over 400 Department of Education civil servants. There was no great fanfare, they came and loved the town. They are all settled in now, rearing families who go to local schools and college, they are part of the fabric of Athlone. When I <Col N="1553"/>entered Government in March 1987, Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s father brought to the table the decentralisation proposals that had been put on ice since the previous Government under Dr. Garret FitzGerald. The then Minister for Finance, former Deputy Ray MacSharry, laid out the towns to which Departments would be decentralised and Athlone was included again. I was Minister for Education at the time and a further 240 civil servants came to Athlone. I heard no cribs or people saying they did not want to go to Athlone. They were happy to go there and relished moving to a thriving town on a wonderful river with fine facilities. I am glad Athlone has been included a third time for more civil servants in the Department of Education and Science. It is the educational centre of Ireland. Clonmacnoise, the famed scholastic establishment is eight miles away and we are happy to don the mantle of scholastic achievement and be a centre for education.</P>

	<P>The Government Senators are reminiscing tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am telling the House what happened, there is no reminiscence about it. The Department of Education and Science is there, phase one happened under Brian Lenihan and phase two happened under me. I am not reminiscing, I am telling the truth.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to providing jobs for rural areas. Yesterday, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced 170 jobs in the triangle of Roscommon, Athlone and Longford. It is a small number of jobs but there is huge potential for growth because they are involved in marketing and research and development. I assume Senator Bannon was happy about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will refer to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is something discordant about this debate. From the very beginning, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and the Taoiseach consistently said the scheme would be voluntary. It would be impossible to exert pressure in a matter such as this. It must be voluntary, of necessity. Therefore, one must move ahead with those who have applied. To demand what will happen to a particular town if people have not applied for it is to remove the voluntary aspect. I fully applaud the fact that it should be voluntary and will continue to support that approach. In that way people will want to go to a particular area and make their homes there. I understand that there are people who cannot move for various reasons including family, care of old people, education, etc. That is understood and there is no pressure on such people to move. That would be to move away from the core idea of decentralisation.</P><Col N="1554"/>
      <P>The Minister of State came in for much flak when he said, &ldquo;Welcome to Parlon country&rdquo;. I knew him in another guise, and that is the nature of the man. He is exuberant and outgoing and wanted to express his delight at the announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It was out the night before the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar are the three towns which form the apex of the strategy, where the education jobs are to be located. Athlone is willing to extend its mantle of education to the other two towns and allow them to share in its success. Everyone on the Opposition side is moaning, but I notice in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech how many Departments are being decentralised. The Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Arts, Sport and Tourism, Defence, Education and Science, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Agriculture and Food and the Office of Public Works are all included in the initial phase. I am referring to the headquarters of those Departments. This is important because inherent in Deputy McCreevy&rsquo;s first announcement on that fateful budget day was that headquarters were to be decentralised so that the policy-making units of Departments could be seen to be part of the rural landscape of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why people, knowing that the scheme is voluntary, ask about this town or that. Clearly, people did not want to go to a particular town and, if so, they cannot be forced to go. I realise that Athlone has pushed out the boat and has a record as regards decentralisation and a welcoming approach which was there from the beginning. However, it is advisable for towns to put on their bright clothes, lay out their stalls, show their attractions and what is on offer, in the fullest sense. In response to those who are reluctant to move, I do not know how people live in Dublin all the time. When we Senators do our three our four days work here in the House, I cannot wait to get on the western road home. A newspaper correspondent once asked me what my favourite road in Ireland was and I replied that it was the road home between Dublin and Athlone.</P>
      <P>There is little quality of life if one spends an hour in a car trying to get to Dublin from some outlying suburb. That is a akin to the &ldquo;murder machine&rdquo;, like the education machine of long ago. I left Athlone early this morning and encountered heavy traffic on the M50 and I reflected on having to do this every day of one&rsquo;s life. The roads in rural Ireland are becoming busy, too, but at least one may wake up in the morning and hear the birds singing, if it is spring. One can get to shops and get children to school in comfort and there is no shortage of social activities, clubs, etc. Senator Bannon is nodding appreciatively. Longford is lovely place in which to live.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1555"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my favourite part of Ireland, as well as Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure it is. I notice that the Senator, not wanting to parade up and down the road from Longford to Dublin, has acquired a place in which to lay his head in Dublin. That is good. He does not have to do the long trek from Longford to Dublin all the time. I acquired a place for myself in Dublin many years ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s script is a beauty in that it lays out comprehensively what the Department is doing as regards decentralisation and the way it is going about it. I applaud the work that has been done, with so many departmental headquarters being located around the country. I am referring to the work of Mr. Phil Flynn and the OPW in particular. One cannot speak with a forked tongue. Members of the Opposition cannot say they do not really want decentralisation and then ask, almost in the same breath, what happened this or that town. If they want decentralisation they must work hard towards achieving it. I cannot see why people do not like the idea the people who came to Athlone all those years ago, and latterly, are now true Athlonians, or at least their children are. We have enjoyed each other&rsquo;s mutual company over the years and the initiative has been a great success, as I know this will be too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sharing my time with Senator Ulick Burke. As a native of Newcastle West and someone who has championed the cause of decentralisation long before the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made his announcement in December 2003, I welcome the 50 jobs that are going that town. Originally the model encompassed Newcastle West only, and then Shannon Development said we would possibly be successful with a concentration of 150 jobs, if we looked for 50 jobs each for Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastle West. It is important to understand why the take-up has been so significant in Newcastle West, where 109 people have indicated they would like to go. It is significant that only seven people volunteered from the Dublin location. Many of the people who will decentralise to Newcastle West will come from Limerick city and they are people living in the region already. In many cases, people have been coming to me since the announcement, wondering when it is going to happen.</P>
      <P>One must go back to the original spirit and concept of decentralisation, as advocated by the Minister for Finance of the time, Deputy McCreevy. He spoke about the chaos within Dublin and the possibility of decentralising all these jobs around the country. I believe he was talking in the context of decentralisation out of Dublin. On that occasion, 10,000 jobs were being relocated. It is significant that this was followed with a degree of ecstasy within the Seanad Chamber. When the announcement came there was a debate in this House on 4 December 2003, <Col N="1556"/>and it is significant when one reflects on what happened at the time. Senator Leyden went down memory lane and gave the House a history lesson. He went back 21 years to the time of Deputy Dukes as Minister for Finance and further still to the time of Deputy Garret FitzGerald. I would remind him how wrong he was in asserting that no Government in the history of the State had decentralised 10,500 jobs to the regions and that the strategy would be implemented within three years. I would remind Senator Leyden that not one job will be decentralised by December 2005, as regards what we have been presented with by the Minister of State. That is the reality because it is spelt out in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s recent publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is three years to 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Three years from December 2002 is December 2005. I am sorry. His statement preceded that. This is 4 December 2002. It must be a mistake. Even maintaining that it is 10,500 jobs in 2007, we all know it is not going to happen.</P>
      <P>I am glad a sense of realism is creeping into the debate. It was announced there would be 2,000 jobs in the first phase, 1,320 of which would go to the commuter belt of Dublin. I stayed in Naas one night last week. Having left Naas at 7.30 a.m. it took two hours to get to Leinster House. It was significant that there was a logjam all the way from Naas along the dual carriageway to Dublin and that the traffic flowed freely in the opposite direction. Therefore, I could understand a person from Naas, Newbridge, Portlaoise or Portarlington saying he or she would be far better off to remain in Dublin and commute downwards with the flow of traffic. It is extra chaotic at present owing to the bridge mishap but that will probably be sorted out by the end of December.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Mansergh earlier. All I can say is that in his press release, the Minister announced it was the first carriage. As far as his community and Tipperary town are concerned it appears to have got derailed at Limerick Junction. It is regrettable that the concept of decentralisation works only if there is the cluster model. The reason it has been successful in Ennis, Kilrush and Newcastle West is that there are 800 jobs in Limerick city, Ennis and Nenagh, within the Revenue cluster, and that there is a certain tier of promotion within the system and an opportunity for advancement. That is the reason is works further away. Within those tiers of the Civil Service there would be movement, say, from the Department of Agriculture and Food in Limerick to Revenue in Newcastle West and so on.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the timeframe for semi-State organisations has been pushed out further and to areas such as Birr. I worked in F&Aacute;S head office where it is proposed to decentralise 390 jobs. I ask the Minister of State to be real in regard to that proposal as it will not happen. That <Col N="1557"/>office has already said that six or seven people have applied. I do not know how 390 jobs can be focused down there. At some stage we must accept that decentralisation is not achievable in a particular area but may be achievable elsewhere and, where it is achievable, the Minister of State should proceed with it. We all wish it well because it is good for the whole country.</P>
      <P>What the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, tried to do was over-ambitious. Given that the local elections were taking place in June he considered it would be helpful if he gave enough smarties throughout the country to 53 locations. Senator Leyden said that in Roscommon it was a great political idea and that he would benefit in the local election. In that way he was attributing a political dimension to the process. Politics was involved and the local election was a significant feature in the decisions made.</P>
      <P>If civil servants are being decentralised down the country I suggest the cluster model be used as this would allow for promotional opportunities and there will be some degree of success. Our area is a classic example where all three locations have been selected in the first tier. We look forward to that happening.</P>

This time last year the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made the announcement during the budget that 10,300 civil and public servants would be moved out of Dublin to 53 locations by 2007.

	<P>It happened subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Decentralisation was the Minister&rsquo;s development policy. We know as a result of the announcement a few days ago by the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, there are 29 centres throughout the country that are disappointed. The Minister of State said that since June 2004 we have had a major development initiative on the line. I welcome the fact that Loughrea is included in the list. How can we be assured those 40 jobs will be delivered within the timeframe announced? Other jobs have been promised but it is only the Department jobs that have been mentioned.</P>
      <P>There are three elements of the overall plan that indicate the Government and the Minister of State, in particular, have failed. The decentralisation programme was announced last December without any consultation and that is one of the rocks on which he is perishing. Prior to the announcement there was no consultation. The consultation that has taken place in the meantime clearly indicates it was a matter of asking people if they would go and only one person has indicated an interest in Loughrea. How can the Minister of State continue to pursue an active policy of decentralisation when only one person has indicated an interest? We have been told time and again this evening and also by the Taoiseach that it will not be forced.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on numerous occasions during her visit to Ballinasloe when three major factories were lost, gave an indication that she had prioritised Ballinasloe as a jobs blackspot and that she would deliver jobs. On two occasions since then, the Government has turned its back on Ballinasloe in regard to the spatial strategy. Senator O&rsquo;Rourke said there is a triangle of development between Mullingar, Tullamore and Athlone, yet 14 miles down the road Ballinasloe was left outside the loop that would be appropriate for development. Tonight Ballinasloe has again been omitted. If the Government had decided it was to prioritise any particular area for development and inward investment and was serious about any of those issues, it would have said Ballinasloe was one of those areas that has to be developed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>On what basis did the Minister of State make his decision on the selection of the 20 moves? Some are the headquarters of Government Departments but prioritisation ranks very low in the Minister of State&rsquo;s vocabulary.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke said we moan and groan about towns that have been left out. The people who live in those towns and who expected development and jobs in those areas rightly feel aggrieved. In the next statement she said people did not want to go. They were her words, not mine. There are examples of towns which were <Col N="1559"/>allocated Civil Service and public service jobs but where there was a poor indication of interest. Given that the Minister of State has responsibility for this area, what has he done to consult with those people who may wish to move?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Throughout his contribution the Minister of State referred to OPW and the factors affecting delivery. I have great admiration for the OPW. When it does a job it does it well but when has it delivered a project, a building or otherwise, on time and within budget? There are difficulties with the targets set by the Minister of State. It is not always the fault of the OPW that these delays occur. The OPW did a fantastic job on Farmleigh House. It is an ace in the country and the work carried out is a credit to the OPW. Once more, targets have been set for the OPW, but it cannot be blamed if it does not meet these targets. The Minister of State should be honest and admit there will be a time variation. He should consult with the people whose lives will be affected. This time last year, he welcomed them to Parlon country. Who was he welcoming? Only he knew about the move the night before the budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State first politicised decentralisation. He was in a mad rush, which was political strokery. Anyone who says that Fine Gael is politicising decentralisation is wrong. The Minister of State is the person who did so and he must quickly redress this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am pleased to have an opportunity to make further points and reiterate previous points relating to decentralisation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Flynn report, which gives a clear outline of the properly managed implementation of the decentralisation programme announced last year. It is worth noting that this is phase two of the Fianna F&aacute;il decentralisation programme, or possibly phase three, as the Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, pointed out. This began in the 1960s when her late brother, Brian Lenihan, was responsible for the decentralisation of the Department of Education to Athlone. There was a continuation of this in the late 1990s and now we are onto phase three, which will be implemented on a phased basis over the next number of years, as clearly pointed out in the Flynn report. I am absolutely delighted the programme will proceed over the next number of years, which is the fastest possible time in which it can occur.</P>
      <P>By way of rebuttal, the Minister for Finance did not refer in his budget speech to a three year deadline. Phil Flynn points out in his report that in the past, when various Governments made commitments or stated aspirations to carry out policies, there were no deadlines or targets attached. Scarcely a job exists nowadays which is not performance-related or subject to performing to targets. While various sensational press reports and newspaper articles stated that the prog<Col N="1560"/>ramme would be rolled out in three years, this could not happen. This was not the intention. However, the intention was that it would be well under way but it was important to state a target and seek to perform to that target, otherwise nothing would happen and our party might be criticised. It was a clich&eacute; for many years that if anyone drained the Shannon, X party would do so, but of course it was never drained. Thank God, things have moved on substantially since then. Thanks to the Phil Flynn report and the vision of the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and the Government as a whole &mdash; following on successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Governments and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments &mdash; there has been this type of consistency, and I am pleased we are moving forward.</P>
      <P>I had not anticipated the kind of crossfire evident here earlier. The entire contribution of Senator John Paul Phelan, for whom I have tremendous respect, was substantially about what people said in this House previously and how they were proved incorrect. Perhaps the biggest irony is that the entire decentralisation programme would be complete today if in 1981 and 1982 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, had not cancelled the proposals of a previous Fianna F&aacute;il Administration. In a second cancellation, he proceeded to sell sites which had been secured throughout the country, which was consistent with the policies of that Administration. As Senator Leyden said, they were more concerned about taxing children&rsquo;s shoes so that ladies with small feet would not be able to cash in on the possibility of buying footwear without paying their due taxes. It was hardly surprising, therefore, that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, sold the sites. This meant waiting for a considerable period before being able to revert to a decentralisation programme, which was successfully implemented by the 1987-89 Government, and in which the Leader of the House played a very important part.</P>
      <P>We are experiencing the benefits of that programme today. There was an allocation of 250 civil servants to the then Department of Social Welfare in County Sligo. It is worth noting that today almost 700 people work in that office. While Sligo is to lose 100 jobs by way of localising the mother and child scheme, I am pleased that under the first and second phases of the decentralisation programme, 100 additional posts will be created. I would like many more jobs, as I am sure every town and cluster of more than three houses would like a Department in their back garden. However, this is neither realistic nor feasible.</P>
      <P>A number of Opposition Senators asked about Roscrea, Loughrea and various other towns. This is missing the point. It would be fantastic if the Minister of State were in a position to announce 1,000 jobs for Sligo. However, this is not a parochial matter, it is about the policy of decentralisation and people. People must think regionally. Senator Feighan, for whom I have tremendous <Col N="1561"/>respect &mdash; unlike Senator Leyden, I will not speculate about his political affiliations before he came to this House &mdash; referred to how Boyle, which fought hard and made a site available free of charge, had been overlooked. Sligo County Council, and perhaps most county councils throughout the country, were making available a site free of charge. The Senator will need many more votes than Boyle if he is to transfer from this to the other House. Phase 2 of the plan is not 100 years away. The second Phil Flynn report will be published in March, which will be followed by immediate action by the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>In the region of 300 jobs will be created in Carrick-on-Shannon and approximately 240 in Roscommon town, which is 550 jobs in the constituency. Sligo will also benefit. The 700 staff who work in the Department of Social and Family Affairs commute from Senator Bannon&rsquo;s constituency, Donegal, Roscommon, Cavan and Fermanagh. Of course, it would be great politically to be able to say 1,000 jobs will be created in Sligo, Portlaoise or wherever. However, we must consider the regional aspect of decentralisation in order to achieve the ultimate benefits. The Government must take the lead in tackling regional imbalance and investing in the regions.</P>
      <P>The private sector should follow suit and engage in the regions. Irish indigenous industry should decentralise office facilities to other parts of the country and we should stimulate and attract foreign direct investment through the IDA and other agencies. The Flynn report makes the point that the decentralisation of State agencies has not happened before, which is not entirely true. A number of years ago, the IDA decentralised constituent parts of the organisation. For example, part of the international trade service division and the entire engineering division is located in Sligo. When Ireland is being marketed in Dusseldorf, Japan, New York and throughout the world, it is being marketed from Sligo. Over time, it will be possible to bring these agencies to the area. The IDA has already done it. In the 1980s the then leader of Fine Gael, Mr. Alan Dukes, stated it would cost £45 million. It did not cost that. As Senator Mansergh rightly pointed out, decentralisation was a cost-saving measure. Decentralising out of Dublin was cheaper by approximately 50p per square foot, which represented a significant saving.</P>
      <P>According to the report of the implementation group headed by Mr. Phil Flynn, over the lifetime of an average mortgage, some 25 years, that is precisely what will happen again. There will be very significant cost savings because, instead of paying exorbitant rents in Dublin, which are climbing and represent dead money, we will have secured state-of-the-art facilities nationwide. The savings in rentals will continue to accrue at that level, and the State will own the buildings, which it does not do in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation is a tremendously positive step. The issue has been too politicised. Senator <Col N="1562"/>Ulick Burke said it was the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who politicised it. That is most certainly not the case. It has been politicised since the 1980s by others. It should not be politicised. It is a very positive policy and there is only one party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator John Paul Phelan is back. Lest he missed it <i>en route</i> from his office, I pointed out earlier that the decentralisation programme could have been completed by now if in 1982 the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy John Bruton, had not cancelled the process and sold the sites. However, that is not surprising, given that at the time Fine Gael was more concerned with putting VAT on children&rsquo;s shoes.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House today.</P>
      <P>Words, as well as promises, are soon forgotten by this Government, but let me refresh the Minister of State&rsquo;s memory regarding the words of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, when announcing decentralisation plans last year. He said that it would be catastrophic if decentralisation was not delivered by the next general election and that the Government must make sure it was delivered or it would suffer heavily at the polls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what happened to Fine Gael. It is indeed a family at war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has not delivered on decentralisation. Last week we heard that the plan to move 10,300 Dublin-based civil and public servants to 53 new locations by 2007 has been dropped, even though the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, placed leaflets in every post office in Laoighis-Offaly on the eve of budget day last year announcing decentralisation to those locations.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately for the Government, there will be a general election before its policy can be implemented in full. The Government lied to the people and it will get a message from them. With the results of the local elections still fresh in its mind, this must be a daunting prospect &mdash; having run almost 20 candidates in Laoighis-Offaly, very few were elected to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>How many?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the ink was dry on the budget announcement last year, the T&aacute;naiste hinted that targets for decentralisation could be reduced if staff resistance remained high. Shortly after decentralisation was announced, the two parties in Government were pulling in different directions like two goats. This is evident in Government even today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator would know about goats pulling the wrong way.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1564"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It appears that the Government could not even convince itself that decentralisation would go ahead as promised.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that plans for decentralisation were first mooted prior to the local elections in 1999. In the run-up to the last general election it was part of An Agreed Programme for Government to be delivered by 2002. Prior to last year&rsquo;s local elections it was announced yet again with much fanfare in the budget. I refer to announcements by the Minister of State in the Laoighis-Offaly constituency. Decentralisation must go down in history as the most promised, broken promise. The electorate, however, are waiting on the doorsteps, waiting in the long grass, as they did last June at the local and European elections.</P>
      <P>Approximately 4,700 other positions that featured in the budget package last year have not been mentioned in the latest report issued by the implementation committee. It is reported that the Government remains committed to moving these jobs and has announced that they will feature in a separate report in the spring. However, people should not hold their breath. It is another con job. Ministers have made promises, but should we believe them any more? The people do not believe them. They have lost the trust of the people on this and on a number of other issues. They cannot deny it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

	<P>The Leader would have been like a red rag to a bull in Athlone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator believe decentralisation is voluntary? There is an argument about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the promise made last December and the firm commitment to move 10,000 civil servants out of Dublin within three years, 29 of the original 53 locations have been abandoned. This monumental mishandling of the decentralisation programme has set back the cause of genuine regional development and caused discontent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is the only one who is disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are left with is a shambles which serves neither the staff concerned or the people they serve.</P>
      <P>The scaled-down programme of decentralisation now proposed shows that this ill-conceived <Col N="1565"/>project is now in the difficulties envisaged by the Opposition last year. Deputy Richard Bruton said in the D&aacute;il that decentralisation would not happen, and it has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be terrible to be so negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget allocation of &euro;20 million would not be enough even to move the furniture out of Dublin. The Government has not thought the decentralisation programme through. A mere &euro;20 million was provided. It is only a pittance in terms of the programme announced in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a down payment. It was evidence of trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 13 Departments and State bodies will move to 15 locations in the first long-overdue phase of the scaled-down programme. I am delighted that 159 Prison Service jobs have gone to Longford under the plan. As soon as the announcement was made I met the county manager and my colleagues on Longford County Council with a view to calling the Government&rsquo;s bluff. Longford County Council, of which I was a member at the time, donated the site free of charge to the Prison Service, as the Minister of State is aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>That requires correction. We paid for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We invited the Minister of State to the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Although we had to borrow a spade, we turned the sod to ensure there would be no going back on the Longford project. Following the withdrawal of Cardinal Health&rsquo;s proposed plant, this is good news for the county and I hope the move will be mutually beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>As several speakers are offering to contribute to this interesting debate, I ask that the business of the House be extended to 7.45 p.m., if the Minister of State will agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State be called at 7.40 p.m.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement, referred to by the Leader, by Cooper Cameron Corporation of 57 new jobs, which will see Longford placed as the company&rsquo;s global centre of excellence. Other good news is Wessel Cable&rsquo;s extension in Longford, which will create a further <Col N="1566"/>40 new jobs, and Abbott&rsquo;s recent &euro;700 million investment in the town, which will generate in the region of 800 new jobs. These are positive developments, regarding which I have worked hard since entering the House.</P>
      <P>Although the Government decided to cut its losses and break loose from the huge commitment of full decentralisation, questions on funding still have to be answered. Far from being realistic, the former Minister&rsquo;s assertion that the project would be self-financing is another failed promise. The entire initiative will not even break even until 2026, according to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I must ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The country deserves better than a Government which has wilfully deceived the electorate on many occasions but the scale of the deception in regard to decentralisation is mind-blowing. Some 29 of the original 58 towns earmarked for decentralisation have been abandoned by the Government, with all the problems that ensue being dropped on their doorsteps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

	<P>Will the Senator conclude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his comprehensive statement to the House. It is obvious his statement is baffling to some on the other side of the House because we listened to contributions which were prepared in advance of the events of the past two weeks. No recognition was given to the substance of the Flynn reports and there was not acceptance that decentralisation is not something that happens on a Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about the broken promises of the Government. The Senator cannot blame Mr. Flynn for them.</P>

	<P>Senator Bannon, allow Senator Dooley to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon is talking rubbish. He is like a goat tied to a pole, going around in a circle with no concept of what is going on. The Senator decried the Government for the fact that house prices would drop. This is appalling given that he repeatedly complains in the House in regard to the price of houses and that young couples cannot buy houses. His point is self-defeating. We will not need an Opposition by the time of the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I was talking about areas where the Government reneged on its decentralisation commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>This is the most pompous rubbish I have ever heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The point which many emphasise is that there is no understanding or care for the staff involved in decentralisation. The Opposition rightly identified an issue when decentralisation was first mooted. It asked the Government the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government lied. It said the process would take three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator wait to hear what I have to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator John Paul Phelan might not want to hear what I have to say, although, to be fair, he made a relatively good contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is pompous rubbish. Who does the Senator think he is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Phelan should not interrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is hurtful, I apologise. The point I was trying to make was that the Opposition rightly asked a question of Government when decentralisation was announced, namely, whether the Government would force people out of jobs in Dublin into parts of rural Ireland. The answer from Government was that the moves would not be forced, that it would work with the unions-&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, not consult with the unions?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1568"/>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it would work to ensure staff were appointed to positions they wanted, where possible. This has obviously proved a greater difficulty than some might have understood it to be. We accept that staff cannot be forced into jobs they do not want or to areas to which they do not want to go. However, Opposition Members are still not happy. They decry the fact that the towns are not getting what was promised. What would the Opposition do to give what was promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not have told lies in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition would force civil servants into jobs they do not want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government did not do its homework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is to be the policy of the Opposition in its response to the decentralisation programme in the run-up to the next general election, I would be delighted to see it on paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Decentralisation was an attempt to buy the local elections but it did not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be delighted to challenge Senator Bannon as he stated the Government parties will suffer the effects of this at the next elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government suffered last June in the local and European elections. The public will not be blind going into the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The one message coming from Senator Bannon&rsquo;s contribution is that he and his party, Fine Gael, which opposed decentralisation for so long, now accept it is required for balanced regional development and the development of rural Ireland, and to promote life outside Dublin. However, as a result of this, Fine Gael will force people out. It is a serious move. It was worthwhile having this debate to discover this point.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the decentralisation programme is progressing so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>With one fifth of the required staff available. Who does the Senator think he is kidding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am particularly delighted that County Clare is part of the first phase and that jobs are being transferred to Kilrush as part of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; response, as Senator Finucane stated, in the context of the cluster which includes Newcastle West and Listowel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a few problems with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1569"/>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt this will be welcomed, as was the past decentralisation programme in which Ennis, Nenagh and Limerick were clustered.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation is an evolving process. From the time Fianna F&aacute;il set about this programme, it has ensured the regions were developed and built up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Were the PDs involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We are at one with the Opposition in terms of recognising the importance of decentralisation to the growth of the regions. Senator O&rsquo;Meara referred to Ryanair&rsquo;s announcement today that it will invest approximately &euro;180 million to &euro;200 million, which is a fantastic recognition of the mid-west and west. I am delighted the Western Development Commission in recent days began encouraging people to move from the overcrowded east coast, an area where the infrastructure is creaking at the seams because of the increases in population. It is correct for the commission to try to encourage people to move west and Government policy is focused on supporting this.</P>
      <P>However, this process must be carried out in a phased and controlled manner. From the outset, the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, stated it could not be done as a big bang. Certain statements have been taken in isolation and presented in this debate in what can only be described as a misleading way and one which tries to suggest that the Government last December set about delivering on a programme of decentralisation over two to three years. Anybody in his or her right mind would know this was not achievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what was stated last year in this Chamber by perhaps five or six Fianna F&aacute;il Members. It was stated the programme would be delivered over three years but it has not been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it was. To the best of my recollection, nobody on this side said that 10,000 staff would be delivered in three years. It is the use of a selective quotation, a practice with which the Opposition is familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I must ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>A Member referred to the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government as being over-ambitious. This is the first time an Opposition has criticised a Government for being ambitious. This is what the Opposition lacks, irrespective of whether it can see it. The reality is that the Government has been ambitious in regard to delivering jobs to the regions, removing the clog in infrastructure from Dublin city and ensuring that people have a quality of life, but it has done this in a way that is mindful of the workers who must be transferred. From my understanding of the contributions of Opposition Members, they will force staff to move to areas to which they do not want to go.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak and I thank Senator Dooley for sharing his time. In 1980 the Fianna F&aacute;il Government made plans to bring in the decentralisation programme and it was very successful. I was on the Committee of Public Accounts at the time when the Opposition told us we could not move the then Department of Social Welfare out of Dublin because it was so big, as were the computers. The technology has moved on and many parts of the Department of Social and Family Affairs are now devolved and decentralised throughout the country. We had a similarly good programme in 1989.</P>
      <P>When the spatial strategy was launched by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, there was some disappointment. Tuam, for example, is a hub town and a number of gateway towns have done quite well out of decentralisation. Tuam did not feature in the spatial strategy. At the time I also made a strong case for Ballinasloe because it had lost two major industries, Square D and AT Cross, while Dubarry has laid off some people. Thankfully, Ballinasloe is included in the decentralisation programme, with the National Roads Authority due to come there. It is disappointing for me that Ballinasloe is not mentioned in Table 1, 2 or 3. I am told that is because the NRA employs specialised, highly-skilled people. The NRA is very busy with its roads programme, and all credit to it, but it is time for the agency to announce through a sub-committee or small group what it intends to do with regard to Ballinasloe. That is important.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Loughrea is mentioned in Table 1, with 40 staff due to come from the Department of Transport, and in Table 3, with 12 people coming from the National Safety Council. The Minister and the Government must look again at Ballinasloe. That town like many others wants a major industry to locate there but the only way the Government can directly help the town is through the decentralisation programme. I hope Ballinasloe will be listed in future announcements.</P>
      <P>I understand that the closing date for applications regarding the spatial strategy was September 2001 &mdash; Senator O&rsquo;Rourke may confirm that. A great deal of good work was done on the spatial strategy by the previous Government but I now see the new Deputies from east Galway, in particular the Independent Deputies, claiming credit for Tuam having hub status. A lot of the work was done by the last Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly by the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who consulted and was of course lobbied by Members on all sides of both Houses to give hub or gateway status to various regions and towns. I am glad that Tuam has hub status but it needs development.</P><Col N="1571"/>
      <P>There are many issues we could discuss. The Minister of State has given a very good explanation of what is happening. I am glad we have made progress. I admit, as no doubt will the Minister of State, that there are areas in which we have not made progress. It is important that the towns not so far included should have their problems sorted out. The NRA is an important body for which I have great regard and I greatly admire its work. The Minister told me that it is so busy with its roads programme that it has not got down to the basics of moving to Ballinasloe. Hopefully the NRA will sort out its problems and we will see it taking its first steps in terms of moving to the town.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach has been very generous in giving time to those on the opposite benches.</P>
      <P>The main point of the decentralisation debate is that the homework was not done beforehand. The announcement was made in the budget, where it had no place. In the budget, the Minister should make announcements concerning changes in archaic and outdated limits in the social welfare area which are there for 11 years, for example, in the area of family income supplement. The decentralisation programme had no place in the budget debate last year and there was no consultation with the unions. When the Government began talking to the unions it realised there were major problems. That is why we now have 2,000 people moving instead of 10,000. That is the main difficulty the Opposition has with decentralisation. The purpose of decentralisation is to ensure that not only will we have as good a public service as we currently have, but perhaps even better. The Government, however, has fallen at the first hurdle, that of transferring the Departments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement about Carlow but I acknowledge the role played in the decision by Carlow County Council. It gave the Department a free site in a prime location in Carlow town and offered to fast-track the planning process. It put together a very good package which the Minister and Government could not refuse. The decision was the result of the pro-active initiative taken by the Carlow local authority and I would not like to see the Minister of State take all the glory for that decision.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that Senator Dooley in his contribution regarding Shannon did not mention Enterprise Ireland, which has now been shelved. He spoke about Kilrush but Enterprise Ireland is now gone. Senator John Paul Phelan spoke about Kilkenny city and Thomastown, which has lost the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The antics of the Minister of State last year were deplorable and gave politics a bad name. I am glad he was not rewarded in the local elections because politics was given a bad name. I am glad that my friends in the Luggacuran area, Councillors Moran and Daly, came first and second in the poll. For all of us, that sent out a good signal that these gimmicky antics will get us nowhere and will damage politics in general. The public already has a low opinion about politics without us deliberately doing anything to make the situation worse. I am glad that in most of the towns promised Government Departments under decentralisation, Fianna F&aacute;il lost seats. It did not get the reward it thought it would get. The sham was exposed.</P>
      <P>I was bemused while listening to Senator Dooley talk about jobs for the regions. The Government&rsquo;s record in that area is atrocious. Even in Carlow we have 900 IDA-supported jobs, 700 of which date back to the early 1970s. We have had no new jobs in that area. The situation has been atrocious. The record is worse in Kilkenny and other parts of the country. I would hate to go to the west of Ireland as I imagine the situation is even worse there.</P>

	<P>Senator Kitt asked a useful question on the spatial strategy. Where is it and what is it? We have forgotten all about it. It was launched with great fanfare and we have not heard about it since. It has made no difference at all.</P>

	<P>On behalf of his countymen and countywomen, Senator Dooley welcomed the Revenue to County Clare. I suspect he is the only public representative who would ever welcome the Revenue to any part of the country given the prospect for declarations on various non-resident accounts there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 300 jobs coming to County Clare. There is spin-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a useful debate and the key issue has been raised by Senator Kitt. Since the Government set out in a national spatial strategy where it wants to make settlement policies over the next ten years, it is logical that at its first opportunity of directing jobs to the regions <Col N="1573"/>it will follow that plan. We have made a huge mistake. This is stroke politics at its worst, whether it comes from this side of the House or the other. This scatter-gun approach, with a little offered to everyone, is appalling. It is neither sensible, strategic or sustainable. If we are serious about doing something about the imbalance between east and west we should pick one or two locations in the west of Ireland and go for them.</P>
      <P>The Shannon and Limerick region is the most logical place for strategic development in order to stop the pull between east and west, because it has an airport, third level education facilities and all kinds of industries. If we are serious about stopping the expansion of Dublin and doing something for regional development, all the international evidence is that one should select one or two areas, rather than 56, as the Government did before the last local elections. One should run with those areas and try to do something significant for regional development. The great fault on all sides lies in thinking that every area can get four or five, 50 or 60 jobs here or there. That will do nothing for regional development in the long term. There are many people in Dublin who want to see genuine regional development to reduce the gridlock, stop the crazy hike in house prices and so on.</P>
      <P>There are jobs which can be usefully decentralised. One of the reasons the Department of Social and Family Affairs is such a success in parts of County Donegal is that much of its task is administrative. If one is serious about policy, one must keep the key decision-makers close to each other. It is crazy that people will regularly criss-cross the country to discuss policy in respect of various Departments. If we stop the stroke politics and go back to basics on this issue, then we will be able to do something significant for regional development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions. Those which were not enlightening were, in some cases, hilarious. I am sure if they reach &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, they will make interesting viewing. Senators John Paul Phelan and Feighan started off the debate. I have the height of regard for both young Senators but I thought their contributions were quite juvenile and naive in many ways in terms of where they are coming from compared with that of their colleague from Limerick, Senator Finucane, who made a very mature contribution. I would say to Senator John Paul Phelan that it was never suggested, either in this House or the other or anywhere else, that decentralisation would be delivered in one year.</P>

	<P>That was the Senator&rsquo;s inference.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1574"/>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>He went on at great length about towns with Ministers. Is there a Minister in Longford, Newcastle West, Thomastown, Carrick-on-Shannon, Kilrush, Loughrea or in Portlaoise? I do not believe there is, yet all these towns are in the first phase.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that the Government is determined to deliver the full decentralisation package. I think Senator O&rsquo;Toole said it did not matter how long it would take. Senator Dooley referred to the fact that when the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, was trying to motivate Ministers to encourage Departments to move, he mentioned 2007. That should not be a stick with which to beat him. It was an ambitious target and Ministers should have pulled the finger out and motivated their Departments.</P>
      <P>Phil Flynn has a tremendous reputation and the people on his committee are all high achievers with expertise in their areas. The criterion used is that this is a voluntary scheme, which the Government has always said. One cannot put a gun to civil servants&rsquo; heads. Fine Gael, in its last manifesto, said it would decentralise full Departments within a year. I would like to know how that was going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We selected seven towns, not 53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It was going to put a gun to civil servants&rsquo; heads and move them to seven towns. We allowed civil servants to apply to move.</P>

	<P>They will be scattered everywhere.</P>

	<P>Why did the Government not consult beforehand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>More than 9,000 civil servants have applied to move. Mr. Phil Flynn wanted to assure himself that Departments would be able to operate efficiently and have sufficient people from all grades. That is why he has come forward with the 28 agencies and Departments. He has recommended to the Government &mdash; it has accepted the report &mdash; that those 28 agencies and Departments move. Some 4,500 civil servants will move in the three different moves which will be made. That is half of the full commitment. Within a year &mdash; although it will not be a year until tomorrow when the budget is announced &mdash; tremendous progress has been made by the Government, the Department of Finance and the OPW. I am very proud of that achievement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I might not just have the single poster which got me such tremendous notice around the country and which cost me &euro;16. Senator Browne referred to people bringing politics into disrepute.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara made a number of comments. I recall that when I was in the House the last time, her colleague, Senator McDowell, referred to the decentralisation of Departments to God awful places with dingy pubs around the country. If that is the Dublin and the Labour Party mindset, we have a major problem.</P>
      <P>In fairness, everyone agrees with voluntary participation in decentralisation. In terms of the hype that the Government should have consulted, if it had attempted to consult each Department in advance of this very ambitious declaration to move 9,500 civil servants, it would still be talking about it. The consultation has taken place. At least 35 new people apply each week to decentralise. Given the announcement made last week, civil servants and those in the agencies are now 100% sure that the Government will deliver on this project and throngs will sign up to move. The Government is fully committed to taking care of the people left behind. They will be directed to new Departments or to new jobs. Their jobs will be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>I am delighted with the debate and the fact so many Senators contributed. It has been very positive and I am delighted with the massive success so far and the progress we have made. In terms of hostages to fortune, the report states clearly &mdash; the OPW has put its neck on the line &mdash; when the different projects will begin and end. As I said, all will be completed by 2008 and by &ldquo;completed&rdquo; I mean that locations will be fitted out and ready for civil servants to move in. I have no doubt the Department of Finance and the Civil Service will have put all the personnel in place and that we will have a very successful decentralisation scheme.</P>
      <P>In regard to those agencies or Departments which have not been included in the first move, as Senator O&rsquo;Rourke said, we are moving the big offices and Departments, the tough ones. It will be a lot easier for the rest to come on stream and I have no doubt some of them will have moved well before 2008. I look forward to the very successful implementation of this scheme. Again, I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask the Minister for Health and Children if there are any plans to increase the number of beds for cancer care to serve the population of 100,000 in north Kildare and if consideration could be given to using some of the existing beds in the Maynooth community unit run by the South Western Area Health Board for such care since St. Brigid&rsquo;s hospice in the Curragh is the nearest such facility and this imposes undue hardship on patients on their families? There is no public transport from Maynooth, Kilcock and Leixlip to the hospice in the Curragh. Some kindness and consideration should be shown to those who must go to the Curragh by the provision of direct transport. At present, they must travel by taxi or must travel to Naas and then to the Curragh. Are there any plans in place in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</P>
      <P>Since implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately &euro;550 million nationally in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes the sum of &euro;15 million which was provided in 2004 to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately &euro;183 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area for people with cancer. This investment has enabled the funding of 41 additional consultant posts together with support staff in key areas of cancer care, such as medical oncology, radiology and palliative care. The funding has also provided for the appointment of 97 cancer care nurse specialists across the health authority region.</P>
      <P>The new national cancer strategy, which is being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, will build on the progress made during the implementation of the first national cancer strategy. It will set out key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years. It will also make recommendations regarding the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.</P>
      <P>The report of the national advisory committee on palliative care was launched on 4 October 2001. It describes a comprehensive palliative care service and acts as a blueprint for its develop<Col N="1577"/>ment. It is planned that the report&rsquo;s recommendations will be implemented over a five to seven year period. Prior to the launch of the report, £3 million or &euro;3.8 million, was allocated to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to begin implementing its recommendations. At the beginning of 2001, an additional £2.625 million, or &euro;3.3 million, was also allocated to the boards and authority for palliative care services. An additional &euro;6.928 million funding was made available for improvements in palliative care services in 2002. In 2003, additional funding of &euro;2.456 million was provided and this year the figure is &euro;1.2 million.</P>
      <P>As the Senator is aware, the provision of health services in County Kildare is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the South Western Area Health Board acting under the aegis of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The authority has advised the Department of Health and Children that the number of palliative care beds in Drogheda Memorial Hospital in the Curragh was increased from four to seven. In these circumstances, there are no plans to use beds in the Maynooth community nursing unit for palliative care.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, for coming to the House. My question relates to the provision of a proper gymnasium at St. Raphael&rsquo;s College, Loughrea, County Galway. It was 28 years ago, in 1976, that the school first requested this facility. The physical education facilities in the school are poor, with no light, heating, washing facilities, or toilets. This is a college that is well known for its achievements in games such as volleyball, camogie and hurling. The girls&rsquo; volleyball team took part in the world championships in 1988 and twice competed at the Catholic student games. The most popular girls&rsquo; games are volleyball and hurling, while the favourite games for boys are hurling and volleyball. The boys&rsquo; volleyball team has won the all-Ireland B championship in the past.</P>
      <P>Proper facilities should be provided for physical education, an important subject which is often forgotten and in which great success has been achieved by the pupils of this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kitt for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the strategy of the Department of Education and Science for capital investment in education projects. I also wish to outline the position regarding an application for an extension and PE hall received from St. Raphael&rsquo;s College, Loughrea, County Galway.</P>
      <P>The management authority of that school applied for an extension in February 2000 and for the refurbishment of the existing PE hall in <Col N="1578"/>February 2003. The school is accommodated in two blocks, comprising the junior block which accommodates class groups up to junior certificate level and the main building accommodating all other levels. The application for an extension is under consideration in the school planning section of the Department. All relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends in the area, must be taken into account. Following an assessment of these factors, it is considered that the long-term projected enrolment for this school is 325 pupils. This is the figure on which the Department will base the school&rsquo;s future requirements.</P>
      <P>The next step is to determine how to meet the school&rsquo;s accommodation needs. Departmental officials are in discussions with the trustees on how best to meet these needs. Once this is decided, the project will be prioritised in accordance with the recently revised prioritisation criteria for large-scale projects. The next step in progressing a large-scale project is the drawing up of schedules of accommodation, which must be agreed by the school authorities before architectural planning of the project can commence.</P>
      <P>Further progress on St. Raphael&rsquo;s College and all such projects will be considered in the context of the schools building programme from 2005 onwards. The management authority of the school has recently made applications for various works under the summer works scheme and for temporary accommodation under the 2005 schools building programme. These applications will be assessed in the context of the school&rsquo;s overall accommodation requirements. It is planned to publish the list of successful applicants early in the new year.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, for coming to the House. The issue is self-explanatory. I request a list of all the schools in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West that have requested building works or building repairs and an indication of which of these requests have been approved. I also ask the Minister of State to outline which of the approved works have been commenced and completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Tuffy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the overall strategy of the Department of Education and Science to address the accommodation needs of first and second level schools. The Department has arranged for details regarding individual schools in the areas referred to by the Senator to be forwarded directly by officials.</P>
      <P>From the outset, the Government has been committed to addressing the historical deficit in educational infrastructure and has set about rec<Col N="1579"/>tifying the situation by allocating substantial funding in each of its budgets. Only &euro;92 million was allocated for investment in school buildings in 1997. In stark contrast, between 1998 and 2004, almost &euro;2 billion will have been invested in primary and post-primary educational infrastructure. This investment incorporates 7,500 individual building projects, site purchases, dust, asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science initiatives, contingency projects and furniture and equipment provision.</P>
      <P>At primary level, this unprecedented level of investment has delivered 84 new school buildings, more than 350 large-scale refurbishment or extension projects, in excess of 6,000 smaller-scale projects and thousands of other small-scale works under the annual minor works grant. At post-primary level, 46 new school buildings, more than 160 large-scale refurbishments or extensions and in excess of 850 smaller-scale projects have been delivered.</P>
      <P>In particular, the 2004 building programme is the most ambitious ever in the history of the State, involving many hundreds of individual projects ranging from new school buildings, extensions, refurbishments and other projects under the summer works scheme, temporary accommodation and permanent accommodation initiatives, remediation programmes, the contingency fund and site purchases.</P>
      <P>Within the 2004 programme, the Department introduced a new initiative, called the summer works scheme, for capital grants for small-scale improvements for both primary and post-primary schools. This new initiative is in addition to the <Col N="1580"/>existing devolved grant scheme for minor works which applies to all primary schools. The &euro;31 million provided for the new scheme is targeted at small-scale improvement works in those schools most in need of resources. The scheme reflects the overall approach of empowering school authorities to manage their own building programmes with minimal interaction with the Department. In excess of 450 schools benefited from the scheme in 2004 and a similar scheme will operate in 2005.</P>
      <P>Departmental officials are conducting a review of all large-scale projects which did not proceed to construction as part of the 2004 schools building programme. Under this review, all projects are assessed against the published prioritisation criteria, which were revised earlier this year following consultation with the education partners. Each project will be assigned a band rating and the progress of all projects will be considered in the context of the schools building programme from 2005 onwards.</P>
      <P>Department officials will be in touch with Senator Tuffy in the near future to provide the data she has sought.</P>
