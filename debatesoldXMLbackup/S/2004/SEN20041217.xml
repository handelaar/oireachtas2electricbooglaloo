    <Title>Tributes to Head Usher of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group and the entire House, I wish to pay tribute to Paddy Behan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Members will have an opportunity to speak about him. When speaking about Pat Behan, it is difficult to know where to begin. I find myself somewhat at a loss in deciding what to say. We all know him very well. I would like to hear his recipe for good health &mdash; he did not take a sick day for 32 years, which is some record &mdash; so that it can be given to all those with whom we work. It is a mark of how happy and fulfilled he felt in his job that he liked to get up every day to come to work.</P>
      <P>The leaders of all parties in the House were given an exhaustive list of the various roles played by Paddy during his life. We are familiar with the role he has played in this House for many years, first in the ordinary usher service and then as deputy usher and chief usher. He developed a strong interest in genealogy while he was in charge of the register of births and deaths in the Department of Health. He was an avid footballer and jogger during his early school years. When he served in the Reserve Defence Force, his boss was Charlie Haughey. Paddy played an enormous role in his many special interests.</P>
      <P>Mr. Behan was working in the Houses of the Oireachtas when many eminent presidents and other people of note visited the Houses. He has had a kaleidoscope of experiences, all of which were notable for his affability, good humour and approachability. He remained cheerful, outgoing, affable, pleasant and eager to help, regardless of whether he was dealing with President Mitterrand or a first-time nervous backbencher in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad. Such attributes and characteristics come to mind when we think of Paddy Behan or try to sum him up. He treated princes and paupers with professionalism, skill, affability <Col N="2582"/>and the great interpersonal skills he has in abundance. Paddy was friendly and outgoing whenever one met him, whether it was early in the morning or late in the evening. He was always keen to help and do all he could to make one&rsquo;s path easier.</P>
      <P>I know from my private conversations with Paddy that he respected and empathised with those who had difficulties or sorrows. He was in tune with people&rsquo;s approaches to life. I am very grateful to him for that. He is a very fine person who epitomises the highest qualities of public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something we feel deeply about. Although I have always known him as Paddy Behan, I note that the documentation I have been given refers to him as &ldquo;Pat&rdquo;, which may be more respectful. When one met Paddy, one knew that whatever one said to him mattered at that moment and that he would try to help one in every way there and then. He is a very fine person.</P>
      <P>We are pleased that some of his friends and family are present this morning. He has a fine family &mdash; his wife, Kathleen, his son, Simon, and his four daughters, Niamh, Orla, Aisling and Aoife. Given that he has such a varied background and so many interests, it is clear that he does not intend to have an easy or cosy retirement. I imagine that he will be pressed upon by many groups and many people. I wholeheartedly salute his years of professionalism, public service and friendship.</P>

    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As we mark the retirement of Paddy Behan, I would like to echo the words of the Leader on behalf of the Fine Gael group. I did not know that one could retire in one&rsquo;s 40s. As I look at Paddy Behan, I wonder where the years have gone. Paddy Behan is a northsider like myself, although I have not mentioned that to many people in west Dublin over the past nine years. He is part and parcel of the north side of Dublin. He is an avid golfer and a member of Clontarf Golf Club, as well as a keen cyclist and marathon runner. He is an instrinsic part of St. Vincent&rsquo;s GAA Club, and all that stands for on the north side of Dublin. I am sure Senator McDowell will tell us more about that later. He is one of the few people in the House with an All-Ireland medal. It now seems to be an astonishing feat for a Dubliner to win an All-Ireland medal. Where was he when we needed him in recent years? Paddy is a great sportsman and I know he will remain as fit as he was when working in Leinster House.</P>
      <P>I met a junior colleague of Paddy&rsquo;s yesterday who said all the staff would miss him terribly. The colleague said that Paddy, in his 32 years in the House, never once gave an order. Such was his <Col N="2583"/>manner that he never had to do so. I know how well respected he is among the staff of the Houses. Paddy will be missed greatly but I know he will visit the Houses after he retires and bring in the scones and bread which he will bake at home from time to time. I wonder if he will ever write a book given that he was a member of staff in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, during which period he experienced turbulent years and all kinds of events. He will not be prevented from doing so because the Official Secrets Act does not apply to retired civil servants.</P>
      <P>I wish Paddy every success in his retirement and hope his wife and children, who will now see him more than they used to, will continue to enjoy his company for many years. I, on behalf of Fine Gael and all Members of the Seanad, sincerely thank him for his sterling work and, as the Leader implied, his sterling contribution to public service in this country. He will be greatly missed and I hope he will have a wonderful retirement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Independent group, I wish to echo and add to the sentiments of Senators O&rsquo;Rourke and Brian Hayes. If we were honest with ourselves, we would note that, from time to time, we pay somewhat tepid tributes to people in this House whom we are quite happy to see the back of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The opposite is true in the case of Paddy Behan. It was with incredible sadness and great surprise that I discovered he is retiring in about two weeks. I believed he had about a year and a half to serve before retirement. As Senator Brian Hayes said, it is extraordinary that someone who looks and sounds so young, and whose mind is so young, is leaving us. It is a terrible condemnation of the fact that there is mandatory retirement for people in the public service who reach a certain age. Paddy Behan still has very much to offer but unfortunately he will not be able to offer it to us any more.</P>
      <P>If Paddy Behan was not the first person I met when I first came to Leinster House 23 years ago, he is certainly the first I remember. All I can remember is that he was incredibly kind and very helpful. He showed me the ropes and told me my entitlements. Some weeks later, I heard that Paddy had left and I was devastated. Some less friendly face appeared behind the counter downstairs. However, about six weeks later, Paddy reappeared and has been here ever since. He has been a great friend to all Members.</P>
      <P>As Senator Brian Hayes implied, the greatest tribute to Paddy Behan is not that he is a friend to the Members, as he has been, but that the jun<Col N="2584"/>ior staff in Leinster House speak so incredibly highly of him. If one judges a man on his life or job, one should do so on the basis of how he is regarded by those in positions below him and not on how he is regarded by his equals or those he is supposed to serve. I have considerable experience of talking to staff of this House and have noted that they have all spoken highly of Paddy Behan. This is an incredible tribute to him given that there are people in the Houses, in all positions, who do not speak quite so highly of the rest of us. Paddy Behan is unanimously respected and liked because he has the time to be helpful to everybody, regardless of his or her stage in life. Being popular with the staff is an incredible quality.</P>
      <P>The second characteristic of note is Paddy&rsquo;s great patience. He always has enough time to talk to one about one&rsquo;s problems. I had a small problem last week that caused me a great deal of grief. The assistant in my office stated that Paddy Behan was the guy to sort it out. We went to Paddy, who was sitting at his desk, and he told me not to worry because he would resolve the problem. Another person might have been a little more gruff. The problem in question was a fault more of my making than anybody else&rsquo;s but Paddy resolved it.</P>
      <P>Paddy Behan will be irreplaceable. He has been an incredible rock of sense and support to all Members. He is a great advertisement for how civil servants should go on forever. I wish him a very happy retirement, a long life and a great deal of continued activity and fitness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My first experience of Paddy was not dissimilar to that of Senator Ross. Shortly after I was elected in 1992, I remember coming to the front gate of Leinster House before the beginning of the D&aacute;il term. I had been to Leinster House before then for Christmas parties of the Labour Party and other such functions but had never entered the place of my own right. I confess that was a wee bit nervous because I did not know how to get in. Paddy happened to be lingering in my vicinity, wished me good morning, invited me in and led me into the building. I was mightily impressed and I presumed Paddy had been studying photographs of new Deputies. I discovered subsequently that he lived in Marino and that I should probably have known him at least as well as he knew me.</P>
      <P>Paddy Behan also helped me through a great catharsis in my life which took place very shortly after I was elected. As a young, idealistic Labour Party activist from the north side of Dublin, I was nervous about expenses forms and had a notion in my head that they were all grubby and sordid. I would have preferred if expenses cheques arrived without my having had to sign a document. Somebody explained that the way to deal with the matter was to speak to Paddy, who would sort it out. It was only after some months that I went to Paddy because I was nervous about the whole <Col N="2585"/>process, but he went through the dates on the calendar and told me what to mark up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He had his own one-stop shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>He showed me where to sign and stated that he would sort me out. It was this kind of informality that marked Paddy&rsquo;s service in Leinster House.</P>
      <P>I, too, saw the <i>curriculum vitae</i> with which we have been provided and it astonished me that Paddy has been a member of staff for so long. It is somewhat strange to be speaking about Paddy almost in the past tense because I know I will see him again, probably quite soon. Senator Brian Hayes damned Frank Lane forever last week by referring to him as a cultivator of chrysanthemums. My experiences of Paddy Behan tend to be in pubs in Marino late at night and, very occasionally, in the golf club in Clontarf, of which he, unlike me, has succeeded in becoming a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Good judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I also encounter him very occasionally in St. Vincent&rsquo;s GAA club.</P>
      <P>Paddy has been a true friend to us all. There is an obvious warmth to the genuine tributes we have heard this morning. We are all grateful for the assistance Paddy has given us over the years. Senator Brian Hayes is right in saying that this is also the case in respect of the other ushers. In all my time in the House, I never heard a bad word said about Paddy by any of the other ushers. This is an extraordinary tribute to any boss. I join the other Senators unhesitatingly in wishing Paddy all the best. No doubt I will meet him for a pint in Graingers some night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I am delighted to be associated with this tribute to Paddy Behan, who has served us so loyally and well for 36 years in Leinster House. In many ways, he epitomises the ideal man who can &ldquo;meet with triumph and disaster, And treat those two imposters just the same&rdquo;, as depicted in Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s poem <i>If</i>. Paddy has all the qualities listed in the poem and he has been professional in everything he has done. He could write a book, as Senator Brian Hayes suggested, and it would make very interesting reading. I understand he has given a commitment to bring the secrets to the grave with him. There was a great sigh of relief around the Houses when he made that statement.</P>
      <P>He has been a father figure to all of us. When one comes in the gates of Leinster House for the first time one can be quite intimidated. Paddy has always been able to put us at our ease. It never ceases to fascinate me how, when each new intake arrives, everybody is known. One presents oneself at the desk and does not have to say who one is. It takes a great deal of effort and homework to do that. We are all very grateful to him <Col N="2586"/>for the assistance he has given us. It is unusual in any walk of life not to hear people speak ill of others but it is quite unique in this place and I have never heard anybody speak ill of Paddy.</P>
      <P>His sporting achievements have been listed but one aspect has not been mentioned, namely, the way he looked after the Oireachtas rugby team which has been playing for 12 years or so. It plays an annual fixture against the Houses of Lords and Commons among others, and has been to the World Cup. Paddy was the manager, masseur, minder of the money and the fixer of the scrapes. By scrapes I do not mean those on the field but those off the field. For all of that I thank him and assure him that the tickets will continue to be available to him for Lansdowne Road. We hope he enjoys those, and that he and his family enjoy his retirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The last speaker will be the sole representative from Northern Ireland, Senator Maurice Hayes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak on behalf of a group that has never before been recognised in this House, and which will dissolve as soon as I finish speaking, that is, present and former Members from Northern Ireland. I recall Gordon Wilson telling me about his experience of coming to Leinster House when he said he had no problems because there was a man called Paddy Behan who filled up all the forms for him and that was all he had to do. If I may speak on behalf of Gordon Wilson, Br&iacute;d Rodgers, Seamus Mallon and Sam<?oasys [jy?>McAughtry, and warmly on my own behalf, I pay tribute to Paddy Behan and thank him for all he has done to make this place so liveable in, and so welcoming to people. To instil that sort of culture and spirit in all the people who work here is an achievement and I am sorry to see him decommissioning but am glad he has no objection to being photographed.</P>
      <P>I did not realise until I read his <i>curriculum vitae</i> recently that I had come across Paddy approximately 46 years ago, in much less pleasant circumstances. He was a member of a Dublin minor team which beat a Down minor team in the semi-final of the all-Ireland. He was a star then and he is a star now. I thank him personally for all he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with all these fine tributes to Paddy. The applause following them confirms the respect he commanded in this House which was second to none. He was always in good humour, always had a smile, and it was a pleasure to meet him. He established a high level of professionalism in his job. Senator Brian Hayes mentioned his youthful appearance and others mentioned his achievements on the football field. I am involved in a masters hurling team in Limerick, which I think won the all-Ireland this year. Dublin won the football. Paddy would be very useful on this masters team which would help to keep him fit for the future and <Col N="2587"/>where I am sure there would be a place for him. He will also have time to pursue his other great sporting activity, golf. I do not play golf and do not known much about handicaps but I am sure he will have plenty of time to improve his handicap now.</P>
      <P>On a personal note, I have a daughter who is a civil servant. She worked in the Department of Justice and Paddy&rsquo;s daughter Orla worked with her and they became great friends. My daughter, Aileen, is in Limerick but every time she visits Dublin her first call is to Orla Behan. They have developed a friendship which is hardly surprising knowing their two fathers.</P>
      <P>We will miss Paddy&rsquo;s smile but we will probably see it somewhere. I wish him, his wife Kathleen, his son Simon, and his daughters, Orla, Niamh, Aisling and Aoife the best of luck for the future. I thank Paddy for his great help. The tributes to him have been fine and deserving, the like of which I never witnessed in the House.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I extend season&rsquo;s greetings to all Members of the House. I thank the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader and the leaders and whips of the various groups for their hard work. I also thank the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard and their staff, including Paddy Behan to whom we have paid glowing tributes, Dessie Edwards who is also retiring, and Frank Lane who retired earlier in the week. I thank the broadcasting and reporting staff, the staff of the Houses, and members of the press for their attendance and coverage. On behalf of Members I thank the Clerk, Deirdre, and the Assistant Clerk, Jody, and other members of the staff in their office for their guidance and assistance. I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Acting Chairmen for the many hours they spent in the chair.</P>
      <P>I wish everyone a relaxed and peaceful Christmas.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been suggested to me that Christmas wishes be conveyed with the Order of Business, rather than having everyone getting up twice or three times. I am very pleased to echo the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s felicitations for Christmas and for 2005. I wish every Member of the House a very happy Christmas, and particularly time to be with their families and enjoy one another. We all look forward very much to that. I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach. It is not always easy to keep an even temper in a House of varied contributions and characters, different as we all are. He keeps great order as well as maintaining friendship with everybody, which can be difficult.</P>
      <P>I thank particularly the staff, led by Deirdre Lane. I doubt there is a legislative chamber in Europe or the world which is run in such an efficient but also friendly manner. We wander in and out of the offices and one wonders where else one would be allowed to do that. When we all go <Col N="2588"/>home tonight, laden with our parcels and presents in our cars and so on, the mopping-up operation after a busy term must be done in those offices. The term was especially busy in the past three to four weeks dealing with a significant intensity of legislation. Each one of the staff in the offices is friendly, approachable and professional. They make us all feel very welcome when we wander freely in and out of their offices, which is due to the influence exerted by Deirdre Lane and Jody. We are very happy Jody is back with us in good health.</P>

	<P>I wish everybody a happy Christmas. We have had a busy term and there is an even busier one to come. Legislation awaits our return. I am grateful for the even tenor of business we have maintained here. There are spats from time to time but that is what our business is about. We are here because we come from different political parties so spats are par for the course. However, they do not interfere with how we run and order our business. I very much welcome the friendship, co-operation and comradeship between the leaders &mdash;&ldquo;representatives&rdquo; is the right word &mdash; of the groups in the House. I wish them all a happy time with their families.</P>

Members may share time. The Minister is to be called on to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage. Committee and Remaining Stages are to be taken on the conclusion of No. 2 or at 4 p.m. and to conclude at 6 p.m.; No. 2, motion for earlier signature of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004, if passed by this House, is to be taken immediately on the conclusion of Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill; and No. 3, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 2 p.m. and to conclude no later than 4 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and all their staff in the House a very happy Christmas. I thank them very much for all their hard work, particularly over the last three weeks, which have been difficult, since we have had to work very hard four days a week with late hours. All the amendments and papers must be pro<Col N="2589"/>duced by a very small staff under the leadership of the Clerk and the Cathaoirleach. I wish them a happy Christmas. I also wish the Leader, the other group leaders and Senators a happy Christmas.</P>
      <P>From time to time there is some tension in the House, which is not a bad thing if it is creative. I appreciate the co-operation from the Government side to ensure that all voices in the House are heard and views recorded. In particular, I extend my best wishes to the Leader and Eamonn McCormack, who does a great amount of work behind the scenes to ensure the House operates in smooth manner. This is recognised by all parties. It is important at this time of the year that people spend time at home with their families and I wish everyone a very peaceful and happy Christmas and a good break in the Christmas spirit so that when we return in January we are ready for the next spat and beyond.</P>
      <P>We are grateful that the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is not to be guillotined as it was in the other House yesterday. Deputies did not have the chance to deal with any of the amendments tabled. We are also grateful that Second Stage is to be taken separately from Committee Stage to ensure the Minister hears our views.</P>
      <P>I must make one political point, however. We were told that the former Minister for Health and Children did not know about the potential problems that had arisen as a result of the overcharging fiasco from the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001. Now we have documentary evidence that this time last year the then Minister for Health and Children met Ministers of State to discuss the issue. With a staff of 400 in the Department, one might have thought that the matter would have been raised. In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, she at least responded when the leader of my party, Deputy Kenny, raised the matter in the other House two months ago. However, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has been politically negligent in the way in which he has dealt with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This would be more appropriate during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We now have documentary evidence that the Minister knew of the problem in 2001 and last year, yet he sat on the issue and did nothing. It is a shameful situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with the tributes paid to the Cathaoirleach and the other officers of the House.

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader in particular for the style and panache with which she has conducted the affairs of the House. It is quite unusual that, although she is plainly a party person &mdash; more power to her &mdash; she has defended the interests of the House when necessary, something that we welcome on all sides. Where would we be without Deirdre Lane and Jody Blake, who we are delighted to have back with us and restored to health? The final person I would like to mention is the apparently sole surviving representative of the media in the Press Gallery, Jimmy Walsh. The rest of the print media seems to have abandoned us, although we do appear in &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of the so-called &ldquo;Colombia three&rdquo;. There are concerns about the judicial process in Colombia. In particular, although I have nothing in common with those people, Ms Sheila Maguire of the Irish embassy in Mexico said that there was evidence, including very significant testimony from Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, that gave one of their number, Mr. Connolly, a clear alibi. However, I was astonished to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, say not once but several times last night that the defendants had been absolutely exonerated in their first trial. That is not true, since they were found guilty of travelling on false passports, and the shrill voices of people such as Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane instructing the Irish Government of what it must do are no help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be seeking a debate on this matter early on Tuesday morning. It is important that we record the established facts, the first being that they were travelling on false passports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator seeks a debate, we cannot have one now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, this is a trailer. They were in an area controlled by very dangerous people and gave the apparently flippant excuse that they were bird-watching. I wonder whether we might have a little more information. Were they members of the Irish Wild Bird Conservancy before they left this country? We know that one of the men has a serious conviction for bombing. We must be careful and need not interfere directly in the justice system of another country or claim that people have been absolutely exonerated when they have not. We must keep the shrill voices that I mentioned from piping up.</P>
      <P>I wish everyone a happy Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the other Members in wishing the Cathaoirleach and his staff a happy Christmas and a good new year. It has been an interesting session in some ways. The Leader has been extremely successful in streamlining the processes of the House. We have managed to separate the Second Stage from the Committee and <Col N="2591"/>Remaining Stages of Bills, something that did not always happen previously and does not always happen in the other House. That must be good for the quality of debate here. The Leader has also been very successful in procuring the regular attendance of senior Ministers, who seem to spend a little longer in the House than they might have done in the past. It is all to the good and contributes to the standing of the House. Like other Senators, I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach, Jody Blake, Deirdre Lane and Eamonn<?oasys [jy?>McCormack. We should also include Jimmy Walsh, who is out there somewhere in the ether.</P>
      <P>I will not detain the House unduly on the issue that Senator Norris raised. However, it is important, and we should not ignore it this morning. I have nothing in common with those men in Colombia. I do not believe that they were there to go bird-watching and have no doubt that they were there for less than reputable reasons. However, it is important that people such as I, who have nothing in common with them politically, say this. There is a serious onus on the Colombian authorities to prove that they were guilty of the charges made against them. I do not believe that they have discharged that. That, ultimately, is the test of democracy and the test of the legal system. The men had an open trial before a judge, of which many of us were sceptical, conducted under the glare of the international media, as a result of which they were found guilty on one charge and not guilty on others. However, that has been superseded by a process which has been largely secret and not open in any way to public scrutiny. Since these people are our citizens, we have to say that is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and everybody in the House a very happy Christmas. I thank the Cathaoirleach for the way he has conducted the proceedings during the term. He has always been good humoured and even-handed and we appreciate that.</P>
      <P>I also join in the tributes to the Leader for the manner in which she has led the House and brought the business before us. I link Eamonn McCormack to that tribute because he plays a critical role in all of that.</P>
      <P>I wish the usher staff under Paddy and the Captain and Superintendent and their staffs all the best for this season.</P>
      <P>One group of people missed in these tributes who do a valuable job comprises the Editor of Debates and her staff. Some of us can recall a time when it might have taken a week for the proceedings to be printed but now we have them almost instantly. There has been a huge improvement in that area, for which they deserve our congratulations.</P>
      <P>I join in the thanks extended to the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and everybody in the office. I wish to make a point which I have made on other occasions, namely, that the workload seems to be <Col N="2592"/>increasing all the time, particularly that of the Clerk who is involved in several commissions, committees and so on. Something needs to be considered in terms of back-up support. It is unreasonable to expect the staff to deal with amendments into the middle of the night and early the following morning. They should be given the necessary resources to ease that burden somewhat. Perhaps the other body on which the Clerk of the D&aacute;il serves might examine that aspect.</P>
      <P>I wish everybody a very happy, peaceful and enjoyable Christmas and hope we come back refreshed for the battle in the new year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue raised by Senators Norris and McDowell, one has to ask why people would go to a very dangerous country, travelling on false passports. It is reasonable to wonder what brought these people to that country. In those &mdash; or in any &mdash; circumstances it is a long-standing and good practice that countries do not interfere with the judicial processes in other countries, however, much we might feel they are defective. In countries where there is imminent danger to the state, judicial procedures have been adopted, as they were in this State, to protect the state. It is only when one sees that there is a commitment to democracy that those judicial procedures, or the burden of them, are lessened. There are some aspects of that which we need to consider. If people were to expect intervention and clemency, one would expect they would give themselves up to the authorities. These are matters that could be debated. Perhaps Senator Norris and I can go to some hostelry locally next Tuesday morning and debate these issues more fully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with the tributes to the Cathaoirleach, Deirdre Lane, all the staff and to Paddy Behan who is something of a guardian angel, as has been said.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo; comments about when the former Minister had knowledge of the overcharging fiasco.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Colombia three, it is not up to us to ask questions post the events. It was a matter to be proven and established in court. None of us, based on our system, believes anything was proven other than the passports issue. Naturally, as citizens of this country, we must have a concern for those involved and about the judicial system in that country. However, that is a matter for the Government and Ministers to deal with.</P>
      <P>We only heard this morning that the IDA had its most successful year ever, which we are all delighted to note, and also that next year will possibly be an even better year for it. In light of that, I call for a debate early in the new session <Col N="2593"/>to discuss in particular how it will address the blackspots in the country.</P>
      <P>I was surprised at the Leader&rsquo;s use of the term &ldquo;spats&rdquo; because I do not believe I have ever had a spat with anybody in here and I am sure Members would agree that I never had a spat with the Leader.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand the surprise and the concern which has been expressed by many commentators on the plight of the three Irish citizens in Colombia. I have come to the conclusion that what we are currently witnessing is a legal fiasco, masquerading as justice. It is a political circus. There are agendas operating here which have nothing to do with the court case. The political tentacles of this case extend far outside Colombia. One has only to listen to the views of Mr. Paisley junior last night and again today to realise the significance of what is happening. I welcome the views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is important for us now in Ireland is not to be distracted by peripheral issues but to consider the central issue, namely, the right of our citizens any place in the world to expect the protection of the State. Nobody can ague against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the views expressed by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, which I will not repeat. I was disappointed to read in at least one of the national newspapers that in the saga of overcharging by the banks another new chapter has been added. The charge applicable to transactions at convenience ATMs in the department stores and supermarkets is five or six times the charge normally applicable to those at standard ATMs. This is another clear example of the way the financial institutions here are thumbing their noses at the citizens of this country. I ask our spokesperson on finance, Senator Mansergh, and the Leader, to exhort the Minister responsible to come to the House to outline proposals on what he will do to address this outrageous new development in banking circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the good wishes extended to the staff of the Houses and in particular to Mr. Paddy Behan who is retiring. I thank him for the courtesy he extended to me in my short time here, especially in arranging <Col N="2594"/>visits by school groups etc. He was always calm especially when I brought in a group on very busy day. That was much appreciated. I wish him and his family every success on his retirement.</P>
      <P>I also have some concerns in regard to the so-called Colombia three. That their whereabouts are not even known yet is a cause of grave concern. It is important that justice is seen to be done correctly. Perhaps it would be opportune for all concerned to have a debate on this issue in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for having arranged a debate on Northern Ireland at such short notice and for having arranged for the Taoiseach to come to the House. I hope we might have a longer debate on that subject in the new year.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on the telecommunications industry in the new year. It is important that we examine all the telephone charges and so on. I say this in light of the success of myself and Senator McHugh in getting O2 to reduce its running charges and we hope that Vodafone will follow suit. It is bad enough to get a message on one&rsquo;s telephone that one is still in the United Kingdom but to be charged double for it is not very nice.</P>
      <P>I wish Paddy Behan all the best. One of the reasons he is such a fine person is because his mother came from Glenfinn.</P>
      <P>In many parts of the world today, it is no longer politically correct to wish somebody a happy Christmas. At this time of year, we need to remind ourselves that we are celebrating the birth of our saviour. In that spirit, I wish each and every one here a happy and a holy Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Lydon on the need for a debate on the broader telecommunications issue. One of the aspects I would like addressed is that of mobile telephone charges. By European or international standards the Irish consumer is paying a high premium rate for mobile telephone use and the matter needs investigation.</P>
      <P>In a similar vein, I raised some weeks ago the issue of the subtitling of television programmes and asked the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. My point was that people who suffer hearing loss are able to enjoy television with the benefit of subtitling but, unfortunately, the quality of subtitling on news and current affairs programmes on our public service broadcaster, RTE, is inadequate. I appreciate that the service costs money but those who are hard of hearing should not be treated as second class citizens. The Leader should use her influence to push for increased funding to improve the level of subtitling.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise an issue I have raised several times, that of the serious crisis involving great human suffering in Darfur, Sudan. It is an international crisis which is not getting the attention it deserves. The rate <Col N="2595"/>of killing and displacement of people and the misery in that country would make the situation in Iraq look like a picnic. However, because of the different politics involved, it is not getting the necessary attention in the Oireachtas or the broader political field. An international response is required. The efforts of the United Nations to date have been insufficient and the scale of suffering is deeply worrying and profound. It is important we would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to maintain pressure on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the courtesy you have extended over the past year and also thank the staff of the Houses. I extend good wishes to all.</P>
      <P>When matters are clearer and the dust has settled on events in Colombia, and people have had the opportunity to read whatever judgement might have been handed down, it would be appropriate if the Leader could arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to House, perhaps early in the new year. Like other Members, I remain entirely unconvinced regarding the reasons these men gave for their presence in Colombia. However, that should not blind us to the fact that, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated, where Irish citizens are involved, there is a certain responsibility for seeing that standards of law are maintained.</P>
      <P>It seems the men were convicted of a relatively minor offence and on appeal have been given a sentence which was entirely disproportionate. We would object if under Irish law people were sentenced for the graver offence which could not be proved rather than sentenced for the lesser offence which could be proved. There is an issue to be considered and we should do this at calmer time, when events unfold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to schedule early in the new year the promised debate on the promotion of the Irish language. We can consider this matter and also how we can promote Irish culture in general. On that note, all Members will join with me in wishing my native city, Cork, all the best when it kicks off its European capital of culture term in January.</P>

	<P>It is a great honour for the city and the country and I hope we will row in behind that effort in the interests of promoting Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes that we should not get too exercised over the issue of the Supreme Court decision in Colombia because I have a deep suspicion it will be an academic exercise. However, we await developments and if there is a need for a debate in the new year, we can have it then.</P>
      <P>We should have a debate early in the new session on the issue of toll roads, particularly the <Col N="2596"/>M50. A very bad deal was struck with NTR by the Government and the State. The toll contract is a cash cow and the consumer is not getting a good deal. While we know of the 20% increases, the issue is not so much the direct cost but the latent cost of transport being significantly delayed on the M50 because the toll booth is almost like putting a gate across a main artery. It is fine<?oasys [jy?>to place toll booths on long, perhaps 50 km, stretches of motorway. However, to place them on a short stretch around the city is wrong. We are making a similar mistake with the bypass in Waterford. This policy will turn out to be counterproductive to the objective of investing millions of euro in road networks.</P>
      <P>I am prompted to raise a further issue by Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio show yesterday when he<?oasys [jy?>interviewed the granddaughter of Thomas<?oasys [jy?>MacDonagh. It caused me to reflect on the manner in which his family feel disenchanted that the State does not give due recognition to the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation. This arises in the context of the demolition of the tower blocks at Ballymun, which commemorated the names of the seven signatories of the proclamation. The Leader might arrange a debate in the new year during which we could discuss this issue and make appropriate suggestions as to what might be done to remedy this lack of recognition. For any self-respecting republic to turn its back on its founding fathers would be a sad development.</P>
      <P>We need to address this. The 75th anniversary of 1916 was a poor show and it is important we do not allow this to recur for the centenary. Some may object to this on the grounds that it offends certain sensitivities among the Unionist population. However, as we mature in politics on the island, it is up to us to have respect for Unionist traditions and for the more enlightened members of the Unionist community to also have respect for ours.</P>
      <P>I join in the justified tributes to Paddy Behan. I have always found him an absolute gentleman, as have other speakers. I join with you, a Chathaoirligh, in wishing the compliments of the season to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to mix good wishes with business but I thank all Members for their kind words. Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, raised an issue which was worth airing, and I am sure the Senator will do as he says. Senator Coghlan called for a debate on the IDA, particularly industrial blackspots.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris, Dardis, McDowell and others raised the matter of the Colombia three, on which Members have different points of view. The severity of the sentence was a great surprise, as was the dichotomy between what happened and what is now happening. Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke on the legal fiasco which is the outcome of the case. The three men are Irish citizens and everybody wishes to see proper justice done. What we do not want is the taking up of the case in a purely partisan manner by different political <Col N="2597"/>groupings, which is wrong. Such groups are seizing the opportunity to bend the facts to suit their own agendas, and Members have grave reservations about this.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn referred to a new saga of overcharging in regard to ATMs. IFSRA is charged with investigating such matters and I will bring it to its attention, although I am sure it knows of the issue. Senator Browne expressed his good wishes. Senator Lydon called for a debate on the telecommunications issue. Senator Bradford raised the matters of mobile telephone charges and the subtitling of television programmes. We have already put something in train on that matter but I do not know what will be the outcome. Senator Bradford also raised the question of what is happening in Darfur, Sudan. He is very involved in dealing with such issues as a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the Colombia Three, while Senator Minihan sought a debate on the Irish language in the New Year. Senator Jim Walsh referred to toll roads. Senator Bohan raised this matter previously in the House and other Members took it up subsequently. I have received a plethora of e-mails about it. The M50 is a road of misery. Nobody would mind the charges if they could just pay the money and continue driving but the delays are unacceptable. The road was described vividly in an e-mail I received this morning as a road of misery. People depend on the M50 to get to work, yet they are delayed morning and evening by queues at toll booths. Back in 1987, a very bad arrangement was made at the beginning. There was no money around for anything at that time but the M50 is now a cash cow which shows no sign of drying up. It is time the Government took up this matter.</P>
      <P>While I did not hear Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; radio programme yesterday, another issue was raised on the show which was cut off with great alacrity. I will not go into that because it was most inappropriate. There was also an interview with the granddaughter of Thomas MacDonagh who discussed how we should finally remember the founding fathers and their contribution to the State. It would be an interesting idea to have such a debate in the House if we could manage it. I will inquire as to how best such a debate could be arranged.</P>
      <P>When I thanked everyone earlier, I omitted Mr. Jimmy Walsh who is ever present. Mr. Walsh is very industrious in reporting Seanad debates. I also wish to thank RTE for broadcasting &ldquo;Oireachtas Report.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>I am pleased to explain this Bill to the House. In this debate, we must address important issues with clarity, purpose and fairness. People in long-term care, and their families, should have clarity about how care will be provided and paid for. It is also important that any charges made by the State are on a fully legal basis.</P>

	<P>I wish to deal with three areas &mdash; first, the provisions of the Bill; second, the scheme of repayments the Government will put in place; and third, the issues arising from the handling of this question within the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Just as the T&aacute;naiste placed on the record of the Lower House yesterday a number of documents as an annex to her prepared remarks, I am also placing on the record of this House today the same documents as an annex to my remarks. I am putting before the House all the facts of which I am aware. This the only way each of us can form clear and fair assessments.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a legal framework for the charging of patients in long-term care in health board institutions and publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes. The Bill will establish a sound legal basis for the long established practice of health boards in charging for the costs of maintenance in institutions providing long-term care.</P>
      <P>Most people accept that it is fair and reasonable that those who can afford to contribute to the cost of their long stay care should do so. This has been implemented by successive Governments and by Ministers for Health from all parties in Government since 1954.</P>
      <P>The charges raised are used to support the provision of care for those in long-term residential care. These charges currently generate approximately &euro;100 million in revenue for health boards each year. The cost of long-term care, even of the shelter and maintenance part, is clearly more than this amount. There is no doubt that the loss of this income would have an adverse effect on our ability to provide the health and caring services our population needs.</P>
      <P>I am attaching as one of the annexed documents a brief background note on the history of <Col N="2599"/>the legislative basis on which charges have been raised up to now. Similar information is found in the report of the Secretary General of my Department, prepared at the request of the T&aacute;naiste for the Government meeting on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The essential point is that the basis for charges made since the McInerney Supreme Court judgment of 1976 arose from a circular issued by the Department of Health to individual health boards. This circular, which is included in the annexed documentation, authorised a practice by which the chief executive officer of a health board could regard patients as not meeting the criteria for full eligibility while being maintained in long-term care, on the basis that the necessary general practitioner and surgical services were being provided for them.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal of medical cards and full eligibility in this way was taken to enable a charge for inpatient services to be raised under the 1976 regulations, which provided for charging for persons other than those with full eligibility.</P>
      <P>The extension, in 2001, of full eligibility to all persons over 70 years of age, irrespective of means, was not the reason the practice of charging in this way was found to be without a sound legal basis. The flawed basis for charges for anyone with full eligibility goes back to the 1976 circular which continued to be implemented after the 2001 decision. I will return later to developments since 2002 on how the legal issues around this were handled when I address departmental management issues.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the scope and principal provisions of the Bill. The Bill provides for an amendment to section 53 of the Health Act 1970 as follows: To replace the existing enabling provision in sub-section (2) which provides the Minister with discretionary power to make regulations, by a provision which requires the Minister to make regulations in order to impose charges in relation to all persons, namely, those with full and limited eligibility; to insert a new sub-section (3) which specifies categories of person exempted from charges imposed under sub-section (2); to insert a new sub-section (4) which empowers the chief executive officer of a health board to reduce or waive a charge, having regard to the financial circumstances of the person and with a view to avoiding undue financial hardship for that person. It is intended that the regulations will impose a maximum weekly charge of &euro;120, which approximates to 80% of the weekly rate of the maximum level of non-contributory old age pension. The regulations will also make clear that individuals are to retain a minimum amount of pocket money of &euro;35 per week; to insert a new sub-section (5) to provide, among other things, that charges levied under section 53 of the 1970 Health Act, prior to 14 December 2004, are and always have been lawful. My Department is satisfied, in light of legal advice available to it, that it is constitutional and in accordance with the Euro<Col N="2600"/>pean Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Department has received advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which includes the opinion of Dr. Gerard Hogan SC, a leading expert in Irish constitutional law; to insert a new sub-section (6) that the retrospective regularisation provision of the new sub-section (5) does not apply in the case of a charge which is the subject of civil proceedings instituted on or before 14 December 2004 for the recovery of the relevant charge; to insert a new sub-section (7) to provide that the provisions of the new subsection (5) do not affect any other ground which may be raised in civil proceedings to debar the recovery of the relevant charge; to insert a new sub-section (8) to make it clear that any current regulations in force remain in force. This is to make it clear that the Bill does not interfere with other existing regulations; to insert a new sub-section (9) to provide that the charges shall only apply for in-patient services after a period of 30 days or periods aggregating 30 days within the previous 12 months. The new sub-section (9) also limits the weekly charge to an amount that does not exceed 80% of the maximum of the weekly rate of old age (non-contributory) pension; to insert a new sub-section (10) to clarify that the period of 30 days referred to in subsection (9) begins to run immediately the person concerned is provided with inpatient services; and to insert a new sub-section (11) to define &ldquo;inpatient services&rdquo; for the purpose of charges made.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill will implement the Government&rsquo;s policy which, in summary, is as follows: It is reasonable that charges should be made; charges must be on a sound legal basis; and clarity must be brought to charges made in the past so as to avoid needless litigation and potentially large instability in health care funding.</P>
      <P>As indicated by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday, and as I have reiterated at the beginning of my contribution today, where mistakes are made, they should be recognised and there should be redress if at all possible. The Government recognises that a mistake on the legal basis for charges has been made for 28 years. Notwithstanding the fact that the policy had consistent support and that persons benefited from their payment, the Government believes that some repayment should be made because a mistake was made.</P>
      <P>It is clearly beyond our financial and administrative ability to repay all charges since 1976. We have decided, therefore, by way of a goodwill gesture to make repayments to people with full eligibility who have paid charges to date. I expect that approximately 20,000 people will benefit from this repayment. Each person will receive a repayment of up to &euro;2,000. These payments will be made automatically, where possible, and as soon as possible in the new year. We will also advertise to allow persons to apply for this payment. This is to ensure that no person who has made payments is left out or is unduly delayed in receiving payment. For example, there may be those who previously had been in long-term care but have <Col N="2601"/>since left or moved to another setting and records may in some cases not be as readily available as is normally the case.</P>
      <P>The Government believes this is a reasonable and fair way to recognise that a mistake was made. Those now in long-term care will benefit directly and exclusively. Administrative and legal costs will not absorb any part of the repayment which will be done speedily and fairly.</P>
      <P>I will now address how this issue was handled at various times since 2002 by my Department and in its work with health boards. At the end of 2002, the South Eastern Health Board, in the context of a number of claims about charges by and against the board, obtained legal advice on a range of issues related to long-stay care in both public institutions and private nursing homes. An extract from the legal advice was handed to the Department at a meeting with the South Eastern Health Board on 11 March 2003. I am informed that the broad content of the advice was also made known by the South Eastern Health Board to the chief executive officers of the other health boards.</P>
      <P>The relevant aspects of this advice were considered within the Department over the following months. However, a decision was not made during this period. The charges for long-term stays in public institutions were discussed in some detail at the end of year review meeting between the Department&rsquo;s senior management and the chief executive officers of the health boards on 16 December 2003. I am laying the minutes of that meeting before the House. The meeting concluded that it would be necessary for the Department to obtain a definitive legal assessment as the first step in drawing up legislation on eligibility and charges. Arising from that meeting, a small group was convened within the Department to prepare a position paper on the legal issues surrounding charges for long-stay patients in public institutions. This position paper was drawn up at the end of January of this year, as was a letter to the Office of the Attorney General requesting legal advice signed by the Secretary General. Unfortunately, this letter was not sent at that time.</P>
      <P>Following questions on the issue from Deputies Kenny and Perry in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere last October, the T&aacute;naiste immediately sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. The legal advice provided by the Attorney General on 5 November made it clear to her that new primary legislation would be required urgently to underpin a policy that persons can be required to contribute to their costs of maintenance, namely, shelter, food, bed and clothing, in a public institution, or a contract bed in a private setting.</P>
      <P>In light of that advice, work began immediately in the Department on the preparation of the necessary legislation. The T&aacute;naiste received further advice on 8 December from the Attorney General on legal problems arising out of the continuance of such charges. On foot of that advice, a letter was issued on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s instructions <Col N="2602"/>to the chief executive officers of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority asking them to immediately cease making such charges, pending the introduction of amending legislation. The health boards confirmed last Friday, 10 December, that they had taken the necessary steps to do so. Drafting of the legislation continued between the Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, and was completed so that the T&aacute;naiste was in a position to bring a memorandum to Government this Tuesday, 14 December.</P>
      <P>These are all the facts of which I am aware which have led to today&rsquo;s debate. The T&aacute;naiste made clear in the D&aacute;il yesterday that one of her immediate objectives was to place on record all the facts she knew. As regards requests for copies of the relevant legal advice to be made available, it remains the long-standing policy of Departments not to release legal advice as this can be prejudicial to the State&rsquo;s ability to defend litigation in the courts.</P>
      <P>It is clear that serious issues arise from the manner in which this important legal issue was handled in the Department of Health and Children. The Government proposes to deal with the charges by new law and by making <i>ex gratia</i> repayments. There is also a responsibility on us to deal with public management and administration issues. The T&aacute;naiste has asked Mr. John Travers, a retired head of Forf&aacute;s with a distinguished career in the public service, to examine the management of this issue in the Department and the reasons the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice was not sought at the earliest possible time. The T&aacute;naiste will ask him to identify lessons that can be learned and applied from these events, in the interests of more effective public administration in the Department of Health and Children and elsewhere. She intends to give him the greatest latitude possible for recommendations in this regard and expects to receive his report by 1 March 2005. The T&aacute;naiste had further stated that she will publish this report.</P>
      <P>In the D&aacute;il yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste indicated that she is not interested in blame but rather only in achieving excellence in public administration in the interests of patients, the public and staff. There is every reason for the Department of Health and Children to strive for and achieve excellence, particularly at this time of change when its role will be more focused on policy, legislation and evaluation. We look forward to this report helping us to achieve that aim.</P>
      <P>This legislation will bring clarity to an area which has not been operating on a sound basis for almost three decades. This is a genuine attempt to correct that flaw so that charges for long-term care will now have a sound legal basis. This Bill will ensure that the income from charges will continue to support the provision of quality services to those in long-term care.</P>
      <P>If we do not allow this funding to be retained, the loss of resources for the health service is estimated to be approximately &euro;8 million to &euro;10 mil<Col N="2603"/>lion per month. It has been accepted that these charges, as contributions to the cost of care, are fair and reasonable. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>The documents annexed to my speech include a background note on the history of the legal basis for charges; a Department of Health circular dated 1976; a report of the Secretary General dated 13 December 2004; and the minutes of a meeting between the Department of Health and Children and the chief executive officers which took place on 16 December 2003. I apologised in respect of my attendance at that meeting.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House but it is unfortunate that the House is debating this Bill. Last September we were treated to the farcical illusions of Fianna F&aacute;il suddenly rediscovering its soul as a sharing and caring Government and party of the people.</P>

	<P>The party was massacred in the local and European elections. That facade has certainly been blown off by this draconian measure. The Government is rushing through this legislation so that it can begin charging old-age pensioners in Christmas week. Scrooge is well and truly alive in the form of this Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The manner in which the Bill is being rushed through the House is disgraceful. The blame game has begun. The only people who cannot be blamed are the pensioners over 70 or in long-term care in public nursing homes but the blame is being pointed in their direction. This is regrettable, reprehensible and despicable, especially in Christmas week and the season of so-called goodwill. The sharing and caring Government has gone and poor Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy has been forgotten. I am not too sure who is advising the Government this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It should not be forgotten that only a year ago a similar debacle occurred when the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, wanted to restrict special entitlements for widows and widowers. The Government seems to have learned nothing from that debacle either. It is very worrying to see this trend continue.</P>
      <P>I question the genuineness of the Government&rsquo;s attitude to this issue. Fine Gael has submitted a freedom of information request on this subject. This might explain the reason the T&aacute;naiste was very forthcoming in releasing documents, in particular the interesting document relating to the meeting on 16 December 2003 at <Col N="2604"/>which Ministers were present. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is now back-tracking by saying he arrived late for the meeting.</P>
      <P>Serious questions remain to be asked. What were his Ministers of State doing at the meeting? Are they talking to each other? It is a pity that the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is not present in the House. I presume he is conveniently absent. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, cannot be blamed because he did not attend the meeting and the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, has moved to a different Department. Principal officers of the Department of Health and Children attended the meeting. What lines of communication exist in the Department? There seems to be an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach to picking the nice topics and not being made aware of the bad topics. The former Minister cannot abdicate his role in that area.</P>
      <P>When Fine Gael was in Government, poor Deputy Owen as a Minister was blamed for everything by Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue who was then Opposition spokesman for justice. He gave the impression that the Minister was personally liable for all criminal activity. When Fianna F&aacute;il is in Government it conveniently forgets and moves away from terms such as &ldquo;collective responsibility&rdquo; and the concept of a Minister being responsible for his or her Department.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting the Government&rsquo;s recent acknowledgement that it has failed completely in the provision of medical cards. There are now 200,000 fewer medical card holders than in 1997. The Minister has introduced a new system of GP-only medical cards but this is only a short-term solution. It will not work out in the long term and must be reconsidered. The Minister has not clarified whether these recipients will progress onto full medical card cover over a period of time. These new cards have been described as &ldquo;half medical cards&rdquo; but they are less than that. Those in possession of a GP-only card will lose out on free prescriptions and free access to inpatient and outpatient facilities and orthodontic and optical services. They will lose other benefits available to the holders of full medical cards, such as the exemption for State examination fees. The Government&rsquo;s record in this area in the last year is atrocious.</P>
      <P>By 2036, when most of us will no longer be involved in politics, almost one fifth of the population, or 1 million out of 5 million, will be over 65 years of age. The Government has not inspired confidence that it will initiate steps to provide for the care of the elderly in the long term. Almost 30 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that medical card holders were entitled to free inpatient care, including in nursing homes. In 2001, the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, initiated a scheme to give medical cards to all over 70 years of age. He did not do his homework, underestimated the number of people involved and did not consult widely enough. The deal was apparently done at the 11th hour.</P><Col N="2605"/>
      <P>We are now seeing the results. An interesting aspect of this is that State subvention of nursing homes has gone from &euro;15 million to &euro;115 million in a short number of years. This scheme was a pre-election gimmick in 2001. The Cabinet, including the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, should have seen the implications of this measure. The T&aacute;naiste cannot point the finger of blame at the Minister, Deputy Martin, and walk away. That is disingenuous in the extreme.</P>
      <P>Apparently, the Department first became aware of possible legal difficulties in 2002. However, the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation, INHO, claims the Department sought legal advice on the legality of the nursing home patient charges in 2001. Why has there been a three-year delay in this matter? In March 2003, the South Eastern Health Board gave the Department legal advice that the practice of charging medical card holders for nursing home care may have been legally unsafe. That health board stopped charging two nursing home residents on foot of complaints they made to the Office of the Ombudsman. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this week indicated that health boards did not charge pensioners who made complaints. Those who were able to speak up for themselves did not pay the charges while the weakest and most vulnerable members of society, who could not defend their rights, were obliged to make such payments. This is shocking. I hope never to see such a situation arise again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P>As my colleague, Senator Bradford, has said and as I have learned in my two and a half years in the House, the world began in 1997. Senator Mansergh tells us so repeatedly. This is what we have learnt. Every utterance by Fianna F&aacute;il Members begins with the phrase, &ldquo;Since 1997&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State&rsquo;s aunt will have some stories for which to answer when she speaks.</P>
      <P>The blame game has begun. The lack of accountability in this area is appalling. The Minister has released minutes of the meeting at which this issue was discussed but I contend that this is a consequence of Fine Gael&rsquo;s submission under the freedom of information legislation. There is no evidence of a rush to transparency. This meeting was attended by Ministers of State in the Department and the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, although he arrived late.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2606"/>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>He was probably getting his photograph taken that morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure he received and read the minutes of the meeting. There is no doubt there was poor management. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, allowed that situation to arise and he was the person with ultimate control of the Department. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has admitted that the letter that should have been received by the Attorney General last year was not sent. Why was this letter not sent?</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Mr. John Travers, the distinguished former chief executive officer of Forf&aacute;s, will investigate the management of this issue by the Department. I hope that civil servants are not scapegoated, as is usual in politics. The Minister should take responsibility, as happens in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State acknowledged in his speech that the &euro;2,000 <i>ex gratia</i> payment could be challenged in the courts. The payment is fine but all bets will be off if somebody is unhappy with it and makes the case in court that it is insufficient to compensate for the payments he or she has made. This is a dangerous scenario. There seems to be great uncertainty among people who have failed to achieve admission to a public nursing home for themselves or their relatives. As a last resort, such people had to take the option of private nursing home care. This issue is the subject of a legal case and the Minister of State is far better acquainted with the legal situation than I am. However, there may well be implications if that court case is successful in that people might then be entitled to the difference between what they paid for private nursing home care and what they would have paid for public care. The issue may be more significant than we have imagined.</P>
      <P>Nobody has any difficulty with people paying their way for nursing home care. However, the issue is that if someone gets money illegally from another party, there is no choice but to repay that money. It is as clear as that. There can be no equivocation. If I were to take money from Senator Glynn to which I was not entitled, I would return it without hesitation. I hope I would do so at least. The Government does not seem to acknowledge this principle. It is shocking that this legislation is being pushed through so that it can charge the old age pensioners involved in Christmas week. In her speech yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste seemed to place the blame somewhat on the people involved. Her concern was that if the situation continued, there would be a cost to the State which would impact on other services. This is regrettable. The people requiring nursing home care are not blame.</P>
      <P>We are sure to see more articles on this issue in the newspapers over the weekend. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is under siege, whether correctly or incorrectly. The roles could be reversed next week, however, because an interesting case will <Col N="2607"/>be heard involving a challenge to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. If that case is successful, the Minister, Deputy Martin, may be able to dig up some files in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Environment that have implications for the T&aacute;naiste. There may be an interesting Christmas period ahead.</P>
      <P>The measures announced by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday in the D&aacute;il were shocking. Some 80% of an individual&rsquo;s pension will be retained for the provision of nursing home care, leaving him or her approximately &euro;35 per week. A caller to &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; yesterday pointed out what this would mean for pensioners. An allowance of &euro;5 per day is laughable. If a pensioner in this situation wishes to buy a newspaper every day and one on Sunday, it will cost approximately &euro;9. The purchase of such items as toiletries and other everyday living expenses will be difficult. They will be unable to purchase gifts for grandchildren, smoke even ten or 20 cigarettes per week or have a few drinks.</P>
      <P>Pensioners in long-stay nursing home care should receive a minimum of &euro;50 per week. Pensioners built this country and should not be treated with contempt. One can tell a lot about a society by its treatment of older people. I am appalled by many of the measures in this Bill and by the reaction of the Government to the situation. The actions it is taking to correct it are shocking. The Government is penalising those who do not deserve it. A survey of the period 1990 to 2000 indicated that 38% of pensioners lived in the bottom 20% of households in income terms. I am sure these figures have been updated since then but they provide food for thought. It is amazing that the T&aacute;naiste has lectured all other institutions, from the insurance bodies to banking institutions etc., about overcharging. However, when faced with a clear issue of overcharging by the Department of Health and Children she does the opposite to what she has preached in recent years.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Recent newspaper headlines about the Government&rsquo;s meanness and incompetence are deserved. It was really shocking that the Government had planned to make people complete application forms to claim back the money they were rightly due. Thank God that due to the persistence of Deputy Kenny and other Fine Gael Members, this plan was scrapped and at least now people will get it automatically. I welcome the fact that advertisements will be placed in the newspapers to rectify the matter and encourage people to come forward. However, I wonder whether it will stop there.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has cited history and of course Fianna F&aacute;il is very good at re-writing history. He has blamed legislation going back over 30 years, which would obviously involve Labour and Fine Gael Ministers during that time. If the old legislation was a problem, why was the 2001 <Col N="2608"/>legislation approved? The Government cannot answer that question.</P>
      <P>I hope I never have to deal with such an issue as this again. The treatment of old-age pensioners is disgraceful. It was clear from the legislation that health boards were not legally entitled to reduce the full eligibility of people over 70 or legally seek a contribution from them. Had this matter not been pursued in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Kenny, when would the Department have taken action on the matter? Are other similar stories waiting to be uncovered in the Department? It is completely unacceptable that the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, did not read an 80-page document giving legal opinion on the issue. What steps will be taken to ensure this will not happen under the watch of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney?</P>
      <P>I resent the fact that we have been forced to sit an extra day this week to take legislation correcting a mistake made by the Government, who will now seek to penalise those people even further in Christmas week. The timing is all wrong and the image of a sharing and caring Government is truly dead, like the ghost of Christmas past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Convenient amnesia is alive and well and living in Fine Gael. It is important to remember that whatever we do in terms of introducing legislation must be fair and equitable. I do not believe the blame game will do much good. However, we must accept that charging patients in long-stay institutions has been ongoing for many years. The Government is introducing this legislation because it is essential that any charges that may be made have a sound legal basis. It is especially important for the State to ensure that the charges and taxes it imposes are clearly legal, whether for health or any other services.</P>
      <P>The legal issue relates to charges made towards the cost of shelter and maintenance for people in long-term care in public institutions, county homes, district hospitals, welfare homes, community nursing units, psychiatric hospitals and publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes. For an elderly person on a basic State pension this comes to approximately &euro;120 per week. We need to remember and appreciate what a pension or a social welfare payment is. It is unreasonable and hypocritical of those on the other side of the House to claim that the State should pay a pension as well as keeping them in a long-term institution.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the shelter and maintenance scheme this has being ongoing for years. Senator Browne is correct in pointing out that our population is ageing. As we are living longer and families are getting smaller, it is axiomatic that the number of older persons in society will be on the increase. To address this matter the Govern<Col N="2609"/>ment introduced the national pension reserve fund.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne referred to Scrooge. When his party had the opportunity in a flourishing economy, it made Scrooge look like a benevolent Santa Claus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>By what action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The rainbow coalition Government gave the old-age pensioners only &pound;7, approximately &euro;9, in three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We had no stealth taxes as we do now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts speak for themselves. The Senator referred to medical cards. I remind him that a medical card is an income-related facility. The many thousands of people who have entered the workforce have gone outside the terms of eligibility. Fine Gael chided the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children for changes to the medical card scheme. However, this is a very important step. We all know that general practitioner charges have significantly increased. I appreciate that general practitioners have costs including those for staff, which have increased.</P>
      <P>Geriatric medicine is a very important specialty. The Midland Health Board employs a geriatrician at the general hospital, who does excellent work. The medicine pertaining to health difficulties for the aged is a specialty all of its own.</P>
      <P>For 50 years people in long-term care have paid towards the cost of shelter and maintenance. It was provided for under the 1954 regulations, amended in 1965 and again under the Health Act 1970 and the 1976 regulations. Senator Browne&rsquo;s party was in Government in that year. People accept it is reasonable and fair that a contribution should be made towards living costs, in other words the non-medical expenses of shelter and maintenance. It should be noted that people receive their pension from the State to meet living expenses. When people go into long-term care, these expenses are taken care of. Successive Governments have implemented this policy and provided for new charges from time to time. Governments involving my party and others have done this.</P>
      <P>For many years I worked in a caring profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I can speak with experience and knowledge. I found it reprehensible that on the death of a patient who had not seen a visitor for years, when the relatives could be located the first question they would ask was whether the deceased left any money. It was a nauseating situation, which I encountered far too often for my liking. I am sure Deputies Finneran and Connolly from the other House would tell similar stories. It is not a nice thing to say about a so-called Christian society.</P><Col N="2610"/>
      <P>Money was taken from the income of such patients to ensure they had extra comforts. It must be borne in mind that the additional needs of patients in long-stay institutions would vary. Some patients would not spend a penny from one year to the next. Other patients had additional needs and liked to take a drink or a cigarette or have a bet on a horse. We are not comparing like with like. All right-thinking Members of both Houses would accept that we should not pay people an income and also take care of them. It is not fair or acceptable. It never was the case and to claim so is to make a nonsense of the taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
      <P>For the long-term care of people the concept of national pension reserve fund is very important. It is all about planning for the future. When planning for the future in the psychiatric services was introduced it had huge implications for long-stay institutions.</P>
      <P>I recall that Senator Norris and another Member of the previous Seanad tabled a motion about inappropriate bed occupancy in acute hospitals, particularly psychiatric hospitals. Many acute beds in psychiatric hospitals were used as hostel beds and long-stay psycho-geriatric patients were being cared for in psychiatric hospitals when they should have been in geriatric hospitals. The policy of planning for the future in the psychiatric services has had a major impact on the elderly. In many instances, this has been for the better.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that a mistake has been made, hence the introduction of this legislation. One recalls the saying, &ldquo;You are damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; We recognise that mistakes has been made but, as already stated, any charges imposed must have a sound legal basis. The <i>ex gratia</i> payment is being made out of a sense of moral obligation rather than on foot of a legal requirement. The Government is making a once-off goodwill gesture because we believe it is fair to make some repayments. It is anxious to bring about clarity and finality in respect of this issue. An essential part of achieving these is to make repayments. Are Members on the opposite side of the House stating that we should do nothing? In my opinion we must take action.</P>
      <P>The legislation is being put in place to ensure that charges will have a legal basis. The Bill also contains retrospective powers in respect of deeming legal the past practice of charging.</P>
      <P>Reference has already been made to the proposal to repay &euro;2,000 to people who were charged. A person charged anything less than &euro;2,000 will be refunded the actual amount charged. The scheme will cover people who are still living and who are currently receiving or who have received long-term care in the past. Payments will be made, where possible and in the majority of cases, as early as is practicable in the new year. There had been plans to advertise to allow people to apply for these payments but these have fallen by the wayside. We are all tax<Col N="2611"/>payers and if the State pays out money, it should go to the people who are entitled to it. I do not see anything wrong with that and I believe all right thinking people would agree with me.</P>
      <P>The details regarding the administration of the repayments were worked out, as a matter of urgency, by the Department of Health and Children. The new health service executive, which is taking over from the health boards on 1 January, will administer the scheme.</P>
      <P>Approximately 20,000 people, the majority of whom are elderly and who occupy long-term care places, are likely to receive the repayments. It will not be taken into account for any means test carried out by the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Health and Children, nor will it be subject to taxation.</P>
      <P>Will people in private nursing homes also obtain repayments? The repayment scheme mainly applies to people who have been in long-term care in public institutions. The only people affected in private nursing homes are those in private beds contracted by a health board. People who are in private nursing homes receiving the nursing home subvention will not be affected, nor will those in such homes whose means are over the means test limits for a subvention payment.</P>
      <P>Having discovered a legislative glitch, it is important that the Government has moved to correct it. It is also important to ensure that we cater for the needs of the elderly. A clear principle is being established in the Bill, namely, that it is not acceptable that taxpayers should pay incomes which are supposed to sustain and maintain others in the community or that they should be obliged to pay on the double if these individuals enter caring institutions. It would not be fair to expect taxpayers to do so. I may have misunderstood what was said earlier but that is the impression I obtained.</P>
      <P>As stated earlier, elderly persons in long-stay institutions have varying needs in terms of their extra comforts. Perhaps a way might be found to address those needs. I thank the Minister of State for the comments he made and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State who has acted expeditiously and provided the House with full reports. I also welcome the fact that he has published the surrounding documentation. Some of the latter is technical in nature and I do not propose to discuss it in any great detail. It is important, from the point of view of democracy, that this information has been placed before us. In providing it, the Minister of State has acted courteously, efficiently and in a manner which assists the democratic process.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn&rsquo;s speech demonstrated one of the values of the House, namely, that one can actually hear from people who have first-hand knowledge and experiences of matters of this nature. When a Member has this kind of experience, it is important to listen to his or her contribution <Col N="2612"/>with respect and to take into account what they have to say. Senator Glynn made some sensible, useful and practical points. He stated, for example, that it would be foolish for the State to give money to people which is intended to sustain them in the community and then make no attempt to ensure that they are given the dignity of making a contribution.</P>
      <P>I have, however, a number of qualms about this matter. The first of these relates to the quite substantial number of millionaires in this country who manage to pay no tax whatever.</P>
      <P>Some of the language used &mdash; even that employed by the T&aacute;naiste &mdash; in the debate on this matter has been unfortunate. I salute the T&aacute;naiste, however, because I believe she took on a poisoned chalice. I do not know anyone else who would have plumped for the Department of Health and Children. Most people would run a mile from it. The T&aacute;naiste is an efficient and clear-thinking person and it is significant that she unearthed and confronted this problem mere weeks after assuming her new position.</P>
      <P>One of the terms used previously in the debate on this matter was &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo;. Let us not use such terms in respect of the elderly because they are demeaning and patronising. When one has lived one&rsquo;s life, earned one&rsquo;s money, paid one&rsquo;s taxes &mdash; unlike our friends the millionaires &mdash; and contributed to society by raising a family or whatever, it is terrible to be told in one&rsquo;s 70s, 80s or 90s that one can have pocket money. Would it not be possible to refer to it in some other way? The Minister of State avoided using the term &ldquo;<i>ex gratia</i> payment&rdquo; but it was used in the Lower House. There is an element here of the lady of the manor handing out things from her wicker basket. Elderly people are entitled to the money they receive.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the retrospective nature of the legislation. If it was illegal to take money from these people, surely they are entitled, as of right, to full recompense. I do not believe it is correct that the legislation should have retrospective effect but, on the other hand, the sums involved would be quite huge were that not the case.</P>
      <P>There appears to have been a certain degree of co-operation in the earlier stages of the debate on this matter. Questions were asked, particularly by the Fine Gael Party, in the Lower House which helped to bring this matter to light.</P>
      <P>We need to be sensitive in terms of elderly people and their treatment. I am not too concerned about the lump sums because many of the people involved, if they are in institutional care, will not have any major use for the money. I may be wrong but that is what I believe. On the other hand, the income they are allowed to retain is important.</P>
      <P>I listened to an radio interview last night with Michael O&rsquo;Halloran, an extremely decent man who served as Lord Mayor of Dublin some years ago. I recall doing battle with him about the preservation of 18th century buildings, etc., but we <Col N="2613"/>became friends following our initial spat. During the interview he documented, as did Senator Glynn, the things people in institutional care often want or need. He stated that they might buy a daily newspaper and a Sunday newspaper, which is more expensive, a pint every second day and one packet of cigarettes per week. This would mean that they would exceed the &euro;35. There should be consultation with Mr.<?oasys [jy?>O&rsquo;Halloran and his group, the Irish Senior Citizens&rsquo; Parliament, which is non-party in nature, or Age Concern to see if a practical way of dealing with this matter can be found.</P>
      <P>The Minister now has a good bargaining chip to get facilities for the elderly. Members have said that this money was taken illegally and in some cases people&rsquo;s houses were sold. Some of these people may have felt, perhaps unrealistically, they may be able to go back to their houses. That possibility was removed because they were forced to sell them as they were taken into account in calculating how much money they had. The Minister can now bargain for expensive equipment such as hoists. Certain institutions find it difficult to get these things.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the people who work in this area. I have an aunt whom I love very much and who I looked after for a few years. She very sensibly said that she was falling over while I was in Leinster House gadding around and I might find her on the kitchen floor after a stroke one day. She went into the Alexandra Guild House, which is marvellous. The staff were pinched and squeezed by the financial constraints but they were not bleeding the old dears in the place, they were very generous in what they charged. I brought the subject to the attention of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor and the programme manager in the Department of Health and Children. I got the directors of the nursing home to come along and a sensible financial plan was worked out so they could get a subvention from central funds and, along with a financial expert, we put together a system where relatives who paid could claim tax allowances. That is one of the things of which I am proudest &mdash; that we saved that wonderful facility for old people. It was necessary, however, to give them help from outside.</P>
      <P>This is an increasing problem because the population is ageing but we prefer not to think about it. I mentioned facilities because I was contacted by a man who works near me about his mother. She is in a hospital in Dublin that I will not mention because I have not visited it and that would be unfair. She has Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and is being looked after. She is restrained and has uncontrolled bowel movements. For her dignity the family have tried to keep her wearing her own clothes. They sometimes get bags of clothes which have been left in the corner for a couple of days with bowel movements in them. That is dreadful. She has been accepted for another residential home but they cannot get the medical authorities in this other hospital to sign the form that would release her.</P><Col N="2614"/>
      <P>This is what we are talking about. I do not blame the people in this hospital, I am sure they are under-staffed, over-stressed and lacking resources. This woman is repeatedly falling. Every time her relatives visit, she is bruised. When they ask for an explanation they are told she fell or she was given a glass of whiskey for her birthday and she was not used to it and fell over. The place caring for her is not suitable. We should be able to look after our old people better.</P>
      <P>I do not envy the Government trying to untie this Gordian knot. It is right and practical, however, that it should be done. It is appropriate that relatives should have to make some contribution. They cannot grumble too much. Senator Glynn mentioned families who do not visit elderly relatives at all and then come in for the kill at the end if they think there is a pot of money. It is barbarous and I hope it does not happen too often. If the resources exist, there is a moral responsibility to look after one&rsquo;s own.</P>
      <P>This should not be treated as a political football. The situation emerged due to the questioning of the Opposition and the integrity of the Minister. It is now being faced and a practical resolution must be found. I worry about the legal effectiveness or unchallengeable nature of retrospective legislation that states that even though it was illegal to take people&rsquo;s money, they will only be given back a certain amount. We must be careful of the language of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment &mdash;&ldquo;pocket money&rdquo;. I am a mere 60 years old and if someone told me he was going to give me pocket money I would give him a clip on the ear. I imagine there are quite a few feisty old dears in residential homes across the country who would, if they could get out of their beds, give a resounding clout to anyone who used such language to them and I would support them in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Accusations have been made that the Government is rushing this legislation but those accusations are unfair. Speedy action is needed. Every week we postpone this legislation will cost the Exchequer and the Department of Health and Children &euro;2.5 million. As the T&aacute;naiste said in the other House, it would be an expensive Christmas recess were we to postpone it.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the matter is that we treat fairly and reasonably the expectation that those who can afford to contribute to their long-term care should do so, as has been the case since 1954. I pay tribute to the T&aacute;naiste for the manner in which she dealt with this. She did so speedily, openly and sensitively. Comments have been made about some of the language being used and, unfortunately, at times it is difficult to find the right words. No one has a monopoly on interest in the elderly. We all have families with elderly members and we value the way those people are treated.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste was made aware of this situation in November, sought legal advice, which she received on 8 December, and immediately set <Col N="2615"/>about taking the necessary action to correct this anomaly. Senator Browne referred to the T&aacute;naiste lecturing other institutions on overcharging and then doing the opposite in her Department. That is rich coming from a party that has had, albeit short, experience in Government but given that experience, it is aware of how responsible Governments must act. Fine Gael presided over the health service that gave us one of the greatest scandals this State has seen, the hepatitis C scandal, so it is rich that it refers to the T&aacute;naiste as insensitive. Her actions have been decisive.</P>
      <P>There are three courses of action. In the immediate term, we must amend the legislation to place these charges on a sound and legal basis. In the medium term we must review the management of this issue, who knew what and when. I welcome, therefore, the appointment of Mr.<?oasys [jy?>Travers, a distinguished public servant, to carry out a review of the management structures that allowed this situation to evolve. I am also glad that his report will be received by the T&aacute;naiste by 1 March. Finally, in the longer term there is no doubt but that we must look seriously at care for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn&rsquo;s contribution was valuable, given his experience in this area. This is a new and challenging situation in the light of today&rsquo;s demographics. As society has changed, the extended family has declined. In many cases, both partners now work and grandparents do not always live in the family home.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has not become aware of this change only in recent weeks. As late as last April she commented that when the SSIA scheme comes to an end, that money should be diverted to care for the elderly. This is not a new-found interest on the part of the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      <P>The elderly are a vulnerable sector in society, as those of us who canvass and engage elderly people at their doors are aware. Loneliness, insecurity and an element of fear are apparent. It is most important that public representatives ensure the State embraces the challenges facing us in terms of changed demographics and that we put in place a proper system whereby elderly people can be supported. People should be supported in their own homes if that is their wish. However, if there is a need for them to go into some form of residential care, that should also be provided. We should not postpone that challenge.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House. It is necessary and is an example of good governance. We are seeking to address an anomaly in the system in an open and transparent manner. The Bill should be embraced in that spirit. Let us deal with the short-term objective of putting a proper legal basis in place to address the anomaly. Let us await the report of Mr. Travers and put in place a proper management structure and health care policy that will look after the elderly into the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Minihan for sharing time with me. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. He might be relieved to know I will not refer to Dickens. What does come to mind however is the Dutch folk tale of the unfortunate young boy who had to put his finger in the dyke. I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s finger does not freeze off before this matter is sorted out.</P>
      <P>The Bill is necessary and I do not have a difficulty with it. Nor do I have a difficulty with the concept that people who can afford to pay for their care in old age should make provision for that, although there is a problem at the moment in view of the apparent collapse of insurance and endowment policies. People are losing faith in that industry.</P>
      <P>I am worried that something may be overlooked in the desire to sort out eligibility, entitlements and what went wrong. The director general&rsquo;s statement indicates a black hole which something fell into and everybody else hoped it would go away if they did not ask too many questions about it. I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on grasping the problem and dealing with it so expeditiously.</P>
      <P>Before focusing on the need for legislation in regard to eligibility, it would also be worthwhile to think about the basic policy in regard to care of the elderly. This is most important. It is not a matter of sentimentality of emotion, it is a matter of health economics and about how one can order things in such a way that one does reduce the weight on the acute hospital sector and in so doing help people to live. Far more attention is required for domiciliary care and care in the community. Senator Minihan referred to this point. The aim should be to enable people to live in the community and maintain them there. Barriers which prevent the free movement of people from one part of the structure to another should be removed. I appeal to the Minister of State not to be satisfied with a review of the legislation but to examine the policy behind it and look at what we need to do which in the long term is of greater importance.</P>
      <P>Another point on which I would like to comment, which also arises in the director general&rsquo;s note and elsewhere, is the rather cursory attention given to the finding of the Ombudsman, as if the Ombudsman were just another lobbyist. The Ombudsman is the officer appointed by these Houses to look into administrative matters. References such as &ldquo;in the view of the Ombudsman&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Ombudsman thought&rdquo; appear to me to be rather disparaging. What I thought was worse was a report I read to the effect that some health boards were remitting charges to those people who had complained to the Ombudsman but not to others. What the Ombudsman pointed to was systemic failure, in effect to class actions. It behoves a Department or health board at the stage of getting a report from the Ombudsman which shows systemic failure to look at the other examples of the impact of that failure of systems.</P><Col N="2617"/>
      <P>Like Senator Norris, I found Senator Glynn&rsquo;s contribution in regard to his own experience extremely interesting. It reminded me of the English professor of social administration who once remarked that where there is a will there are relatives. That is a very strong reason for ensuring that public money is not used to provide benefits for otherwise uncaring relatives.</P>
      <P>In the context of the proportion of the pension that is retained by people, I welcome the new subsection (4) which gives the administrator the opportunity to take individual circumstances into account. Senator Glynn made a perfectly valid point, that if one gets the old age pension to provide for one&rsquo;s living expenses, it is unfair to expect to get other things free when one goes to hospital. However, when one is at home one has some element of control over one&rsquo;s expenditure. One can decide whether to spend it on A, B, C or D. Not to have that is a great indignity and loss of freedom for an elderly person. Will the Minister of State examine whether an accommodation could be made for 50% or some other percentage of it to allow people retain some independence?</P>
      <P>I do not believe the retrospective provisions are entirely free from challenge. This is a cause for concern. Having said that, the Bill is a timely one and an attempt to create certainty where that does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to leave some reflections on the bigger issues until last but as Senator Maurice Hayes and others have introduced them, I will commence with them. I do not accept the general proposition that we should ask people to pay for care in the circumstances which currently operates. The current system is a typically Irish mess with several different tiers where people are asked to pay for long-term nursing home care. On the one hand, there are those, specifically covered by the Bill, in public homes and beds who are asked to pay a significant proportion, 80%, of their old age contributory pension towards the costs while on the other hand, there are those who can afford to pay for any measure of care, whether it is nursing home or medical care. Many people are somewhere in between, in long-term care subvented by taxpayers&rsquo; money. The result does not provide an even level of care for everybody that the system should aspire to do. It is a mess because there are so many people who fall through the system who cannot get access on a reasonable basis.</P>
      <P>The public system in many parts of the country is little short of a joke. In north Dublin, it is extremely difficult if one is looking to access a public bed in these circumstances as the waiting list is years long. I have had the experience of desperate relatives looking to me to help them jump the queue. It is heart-rending when little or nothing can be done for them. These people are often at the end of their tether with nowhere to turn. There are not enough public beds. Many people are forced to consider private nursing <Col N="2618"/>homes. However, even with the benefit of subvention, they cannot afford it. I do not buy into the notion of charging by user charges paid when dealing with long-term care. A better way of doing this needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs has started such an examination. Last year, it produced an interesting and stimulating policy document which canvassed an additional 1% payment on PRSI to provide for such care. This deserves serious consideration. I believe we should look at the idea of private insurance, as people prefer that to social insurance. A system could be introduced where everyone would be obliged to either contribute to a social or private insurance system to ensure they are pre-funding any care which they may require in the future. It is society&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that our old people are dealt with properly. The <i>ad hoc</i> system of means-tested user charges does not operate that well.</P>
      <P>I have never been a fan of the long-term pension fund. It is somewhat strange to be dealing with the needs of pensioners in 20 or 25 years time when we all accept that today&rsquo;s pensioners are not well looked after in pension or care provision. When people who have contributed much in their taxes are old and require care some means must be found to ensure they receive a benefit from the fund. This is better than saying to today&rsquo;s pensioners that when they are dead in 20 years&rsquo; time, their offspring will get a decent pension. I do not accept the notion that we can predict with any certainty the demographic profile of the State in 20 years. It has dramatically changed in the last 20 years from a relatively high birth rate to a low one and which is now going back up. The dependency ratio is changing, thankfully for the better, by virtue of the number of immigrants and people contributing towards the labour force, which no one predicted ten years ago. A solid case can be made for accessing available funds to measurably improve the provision of long-term care. We all accept this and the T&aacute;naiste has claimed it is one of her priorities.</P>
      <P>I commend the T&aacute;naiste for acting decisively in introducing the Bill. This is an issue that has been ticking away in the cupboard for several years, ready to explode. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said it was important when mistakes are made they are recognised, responsibility taken and the lessons learned and applied. I am not sure we are doing this as responsibility is not being allocated. In the note prepared by the Secretary General of the Department, it is clear that no one is taking responsibility. In effect, the note claims that the Department was terribly busy during this time with the health strategy, the EU Presidency and everything else and it slipped through the system. This may very well be the explanation. People may have been overworked and may have taken their eyes off the ball with the result that the problem persisted. If so, it is not good enough as it does not point the finger <Col N="2619"/>of responsibility in a way we are entitled to insist should happen.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman was aware of this problem for five years and pointed it out. We know what happened in the South Eastern Health Board and that it has been in the Department for 21 months. We know a decision was taken on 16 December to do something about. Something was initiated but not pursued. We do not know why it was not followed through. Claiming that everyone was too busy is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The meeting of 16 December 2003 is important. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, claims he arrived late to it. While we can accept this, the minutes would have been provided to him later. The Secretary General of the Department and the Minister&rsquo;s officials must have been aware that the substantial body of legal advice should have been brought to his attention. It is remarkable that no one took the trouble to sit down with the Minister for five minutes to explain the existence of this long-standing problem and how it must be dealt with eventually. If the then Minister, Deputy Martin, was not available to deal with it, then surely the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for services for older people, Deputy Callely, should have been asked. Deputy Callely is not known for his reticence. I would be interested to hear his explanation. Like most of his constituents during that period, I received much literature from Deputy Callely detailing his good work on behalf of older people. I am sure he would like to take the opportunity to explain his views&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should refrain from mentioning Members of the Lower House, complimentary or otherwise. Other Members might have different views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach is right. I withdraw my excessively familiar references to the Minister of State at the Department of Transport. An explanation is needed and we are entitled to hear it. Those we have heard do not ring true. It is not good enough for those involved to claim they simply forgot about it.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about curative legislation as it should be treated with great care. However, we are not getting the time to do so. It is being rushed through both Houses of the Oireachtas in 72 hours and will be signed by the President under an early signature motion. The Bill seeks to deem as lawful a procedure which we know was not. In a sense, it is a contradiction in terms. The Bill states that the charges which were unlawful are lawful. This should be done with great care. The Labour Party has obtained legal advice which raises serious concerns about the constitutional issues involved in the Bill. I do not claim to be a constitutional lawyer. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Chil<Col N="2620"/>dren, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has far greater knowledge on such matters.</P>
      <P>While this is not a criminal issue but largely a civil one, serious questions remain to be answered. As Deputy McManus stated in the Lower House, it is not sufficient to say that Mr. Hogan, learned constitutional lawyer as he is, has given his advice and, therefore, we are absolved from having to give any further explanation. It would be helpful if the Minister of State could give the House more detail of the advice he has been given and of his views on the soundness of the curative legislation we are asked to endorse so quickly. The Department, having wrongly charged people over a long period, has both a legal and moral responsibility to repay the individuals concerned. One could cogently make the case that the State should not try to contact the estate of somebody who died in the 1970s to make a donation to it but anybody who is still alive is entitled to a repayment.</P>
      <P>It is not clear how the system of automatic repayment will work. I presume that some of the people who are entitled to repayment are in long-term care, so there is no difficulty in that regard. However, some are not in long-term care, including those who are deceased. How does the Department of Health and Children propose to check the status and locations of the individuals in question, so that it can make automatic repayments?</P>
      <P>None of us likes to see legislation of this nature. The Bill will close the chapter on a saga of incompetence and mismanagement. I welcome the establishment of an inquiry by the Department. It is important that it should be pursued with rigour. I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s commitment to publishing the results after it has been finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. The Department of Health and Children is dealing with this issue in a competent manner. The Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004, which has been passed by the D&aacute;il and will be passed by the Seanad today, has been brought to the House on the basis that it is required. It will regulate this sector, which has been the subject of a great deal of concern over a long period. As a former chairman of the Western Health Board, I have dealt with many nursing home subvention cases involving patients in long-stay care in publicly funded nursing homes, which used to be known as county homes.</P>
      <P>Recent developments have come as a surprise to many people. Residents of public nursing homes were satisfied to make a contribution and to receive what has been termed the &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; that they were given. Many people considered the pocket money to be inadequate to meet the needs of the residents, especially when one considers the increased costs of modern times. When the nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in private nursing homes, <Col N="2621"/>regulations required family members to contribute towards the cost of the care of their elderly relatives. It proved impossible to administer the scheme, which was scrapped some time ago. I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the details of the debacle at that time. The collapse of the scheme raised serious issues about long-term care in private and public institutions. The cost of a bed in a private nursing home is approximately &euro;500 or &euro;600. If a person whose pension has been taken away has to make a contribution, he or she might need to sell the family home to pay for care in a long-term institution.</P>
      <P>The nursing homes operated by the State are of a very high standard. The three such homes in County Roscommon &mdash; the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon town, which has over 200 long-stay beds, &Aacute;ras Mh&aacute;thair Ph&oacute;il in Castlerea and the Plunkett Home in Boyle &mdash; are managed extremely well by the Western Health Board. The staff and directors of nursing in the homes provide the highest possible standard of care and attention. Private nursing homes have provided tremendous service, in co-operation with the health boards. Some form of control or regulation should be introduced to deal with the number of nursing homes being built in certain areas without regard to the number of patients who need to be dealt with in the areas. Similarly, action should be taken to control costs, which have soared in recent years.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify an interesting anomaly that came to my attention in November. I will refer to the man in question, who is a resident of a long-stay institution, as &ldquo;Mr. G&rdquo;. His Irish pension is taken from him and he is given some pocket money in the normal way. Along with that little allowance, he used to receive a small pension from the United Kingdom that was of great assistance to him because brandy and whiskey can be quite expensive. I brought this case to the attention of the relevant administrative authorities in November, before this Bill was published, when I learnt that Mr. G&rsquo;s UK pension was being confiscated, even though he had not given permission to do so. I considered that it was improper to take the money from him.</P>
      <P>As recently as yesterday, the administrative personnel in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon town justified their decision to confiscate Mr. G&rsquo;s small UK pension. They informed me that they have not received any instructions about the Bill under consideration. I accept that it has not been passed or signed by the President. The Department&rsquo;s programme managers should send documentation to the institutions to alert them to the matters which are arising. When I spoke to Mr. G, who is 79 years of age, on the telephone yesterday, he told me he is delighted to be getting his &euro;2,000 back. He made the point that it is strange that if the Bill was beneficial to him, it probably would not be passed as quickly by the Houses. Mr. G is well-known for his interest for politics. He canvassed strongly in south Roscommon in the past.</P>

I would like officials from the Department of Health and Children to examine the concerns I have in this regard. I have mentioned that the institution in question is the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon town and I have referred to the person in question as Mr. G. The authorities in the hospital are well aware of the situation. I felt that it was improper to confiscate his UK pension. A great deal has been said about the Bill and the difficulties which have arisen, but I want to emphasise that point.</P>

Pensions have been taken into account during the amalgamation of finances which has been needed to fund the care of elderly people in private nursing homes. The cost of accommodation in such nursing homes, which can be quite expensive, has been met by a combination of elderly people&rsquo;s pensions and funds supplied by their relatives. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the matter, although he may already have done so in his opening speech. Do the institutions have to provide money? How will the State refund those who have paid substantial sums of money for their care? Will the payments be made from funds allocated by the private institutions and the State?

	<P>When I listened to Senator Leyden&rsquo;s tale of Mr. G, I found it easy to imagine Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and Deputies touring district and community hospitals in the coming months to present cheques for &euro;2,000, as if they were lotto cheques.</P>

	<P>That is a good suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not feel that it would be beyond them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has a low opinion of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been argued that this legislation has been rushed. The case for the defence has been made by Senator Minihan and others, who have said that speedy action is required, which is a fair point. We need speedy action to put in place, for once and for all, a plan to deal with the issue of long-term care for the elderly. The statistics were enunciated by some Senators, including Senator Browne, who emphasised that a considerable proportion of the population will be elderly in 20 or 30 years. Senator McDowell made the valid point that we not only need to plan for the future but that we also need to plan for the present. Every politician, local and national, is contacted weekly, if not daily, by constituents seeking some type of long-term accommodation for their elderly relatives or friends. This is one of the most difficult queries to deal with as a politician because a solution is always very difficult to find. There are simply not enough places available. If any good is to result from this debacle and this necessary legislation, rushed as it may be, I hope it will be that the minds of the T&aacute;naiste and her ministerial colleagues will be focused on the broader question of care for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Portfolios held by the Ministers of State at the Department of Health and Children seem to change very regularly. Could one Minister of State not have sole responsibility for the elderly? The number of issues faced by the elderly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State in question has a broader remit and does not deal solely with the elderly. If one Minister of State dealt specifically with all the problems faced by the elderly, it would help to achieve redress.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Let us consider the retrospective payment of those who were asked to make a contribution towards their nursing home care. Will the Minister of State indicate, while wearing both his ministerial and legal hats, how certain the Government is that its position will stand up to challenge in court? On the one hand, we are saying the charges were illegal and, on the other, we are saying we must put in place legislation to underpin those charges. This is an unusual way of doing business. I am sure the Minister of State has already been asked about the legal ramifications but he might expand on them. Approximately 20,000 people are to be repaid &euro;2,000. Will the next of kin of those who died in the care of the district homes or community hospitals receive the payment of &euro;2,000, or will it just to be paid to those currently resident in those institutions?</P><Col N="2624"/>
      <P>While we appreciate that this legal minefield has been made public and that it must be dealt with, serious questions must be asked about how it was handled. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has not in any way rendered himself glorious in his attempt to distance himself from responsibility in this area. He was in charge when the problem was fully and formally noted. We first heard he was not present at the meeting with the chief executives of health boards, we then heard he was present and later heard he was present but turned up late. Whatever the explanation, it is simply not good enough. There are other jurisdictions in which a Minister involved in such a mess would not remain in Cabinet and would not excuse himself by saying he did not attend or was late for a meeting. I commend the current Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on at least facing up to the problem and trying in some small way to correct it.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that we are debating this matter well over two years after it was first formally highlighted. This demonstrates once again that, in the Department of Health and Children, progress appears to be made not only very slowly but also in a very unusual fashion. This crisis is not the first in that Department and I presume it will not be the last. Bearing in mind that the Department has such considerable funds at its disposal and such responsibility for virtually every citizen, the fact that this problem has been ignored for so long after its being highlighted poses very serious questions.</P>
      <P>On the broader issue of care for the elderly, Senator McDowell referred to the semi-private, private and public systems of care. The thousands of people seeking care are not concerned with the ideology behind who provides the care but that it is available and affordable. This presents a great challenge to us all and it is the subject on which this debate such focus. This debate might tie up a loose end but we do not know but that it might become undone in the courts. We must tackle seriously the broader issue of care for the elderly because the elderly not only need care but certainly deserve it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator McHugh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. We have dealt with this serious problem over the years and it was sometimes quite embarrassing that the pensions of those in nursing homes were so minimal. The issues were very confusing even for elected representatives. The decision to grant all persons over 70 a medical card was a stunt on the part of the Government prior to the last general election but we welcomed it nevertheless. However, the Department of Health and Children underestimated the number of eligible people and believed there <Col N="2625"/>were 39,000 instead of over 71,000. One must ask who crunches the numbers because this is a considerable underestimation. The legislation introduced was seriously flawed and it is clear therefrom that health boards were not legally entitled to reduce the full eligibility to people over 70 or to seek a contribution from them.</P>
      <P>Although I understand why the Senators on the Government side have been quite positive in stating why this Bill is needed, I contend that the Minister of State is rushing it. It should be noted that when people complained to the health boards and said this practice should not be continued they were not charged extra.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden mentioned the &euro;2,000 refund. It is a bit soon to determine how much can be paid until we see the extent of the payments received illegally and the number of people affected. This is a bit hasty. It is as if someone came into my shop and I overcharged him or her by &euro;20 or &euro;10, and when he or she returned three weeks later I put up my hands saying I had made a mistake and offered &euro;2, take it or leave it. This is not a bargain basement or a closing down sale. These people have been swindled in many ways. We should stand back and determine to what extent they have been short-changed. It is a bit rich to start offering a certain sum, take it or leave it. I would like that clarified and I am sure the Minister of State will clarify it.</P>
      <P>The real issue surrounding the legality of nursing home charges is focused on the legislation passed in 2001. One problem area is that there was a meeting last year but the then Minister for Health and Children did not seem to take the initiative. In politics we like people to put up their hands and say &ldquo;<i>Mea culpa</i>&rdquo;. The present Minister deserves our congratulations and thanks for being honest and up-front. I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleagues on this side of the House I have major concerns about the fast-tracking of this important Bill. By not giving it enough time issues will be missed and there can be grey areas that need to be addressed. On the political debate surrounding what Senator Feighan called <i>mea culpa,</i> or the question of who is to blame, it is easy for the other side of the House to go back to 1976 but the nub of this issue concerns what happened in 2001. That is when the nettle should have been grasped and the matter addressed but it was not.</P>
      <P>With regard to the outcome of the Bill, much work remains to be done on the set procedure for medical cards and subvention payments for private nursing homes. That debate needs to begin very soon because there is a large cloud over the issue and a great deal of misinformation and lack of transparency and accountability regarding subvention. If this legislation is passed today there will be a legal mechanism for effecting payments.</P>
      <P>A major issue surrounds community hospitals. I can use my own area as an example, where there are community hospitals in Dungloe, Carndonagh <Col N="2626"/>and Lifford, outside the mainstream Letterkenny General Hospital. We need answers before a vote is taken here. Will convalescent patients who are recovering or rehabilitating in community hospitals be charged after 30 days? That question must be answered. For example, a gentleman or lady who needs a hip replacement may, due to the pressures in the general hospital in Letterkenny, recover or rehabilitate in one of the community hospitals. It may take longer than 30 days in some instances for an elderly person to recover from an orthopaedic operation with the necessary physiotherapy rehabilitation programme. After 30 days will that patient have to pay charges? This is a very important issue and has not been raised due to the fast-tracking of this legislation. It is important that the Minister of State say whether an elderly person undergoing treatment, rehabilitation or otherwise in a community hospital must pay after 30 days. We need an answer before taking a vote on this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach must have noted that when a Government Bill is presented here it is seldom that so few Members support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is relevant but the Cathaoirleach must remain at a distance from it. Only one or two Members on the Government side came in to the House today to support this legislation because most Members on that side do not support it. The rest will vote on it and disappear because this legislation will hurt. They have got the message on the ground and are hiding this afternoon. It is a pity. This legislation is penalising pensioners in Christmas week because it will mean that between 70% and 80% of their pensions will be taken from them. Does the Minister of State agree that as soon as the Bill is passed he will be deducting 80% of the pension from old age pensioners in long-stay institutions, in Christmas week? Is Senator Leyden, as a former member and chairperson of the Western Health Board satisfied to do that? I doubt he will visit all the long-term institutions in Christmas week, as he does before elections, and tell the people that this is what he and his Government have done.</P>
      <P>In regard to the blame game, which many Members mentioned this morning, the then Minister said that he missed the important part of a meeting with the chief executive officers and did not know this matter was discussed at it. The chief executive officers decided there should be no change and they would continue their demands. Down through the years all the health boards demanded that people pay for their keep in those long-stay institutions but those affected could not afford it. I mentioned it recently on the Order of Business. Those are the people for whom I feel sorry. The new Minister for Health and Children, the Progressive Democrats and <Col N="2627"/>Fiannna F&aacute;il in Government will demand 80% of the pensions of those affected. They will answer no questions but want people to pay up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator voting against the &euro;2,000 refund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will come to that. That is all they have. Does the &euro;2,000 that is to be paid to those concerned represent a first instalment?</P>
      <P>Let us consider the years from 2001. For 80% of the pensioners, it amounted to IR£80 in 2001, &euro;104 in 2002, &euro;117 in 2003, and &euro;120 in 2004. Senator Leyden should not make a big deal out of that. If one only pays back &euro;2,000, there is still an outstanding bill of &euro;19,500. Is that the first instalment? That might encourage the Government to go back and talk to those affected. If it is a once-off payment and the rest is to be forgotten about, the Government should answer why it is illegally withholding &euro;19,500 from the pensioners and others who have had to pay in such a situation.</P>
      <P>In the past, health boards harried relations and patients to get money from those in hospital, who were vulnerable. If in long-term hospitals or care, they were in no position to defend themselves and whatever resources they might have saved over the years. They had to hand over a portion, sometimes half and sometimes most of it. In the most extreme instances, they had to sell their homes &mdash; or their relatives had to do it for them &mdash; to allow them to remain in the long-stay beds.</P>

Let the Minister put the shoe on the other foot and imagine that people had been overpaid social welfare benefits. The Department of Social and Family Affairs would insist that it all be paid back quickly. Why are the demands of the voiceless to have the illegal payments returned to them not acted on, as any Department would demand if it were so entitled? It is a sad Christmas for 20,000 or more people in this country. That is why the Government benches are so vacant. The only one present, who is most unusually silent, is Senator Leyden. I pity him; he will not be visiting any of those long-term institutions in his constituency.</P>

	<P>I agree with the remarks of my colleagues. I attended the House a few weeks ago when we discussed the Second Stage of the Council of Europe Development Bank Bill 2004. I was castigated by members of the Government parties because there were not sufficient voices from the Opposition, particularly from my own party, to discuss that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>They are all here now, so we think more of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, they were all there on that day because they were involved in the Council of Europe or wished to be. They are striking today by their absence. I will not have a go at Senator Leyden, who as usual has contributed. In fairness, he had to remain for the duration of the Bill. However, the absence of his colleagues speaks volumes regarding this legislation &mdash; probably more than I could ever say. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House. I understand he was placed in a very unenviable position yesterday, making remarks in the other Chamber to the effect that the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had not attended the famous meeting with the CEOs, although it turns out that the Minister himself admitted on national television last night that he had been present at that meeting, albeit belatedly.</P>

	<P>I know that the Minister of State will take the opportunity to correct the record on what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should check the record before he starts quoting me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in expressing disappointment and absolute outrage at the moneys withheld from people in residential homes. At this time of the year, it is a poignant symbol of how out of touch the Government is with many sectors of society. I am particularly disappointed that, as we can all plainly see, if my colleague, Deputy Perry, and our party leader, Deputy Kenny, had not been so vociferous in this regard, very little if anything would have been done to recompense those people who found themselves defrauded by the State. I salute the efforts of Deputies Perry and Kenny to highlight the issue and ensure that the Government take action. I echo Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s comments, who expressed his reservations about the &euro;2,000 that it is proposed to repay. In many situations <Col N="2629"/>and circumstances, that will not be commensurate with the amount that people are owed.</P>
      <P>I also want to return to another aspect of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 that relates specifically to the new health service authority and the abolition of the health boards. We have seen crocodile tears in both Houses from members of the Government regarding the fact that local representatives&rsquo; voices will be removed almost completely from the running of the health services. It is a retrograde step and particularly disappointing that the first implementation and change brought about in reforming the health services was the abolition of the board itself, with no substantial reform of structures below that level, from the chief executive officers down to administrative staff.</P>
      <P>Several speakers have pointed out the great increases on health in various budgets and Books of Estimates published over the past few years. During that time, we have also seen remarkable increases in the numbers of those employed in administering the health service, but not in doctors, nurses and medical staff. In this House we heard the statistic during a debate a few weeks ago that, of 33,000 extra people employed over a five-year or six-year period in the health services, only 6,000 were nurses. Most of the remainder were administrative staff.</P>
      <P>That is the big issue that must be tackled by this Government or any other regarding reform of the health service. No proposal has been announced in this Bill or by members of the Government to tackle the serious issue of where resources are spent in the health services. We must achieve better value for the money that we spend. This Bill and this Government are not doing enough to ensure that we get it, and that is why I have serious reservations about this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Virtually everything that needed to be said has already been said. There is just one matter that I would like to raise that has not yet been mentioned. One of the serious difficulties with such issues that the Department of Health and Children, the hospital services board, and primary continuing community care have when planning health services is the lack of knowledge on patient numbers, something brought into sharp focus by the extension of medical cards to over-70s. At the time, I said that I welcomed it, although I thought that others deserved a card more than all those over 70 without a means test. However, the measure has now been introduced. I recall that at the time it was believed that approximately 35,000 people would avail of those medical cards. I understand 67,000 people have now registered for such cards. How can the Department plan when it has such inaccurate figures? This not only relates to financial planning but the planning for places and knowing where they are needed. It is impossible to do so at present.</P><Col N="2630"/>
      <P>The same situation may arise in respect of the extension of the medical cards on a doctor-only basis. I welcome that measure. It would have been nice if it had included doctors and medications covered by the cards, but we have no idea how many extra people will be covered or whether the primary care system can cope with this number of people.</P>
      <P>I suggested on numerous occasions in this House that one solution that would help would be if people were assigned personal identifier numbers at birth. That would enable us to identify the number of people coming into the health services each day, month and year and the number who need immunisation at six weeks, six months at two years and so forth. Such an identifier number would enable us to plan. It could be described as any great intrusion into people&rsquo;s privacy. There has been a move towards that with the establishment and greater use of PRSAs.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister of State conveyed to the Minister for Health and Children the relatively simple solution of giving people an identifier number. Then we would have some method of planning ahead and would know what number of people might require each service or what unforeseen cohorts might require services. It would also help us in terms of financial planning.</P>
      <P>I can understand why this legislation is being rushed through in this way. I regret that, but huge amounts of money will have to be expended by the Department which it did not expect to expend. It will have to produce the money from somewhere. Those unfortunates who are not legally liable to pay these people, under the legislation, will have to pay up. I regret that the people concerned cannot be refunded all the money they paid out, given that if one owes income tax, one is required to pay every last cent. I am sure the vast majority of these people were hardworking taxpayers all their lives and I very much regret that they will not be recompensed in full for money that should not have been taken from them in the first place.</P>
      <P>I urge the Department as a matter of urgency to put in train some form of planning; an identifier number being the best mechanism of which I can think. We have had example after example where the Department did not have a notion what initiatives were going to cost. This is an issue of money being expended, of which the Department did not inform us. A great amount of tax relief was given for the building of private hospitals, but we find that the Department of Finance has no idea how much this initiative will cost. Day after day we find out there was no notion what an initiative was going to cost. That cannot be the way to run a proper health service.</P>

	<P>That is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2631"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This mess began in 2001 when the Government decided to extend medical cards to those over 70 years. As Senator Henry correctly pointed out, an assessment was done at that time of the cost the State would have to bear when that scheme was extended. However, something worse happened under the watch of the former Minister, Deputy Martin. At the time he stated that the policy of the Government was to extend medical cards to everyone over the age of 70. He made that statement first and then attempted to negotiate with the IMO in respect of the GMS contract. It was a ludicrous position to take. He was responsible for extending the scheme, but in respect of the people with whom he had to strike a rate in terms of getting the best possible price for the service he was buying, he had not even finalised negotiations. That displays incredible incompetence. Had this happened in a large company in the private sector of which Mr. Martin was CEO, he would be out on his ear. He made that announcement first, and then set about negotiating a price for the service with the people who will have to provide it.</P>
      <P>As Senator Henry said, we now know the cost of this for the taxpayer is four times greater than the rather pathetic assessment done then. I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Power, mumbling and bumbling, when my colleague, Senator Feighan, rightly pointed out the presence of the Minister at this meeting. I heard the interview too and for the record the Minister was at the meeting last December. He arrived late, but he was there. This was not an ordinary bureaucratic meeting, but one with the key players in the Department, the people who co-ordinate the issues that must be determined. We have evidence to the effect that this was the fourth matter raised at that time.</P>
      <P>It is right to put the former Minister for Health and Children in the dock on this issue because his incompetence relates not only to last December but goes back to 2001 when he let the secret out the bag by first giving a policy commitment and then attempting to negotiate. That man would be out of a job had that happened in the private sector, and that may well happen in a few years.</P>
      <P>On the issue of retrospective payment, I believe this Bill will be challenged in the courts. I welcome the Bill and hope a test case will be brought. I hope the pensioners who have lost such an amount of money win the case and that the Government will have to pay up. Any time an amendment is put forward by Members on this side of the House attempting to propose retrospective action, we are informed such a measure is unconstitutional and there is no legal precedent therefor. The Taoiseach, God help and protect us, made this known in the House only a month ago when he said he did not think it was possible that legislation such as this could be brought forward, but now this legislation is before us. I hope pensioners take it on and get every last brass farthing from the State because this problem emerged due to the incompetence of the State <Col N="2632"/>and of a bunch of incompetent politicians who have been in office too long. They will have to pay the price for this and I hope they do.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the former Minister of State with direct responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Callely. What more important issue was there than this one last December? He was at that meeting but nothing happened. A definitive legal assessment of the current arrangements was sought as a first step. None of this would have been done were it not for the fact that the T&aacute;naiste, in fairness to her, recognised this hot potato, which was highlighted in the other House, and set about resolving it. The then Minister, Deputy Martin, the then Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and the other comedians in the crew would have sat on this issue as long as it took because that is the kind of mentality they have. These people would not survive in the private sector and they will not survive too long in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We are involved in a hypocritical exercise here, which does very little for the body politic. When the banks and other financial institutions overcharge their customers we are all ready to jump up, and rightly so, and condemn them for robbing the people by way of such charges. Today we are legalising the robbery undertaken by the State in regard to elderly people. Rip-off Ireland is alive and well and we are sponsoring it if we pass this Bill. We have been ripping off elderly people, the weakest section of our community. We are copper-fastening that deception here today. There is no question but that the then Minister knew about this issue last year. He was at the meeting in question, irrespective of whether he was present when the issue was discussed. As my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes said, the then Minister with responsibility for the elderly was also at that meeting. What more do we want? They swept the issue under the carpet and but for the fact that Deputies Kenny and Perry kept raising it in the other House, it would still be swept under the carpet and people would be left without their money. This is the type of Bill we are introducing just before Christmas week. All over the country, the elderly are on waiting lists for public beds in public institutions. St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, Waterford, is a wonderful geriatric hospital. However, week after week, because of the long queue for admission, elderly people must ask whether I can get them into that hospital. Public representatives receive many requests for accommodation in private hospitals and private nursing homes because families cannot afford, even with a subvention, to pay for the care of their elderly relatives.</P>
      <P>This is a land of plenty which is supposed to have a caring and sharing Government. That this is allowed to happen and families are suffering is disgraceful. That there are not enough public beds must be addressed by the Government. Fair play to the T&aacute;naiste for making some effort by <Col N="2633"/>giving a measly &euro;2,000 to compensate for the incompetence of her predecessor, who should be hauled over the coals and asked to explain himself. He should resign. Moreover, the two Ministers of State involved are still in office, with one issuing statements on practically any subject, inside or outside his portfolio.</P>
      <P>We need answers on this matter. The Government knew but did not act &mdash; that is the simple fact. It now makes a &euro;2,000 offer. As Senator Feighan stated, if a shopkeeper overcharged somebody by &euro;10, when the customer complained he or she would not be given back &euro;2. This is what the Government is doing with the Bill, no more or less. It is not good enough. We should treat the elderly better than is the case with this Bill.</P>
      <P>Most aspects of the matter have been covered. If anybody was listening to the rightful condemnation of the practices of the banks during this debate and understood what the Government intends with the Bill, we would be called hypocrites, particularly Members on the other side of the House. That is what is evident in the House today.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power, to the House. This is an important Bill. I was surprised by some of the contributions by experienced Members who have served on health boards. As a former health board member, I tell Fine Gael Senators that that party spent considerable time in power when the charges were in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about the period since 2001.</P>

	<P>Fine Gael did nothing about the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the people saw fit to get rid of the Fine Gael-led Government. It is important to state that Fine Gael was in power at a time when health boards were tracking family members all over the country to try to get money from them to pay for relatives in institutions.</P>
      <P>I have visited many elderly people who paid three quarters of their pension to the health board and were happy to do so because they were looked after. Many elderly people told me they felt living in a nursing home was like living in a hotel. These people worked hard all their lives and received pensions. They were prepared to make a contribution for their care.</P>
      <P>An anomaly was found in the original Act. I compliment the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, on immediately setting out to rectify the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power, is in the House to put through legislation which will enable charges to be imposed in a proper and legal fashion. The Minister has offered to pay back some money to the elderly people involved. It must be remembered that many of these people owned property worth hundreds of thousands of euros which will be left to their next-of-kin when they die. Many are in long-stay institutions and are happy to be cared for in institutions by doctors and nursing staff.</P>
      <P>From some contributions to the debate, one would think elderly people were not being cared for, and that we were ripping them off and selling their property. This was not and is not the case. If the country wants to look after the health care of those in long-stay institutions, the Government is entitled to some compensation from those who use the service, even those with medical cards. Many elderly people have told me that while they are giving back 25% of their pension, their accommodation is like a hotel and everything they want is given to them. These are the facts.</P>
      <P>Many Acts have been found to be defective and have been updated through new legislation. This case is similar. Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats would not be known as parties that rip-off the people. We have done more for the poor and needy in our society-&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to recognise this. The chief executive officers and senior executives of the health boards read the original Bill and knew of the charge. They erred and we have an obligation to pay back some of the money charged in error.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody in their senses would say that every shilling should be repaid or that the elderly should be provided with nursing home accommodation for free.</P>
      <P>The Opposition should talk to those directly involved, not to family members who see an opportunity to put money in their back pockets when elderly relatives die, which is what some want. However, the same family members would not take care of their elderly relatives at home and shoved them into institutions. This has happened and is happening in every parish.</P>
      <P>The Government is making a fair effort to look after the elderly, including in the context of the Bill, which is perfectly legal. From my experience of visiting people in nursing homes, they are happy to have made a contribution. They did not want to be there for free and were happy to pay, <Col N="2635"/>despite the fact that others are now clamouring for money. I wish the Minister of State and his officials well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Moylan made the point that the Government did more for the well-off than any other Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to the less well-off but I include the well-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is that, proportionally, the Government has not done so. The Government had more resources than any other but when the ESRI analysed past budgets, it found that Fianna F&aacute;il did more when in Government with the Labour Party following the 1992 elections in terms of distributing resources to the less well-off in society.</P>
      <P>Others have referred to the potential unconstitutionality of the Bill. One of the matters that makes it obvious is the fact that subsections are being inserted to try to address this unconstitutionality. In addressing the House earlier, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said it was intended:</P>
      <P LI="1">to insert a new subsection (6) that the retrospective regularisation provision of the new subsection (5) does not apply in the case of a charge which is the subject of civil proceedings instituted on or before 14 December 2004 for the recovery of the relevant charge; [and] to insert a new subsection (7) to provide that the provisions of the new subsection (5) do not affect any other ground which may be raised in civil proceedings to debar the recovery of the relevant charge.</P>
      <P FLI="0">These are attempts to try to make the legislation constitutional but I do not think they will work. Like Senator Brian Hayes, I hope there will be a successful legal challenge to the legislation. There is a presumption that everything we do in the House is constitutional but we have a duty to ensure that we do not pass legislation that is unconstitutional. I think this Bill is unconstitutional and, as such, it would be wrong for us to enact it.</P>
      <P>In his speech, the Minister of State referred to Government policy. He said this legislation is being introduced &ldquo;to avoid needless litigation&rdquo;. It is not needless litigation, however, and it is wrong to call it thus. When people initiate litigation on a matter such as this, it is in order to assert their rights. The view from the Government benches is that people who resort to the courts to assert their rights are engaging in needless litigation. That is the wrong way to regard people who are trying to establish their rights through the courts. Every time someone mentions it here I will challenge that view. I know I have an interest in the matter in that I am a solicitor but I am not working as a solicitor any more.</P><Col N="2636"/>
      <P>There must be a better way of dealing with this matter. No other sector of society is treated in the way that older people are treated. The Government is giving pensions with one hand, while taking the money away from elderly people with the other. No other section of society is having money deducted in this way. If an elderly person attends a hospital for treatment, the money is not deducted from his or her pension.</P>

	<P>The legislation may be found to be unconstitutional and we have a duty to ensure that people are protected. I hope I will have an opportunity to table an amendment on Report Stage because we did not do so for Committee Stage. If it is in order, I will try to do so. That issue has been raised by the senior citizens&rsquo; group, which referred to the adequacy of payments and the amount of money that will be left for pensioners after the money is deducted under the terms of this legislation. I understand the average sum will be approximately &euro;35 per week. However, the senior citizens&rsquo; group made the point that if an elderly person buys <i>The Irish Times</i> every day, along with a packet of ten cigarettes and a pint of Guinness, the money would soon be gone. Given the sum this Bill will leave pensioners with, they will have no money for clothes or Christmas gifts for their grandchildren.</P>
      <P>I realise that Senators cannot make proposals that involve making a charge on the Exchequer but, if it is in order, a review group should be established to examine whether or not this payment is adequate. I hope to avail of the opportunity to raise this matter on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this important legislation. As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said in his opening remarks, this legislation is necessary in order to provide a legal framework for the long-established practice of charging those patients in long-term care in health board institutions and publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes.</P>
      <P>A number of issues were raised by Members with which I will now deal. The Office of the Attorney General has provided advice concerning the current system of charging for long-term care and concluded that health boards have no legal entitlement to charge persons who are fully eligible, including those over 70 years of age. In light of this advice, my Department wrote to the health board instructing them to stop imposing any financial charges on fully eligible persons in receipt of health services, pending the enactment of legislation to regularise the power to impose <Col N="2637"/>such charges. If this loophole is not closed to allow this funding to be retained, a significant loss of resources to the health services will result. That is the reason for the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senators have been critical of the fact that the legislation has been rushed through the Houses and while we would all like to have plenty of time to tease out legislation, unfortunately, time was not on our side in this case.</P>
      <P>In the documentation she provided yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children explained exactly the short timeframe in which we had to try to enact this legislation. The T&aacute;naiste acted as soon as the information and advice came from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity that the former Minister for Health and Children did not do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to put the record straight because Senator Phelan misquoted me earlier. I do not mind criticism but Senators should quote people directly instead of misquoting them. If they did so, they would be doing politics a better service. The point I made yesterday in the D&aacute;il was that in trying to be as helpful as possible, the T&aacute;naiste, in addition to her speech on Second Stage in the Lower House, also published documentation relating to this matter. One of those documents included the minutes and attendance of a meeting that took place on Tuesday, 16 December 2003, at which senior management from the Department of Health and Children were present, along with health board CEOs. As I mentioned, three Ministers were present, namely, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and his Ministers of State, Deputy Callely and Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
      <P>The point I made was that item No. 4 on the minutes concerned the long-stay charges for over 70s. The Secretary General of the Department informed us that the Minister, Deputy Martin, was not present at the meeting when that matter was being discussed. That is as much as I said about it. Let the Minister, Deputy Martin, say what he has to say about it but I do not want people to accuse me of having said certain things about him. Apart from what I heard in the interviews he has given, I know no more than Senators do about what the Minister knew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators should at least be fair in their criticisms. They can give out all they like about the legislation we are introducing but they should try not to misquote me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker><Col N="2638"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>When I say something, I would prefer to be quoted properly.</P>
      <P>Senator McHugh referred to the 30-day period. The charges kick in after 30 days for the receipt of inpatient services or periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The 30-day period begins to run immediately the person concerned is provided with inpatient services.</P>
      <P>Senator Derek McDowell referred to rushing the legislation and I have dealt with that point. We would all like to have been in a position to deal with this Bill in a more comprehensive way and have more debate on it but time is not on our side. If we were to postpone the legislation until next year it would have serious consequences for the health service budget. Resources are scarce enough and we want to ensure that we spend them as efficiently as possible to obtain the best value for money.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what point Senator Brian Hayes was trying to make. Is it now the policy of the main Opposition party to withdraw medical cards from the over 70s? That would appear to be what the Senator was saying but I am not too sure.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Senator Tuffy queried the constitutionality of the Bill. This measure is being taken following advice from the Attorney General who, in turn, sought advice from Mr. Gerard Hogan, SC. Mr. Hogan is regarded as the leading expert in this field. We could not have obtained better advice and it is upon that advice that we are making these plans.</P>
      <P>The point must be made that while the Government is being criticised and accused of doing all sorts of things against elderly people, it is generally accepted that these charges act as a contribution towards the cost of care and are seen as being fair and reasonable. If more money is repaid, even less money will be available for services. In my view it would be irresponsible not to endeavour to continue to collect these charges in these circumstances. The charges in the legislation are intended to cover maintenance of patients in publicly provided long-stay care.</P>
      <P>The legislation will bring much-needed legal clarity to a situation which goes back to the introduction of institutional assistance regulations in 1954. It could be argued that the problem began at that time or since 1976. There is no use in kicking around and blaming this or that Government; this practice has been accepted as a fair and reasonable policy under successive Governments.</P>

The nature and content of these co-operative arrangements may be related to a variety of issues, some <Col N="2642"/>of which could be quite minor and temporary. It is unnecessary for such arrangements to be the subject of a written agreement except where their seriousness would justify this. It would not assist to have all such matters laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister of the day can always be asked a parliamentary question if a Deputy wants to establish whether an agreement has been entered into. Members of the Houses can keep themselves informed in that way.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 6 to 15, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 23, to delete lines 35 to 38 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;31.&mdash;(1) As soon as practicable after the passing of this Act and after consulting with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister shall issue to local authorities and the Garda Commissioner guidelines concerning the establishment and maintenance of joint policing committees by local authorities and the Garda Commissioner.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments concern Chapter 4, dealing with the establishment of joint policing committees by local authorities. These provisions have generated a great deal of interest in the Seanad, transcending political lines and party positions. We have already made changes to section 30 to bring in representation on these committees at town council level and we have moved away completely from the county and city development board model that was provided for in the Bill as published. During the debate on Committee Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was also sympathetic to certain points made regarding the guidelines provided for in section 31 and we have moved some way towards the changes sought in earlier amendments tabled by the Labour and Fine Gael Senators.</P>
      <P>I will now outline the main changes. In section 31 we have agreed to use &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; regarding the issue of the guidelines. This will require a change in the role of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The existing wording refers to his or her consent, but with a mandatory provision it would have to change to a consultative role, as it is not possible to oblige a person to agree.</P>
      <P>A second point also arises from the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. This was drawn to the attention of the House by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. Without it means nothing in the sense that section 31 and even the whole chapter could be put on hold if the view was taken and acted upon that it required the making of a commence<Col N="2643"/>ment order under section 2(1) to bring its provisions into effect. Accordingly, reflecting the importance with which I regard these provisions and which is also reflected in the views of the many Senators who contributed to the debate on this matter, the new provision will contain the words &ldquo;as soon as practicable after the passing of the Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the wishes of all the Senators who spoke and in tandem with our own thinking in the matter, the provisions of section 31(2) on the making of the guidelines has been expanded to include the points that were made concerning, for example, Members of the Oireachtas, not just the D&aacute;il, being on the committee; nomination of members by local authorities; the appointment of a chairperson from the local authority members; nomination by the Garda Commissioner of adequate rank and seniority; the establishment of subcommittees; the term of office of the committee; the application of qualified privilege; the attendance of bodies and persons before the committee; an enabling type of provision to allow for the guidelines to deal with the attendance of Members of the Oireachtas; and the circumstances in which meetings of the committee may be held other than in public.</P>
      <P>A related amendment to section 32(2)(<i>c</i>) deals with the hosting of public meetings. The House will note that the text of this section in the version of the Bill printed as amended in Committee already contains a similar provision. This arises from the fact that, during the debate on Committee Stage on amendment No. 51 tabled by the Fine Gael Senators, we indicated our acceptance of the point. We meant to convey that we intended to table an official amendment with the appropriate wording. However, the text of the Fine Gael amendment has been carried into the Bill in its original form, which was not exactly what I had intended. If I did not make myself clear, I apologise to the Chair and the House. I accept responsibility for the fact that the Fine Gael Senators got away with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We submitted amendment No. 8 to have a proper definition of how the policing committees would operate. The Minister&rsquo;s amendment No. 9 addresses much of what we had proposed on Committee Stage and clarifies the matter even further. I commend the Minister for agreeing to do this. It was necessary to put meat on the bones of what was originally contained, which has been accomplished by the Minister&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has agreed to our proposal on public meetings and matters concerning <Col N="2644"/>police committees in a local authority administrative area, which is important. Rather than having, as we discussed, political parties arranging meetings with garda&iacute; present, that will now be a function of the policing committee, which is important for local authorities and communities. I also welcome the other Government amendments in this grouping and I thank the Minister for agreeing to some of the amendments we proposed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Cummins, I welcome the changes proposed here, which shows the Minister&rsquo;s propensity to approach these issues in an open-minded way. He has a great commitment to this matter. Leaving aside the policing aspect, the Bill represents the most significant local government reform that I have seen in recent years.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change to the mandatory word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; in amendment No. 6. I also welcome amendment No. 9 which specifies precisely how the committees will be constituted and gives guidelines on their operation. I also welcome the privilege, which is clearly set out in amendment No. 15. Amendment No. 11 states, &ldquo;the Garda Commissioner shall have regard to the need to ensure that such members are of appropriate rank and seniority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It probably goes without saying &mdash; perhaps the Minister could consider the matter before the Bill is taken in the Lower House &mdash; but those who will serve on joint policing committees would have to be from the localities in which they will operate. I am sure this is understood but I do not know whether it needs to be specified. I welcome the idea of allowing the joint policing committees to appoint sub-committees.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of points in respect of amendment No. 9. The phrase &ldquo;members of the local authority concerned nominated for such appointments&rdquo; is used in paragraph (<i>b</i>)(i) of the amendment. On Committee Stage we discussed whether the county model or that relating to the area surrounding a town should be used. If the county model is used, a number of local authorities within any county will put forward nominees. If, however, the area surrounding a town is used, I understood from the Committee Stage debate &mdash; the Minister of State who was present agreed with this &mdash; that those living in rural areas who serve as county and not town councillors would not be excluded. I wonder if the term &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; should be used in paragraph (<i>b</i>)(i) of the amendment.</P>
      <P>The terms &ldquo;persons nominated by other public authorities&rdquo; and &ldquo;such other persons as may be provided for in the guidelines&rdquo; are used in paragraph (<i>b</i>)(i) and (ii), respectively. I hope &mdash; the Minister also expressed this view &mdash; that these committees should be comprised exclusively of elected representatives, be they councillors or Members of the Oireachtas, and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The provision allows for this model to be extended but restricting membership <Col N="2645"/>to elected representatives in the initial states will allow it to establish its own dynamics. In my view, this model will work well.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) of the amendment states, &ldquo;The appointment as chairperson of the committee of a member of the local authority concerned who has been nominated in accordance with <i>paragraph (b)(i),</i>.&rdquo; The issue again arises whether both town and county councillors will be involved if the town model is chosen. In that instance, one of the local authorities would be responsible for nominating the chairman. Our local government has its own hierarchy and county councils have extensive resources. In my area, for example, Wexford County Council might have a turnover of &euro;80 million or &euro;90 million per year, whereas New Ross Town Council might have a turnover of &euro;2 million. The resources that might be necessary in the future might be more easily provided by county councils. Perhaps, therefore, county or city councils should nominate the chairmen of the committees. Clarification may be required on this matter in that, depending on the model chosen, there may be an overlap in terms of the number of councils involved. If, for example, the town model is chosen, there may be an overlap of at least two councils and if the county model is adopted, there could be even more councils involved. Consideration must be given to this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister is committed to and deserves our commendation in respect of an initiative which will have a huge beneficial effect on policing throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for tabling amendment No. 6, which takes on board the points made by Members on different sides of the House on Committee Stage regarding the need to include the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in respect of the publication of guidelines. This is one of the initiatives for which the Minister will be remembered. It is positive in nature and will enhance local democracy. The Labour Party had proposed a similar idea but this is very much the Minister&rsquo;s initiative and I congratulate him on introducing it and ensuring that it will definitely come to fruition during his term of office.</P>
      <P>As regards amendments Nos. 8 and 9, I thank Fine Gael which took on board some of the points I made on Committee Stage in respect of rephrasing its earlier amendment. I had been concerned that the previous wording might have excluded town councils from establishing joint policing committees. If such councils had been obliged to depend on sub-committees, a committee would have had to have been in existence in the first instance. These points were taken on board by Fine Gael and the Minister and I am very satisfied with both amendments. Clearly, however, it will be the Government&rsquo;s amendment, which is well phrased, that will be passed.</P>
      <P>On the issue of privilege, I agree that, if possible, meetings should be held in public. That was the idea behind the original Fine Gael proposal. <Col N="2646"/>If we are to have democracy, it must be seen to work. I am aware that difficulties might arise and I understand why there is a need to grant privilege. Am I correct in stating that the privilege being introduced will be similar to that which already applies in respect of county councils and will not be as all-encompassing as that which obtains in the Houses of the Oireachtas? The term &ldquo;without malice&rdquo; is used in amendment No. 15 and those attending meetings will have to be careful in terms of what they say because people have a right to their good reputations. In light of the issues that might be discussed at such meetings, there will be a fine line to tread in terms of whether someone&rsquo;s reputation might be tarnished in any way. Due procedures will have to be observed.</P>
      <P>I accept that some meetings may have to be held in private. That is the nature of things. However, I welcome the amendments tabled by the Minister, particularly in terms of the fact that they take on board the need to hold as many meetings as possible in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his senior officials for adopting amendments, requests, proposals and suggestions put forward by Opposition Members, Senator Jim Walsh and me on Committee Stage. I particularly welcome the fact that Members of the Oireachtas will now be included in the legislation. I was pleasantly surprised one of my suggestions to the effect that statements made at meetings and any subsequent publication thereof will be privileged for the purposes of the law of defamation has been included in amendment No. 15. This will prove of great assistance to the members of the committees and it is the first occasion on which a provision of this nature has been included in legislation. I thank those responsible for drafting the amendment for its inclusion.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be made all the better by the Minister&rsquo;s adoption of suggestions that were made in good faith on Committee Stage. I know that he will be prepared to listen to further suggestions from Members of the Lower House. I thank the Minister&rsquo;s officials for being open to meet representatives from the GRA during the Christmas recess in order to discuss the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not repeat what previous speakers have said. We had a good debate on these matters on Committee Stage and the Minister has taken on board many of our suggestions.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of this issue &mdash; Senator Jim Walsh also adverted to it &mdash; relates to paragraph (<i>c</i>) of amendment No. 9, which states &ldquo;the appointment as chairperson of the committee of a member of the local authority concerned who has been nominated in accordance with <i>paragraph (b)(i),</i>&rdquo;. In other words, the chairperson will be a county councillor. That is extremely important. In recent years there has been a tremendous development in urban local authorities, in particular, whereby close relation<Col N="2647"/>ships have grown up between their housing departments and anti-social units. In South Dublin County Council, the people who possess the relevant information and who have their fingers on the pulse of some of the communities work in the housing department. In law, the most important matter with which local authorities are charged is providing people with houses. This Bill will create links between local authorities, particularly their housing departments which possess information about troublemakers, etc., and the new committees. It is an important and major improvement that there will be direct links between the committees and the existing local authorities. I commend the Minister for taking on board our suggestions, particularly those relating to public meetings, etc. We had some useful exchanges on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their remarks and I pay tribute to them for helping to bring about this improvement to the Bill, as originally drafted. Senator Jim Walsh made a technical point about using the term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; as opposed to that of &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My plan is that every town and county council will have the right to have a committee. If a town council surrenders that right, its members will be entitled to attend meetings of another committee. If Milltown Malbay town council decides that it does not want a committee because of the size of the town, it will be able to opt out and nominate members to a larger committee.</P>
      <P>I do not want the committees to be exclusive. If a community is large enough to have a local authority institution, it is probably big enough to have its own criminal, housing and traffic problems. I do not want it thought, however, that because a place has a town council, it can be coerced into not having one of these committees. If the people of a county decide three committees are enough, otherwise the garda&iacute; would spend half their time attending meetings, the flexibility should exist in the legislation to allow for that.</P>
      <P>There is absolute and qualified privilege. Anything that is not absolute is qualified to some extent. Privilege in this case refers to a discussion at a meeting of a joint policing committee &mdash; a person cannot just stand up and make a speech on the fringes of a meeting. Only a member of the committee or a person attending at the request of the committee is covered, someone shouting from the audience is not covered by privilege.</P>
      <P>It must also be without malice. Malice has two meanings. If a person says something that he or she knows is not true, it is malicious, or if a person says something reckless about whether it is true or not, that is also malicious. If someone is accused of being a rapist in a case, it is no defence to say afterwards that he could have been because no one knew at the time. A reckless allegation without honest belief in its truth is a malicious statement for the purpose of defamation law. That is how malice will be construed.</P><Col N="2648"/>
      <P>I have not had the opportunity to study this in great detail but any subsequent publication of the statement is to be covered by privilege regardless of its being genuinely believed. If someone makes a statement that is proved to be untrue, I want the subsequent publication to be subject to the rubric that it cannot be repeated by someone who knows it is untrue but is trying to piggy-back on the original mistake. If a newspaper reporter hears someone say something he or she believes to be true, the newspaper should be able to publish that as his or her honest belief. If, however, it subsequently transpires that the person is clearly wrong, it should not be possible for a political opponent to publish the minutes repeatedly and say that because he or she believed it at the time, it carries perpetual privilege. I will look at that because we must get it right. It could render an injustice if someone says something that is honestly believed and subject to privilege but it is clear afterwards that someone else is repeating it dishonestly by publishing the minutes of the meeting. That would be unfair to the person on the wrong end of the mistaken statement.</P>

	<P>I mentioned on Committee Stage that I was considering tabling an amendment to section 52(2)(<i>b</i>) to increase the penalty for causing disaffection. The subsection as currently drafted provides for a fine on conviction and indictment not exceeding &euro;25,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. If the indictable penalty of two years is left that way, there would be no power of arrest available to the Garda. This amendment provides for a power of arrest by increasing the term of imprisonment to five years. In keeping with that, the amount of the fine is also being increased to &euro;50,000. That would align the penalty provisions in this section with those in section 53(2)(<i>b</i>), as they will be following acceptance of amendments Nos. 22 and 23.</P>

      <P LI="1" el="5">made in the course of, and in accordance with, the duties of that person&rsquo;s office, shall not be an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Unfortunately I was not in the House to discuss this matter on Committee Stage. Will the Minister examine this issue? Where a complaint is made to the inspectorate, the assumption is that the complaint would always be about members of the force in this jurisdiction. However, it could happen and, in fact, did happen in this jurisdiction some years ago &mdash; although I accept it is an exceptional case &mdash; that there may well be a situation where information could be given to the appropriate investigating authority in another jurisdiction. When I met the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, I was informed that in the case of incidents occurring on the Border she did not believe she had a legal right to obtain information from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because she is not a member of a police force but another body. I seek to make it possible for the inspectorate that will be established following the enactment of the Bill to answer queries from responsible agencies in other jurisdictions that are investigat<Col N="2653"/>ing matters. One might say there is no situation in which that would happen. However, it could happen, for instance that two officers in two forces in two different jurisdictions were involved in something dubious. We should ensure that the exchange of necessary information would be possible between the investigating agencies in both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>I will not press the amendment but I urge the Minister to examine this matter. Is he absolutely certain that at present information can be given between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and, equally, that when the Bill is enacted that will be the case between the inspectorate here and other police agencies, most notably the PSNI? In the past there have been cases of serious complaint made against officers in other jurisdictions which may well have an impact on this jurisdiction. There was a famous case in Roscommon, the Dowra case, whereby an allegation was made against an officer from another police authority in respect of actions that person took. We should not hamper possible investigations occurring on a cross-Border level. That is why I think there needs to be provision for this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This was discussed and opposed on Committee Stage. I have not changed my mind on it. The Minister of State tendered the reasons at that time. There is no similar provision in the Northern Ireland Act of 1998 in regard to the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman and I am told one is not planned. I do not believe it is strictly necessary to make provision of the kind in question.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Section 55 states that a member, or person to whom it applies, shall not disclose in or outside the State any information obtained in carrying out his or her duties. Section 55 (40)(<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) allow the disclosure of information where it is authorised by the Garda Commissioner or otherwise authorised by law. It is difficult to imagine a situation in which the Garda Commissioner would withhold such information from a person in those circumstances. However, there could be cases where the Garda Commissioner would have good reason to say that information must be withheld from an outside body for some other purpose. I do not wish to create a situation in which a member of the Garda, insisting on disclosing information, which would be strange, would subvert the Commissioner&rsquo;s authority in this matter.</P>
      <P>Sections 55 and 73 deal with information which has a harmful effect, which is the crucial element. If the disclosure of information is not harmful then it does not apply. As to whether something has a harmful effect, in dealings with bodies outside the country the Commissioner&rsquo;s authority has to be upheld in this matter. He cannot say this would be dreadfully harmful but Sergeant McDowell could say he does not agree and he <Col N="2654"/>will do so anyway. That would not be an acceptable arrangement, which is why I am not keen on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is correct that police forces routinely exchange information. However, the point made to me by Mrs. O&rsquo;Loan at the time was that she thought it would be wise to have a definite legal position so that she and her commission, which is not a police force but a public body charged with the responsibility of upholding complaints made against members of the police force in Northern Ireland, should have the right to obtain information from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to her investigations. The reverse situation could also apply when the new inspectorate is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I concede that the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman, Mrs. O&rsquo;Loan, would want to have a right to receive information and for there to be no legal obstacle to this being provided. In this case we are dealing with sections 53 and 73 which deal with harmful information. It is expressly provided in both cases that if the Commissioner authorises a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, no offence is committed. Likewise, in respect of section 73, if the ombudsman commission were to permit the release of information then Mrs. O&rsquo;Loan would get it. If the amendment were accepted, any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the ombudsman commission staff, could subvert the authority of the ombudsman commission or the Garda Commissioner by doing a solo run claiming he or she is providing that information. This must be prevented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated on Committee Stage, I am not opposed to the principle behind the amendment. However, there is no need to amend the Bill to achieve that objective. All of the safeguards applicable to members of the public in criminal investigations being carried out by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will apply to members of the force in similar type investigations to be carried out by designated officers of the ombudsman commission. Garda&iacute; will have the same rights, including the right to silence, as <Col N="2655"/>everyone else subject to criminal investigation. Access to electronic recording of interviews will be no different than for any other member of the public.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, made it clear on Committee Stage that under existing procedures set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1984 and electronic recording of interviews regulations made in 1997, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is being interviewed about any alleged offence or suspected illegal activity has the right to have the process recorded. It follows that in the circumstances covered by the Bill, the same situation should apply.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This concerns a matter raised on Committee Stage. Why is the power to search a Garda station restricted to investigation under section 90? The power to search a Garda station must be available when all matters covered in the Bill are being investigated. Is this a restriction on the ombudsman&rsquo;s powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 91 is one of the most important provisions relating to the ombudsman. It concerns the power of the designated investigating staff of the ombudsman commission to carry out searches of Garda stations. Considerable care and attention has been devoted to the provision. Due to the necessity for the ombudsman staff to carry out thorough and searching investigations, it must be balanced with the requirements of State security as Garda stations are repositories for sensitive security related material and information. This power applies to those cases where a complaint involving an offence is concerned. However, the power to search Garda stations is covered by the provisions in section 94 where an investigation can be undertaken by the ombudsman commission directly in the public interest without the necessity for a complaint having been made or on foot of a referral from the Garda Commissioner or by the Minister.</P>
      <P>For reasons connected to the security of the State, this section provides that a search of a Garda station will only be carried out on foot of an order made by a member of the ombudsman commission who must also notify the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is proper that the Commissioner, as head of the force, should be informed of such a serious development. The role of the Minister is more akin to that of arbiter of <Col N="2656"/>the competing rights that might be involved. On the one hand, the Commissioner could contend the search would be prejudicial to the security of the State, while the ombudsman may argue the search is necessary for the proper investigation of a serious complaint or that it concerns the death or serious harm to a person as a result of Garda operations.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that this procedure does not apply to every Garda station. This point seems to have been lost sight of in the course of earlier discussions on the matter. It will only apply to those stations designated by the Minister as stations that may not be searched except to a specified extent. After considering the matter, the Minister can issue directions allowing the search in whole or in part. This procedure is subject to scrutiny by a designated judge of the High Court who reports to the Taoiseach who is obliged to lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Provision is made for any sensitive material which could affect State security to be excised from the report.</P>
      <P>I understood the point made by the Garda Commissioner that he might have deep State secrets in a filing cabinet in a particular station. If the ombudsman wanted to search there, the secrecy of these materials would then be violated. For those categories of Garda stations, a balancing mechanism is needed. If there is a dispute between the two sides, the Minister will act as referee. However, if there were a malign Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he or she is subject to the overriding watchdog role of a judge who will say, in a semi-public way, if he or she operated in a fair way. One could argue that the judge should have the entire function, leaving out the Minister. However, it is not right to ask members of the Judiciary to act as referees of first instance in disputes of this kind. Judges do not decide who has their telephones tapped or post examined. They do have a role in ensuring the statutory process of that activity, subject to fixed procedures involving the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is upheld. If a Minister abuses his powers, a member of the Judiciary, under this supervisory watchdog role, ensures the constitutional rights of a citizen are not violated.</P>
      <P>This is an analogous situation. Sensitive and confidential issues are involved here which is why the whole procedure applies only to cases where offences are involved or in the other circumstances mentioned. Transparency can go so far but in any effective society, some secrets must not be available to public view. Strangers cannot come in and look at these secrets. It is possible that the ombudsman commissioner will retain investigators from outside the jurisdiction. To allow them to walk into the holy of holies and look at the State&rsquo;s deepest secret, is a radical proposition. A balanced structure has been built that if the Garda Commissioner says no to the ombudsman commissioner, the Minister arbitrates. That arbitration process is the subject of supervisory scrutiny by the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2657"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that when all the checks and balances have been determined by this process, someone could smell a rat and the information could be removed. The Minister said it is possible that an investigating officer from the inspectorate could come from outside the State. Presumably, the officer is only there to get information on a specific complaint against a member of the force. It would not be a wholesale trawl through every document but only those specific to the complaint made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that someone, in bad faith, could raise an objection to introduce me as arbiter and to avail of that time to conceal or destroy information. That possibility has to be balanced against the other possibility that if immediate access is granted as of right to avoid that risk, the State&rsquo;s secrets will be available, in effect, to all inspectors operating under the mandate of the ombudsman commission. When the time comes to strike that balance, one has to choose between two slightly competing rights, neither of which is ideal. In an ideal world, one would love the commission&rsquo;s officials to go straight in without any question. One would hope that confidence would be maintained if the officials found anything confidential. We have created this architecture in a certain way for that reason. It is fairly unlikely that there will be surprise raids on parts of Garda stations in which security material is available. Section 81 provides for processes and procedures which require the Garda Commissioner to secure the premises in such circumstances.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Senators will agree that very few of the Bills which are considered by the House receive the volume of debate given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004. That the Bill has received such detailed analysis is an indication of the House&rsquo;s interest in it and its importance. Most of the time, there seemed to be at least six Senators contributing to the Committee Stage debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be commended for introducing far-reaching changes and improvements in the operation of the Garda&rsquo;s policing of this country. He is undertaking major initiatives like the joint policing initiatives, the Garda ombudsman commission and the Garda inspectorate. He has outlined his proposals comprehensively in the House. I thank the Minister for spending so much time here, particularly during the exhaustive Committee Stage debate, when many matters were amplified. He showed a great disposition to adopt many of the sensible amendments which <Col N="2659"/>were proposed. The House has made a significant contribution to the evolution of the Bill. I thank the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am sure many people involved in local government will welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiatives and embrace constructively the opportunity to make policing transparent. Such developments will engender greater support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and introduce an element of accountability to the operation of the system. I thank the Minister&rsquo;s officials for the substantial amount of work they did. I wish the Minister, his family and his officials the compliments of the season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for accepting a number of amendments which were proposed to this comprehensive Bill. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to be present for almost the entire debate. It is right that we dealt with the Bill at such length in recent weeks because it is important. The amendments which were agreed and the contributions which were made by Members will add to the quality of the Bill. The establishment of policing committees, the ombudsman commission and the Garda inspectorate comprise a radical change to what we have been used to since 1924. As Senator Jim Walsh said, the legislation will mean that more respect is given to the force, which will be more visible. People in communities will have greater access to the Garda through policing committees and local representatives. I thank the Minister and his officials. I wish them the compliments of the season and a very good new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome many aspects of this reforming legislation. I thank the Minister and his officials for taking on board many issues which were raised by Opposition Senators and their counterparts on the Government benches. I am pleased that some Opposition amendments were accepted and other amendments were tabled on foot of proposals made by Opposition Senators. The Seanad had a good debate on the various provisions of the Bill, which was given a good hearing in the House. I thank the Minister and his officials for their work on this Bill. I thank the staff of the House, including the Clerk of the Seanad and those who report the debates, for their work during the year.</P>
      <P>I expressed my concerns about security officers when the Minister of State was present in place of the Minister. I may have over-stated my worries in that regard, but I am concerned that complaints procedures have not been put in place in respect of the new types of officers, who will have significant powers, which are being introduced in this Bill. The rest of the Bill underpins the accountability of the Garda, but no such provisions are being introduced in respect of security officers. The Minister of State said that similar personnel are employed by airports and supermarkets, but I do not think it is a fair comparison because the security officers who will be <Col N="2660"/>employed under the Bill will be given State powers and legal backing. Garda&iacute; rarely search people in the National Gallery or the Houses of the Oireachtas, but the new officers may use their powers of search often.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Differences of opinion could arise when one is considering whether the officers are using their powers correctly. There is a significant potential for litigation, which is the opposite to what Senator Jim Walsh said. This provision could lead to more litigation because there is no complaints procedure. Most people prefer not to go to court if they can avoid it. The lack of a complaints procedure in respect of recognised statutory officials is a flaw in the Bill. I welcome the legislation, other than that. I extend best wishes to the Minister and all Senators for the Christmas season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a time when I hoped I would not see another cop in my life, because I had spent five years examining police forces in various places. I welcome the Bill, however. I congratulate the Minister on tackling this enormous task with great energy and vision. The passage of the Bill has been marked by his willingness to engage in sensible debate and his openness to the suggestions made by Senators. Legislation such as this represents a very important development in a democratic society and it represents or at least reflects the importance of policing.</P>
      <P>All we have now are words on paper; the important thing is implementation. I know the Minister will push for it. Sometimes people do not realise the importance of training and the resources needed therefor and I join other Senators in stating that the necessary resources should be made available to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The training and recruitment of garda&iacute; stands comparison with recruitment and training of police officers anywhere else in the world. The Minister&rsquo;s problem may be the training of people other than new recruits to the Garda. One of the most demoralising things is for a young, enthusiastic recruit to come out of the depot and go back into a station only to be met by hoary headed old people who say, &ldquo;That is all right son, that is for the books.&rdquo; In changing attitudes, particularly to community policing, and dealing with policing committees, considerable retraining is necessary. I recommend this to the Minister and hope he is given the necessary resources. I congratulate him and his officials on the Bill and wish them well.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the House, I thank the Minister for the attention he has paid to the House in its discussion of this Bill. We have had three debates on Second Stage and five on Committee Stage. I acknowledge not only the highly intellectual content of the debate but also the gusto with which the Minister approached it. I thank the officials, who were always here on time <Col N="2661"/>and who were very attentive. The Minister has done the Seanad proud and it is proud of him.</P>

	<P>I am very grateful to the Members for their kind remarks and I am sure my officials share my sense of gratitude. This process started shortly after my appointment as Minister and has obviously not yet concluded. The scope of this legislation only became apparent to us months into the process. Two teams were working on different aspects of it and these were eventually united under one set of officials.</P>
      <P>When one examines the process that has led us to our current position, one will realise that I attached very considerable importance to the legislation and therefore decided to publish the heads of the Bill before sending it to the parliamentary draftsman to put into its proper shape and form. I also decided to initiate a public debate which was quite hot and furious in respect of some aspects of the legislation.</P>
      <P>We also received input from the representative associations, including considerable input from the Human Rights Commission, and members of the local authorities, all of which influenced the way in which the Bill has mutated in the legislative process. Without prejudging what will happen in the other House, I can say that I am very happy with the substance of the Bill. It is balanced and has material that meets the standard that most people would have set for this kind of reforming legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is of such importance that it warranted the time the Seanad allowed to consider it. I have said on occasion that I do not imagine I will be considering any legislation of much greater importance. It required immense thought and reflective debate. Bearing in mind that we have a bicameral Parliament, it is great to enter this Chamber and have a less-combative and more reflective debate than one might have in the other House. I thank the Members of the House for allowing sufficient time to debate this Bill and adequate time between its various Stages. It was a pleasure to hear all the improvements suggested by Members on both sides of the House and to incorporate some of them into the Bill. I wish the Cathaoirleach and all the officials of the House, both on-stage and off-stage, and the Leader and her officials a very happy Christmas, a happy new year and a well-earned rest from what has been a very onerous legislative term. In one sense, I regret that I add to the Members&rsquo; difficulties by bringing legislation before this House, but the people are the better for it.</P>

	<P>This amendment would have the effect of causing a potential loss of resources to the health services or an additional demand on the Exchequer to compensate for the loss of income from charges. It is estimated that the income from these charges would lie between &euro;2 million and &euro;2.5 million per week and it would be irresponsible to delay the commencement of the Bill in these circumstances. A restriction on the commencement of the Act cannot be accepted. I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P FLI="0">I would be interested to hear Senator Glynn&rsquo;s comment on this as he worked in the psychiatric services. It makes no sense, and must border on discrimination, to include this reference in the Bill to people &ldquo;including any psychiatric ailment&rdquo;. Why is a distinction made between people who have acute ailments and people with psychiatric ailments? Surely this is fundamentally wrong. It is axiomatic that a psychiatric ailment is an acute one and singling people out in this manner is retrogressive and surely runs counter to all modern legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective of this subsection as drafted is to ensure that where an acute psychiatric ailment is involved the person should not be charged. This is the intent for all acute treatment in hospital. Psychiatric patients with an acute ailment should not be treated any differently from any other patients in a hospital with acute ailments. This principle has been enunciated in various policy documents produced by my Department. Accepting this amendment would have the effect of discriminating against those with psychiatric ailments.</P>

This is a key aspect of the Bill and I am satisfied that the subsection as drafted is the best possible way to address this requirement which is vital to preserve the resources available to the Exchequer and is in the interests of the taxpayer.

      <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 11 is technical, but amendment No. 12 states, &ldquo;In page 5, lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;referred to in the definition of &lsquo;in patient services&rsquo; in section 51.&rdquo; The definition of an inpatient service is circular, chasing its own tail. Subsection (11) begins by derogating from section 51, but in the course of the definition there is reference to what section 51 contains. On the one hand, there is a derogation from the definition in the section, but on the other hand, the Bill incorporates some aspects of it. We have <Col N="2666"/>tabled the amendment to find out which it is to be. The Minister and Government cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 11 could introduce a lack of clarity into the subsection, as it seeks to deal with institutional services regarding inpatient services in a different way from that defined in section 51 of the Health Act 1970. That could lead to confusion, and the Bill as drafted and signed off by the Attorney General and a leading constitutional lawyer remains the best way of dealing with the definition of institutional services required to deal with the issues of charging that the Bill seeks to address. I cannot therefore accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 is linked to the previous one. Once again, I consider that this amendment could introduce a lack of clarity into the subsection, as it seeks to deal with institutional services regarding in-patient services in a different way from that defined in section 51 of the Health Act 1970. I cannot accept that amendment either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply unhappy with some subsections in section 1, something that I have expressed through the amendments. I am aware that we are constrained in this House from making any amendment that might have a financial bearing. Our hands are tied in that respect. However, it has been drawn to my attention by Senator Ulick Burke and others that in subsection (5) it is declared that, subject to subsection (6), the imposition and payment of a relevant charge is and always has been lawful. Surely that should be &ldquo;is and from now on will be considered lawful&rdquo;? Those who will pay the charges never did anything wrong. To suggest otherwise is a terrible slur on the people not involved in this area. The phrase &ldquo;from now on&rdquo; should have been used, since it would have made far more sense. The Government is trying to turn back the clock, despite it always telling us that we cannot do things backwards or in retrospect. This is a clear case of the Government rewriting history and turning it around. The Minister should say why the phrase &ldquo;from now on&rdquo; was not used instead of &ldquo;always has been&rdquo;. This is a crazy scenario.</P><Col N="2667"/>
      <P>We tabled amendment No. 8 to section 1, which we have already discussed. On the imposition and payment of charges and rendering them both legal, those who made the payments never acted illegally. They were within the law, and there is no need to render their action lawful as the Government is now saying. However, the Minister should have rendered the demands for payment lawful, which is why we sought to address that issue in the amendment. Section 1 is fundamentally flawed, seeking to turn back the clock and put the blame on the patient, who had nothing to do with this debacle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe this section is unconstitutional because it breaches people&rsquo;s property rights. The Constitution was referred to but I am not sure if that aspect was mentioned by anyone else; I was not here for the entire debate today. I have thought of comparisons. It is similar to applying income tax retrospectively, something that could not be done constitutionally. The same problem may arise again if someone challenges this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently, section 53(2)(<i>a</i>) of the original Act provides that the Minister for Health and Children may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations providing for the imposition of charges for inpatient services in specified circumstances on persons without full eligibility. That includes those over 70 who have an automatic entitlement to medical care on age grounds, or unspecified classes of such persons. We have never said that older people did anything wrong; nor have we accused them of such. To say otherwise is wrong and irresponsible. It has recently been brought to our attention that there is a legal problem, and this Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to bring legal clarity to the situation. The practice of charging has continued since 1976. It is not as if we have intentionally been taking money from people while providing them with nothing in return. The money was taken in good faith and in part for the care that they were receiving. The people who were paying it would not have the same difficulty in doing so that some Members have expressed today.</P>

    <P>Section 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, after line 33, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;3.&mdash;That following the passing of this Act that a review group would be established to look at the adequacy of the minimum amount retained by the patient.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="2668"/>
      <P FLI="0">I raised this issue on Second Stage. The Irish Senior Citizens&rsquo; Parliament has pointed out that the provisions in this section essentially leave the patient with a minimum amount out of his or her pension. I understand it amounts to approximately &euro;35. The point has been made to me that if a person bought a newspaper and a packet of cigarettes every day, and perhaps had a pint of Guinness every other day, the &euro;35 would be almost gone. There are many other things that people take for granted that a person might want to do, such as buying clothes, toiletries or gifts for his or her family. Those small things might be luxuries in a certain sense, but most people take them for granted, and they would not be able to afford them.</P>
      <P>Many people in nursing homes are still able to partake in various activities, and we should encourage them to do so. They might wish to get involved in a local group or hobbies. If they want to visit the cinema, they will not be able to afford it, given the payments with which they are currently being left. I have, therefore, tabled this amendment to ensure the matter may be reviewed. I want that review to be mandatory following the passing of this legislation. The average of &euro;35 should perhaps be increased to a more reasonable level, allowing people to do things that we should want them to be able to do if they are in nursing homes. There are many reasons why it would be good for the State to allow that. It means that people retain their independence and can do things. If they can keep active, their health prospects will also be improved. I ask that the Minister to consider taking this on board. I believe that is possible. If the Minister of State will not ensure that is done, will he inform me? Will he arrange for the setting up of such a review group, even if it is not provided for in the legislation? Will he take on the issue raised by the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. It is shocking that we would treat in such a shameful manner people who worked all their lives, paid their taxes, reared their families and made a contribution to society when life was not half as good as it is now. These people would have paid a high rate of tax, which Senator McHugh and I can barely imagine, while probably paying off a mortgage at an interest rate of 18% or 19%.</P>
      <P>The Government considers that &euro;35 per week is plenty for them, but it takes no account of expenses they may have. One gentleman called to my clinic recently who is in receipt of an Irish pension even though he had lived abroad for a long number of years but he had worked here prior to that. His American pension paid for the cost of his care in a nursing home while his reduced Irish pension meant the difference for him between living and existing. That opened my eyes to this issue.</P>
      <P>What Senator Tuffy suggested is long overdue. It is an issue we need to consider. We have an ageing population. In 30 years nearly one fifth of <Col N="2669"/>our population will be over the age of 65. Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s idea is an excellent one and I have great pleasure in seconding the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is clearly covered in the Bill. I see no necessity for this amendment to be included in the Bill. It is a policy matter which can be given further consideration in the Department or discussed at the relevant joint committee. It is inappropriate to include provision for it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne referred to the shameful manner in which older people are being treated. If one checks the record, few other Administrations have the same record as this one in increases made in the old age pension. That shows we are very much aware of the contribution old people have made and have acknowledged that in the large increases given in pensions in recent years.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 5, after line 33, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the impact of this legislation on patients in Community Units who are admitted for acute medical illness or rehabilitation, e. g. minor stroke or fractured femur where the length of stay exceeds 30 days.&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State may be commended among his electoral base in Kildare for being the man to put legislation through in a fast and effective way, but yesterday and today are sad days for democracy. One cannot put such sensitive legislation, which will affect the daily lives of a vulnerable group of people, through both Houses with such speed.</P>
      <P>The irony of today is that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is on record only half an hour ago for commending the workings of this House and the reasoning and importance of &ldquo;informed debate&rdquo;. <Col N="2670"/>However, we have not had time for an informed debate on this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment before us seems to be about a different subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is. I am building up to it. It is ironic that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is on record as saying this is an excellent forum for putting legislation through.</P>
      <P>I wish to be clear about this amendment. There will be anomaly regarding the 30-day rule that will apply to elderly patients. I stressed this point on Second Stage, but the response I got did not address it. I will give a specific example. An elderly patient who has a minor stroke may not go to the general hospital, as we are all aware, and Senator Glynn will know the procedure, having been a former member of a health board. Such an elderly patient may have to go to a district hospital or a community hospital and after 30 days he or she will be charged. This legalisation puts in place a legal framework to provide for the charging of such a patient.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue on two grounds. First, this provision is ageist. A 14 year old boy who breaks his leg and spends more than 30 days in a general hospital will not be charged, neither will a 24 year old man in similar circumstances. Therefore, why will an elderly patient who has suffered the same condition be charged after a hospital stay of 30 days? I appreciate the response to this issue I got from the officials on Second Stage, but there is a grey area in regard to that anomaly. It is discrimination at its worst.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s help on this matter. I am not proposing a substantive change or the employment of consultants to carry out a review. We seek that the Department addresses the provision to charge elderly patients after a hospital stay of 30 days. It will affect an elderly patient who has a minor stroke or who has a fractured femur who spends 31 or 32 days in a hospital. How much will such patients be charged per day?</P>
      <P>I need clarification on this issue. It is a sensitive issue for the community of elderly people who will be discriminated against and the provision is ageist. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would clarify the matter. He can correct me if I am wrong and, if I am, I will be delighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have the luxury of debating this legislation over a number of days. I explained the reasons we are in this position.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion of a review of this provision, any Government that introduces legislation will always monitor it and be conscious of its impact. If this Senator or any other Senator or Deputy considers that legislation is having an impact that we had not foreseen, it is his or her duty to highlight that and bring it to the attention of the Minister. In any case where legislation we introduce causes undue <Col N="2671"/>hardship in particular areas, we would be conscious of that and keen to make changes.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment, this is a matter for detailed consultation in my Department. It is not appropriate for inclusion in the Bill because it deserves in-depth examination. In light of that, I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State acknowledged that there is a need for extensive consultation in this regard. This is discrimination against the elderly, who are being treated differently from other members of society. I ask that the amendment be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not disagree with much of what the Senator said. However, it would not be appropriate to include the amendment in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that. However, I want a commitment from the Minister of State to a follow-up review of this issue. It is not good that a significant proportion of our population is being discriminated against and treated differently from the rest of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation is always under scrutiny and there have been many amendment Bills over the years. I respect the concerns expressed on the other side of the House and respect all points of view. However, having worked in this area for many years, the State cannot be expected to pay pensions to sustain elderly people&rsquo;s everyday needs in a long-term care institution but still have them receive the same level of income. That is not realistic. While I understand the Senator&rsquo;s point, I do not agree with him. A different situation obtains in regard to elderly people in long-term care. The old concept of shelter and maintenance comes into play, which is a long-established principle in long-term care institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Senator Glynn&rsquo;s intervention. He is the old dog for the hard road and a seasoned campaigner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just stating the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts are that on the one hand, the State gives a pensioner money and on the other hand, if an elderly pensioner breaks his or her leg, the State takes the money from him or her after 30 days. For example, a social welfare recipient is given money by the State. However, if that person has to stay in hospital to receive treatment for a period of 30 days, the State does not take back the money. The only group being discriminated against are the elderly. It is a serious and sensitive issue which must be addressed. I appreciate the Minister is in a corner but I want a commitment that the measure will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The only reason we have reached this impasse is because the Bill is going through so quickly. <Col N="2672"/>The issue should have been raised in the D&aacute;il but it was not because of the speed of the Bill&rsquo;s passage. This is <i>grand prix</i> speed. To put through a Bill in two days is not acceptable. I need a commitment from the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>I must reply to Senator Glynn. This is new legislation. I am worried about the legal mechanism that will be created with the passage of the Bill. I am concerned that a patient who suffers from an acute illness will be charged after 30 days. If having a worry is baseless-&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>My concern is with the period of 30 days. I am glad the Minister has put on the record of the House that any patient receiving acute treatment in any community or district <Col N="2673"/>hospital will not be charged after 30 days. I am delighted this will be the case under this new legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers of State, Deputies Se&aacute;n Power and Brian Lenihan, for their contribution to the debate. I genuinely dislike the Bill and the way it came about. When the matter was repeatedly raised in the other House, it showed democracy in action. Thankfully, clarification was given on the original Bill and action was taken to rectify the problem. However, I have serious doubts in regard to the action taken as it may lead to further difficulty. If the <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2,000 is challenged in court, it could open the floodgates for more payments.</P>
      <P>I suspect that if someone did take a court challenge, he or she might well receive a higher payment, in which case all bets would be off. We might have a lot of expensive litigation ahead of us. I am gravely concerned about people who were unable to get their elderly relatives into public nursing homes due to bed shortages and were then obliged to opt for private nursing homes. There is a court case pending on that matter, which has all sorts of implications.</P>
      <P>That health boards did not charge people when they complained is truly shocking. Those who did not complain had to pay the amount involved which, surely, is wrong. I hope it never recurs. I appreciate that mistakes occur and that there is a difficulty with this legislation but if a similar situation arises in future and a health board realises there is a difficulty &mdash; whether it becomes aware of it through the Office of the Ombudsman or elsewhere &mdash; it should have a &ldquo;one for all&rdquo; system in place. A situation should not be allowed to develop whereby people who can scream and defend themselves get off paying the charge, while those who cannot must pay.</P>
      <P>There are many worrying aspects to the Bill. It is amazing that not alone is the legislation being rushed through the Houses but we now have an earlier signature motion for the President to sign it into law. Next week, people will be affected by this unexpected legislation when it becomes law. That is a regrettable occurrence in Christmas week. The sharing and caring image the Government sought to create at its Inchydoney retreat is well gone now. Maybe the Government should plan a return visit to Inchydoney during the January break to try to regain its soul.</P>
      <P>I wish everyone a happy Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with my colleague, Senator Browne. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their patience and perseverance during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the House. I assume that it is not an easy job being a departmental official when legislation is going through the Houses very quickly. The Minister of State&rsquo;s staff must be commended on all their work, including the work that will need to be done following the Bill&rsquo;s enactment. There is a grey area concerning elderly patients who are recovering in district and community hospitals. When is a patient with an acute illness reclassified as being in the recovery stage? Work needs to be done on defining convalescence, including physiotherapy treatment, for example, following a leg injury. It can be a matter of medical opinion but the important thing is to protect our elderly at all times. I am glad the elderly will be treated no differently from the rest of the population.</P>
      <P>I thank the Clerk of the Seanad and her team for all their work during the year. I appreciate the time and effort they have expended. I wish you, Sir, and the Minister of State a very happy Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and my colleagues in the House for their contributions to the debate. In considering the disbursement of resources it is imperative that they should be allocated in such a way as to achieve the optimum benefit for those in receipt of them.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is relatively brief in content, it is an important measure. There is a difference between the acute and chronic stages of an illness. There was a proposal earlier to delete the words &ldquo;including any psychiatric hospital&rdquo; but certain categories of psychiatric illness can take quite some time to treat, whereas others may be of relatively short duration. It is difficult, therefore, when one is dealing with an area as broad as this, to be precise or concise in framing legislation to achieve optimum benefit for those affected.</P>
      <P>Early in the new year, we should have a debate on services for the elderly, which is a constantly evolving issue. A number of health boards, including my own area which includes the regional hospital in Mullingar, have consultant physicians specialising in geriatric medicine. In addition, St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital has a department of psychiatric care for the elderly. As chairman of the board, I was pleased to officially open that facility.</P>
      <P>When we have a debate on services for the elderly in 2005, I am sure positive suggestions will be made concerning what is being done well and what services could be improved. There is a range of model practice concerning care for the elderly which we should examine early in the new session.</P>
      <P>I wish you, Sir, and the staff of the House a holy and peaceful Christmas, as well as prosperity in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their work on the Bill. Obviously, I <Col N="2675"/>do not support the legislation but I accept that the Department has had to deal with the issue. I appreciate the time constraints involved. The most important point is that there has to be a better way of proceeding than this one. There are not many alternatives for elderly people who require accommodation and nursing care. Very little has been done to provide sheltered housing for the elderly, be it private or State-assisted through local authorities. If the elderly clients of nursing homes were living in private rented accommodation and were assessed on their incomes, the State would probably be paying them rent supplements.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation, however, we are treating elderly people differently from the rest of the community. Even if people are considered to owe money for various services, it is not generally deducted from their payments. We should ensure that older people have a basic minimum income, no matter where they reside. This was the point I sought to make on behalf of the senior citizens&rsquo; group. What is being left to them under the provisions of this Bill, however, does not approach a minimum income. I hope the Minister of State and his departmental officials will re-examine this issue to ensure that at the very least, such elderly people will receive a decent payment.</P>
      <P>Down the line, we may well decide to give payments to families for child care. In that case, we will say such care is necessary and we will do our best to ensure that people receive such payments and that they are not left without a reasonable income. The same applies for the elderly. I hope the Minister of State will re-examine this matter.</P>

	<P>Rushed legislation is bad legislation. I sympathise with the officials who had to shove this Bill through at the behest of the Minister. It has now been passed by the House. I would like to have an assurance from the Minister of State that the payment of &euro;2,000 to the people affected will not be politicised in any way, and that lists of those in receipt of the payment will not be circulated to Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Deputies and Senators.</P>

	<P>This Bill was not of the Government&rsquo;s choosing. We found ourselves in a situation which required action and we have been responsible in the manner with which we have dealt with the issue. There was no option but to pass this legislation before Christmas. I thank all the Members who have facilitated the Government in making this possible. I wish to pay thanks to the staff of the Department of Health and Children for their hard work and dedication. They have put in many hours and burned a lot of midnight oil this week in making everything possible. Much of this work is carried out behind the scenes and few people are aware of it. I wish to acknowledge their contribution to the democratic process.</P>
      <P>I wish the Acting Chairman, officials of the Department and Members of both Houses a very happy Christmas and good health in the year ahead. Go raibh maith agaibh.</P>
