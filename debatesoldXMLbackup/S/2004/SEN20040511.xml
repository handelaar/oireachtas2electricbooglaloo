	<P>I have received notice from Senator Mansergh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make a statement on the support the Government has given since 1989 to the Ulster Scots Agency in light of recent events.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee Stage, to the taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 6.30 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach will be aware of my request under Standing Order 29.</P>

	<P>We will come to that later.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will be aware that the Government repeatedly tells parties throughout the island and in Britain that there can be no renegotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. How is it, credible, therefore, for the Government to tell us that there can be no change to the Agreement when last October, in discussions with the IRA, it attempted to change the Agreement, to which we all signed up and accepted in 1998?</P>
    <P>A commitment was made to both Houses in 1998 that the brutal murderers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe would not be let out of prison under the early release programme. That commitment was also made to Mrs. McCabe in 1999 in correspondence from the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In the context of the latest revelations, which were <Col N="942"/>confirmed today by the president of Sinn F&eacute;in, that policy had the full support not only of this House, but also of the Irish people. The Government is now attempting to change that policy without recourse to the McCabe family or this House.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s actions have been disgraceful in the circumstances and it is vital that a statement is made on the matter by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, who has been huffing and puffing about the IRA over the past four months although he and his like were involved in secret negotiations last October to secure the release of the killers in question. This is terrible and the House needs to debate the matter.</P>
    <P>It is a certainty that when a person puts his life on the line for this country, we, as citizens of a republic, have an obligation to defend the memory of that person, to ensure the courts uphold the law and that those responsible for crimes against that person are adequately charged and serve their time in prison. The memory of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe has not been honoured in any way by the actions of the Government and the revelations about those actions over the past 24 hours. We need an urgent debate on this matter not only to maintain the integrity of this House and this Republic, but also the integrity of the peace process itself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The House should be reminded that, on three or four occasions in the past 20 years, it debated capital punishment and its elimination. Senator Ross brought forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on one occasion. We discussed the matter during Private Members&rsquo; business and the final legislation was introduced by the Government. There was considerable agreement on both sides during that debate and one of the issues on which there was absolute agreement, apart from the abolition of the barbaric practice of capital punishment, was the importance of the fact that those responsible for the deaths of garda&iacute; on duty serve their full sentences.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with the points raised by Senator Brian Hayes. We have frequently been quick in the House to criticise and ask questions of garda&iacute;. On occasions when they put their lives on the line, we must be seen to stand with them. I do not understand what the Government is doing regarding this matter. The courts have spoken on it and we should live with it. The Cathaoirleach is from west Limerick and has seen this matter from both sides, but even given that deals must be done at certain times, I cannot understand the form of negotiation that begins by putting one&rsquo;s trump card on the table for somebody to respond to. This shows absolute ineptness. I mentioned second-termism before. In this context, if certain deals have to be done, they should be done after due consultation, negotiation and discussion and, particularly, with sensitivity to the needs of the families involved.</P><Col N="943"/>
    <P>I, too, would like a clear statement from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this issue. His approach to this matter is extraordinary and in stark contrast to his approach to eight or nine young people who expressed their disagreement with the Government on issues of international politics in a way that many in this House did over the years at the same age and who had the law applied to them by the Garda. They were rightly brought to court but were not given bail at a time when criminals are walking free, garda killers are being told they can walk free and there is a revolving door system in jails. In a democracy, we should encourage people to speak out and express their views, within the law obviously, but there should also be a certain sense of proportion in the way with which people are dealt. There is no proportion in a justice system that puts demonstrating students behind bars without giving them bail and allows garda killers to walk free. I simply cannot agree with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to propose a vote of sympathy but I note with regret the tragic passing of Mick Doyle this morning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Leader of the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the issue the Leader of the Opposition raised, it is clear the Government has participated in underhand negotiations with the republican movement about the possible release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. Everybody in this island was outraged at the cold blooded and brutal manner in which Detective Garda McCabe was murdered on that fateful morning in Adare in 1996 by members of the IRA. It is, to say the least, disappointing to discover through the BBC that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach were party to negotiations that could have possibly resulted in the early release of those prisoners.</P>
    <P>There is a number of things wrong with this proposal. First, it undermines the Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach explicitly stated in the Lower House in 1999 that these people would not qualify for early release in the context of the early release programme under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Second, in 1999, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, wrote as follows to the detective&rsquo;s widow:</P>
    <P LI="1">I hope that what I said at the meeting provided you with assurance that there is no question of granting early release to those concerned, either under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement or, for that matter, on any other basis either. I want to assure you now, formally and in writing, that the Government&rsquo;s position, right from the beginning, was that the men concerned are not covered by the terms <Col N="944"/>of the Good Friday Agreement and that their transfer to Castlerea will have no bearing whatsoever on the question of early release. They will serve their time in Castlerea just as they would have in Portlaoise.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It is an affront to the memory of Detective Garda McCabe and a profound insult to the family to get a written commitment from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and many verbal commitments from the Taoiseach that these people would not be released only to discover from the BBC last Friday that this is exactly what the Government was planning to do. It is unspeakable. This was not contained in the programme for Government and the expressed views of the Taoiseach and Ministers in this regard could not have been clearer. I share the anger expressed in the House today and call on those responsible for these underhand consultations to come to the House to debate this sensitive and important issue.</P>
    <P>I am aware the House debated the disabilities issue recently but a statement from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform yesterday confirmed that some of the measures needed in the disabilities Bill and which have been sought by the Opposition and disabilities rights groups will not be included. Will the Leader exert as much pressure as possible on the relevant Minister to ensure the Bill is published before the European and local elections? There is a presumption in some quarters that the proposed Bill will not go any further than the Disabilities Bill that was shelved prior to the 2002 general election. The Bill should be published before the elections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend to the House the thoughtful, considered and balanced contribution by the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Brady, to the discussion of the current difficulties in the North. It was an exercise in church statesmanship and we look forward to other church leaders coming forward with similar thoughtful contributions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised by Senator Brian Hayes, everybody was disgusted by the killing of Detective Garda McCabe. The Fianna F&aacute;il Party in Opposition made it clear that the killers would not be covered by any agreement. They were not covered by the Good Friday Agreement and, whenever they are released, it will not be under the terms of that Agreement like everybody else who falls into that category. They were explicitly excluded from it.</P>
    <P>They have now served almost eight years so &ldquo;early release&rdquo; is not really the appropriate term to use. I have great respect for what the colleague of Detective Garda McCabe, who was shot and seriously wounded, had to say on the subject in an interview recently. The peace process and agreement in the North has a moral purpose. If all we want to do is moralise, we might as well not have started with the peace process in the first place.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="945"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have no intention of moralising on the matter, coming from west Limerick I know of the profound effect this tragedy had on our area. I am well aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitments, which have been consistent on this issue. The views of the people I represent in the area would very much reflect the Government&rsquo;s thinking up to now. However, the leak to the BBC, regardless of its source, has now happened. Limerick people now believe it is rather disingenuous and inconsistent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has been very outspoken in lashing out at the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in, to take a vow of silence on this issue.</P>
    <P>Along with those in my area, I want clarity from the Government. Is what is said now consistent with what the Government stated in the past and does it intend to release the murderers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe or not? In my area people have been appalled that the perpetrators might be released. If this was a bargaining chip used in the last round of negotiations, why has the information been released now? Are we being softened up for the release, which may happen shortly?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend what I am about to say be hurtful to anyone. I deplore the murder of Detective Garda McCabe and I sympathise with his relatives. I equally deplore the murders of 306 RUC officers. I live near the widows and children of some of those RUC officers who were asked to make an enormous sacrifice in the interests of the peace process. By and large most of them did so on the basis that it is the price to be paid. These people should have been covered by the Agreement all along. I could have lived with a situation in which nobody was released. There was a strong argument for not releasing anybody on either side until they had done their time. However, one knows the politics of the situation and the difficulties of negotiations.</P>
    <P>It seems invidious to make distinctions between those who murdered garda&iacute; and those who murdered RUC officers. This runs the risk of giving the impression to people in Northern Ireland that somehow it was acceptable to murder an RUC officer or, in any case, was less culpable than murdering a garda. We need to think very clearly and for a long time about this. People on all sides in Northern Ireland were asked to make a sacrifice and pay a very high price &mdash; and they did so. People in this part of the country should be prepared to accept that and, if asked, to make the same sort of sacrifice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Mansergh about Dr. Brady&rsquo;s intervention, which by and large was judicious. As a member of the Church of Ireland &mdash; not a Free Presbyterian &mdash; I was absolutely horrified to hear the truculent, ignorant and abusive response of Ian Paisley Junior who, during a radio interview, persisted in referring to Archbishop Brady as &ldquo;Mr. Brady&rdquo;. I <Col N="946"/>found that especially offensive considering that his father has a degree from Bob Jones University yet is referred to politely as &ldquo;Dr. Paisley&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh is again right on the McCabe matter. We must accept the practicality of the issue. If the release of the prisoners leads to the disbandment of the IRA and the destruction of its weapons, which is the only context in which the Taoiseach indicated it was possible, it is a sacrifice we should humbly ask the McCabe family to accept. In the same context, Senator Maurice Hayes referred to RUC widows and families who have had to accept this. However, it should be noted that these prisoners were not covered by the Good Friday Agreement. While the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave a categorical assurance to the widow at the time of their incarceration, she has not been consulted since. The matter should be explained to her most particularly. It is very clear that the IRA lied about the killing by saying it was not involved. Its political leadership, which is the same as the IRA leadership, is now telling a different story. There are many areas of confusion in this which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I wish quickly to raise two other matters. While I have raised one in the past couple of weeks, it is only today that I have documents to give to the Leader. I am revolted by the dishonesty of the President of the United States of America who claims to be horrified and disgusted by what has gone on as if it involved the actions of a collection of people down the chain of command. It is United States policy. I have documents which I will photocopy and give to the Leader which indicate that Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen, was kidnapped at JFK Airport and exported to Syria to be tortured in the presence of CIA operatives. This is contract torture. As the Leader indicated, this came from the top. The language was set at the top. The leadership welshed on the International Criminal Court and said the Geneva Convention did not apply. It established the prison at Guantanamo Bay and exported methods and personnel from there to Abu Ghraib prison. This is clearly a matter of policy. The leadership had the reports and has known about this for over a year. It is lying through its teeth if it says it did not. It is not acceptable. The Taoiseach should raise these matters on a case-by-case basis and name the people involved when he meets President Bush.</P>
    <P>On the same basis, I ask that in his meeting with the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, the Taoiseach raise matters involving Tibet which have been of concern to this House. I apologise to the mandarin opposite whom I see smiling at my Chinese pronunciation which I am sure is quite inferior to his. Perhaps he learned Mandarin at his minor public school.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The elaboration of names is unnecessary.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="947"/>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Can one not even name the Chinese Premier? He would love it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, you should stick to the point. There are time constraints.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should urge the re-opening of negotiations with the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the release of the Panchen Lama who was kidnapped ten years ago. The Taoiseach should also urge the release of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche. While the Cathaoirleach has said it is not proper to name people, doing so is the only way of getting them out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has released half a dozen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>If she can find him, will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to the House to debate the failure of the Government&rsquo;s policy to ease inflation in the housing market? We saw in today&rsquo;s press that some &euro;17.5 billion has been borrowed from lending agents by young couples trying to acquire a house of their own. This proves Government policy has failed. House prices have increased by 20% in the past 12 months. The housing strategy has failed. It is time to get cronyism and the Government&rsquo;s policy of looking after vested interests out of the way and to release more land on which to build houses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has failed to deliver on its policy to deliver houses for young people trying to set up a home of their own.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sad to hear a Member of this House say we have to pay a price for peace in this country. Anybody who has lived and been in communication with the people of Ireland for the past 20 years realises a price has been paid by people on all sides who suffered murder at the hands of those who went about dealing with matters their way.</P>
    <P>Members of this House do not understand the public&rsquo;s feelings in this regard if they think the release of the murderers of Detective Garda McCabe is the last issue to be settled before we move forward. Is this another price? Are Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA moving the goalposts on a daily basis? What next, following the release of Detective Garda McCabe&rsquo;s murderers? How can we expect the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have confidence in the system when we brush aside the murder of their comrades? How can we justify this and say we must accept it in order to deal with outstanding issues? It is time the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, came to this House and stated clearly and unequivocally if this is the <Col N="948"/>final issue on which we must deal with the IRA or if we are to hear of more. It is imperative the Taoiseach and Minister stop equivocating and express their final decision in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to this House to tell us if CIA operatives, encouraging or ordering the torture of prisoners in Iraqi prisons or those described as contractors &mdash; mercenaries would be a better description &mdash; are passing through Shannon Airport from the United States of America? The Irish public is of the opinion that only members of the armed forces are passing through Shannon Airport. However, it appears that may not be the case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to those who have raised serious questions regarding the possibility of the early release of the murderers of Detective Garda McCabe. The Taoiseach has a duty to tell this House what are his plans, if any, in regard to this proposal.</P>
    <P>I wish also to draw Members&rsquo; attention to the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme regarding people with intellectual disabilities aired last night. It highlighted, once again, the plight of many families throughout the country trying to cope with children and adults suffering such disabilities and the lack of services available to them.</P>
    <P>The disability Bill has not yet come before us. I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to bring it before us prior to the local elections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Bannon that not alone do we need a debate on housing but we need an urgent debate on the value for money being provided by local authorities and the enforcement or lack of enforcement of the planning laws. There are many sharp differences in that regard as Members will be aware. It would be timely for the Leader to arrange such a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on housing. Some 170,000 new houses were built in the UK last year and some 67,000 new houses have been built in Ireland this year, a remarkable achievement.</P>
    <P>I join the calls for a debate on Iraq. I have come to the conclusion that the way to end war is not with war, as was suggested with the war to end all wars, but with peace. I am disturbed by what is happening in Iraq and I believe we would benefit by having a debate. I regard the United States as a benevolent big brother and I am disturbed to see things happening which I do not associate with the American people or with their aspirations. I would welcome a debate on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>As many Members raised the issue of Detective Garda McCabe, God rest him, I will read some paragraphs from a statement <Col N="949"/>given to me by the Government. Of course, it will not satisfy everyone but it will put matters in context and we can then talk in a less formal way about the issue. The statement is long. I shall not read all of it but merely quote five of the paragraphs:</P>
    <P LI="1">This issue remains on the agenda. Sinn F&eacute;in have made it clear that they are unable to convince the IRA leadership to move away from violence, as we all want them to, without the Castlerea prisoner situation being resolved. [Those convicted are in Castlerea Prison].</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">The Government can consider the early release of these prisoners only in the context where the complete ending of paramilitarism by the IRA and decommissioning is assured.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">The Government cannot see any prospect of a restoration of the Good Friday Agreement in the absence of such a definitive outcome.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">If the Government were to make such a decision it would be doing so in a context where this island would be looking forward to an entirely new situation in which the IRA had become a thing of the past.</P>
    <P LI="1" el="0">If such a situation arises, the concerns of the McCabe family, Detective Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan, his colleague, the garda&iacute; and the public at large will continue to be central to the Government consideration of the matter.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I would prefer that this statement be read formally in reply to Senators and I will go through&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the statement not refer to complete decommissioning?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am repeating the statement which was given to me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Leader accept it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Everything said here today is sincerely felt. However, people view this matter from different perspectives. I admire the honesty of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in talking through this situation openly and fully.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>They were flushed out by the BBC.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was disingenuous of them. They must realise that Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA are going to do the same thing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please. Allow the Leader to reply without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised this matter and I know he will call for a vote under a particular Standing Order, which is his right. I understand his viewpoint and that of Fine Gael. Senator Brian Hayes has a right to express his views in this forum and he did so with great passion.</P><Col N="950"/>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked why the Government&rsquo;s trump card has been put on the table at this stage. Senator McCarthy spoke on the same matter. He also asked if full rights for people with disabilities would be granted by the disability Bill. I think it has been made clear that rights as defined do not appear to be, but we have not seen the Bill. Senator McCarthy asked if the Bill would be published before the European and local elections. I will inquire about that and I hope to have an answer tomorrow. Report Stage of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill will be debated this week in the D&aacute;il. I hope we will debate the Bill in the Seanad next week.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh drew attention to the statement of Archbishop Brady, which was, indeed, very fine. He also spoke of his respect for the views of Detective Garda Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan, the colleague of Garda McCabe.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane asked for clarity. I believe the statement I have read gave that clarity, in so far as there can be clarity about such matters. That is where the difficulty lies.</P>
    <P>It is a feature of the Seanad that we can have different viewpoints depending on where we come from. In that context, Senator Maurice Hayes spoke of the remarkable generosity of the widows and families of murdered RUC men and the sacrifices they made.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the response of Mr. Ian Paisley Junior to Archbishop Brady and also to the situation in Iraq. There will be a debate tomorrow on Africa and development co-operation. I hope there will be a debate on Iraq next week if the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, is available. The Senator asked that the Taoiseach raise these issues with President Bush when he visits Ireland. I hope he will.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We are daily assailed on radio and television by the situation in Iraq, which is far worse than before. Senator Norris also asked that the Taoiseach raise the issue of the Dalai Lama with the Chinese Premier.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon called for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to come to the House to debate housing strategy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comments of Senator Ulick Burke on the price paid for peace, the Senator was referring to an earlier contribution made in the context of the sacrifices of widows of murdered RUC officers and the generosity of their responses when questioned. The Senator can pluck half a sentence from another contribution but if it is not taken in context, it may not be correctly understood. While there is no doubt this is a serious matter, there will be pain for everyone involved if it reaches that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry wanted to know the status of American personnel travelling through Shannon Airport, about which I can inquire. There was a <Col N="951"/>recent article on the matter and I understand the Senator&rsquo;s concern.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Terry&rsquo;s point, it would be of no avail for the Taoiseach to come to House to discuss the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe or its impact on future events, and this would only cause further pain. I saw only the end of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on disability. I can find out for the Senator whether the disability Bill will be brought to the House before the local elections.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of value for money in regard to local authorities and Senator Hanafin called for a debate on the situation in Iraq.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;This Act (other than Part 3) shall not come into operation until such time as the Commission established by Part 3 certifies that the other provisions of this Act are in accordance with the highest standards of transparency and accountability and safeguard fully the integrity and privacy of the voting process in a verifiable manner.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I welcome to the House the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher. I also welcome the opportunity to debate this critical Bill in light of the major fiasco in respect of how the Government does business and conducts elections. The public&rsquo;s confidence in the system has been shattered to a point which is extremely worrying.</P>
    <P>The issue should have been handled with care and sensitivity in a professional manner. However, experts in IT, Opposition spokespersons and the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, who debated the issue at some length, advised and contributed, were criticised and knocked by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. At some stages they were accused of scaremongering, which was not the case. The electronic voting commission&rsquo;s report has vindicated the many fine contributions made in various fora by those people.</P>
    <P>From the outset, this issue should have been dealt with by an all-party Oireachtas committee <Col N="952"/>in a similar manner to the committee on land prices, chaired by Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan. That is what happens when consensus politics prevails and a common sense approach is taken by a Minister. It is also what happens at Government level when a decent attempt is made to introduce good legislation or examine an area which needs tighter or newer controls. Unfortunately, that has not been the case in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>In a stubborn and deliberate manner, the Minister refused point blank on a number of occasions to listen to the advice put forward by many interested and qualified parties. This has led to an undermining of the electoral system. The Minister has now spent in excess of &euro;52 million on e-voting. This is a large sum of money which could be well spent in other critical areas. One need only look at the health service and the many hospitals bursting at the seams and in need of funding.</P>
    <P>We have yet to be convinced, as we were in respect of the Minister&rsquo;s case on e-voting, in regard to its cost. Mr. Joe McCarthy has pioneered the argument that these machines, which are now in storage across the country, may very well be obsolete and of no real benefit to this country if we take up the mantle of e-voting and the commission decides we should do so.</P>
    <P>Is it fair to waste &euro;52 million on an issue as notorious as this at any time? If this happened in private industry, the manager responsible would be shown the door quicker than his or her feet could touch the ground. It is a failing of the Taoiseach to allow the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to continue in his Department.</P>
    <P>I understand the purpose of this Bill is to indemnify the commission in respect of its next report, which I welcome. I pay tribute to the members of the committee for the brave way in which they deliberated and for their result, which reflected the long hours of hard work expended by them. I urge the Minister of State to examine this amendment and the points which will be raised by Senator Quinn, whose amendment No. 4 is being discussed with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of amendment No. 4, this is an important Committee Stage debate because ours is the only House which can revise the Bill at this stage and I hope all sides will face up to that challenge. I hope Opposition contributions are constructive and that the Government will consider and accept amendments no matter where they come from.</P>
    <P>The aim of my amendments to help achieve the best possible electronic voting system. My first amendment has two purposes, the first of which is to facilitate the operation of those parts of the Bill which need to be brought into effect immediately. The Minister stressed the urgency of these provisions and the fact that the Bill needs to be passed by the Oireachtas before Thursday of this week if it is to be in operation in time for the elections next month. As currently worded, <Col N="953"/>following enactment, it will be necessary for the Minister to make an order bringing these urgent provisions into effect. It seems much more efficient to bypass the necessity of a commencement order by simply providing for those parts of the Bill to come into operation immediately on enactment. Providing for commencement orders holds up the operation of the Bill while the sponsoring Department gets its act together on the implementation process. That is not necessary in this case. By accepting this amendment we can make the commencement order redundant in so far as the urgent provisions are concerned.</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>
    <P>That is the technical aspect of the amendment, but the substantive part of the amendment has a rather different purpose. It provides that any commencement order applying to those provisions of the Bill which apply to electronic voting shall not come into effect until after such time as the Ceann Comhairle has received from the Commission on Electronic Voting a satisfactory certification of the proposed electronic voting system under the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will probably be advised to say that such a provision is not necessary but after recent events it is surely unthinkable that any Government would try to proceed with electronic voting in the absence of an all-clear from the commission. That is what the Minister of State will say, because to do so would be arrogance of the highest order, even higher than we have seen on this subject in recent months.</P>
    <P>While I agree that in practical terms this amendment is not strictly necessary &mdash; at least I hope not &mdash; it nevertheless has an important symbolic value that leads me to commend it to the House. Acceptance of the amendment will write into the Act an acknowledgement by the Government of the technical issues involved. In other words, a technical constraint will be put on the actions of any Government, not just this Administration, by providing it can act only on foot of the satisfactory certification of the proposed system by the independent commission. That recognises that no matter how desirable electronic voting may be in principle, we should not go forward with it unless we get the technical details right. Put another way, this takes judgment of whether a proposed voting system is acceptable in law out of the hands of Government and gives it to an independent commission which has been specifically constituted for this purpose. That is how it should be. That is the method we should have as with one stroke it removes any possibility of a repeat of the unsatisfactory scenario we witnessed in the past few months. The Government insisted over and over, in the face of all the evidence to the contrary, that the proposed system was utterly foolproof and that we should take its word for that. The preliminary report of the commission clearly showed how <Col N="954"/>unwise it would be to take the Government&rsquo;s assurances at face value. If we had gone ahead on the basis originally planned a cloud of uncertainty would have hung over the voting system for all time. All Members would agree that that would have been very unsuitable, given the importance of public confidence in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I do not argue that this amendment is strictly necessary, but that it is highly desirable. If the Government accepted it, it would be a welcome signal that it believes the best way to move forward on this issue is by agreement and consensus, rather than on the belligerent confrontation of which we have seen too much in recent months. I commend the amendment to the House. It makes sense and it should be accepted.</P>

That &euro;60 million could have been spent on improving the health service, the home help service, the carer&rsquo;s allowance and so on. It is a scandal that the Minister is being let off the hook.

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments because of the need for transparency and accountability.

	<P>That is what the Minister of State told the House. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government still did not abandon the system even though we had evidence that it was flawed. It is shameful that the Government continued to push a system that cost the country an arm and a leg &mdash; over &euro;60 million &mdash; and went ahead with its publicity campaign when it was told to call off electronic voting. We cannot stand idly by and let the Government away with this because the public is fed up with its lies and deceit. It is happening in every area. During the past fortnight we have had the Fahey and Dempsey scandals in regard to squandering and the Deputy Cooper-Flynn scandal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Senator Bannon please resume his seat? We are not discussing Government policy but amendments Nos. 1 and 4.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 are an attempt by the Labour Party and Senator Quinn to introduce a commencement order after the independent commission has reported. This is a good idea. When I heard the Bill was being taken in the House, after the commission had given the thumbs down to the electronic voting proposals as currently constituted, I was in a state of disbelief as to why the Government was proceeding with the legislation. I now understand that for the commission to produce its full report and to be put on a statutory footing, legislation is required. It does not require any of the sections relating to the procedures involving electronic voting. The Government would have been well advised to amend the Bill by scrapping all the sections dealing with electronic voting until such time as the independent commission had given its approval to the procedure as outlined.</P>
    <P>I commend amendments Nos. 1 and 4 to the House. In opposing these amendments the Government is asking the House to give it a <i>carte blanche</i> and the right to introduce these sections at any time in the future, independent of the advice from the commission. That is bad politics.</P>
    <P>While I accept the need for the statutory commission, I do not accept the need for any other sections in the Bill dealing with the introduction of e-voting where there is currently no mandate for it. Other amendments deal with the cross-party support and the need for <Col N="956"/>consultation. Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 deal with the commencement order. It is very bad legislative practice for the House to hand over to the Government a complete <i>carte blanche</i> in this area where the independent commission has failed to give its approval to the system.</P><Miles com="cl" par="110"/>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 proposes to insert a new section into the Bill. The Government regards this as unnecessary. The commission&rsquo;s terms of reference in Schedule 5, together with sections 21 and 22, clearly state that the commission&rsquo;s reports will comprise recommendations on the secrecy and accuracy of the system including its application or non-application at the European and local elections on 11 June. In line with its commitment to accept the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, the Government decided not to use the system at the polls next month. We must now await the publication of the commission&rsquo;s next report on which the commission based its conclusion that it was unable to make a positive decision.</P>
    <P>The commission stated that its experts reported that the system accurately records and counts the votes. It stated that when used at the 2002 general election the system accurately counted the votes. It is understandable that once the commission decided on its own testing regime it would find it difficult and impossible to complete the testing as the experts engaged by the Department took months to complete their work. The commission would require a further period of time.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill adequately provide for the intent of the amendment and therefore I cannot accept amendment No. 1. The first part of amendment No. 4 reflects what will happen when the Bill is enacted. Consequently, I ask Senator Quinn to accept my undertaking in this regard. The commencement order is in line with the first part of his amendment. The second part of amendment No. 4 is akin to amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>In view of the Government&rsquo;s commitment, which is being honoured as regards the elections in June, I do not believe any Government would insist on using any system if the commission expressed dissatisfaction with it. I do not consider it necessary to have the second part of the amendment included in the Bill. The intent of this part of the amendment is already implicit in the first part of the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference and was drawn up in agreement with the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission makes its report not to the Minister but to the Ceann Comhairle and then to both Houses of the Oireachtas. In the circumstances I ask the Senators not to proceed with these amendments. There is a commencement order to the Bill which has no major legislative or technical problems associated with it and which will be duly signed by the Minister.</P><Col N="957"/><Miles com="cl" par="105"/>

   <Miles com="cl" par="105"/><Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s response to the amendment is disappointing. Given the level of confusion surrounding this debate and the general debasement visited upon the electoral system by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it would be wise to consider the merits of the amendments, in particular amendment No. 4, a fine amendment tabled by Senator Quinn. It is <Col N="958"/>vital that the integrity of the voting system is maintained as public confidence in the body politic is directly linked to the electoral system. It is incumbent on the Government to ensure that no further erosion of public confidence takes place as a result of this issue.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A number of issues have affected the body politic in recent years, of which the electronic voting system is one. The introduction of electronic voting began as a non-urgent public relations exercise and developed into the political hobby horse of a Minister who would be better occupied in other areas of his Department. The matter was not urgent and the people were not shouting from the roof tops that they wanted e-voting.</P>
    <P>While we all support the spirit behind electronic voting, given the history of the issue and the shambles into which it has descended, it is vital that the Minister of State responds positively to these amendments. His response thus far has been disappointing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a fan of electronic voting but I want to ensure that it enjoys public confidence when it is introduced. While I accept that my amendment is not strictly necessary on this occasion, it would be healthy and good for democracy if it were accepted. I was, therefore, disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that he did not consider it likely that any Government would insist on using a voting system with which the commission was dissatisfied. While I accept it is not likely that this Government would do so, it would be much healthier from the point of view of democracy to stitch the requirement in the amendment into legislation to ensure no other Government could act in such a manner. This is a much better approach and I urge the Minister of State to reconsider.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the second part of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment to which the Minister of State referred, I still do not agree with the proposition that electronic voting can only be introduced once the commission gives it the thumbs up. That is a bizarre way to proceed. This matter can only be advanced when it receives cross-party support. I do not want to stray into another amendment but we are in effect handing over the introduction of an electronic voting system to a commission, albeit an important, independent group of eminent people, when it should be introduced on the basis of cross-party support in both Houses. The reason I disagree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s view is that once the commission gives the green light to a proposal on electronic voting, the entire system can be operated without recourse to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the major parties in terms of how it is advanced. That is a daft way to proceed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that we must await the commission&rsquo;s next report. The commission reported favourably <Col N="959"/>on the use of electronic voting. Like Senator Quinn, I support electronic voting, particularly for reasons of accuracy in the vote and the counting of votes in elections. In response to Senator Bannon&rsquo;s point about obtaining different results, this is one of the problems we have with the paper system of voting and was particularly evident in the recounts during the previous general election.</P>
    <P>Most people agree that the electronic voting system selected has much to recommend it. Voters and election officials were satisfied with the system&rsquo;s physical lay-out in the previous general election and the second Nice treaty referendum. One of the great benefits of electronic voting is that it avoids inadvertent voting errors. I hope we could be more positive about this issue and allow the commission to issue a further report.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy referred to problems with privacy in an electronic voting system. Privacy is not an issue. Complaints were made about the possibility that people will be assisted to vote but that is already the case under the current system. One of the commissioners stated that if the machine made one beeping sound when a person was voting, it could somehow indicate to others in the vicinity of the polling booth the person for whom a voter is voting. The same could be true for a person using a ballot paper. While I do not agree with some of the conclusions of the commission, we should wait until another report is produced. I fully support the Minister of State&rsquo;s position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that the public has confidence in the electronic voting system which is chosen because confidence in the electoral system is the bedrock of any democracy. While the Fine Gael Party is in favour of electronic voting and has indicated that support on numerous occasions, we want a system that can be trusted.</P>
    <P>I compliment the independent commission on its fine work. The commission was established in March as a result of pressure from the Opposition parties. Had the Government had its way, it would have ploughed ahead with the system. Without sustained pressure from the Opposition parties, the independent commission would never have been established because the Government was determined to proceed with the system. We brought the matter to the notice of the public and public opinion supported our position, leading eventually to the establishment of the independent commission. I have full respect for the commission but its findings should be presented to both Houses for approval. For this reason, I support the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>We could have interesting debate on the origins of the commission but it is a separate matter. The question was asked as to why the electronic aspect should be included in <Col N="960"/>the legislation. This is entirely prudent because virtually everybody agrees that electronic voting will be introduced and is desirable. The only question to arise concerns the accuracy or value of the system selected. It was noteworthy that the commission&rsquo;s report referred to minimum standards because, as the commission noted, the burden of proof is much greater as regards the adoption of the system than with regard to its rejection.</P>
    <P>If the amendments were adopted, it would preclude subsequent debate or scrutiny of the matter by the Oireachtas. In other words, the amendments could result in the system being adopted without the matter first coming before the Houses. The political reality of the matter is that when the commission makes its final report, the terms of reference of which are, as the Minister of State noted, contained in the final Schedule to the Bill, it will be subject to considerable public scrutiny and debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill is reasonable and will ensure that the matter is fully debated before the final system is adopted. The adoption of the amendments would not necessarily mean that once the commission had reported to the Ceann Comhairle that the proposed system was reasonable and good, the matter would not be referred to the Houses for debate. However, adoption of the amendments would mean the system could be introduced without such a debate taking place.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>As with all legislation, the Bill is about planning for the future. I do not see why we should, as a country, bury our heads in the sand and feel ashamed of leading the way in a particular area. I am surprised that Senator Bannon claimed credit for starting the debate. As he is well aware, given that he is a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. McCarthy and Ms McGaley started the debate and it was taken up by the joint committee.</P>

If the legislation provided that such a resolution should be passed by the Houses, it would help to resolve this issue. People do not want a scenario where the Government will decide to introduce e-voting following the submission of a report to the Ceann Comhairle without recourse to both Houses. If the Minister of State said the system would be predicated on a positive resolution by both Houses, we could live with that, but that is not <Col N="961"/>provided for in the legislation. Has the Minister of State given consideration to that point?</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tabled an amendment that would resolve the issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The wording of the amendment would set the commission an impossible task. For example, the amendment refers to &ldquo;highest standards&rdquo;. Standards always change and the commission&rsquo;s report states the voting machines produced by the internationally accredited company, PTB, are constructed in line with the current general state of technology. This is fluid.</P>
    <P>Reference is also made to secrecy and accuracy. The terms of reference cover the secrecy and accuracy of the Nedap-Powervote system and the procedures that surround the operation of the system are set out in the legislation. It is not necessary to outline every step, as that is a matter for the respective returning officers to address, in accordance with the principles of the legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes referred to a positive resolution but neither I nor another Minister could give a commitment in this regard because that is a matter for Government. The commission may make a positive recommendation, given sufficient time. The commission report highlighted it was satisfied with the secrecy and accuracy of the count rules during the pilot project in 2002. If the decision is taken, the Minister will have to come to the House and the issue of count rules will be considered. It is not a <i>fait accompli</i>. The Bill, hopefully, will be signed by the President on Thursday. This must happen if the commission is to be established on a statutory basis so that it can go beyond an interim report. All local authority members will also be affected. There are other factors but when the legislation is passed, e-voting will not be a <i>fait accompli</i>. If the commission makes a positive recommendation, the Minister will have to return to the House later with a short Bill relating to count rules.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P><Col N="962"/>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">1.-&mdash;The functions of the Minister under this Act shall not be exercisable in relation to an election by a holder of the office of Minister who is also a director of elections in respect of that election.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The amendment is important in terms of conflict of interest. When the Minister responsible for introducing an expensive project that goes to the heart of our electoral system has such power, it is not good that he or she should be director of elections for his or her political party. We are all democrats and we all believe in participation in the democratic system. Events in recent years have brought politics into disrepute. Approximately 1,500 Deputies have been elected since the foundation of the State and all but a handful were good, honest, hard working and reputable parliamentarians. A few rotten apples corrupted politics for their own gain and brought it into disrepute. Ethics legislation has been introduced in recent years and the Standards in Public Office Commission was established as a result of a number of these scandals. The Houses of the Oireachtas have driven this change.</P>
    <P>The Houses must lead the way in terms of adopting the highest standards in terms of how we do our business as practitioners of politics. It is important that potential conflicts of interest should be addressed. The primary objective of the amendment is to prevent a blatant conflict of interest involving the Minister as he confers upon himself significant power in this area while, at the same time, acting as director of elections for his party.</P>
    <P>This issue has major legal and, more importantly, ethical ramifications. It has reverberations in terms of accountability and transparency in the political system. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I support the amendment and I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator McCarthy. The Minister is director of elections for Fianna F&aacute;il and that represents a conflict of interest. Under the code of conduct for local authority members, they must declare their interests in absolutely everything before they even attend a local authority meeting. During the run up to the last general election, the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was involved in promoting the public relations campaign for the new e-voting system in the Meath constituency, where he was also a candidate. Perhaps there was nothing wrong with that, but the public did not look on it as totally transparent.</P>
    <P>We have two cases in four years where successive Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have been involved in something that the public sees as a little dubious. It is important that this amendment <Col N="963"/>is accepted. I do not question the character of the Ministers involved but it did not look good in the eyes of the public that a Minister was involved in a public relations campaign while promoting himself as a candidate in a particular constituency. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was appointed director of elections by the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach was a little naive to appoint him director of elections given his involvement in promoting the electronic voting system. I am thankful this system has fallen and I am disappointed the Minister has not fallen with it.</P>

	<P>Contrary to the perception that may exist, when an individual takes on the mantle of Minister, he does not automatically lose his other talents. Given that this Administration and its predecessor introduced what is probably the most stringent ethics code in the world, I find it unbelievable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We will not mention Mr. Lowry but keep going instead. As Senator Bannon has pointed out, the legislation has been extended to the councillors, which is only proper. If one examined the records I am sure one would realise it is not the first time a Minister, from either side of the House, has been a director of elections. This would be an interesting study to undertake.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Confidence in our electoral process is absolutely essential. One of the great hallmarks of our democracy since the foundation of the State in the early 1920s is that the electorate, irrespective of its views on party politics and politicians, has genuine confidence in the manner in which people are elected. One of the great advantages of the existing electoral system is its transparency. It can be seen in operation, it takes a long time to count the votes and, consequently, it is well covered by the media. Furthermore, one can enter the count centre. We should not underestimate these factors.</P>
    <P>If a trade union wants to conduct an election, it hands over the operation of that election to an independent body outside its control to ensure the result is authentic and transparent. I cannot understand why the franchise section of the Minister&rsquo;s Department is not entirely independent. This is a very important point of principle. We have a commission on standards in politics, the Standards in Public Office Commission, and a long-standing commission responsible for the division of constituency boundaries for European and D&aacute;il elections. I cannot understand why we cannot have an <Col N="964"/>independent, stand-alone agency to run elections that is outside the control of a Minister. Ministers are elected in the same way as everybody else, they are members of a political party unless they are independent and they have a vested interest in the outcome of an election.</P>
    <P>When this issue was first raised, I was astonished that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, allowed himself to be open to the charge, which the Opposition would inevitably make, that he was director of elections for Fianna F&aacute;il. I do not know why he allowed this to obtain. So many aspects of our elections are already controlled by agencies that the franchise section of the Department should become a stand-alone section. It would obviously be accountable to the House through its various committees but should be completely independent from the arm of Government.</P>
    <P>Some days ago I noticed the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government set the date for the European elections, which we all knew were to be held. As a matter of principle, this date should be set by someone other than the Minister, who is a member of a political party and who has a vested interest in the outcome of the election. This is the only aspect of electoral law we need to examine. Many other countries have independent, stand-alone agencies that conduct elections and which are responsible for the operation and results of those elections. We should adopt the same approach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There is certain merit in Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s argument that there should be some sort of independent body to conduct elections. I had the privilege of meeting the election commissioner for India and I am grateful to the ambassador for India for circulating to the members of the Committee on the Environment and Local Government, if not all Members of the House, a document called &ldquo;Celebrating Democracy in India: The World&rsquo;s Largest Democracy goes to Vote&rdquo;. One should note that India has an electorate of 668 million and that it uses electronic voting successfully. The ambassador was educated by the Irish Patrician Brothers. When I met him there was a discussion on electronic voting in Ireland and he could not understand why we did not have it. One of the questions frequently asked at the time I met him was how the machines would work if the power failed. He made the point that in many places to which the machines are brought in India, there is no power at all, and that the machines work quite successfully on batteries.</P>
    <P>There is a valid point to be made on the disconnection of the operation of the elections from any political personage, not from any political influence. That is different from saying the date of an election should not be decided by a Minister. In general, this is decided by law in any case. The time at which local elections must take place, if not the precise date, is governed by law. The same applies to European elections. <Col N="965"/>Obviously, it is the prerogative of Government to advise the President to dissolve the D&aacute;il and hold an election. I do not believe anybody will suggest this might change.</P>
    <P>It could be inferred from the amendment that the Minister&rsquo;s influence is very wide-ranging. However, there are very few references to the role of the Minister in the 35 sections of the Bill. One section talks about the coming into operation of the Act and states that the Minister may determine, by order, the days on which an election may be held, which is reasonable. In the areas in which the Minister has influence by way of making orders, the Bill delimits his powers fairly significantly. Section 5(6) reads: &ldquo;A returning officer shall not be required or authorised by an instruction given by the Minister under subsection (5) to do any act (whether of commission or omission) which is contrary to the Act of 1993, the Act of 1994, the Act of 1997 or the Regulations of 1995.&rdquo; Even if the Minister was of a mind to interfere, the returning officer would be in a very powerful position to resist his interference.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the only other section I can find that refers to the role of the Minister is in section 30(1): &ldquo;The Minister may provide, by regulations, for the provision, after the conclusion of the counting of votes in an election or a referendum, of statistical information on a specified proportion of the poll concerned, including detailed information on the votes cast and comprised in that specified proportion.&rdquo; We already had that in the sense that local authorities can provide voters with discs to show they have voted. These do not show how they voted but we can now know who voted. Political parties will regard this as useful; whether it is desirable is another matter.</P>
    <P>To infer that the Minister has some really pervasive power that could manipulate the outcome of an election is mischievous. However, I take the point that, in the interest of avoiding accusations of interference, it would be preferable to disconnect the political office from the conduct of the election. In this context, there is merit in having an independent electoral commission along the lines of the Indian model or others.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment, tabled by Labour Party and moved by Senator McCarthy, is not directly related to the Bill and does not represent a clear understanding of the role of the Minister in the conduct of elections. Each of the electoral and referendum legislative codes provides that the conduct of an election or a referendum is clearly the statutory responsibility of the relevant returning officer, in accordance with the legislation covering that poll. The Minister makes a poling day order setting out the polling day and hours of the polls. Very little discretion exists regarding European elections because Europe decided that the selection would take place during the weekend from 10 June to <Col N="966"/>12 June. Of course, most of the elections in Europe will take place on Sunday, 13 June. The change in the Constitution commits us to having an election every five years and it stands to reason that it should be at the same time as the local elections. This has many benefits. When the Minister discharges his responsibility to set out the polling day and the hours of the polls, he has no role in the conduct of the election except in the case of emergency. The European election is determined at European level and local elections, to a lesser degree, are determined by the legislation.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Minister&rsquo;s role in the case of an emergency. The only instance when the Minister might have a role after the polling day order is made is to deal with wholly exceptional circumstances where a difficulty arises, such as a vacancy for returning officer, power cuts or other natural occurrences which would interrupt the poll and where a difficulty order might be required. The difficulty order is fleshed out in other legislation.</P>
    <P>The role of the person appointed as director of elections, and in this case the director of elections for Fianna F&aacute;il is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has nothing to do with that person&rsquo;s ministerial duties under the electoral or referendum Acts. If I were devious, I would have conducted some research. However, I did not do so because it is unnecessary. Nevertheless, the Opposition might be aware that in the period 1994 to 1997, Deputy Howlin, who was a Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Minister said he would not be devious.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting. Deputy Howlin had responsibility for the general election of 1997, the referenda in 1995 on divorce and in 1996 on bail, the local elections in 1994 and the European elections. I do not know if Deputy Howlin was the party&rsquo;s director of elections and I am not concerned about it.</P>
    <P>The late John Boland, who was Minister for the Environment in 1986 and 1987, had responsibility for the referendum on the Single European Act and former Deputy Liam Kavanagh, who was in office from 1983 to 1986, was responsible for the European elections in 1984 and the 1984 referendum to give UK citizens voting rights in general elections. There was also a referendum on divorce in 1986 and local elections were held in 1985. All were decent, honourable people. I have not checked if they were directors of elections but even if they were, I would not have a difficulty with it. I accept that the Opposition has to make political points but, as Senator Dardis pointed out, few sections in the Bill give the Minister any authority apart from in the areas specified, particularly the case of exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the independence of the franchise section of the Department. In <Col N="967"/>practical terms, the franchise section is as independent as it can be without legislation to confer that independence. Senator Hayes and Senator Dardis alluded to this but they appear to be thinking of a type of electoral commission. However, that is a debate for another day. It is a wider and deeper issue which could, presumably, be considered at another time. The Irish electorate has every confidence in the franchise section. That is not to say the Senator does not; he stated that he had confidence in the franchise section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not suggesting otherwise. The Senator probably believes the commission could incorporate the other commissions, such as the commission on electoral boundaries, the Referendum Commission and the Standards in Public Office Commission but it does not arise in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for this amendment. However, it is a matter for the House to decide.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brady first mentioned previous Ministers who were directors of elections. Fianna F&aacute;il has been in Government for fourteen and a half of the last 17 years. He also said the party has led the way in many areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that not tell the Senator something?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;not least in some I mentioned in my previous contribution. Perhaps it is time it led the way in this area.</P>
    <P>This House debated at length the merits and demerits of the abolition of the dual mandate. We were lectured by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, on a division of responsibility between Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities. The majority of people bit that bullet, regardless of how hard it was. The tenor of the Minister&rsquo;s argument on the dual mandate, an argument that he carried successfully in the face of huge opposition from across the political spectrum, was the separation of powers, the identification of two clear roles and the removal of one set of duties from the public representative. Hence, the abolition of the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>Most Members have contested elections and have had to deal with the reams of paper from the Standards in Public Office Commission. This is another commission which works hard and does a good but tedious job. It went through between 40,000 and 50,000 pieces of literature following the last D&aacute;il and Seanad elections. All Members, or at least 99.9% of them, furnished declarations within the prescribed time limit. It was tedious and laborious for the members of the commission and its secretariat to go through this information. However, the accountability and <Col N="968"/>transparency of the system is commendable. It is a good feature of our democracy and could be used as a guide with regard to this amendment. The inbuilt accountability and transparency of that system should be extended to this Bill, particularly given its recent history.</P>
    <?oasys [ic20]?><P>We learn from our mistakes and some of the handling of this issue was mistaken. It takes a good person, not to mind a public figure, to admit he or she made a mistake. Ways can be mended in this context. There is sufficient will in that we sing from the same hymn sheet, particularly when one considers the contributions of Senators Hayes and Dardis about outside bodies handling various facets of the system. There is, also, a broad consensus in the House on electronic voting. However, the key issue in this case is the fact that the Minister is director of elections. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to accept the amendment.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

He was also a Minister from 1973 to 1977 but he was not a director of elections; neither were former Deputy Peter Barry or former Deputy Dick Spring. However, it is an interesting point and even if they had been directors of elections, there would not have been any opposition from our side of the House at the time.</P><?oasys [ic0]?>

   </Speaker><Col N="969"/>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt><Miles com="fc"/>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">1. &mdash;(1) No electronic voting system may be adopted for use in an election or referendum unless all parties in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are in agreement on all aspects of the adoption and use of a particular system of electronic voting.</P>
    <P LI="2">(2) Nothing in this Act or any other enactment shall permit the trial, implementation or use of a system of electronic voting in any election or referendum save in accordance with <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Government must have forgotten that in June 2001 it promised that e-voting would not be introduced without all-party agreement. While some members may not have forgotten, the arrogance of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, forced the e-voting system through. Before legislating for e-voting in future, it is important that we get all-party agreement. The proposed new section provides that electronic voting cannot be used until there is all-party agreement. This amendment and amendment No. 17 are designed to make all-party agreement a prerequisite to the introduction of any new system of voting.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 seeks to insert &ldquo;by order&rdquo; after &ldquo;may&rdquo;. This amendment reminds us that we live in a democracy. Since we achieved out independence we have tried to promote this issue. We must try to reclaim some of the respect we have lost in the intervening years. There is a general outcry and apathy among the electorate about the way politics in this country has gone over the years. This section proposes that the Fianna F&aacute;il director of elections is to be empowered to give instructions to returning officers. In the interest of returning some semblance of balance to the system any instructions given by him must be by way of a ministerial order. Another amendment in my name proposes that a draft of such an order must be laid before the House for its approval. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment in the interest of total transparency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>What a load of nonsense. Every day in Europe we are being encouraged to have qualified majority voting and to eliminate vetoes. The Senator&rsquo;s amendment proposes to reintroduce a veto. This will give one party or perhaps a small group of Independents an effective veto. Our parliamentary democracy does not work on this basis but on the basis of a majority. This amendment would confer on a single party not just a veto on e-voting but a veto on all aspects of the system. This would cut the ground from under the commission, about which the Senator was very enthusiastic and for which <Col N="970"/>he claimed credit. It might as well not exist because when it reports a party could veto its recommendations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. In a previous contribution I stated that the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, deliberated on the issue of land prices for ten or 12 months and after consultation with many interested parties and Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, came to a common sense conclusion. That model, based on all-party agreement should be used in the context of this amendment. It worked perfectly well for the issue of land prices and would have worked perfectly well for e-voting had the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, listened to the requests from Opposition politicians. There is nothing wrong with the spirit of the amendment or the amendment itself.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with the spirit of the amendment and much of what Senator Bannon has said is correct. I am somewhat concerned that it excludes Independents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It refers to political parties.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It also excludes the Seanad and only refers to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. The spirit is correct but the technical detail is not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that the spirit is very much correct and in a subsequent amendment the detail can be changed to reflect the point Senator Quinn has made. I want to take on Senator Dardis&rsquo;s dismissal of the points made by my colleague. E-voting is not like increasing the price of a pint or the tax rate, but represents a fundamental change to the way we operate elections. The Government must have all-party support to proceed as I said four months ago in this House. If one party in this or the other House opposes it, that party will become the focus of opposition in the country to the proposal. The Government has got this completely wrong. If, when the report was published, it had the good grace to admit it had made a hash of the entire procedure it had put in place to introduce the system, there would be considerably more sympathy for it. However, it has no sympathy because it never consulted anyone.</P>
    <Miles com="cl" par="115"/><P>All the parties did sit down together at the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. Last Sunday, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, the Chairman of that committee, said the one <Col N="971"/>great mistake the Government made was not to allow the committee do its work. The Government guillotined the debate and imposed a whip on all the members from the Government parties to take a certain line. Have we learnt nothing about the importance of committees? Such committees can take important issues like this out of the party political system and try to engender agreement so the Government can implement the committee&rsquo;s decision. In this entire debacle the Government never stopped to listen to the Opposition. If it had done so we would not be where we are today.</P>
    <P>I thank the commission and I love its report. However, I want the Houses of the Oireachtas ultimately to make the decision. While I appreciate its work and expert advice, I do not want a commission to make such a decision. Ultimately such a decision should be made on the basis of consensus because the issue is so important and above party politics. I agree with Senator Bannon that we need consensus on this matter if we are to advance. Otherwise the integrity of e-voting will be questioned when it is introduced.</P>
    <P>If parties in the House do not want to take the decision we should let the people decide whether they want e-voting. This is another classical example of the Government not listening to the people. At a time when many other priorities faced the country, in 2001 the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, landed this matter on people&rsquo;s desks. There is no great clamour for it. It is another example of disconnected politics. Ultimately e-voting does not matter and will not change the world. However, it is a sign of a Government that has run its course and is rummaging around for ideas. It picked up e-voting as some kind of fascinating way forward for mankind. The Government has had its knuckles rightly rapped as a result of this proposal.</P>
    <P>If the Government has learned anything from this debacle, it should be the need for all-party agreement on the matter. It should listen to people more often. I have considerable sympathy for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. This was landed on his desk by the former Minister, who looked for tenders for the system before either House of the Oireachtas had passed the legislation. In autumn 2001 the former Minister sent the system out for public tender without any Government decision, or at least no such decision had been debated in either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Who wanted this legislation in the first place? It was not the Government. A month ago the Government assured us there was no need for legislation and this could be done by order. <Col N="972"/>However, this legislation, so ably defended by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is now before us. The goal posts have moved. The Government changes the argument whenever it suits and its credibility is pretty thin when it comes to electronic voting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Members in complimenting the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government which has done a fine job in discussing this issue. I agree with Senator Quinn that this amendment requires a great deal of tidying up before we could agree to it. It fails to refer to Seanad &Eacute;ireann. While have a Technical Group consisting of smaller parties and Independents, there are different views within it. The issue is who will make decisions in this matter. If the Government cannot make a decision without being subject to a veto from one person or a small party, it will be unable to make any decisions. For too long we have heard complaints about the number of agencies and authorities we have established which have somehow taken power away from the Oireachtas. It would be useful to return to a position where the Government makes decisions.</P>
    <P>There is a current proposal that somehow the people should decide, presumably by way of referendum. It should be noted that the people have already decided to send Deputies and Senators to the Oireachtas. Asking for a further endorsement from the people would be a waste of time. The Minister of State and Senator Dardis both made the point that we must have an effective Government and that one cannot adopt a dog in the manger approach whereby one particular Member can hold up the work of both Houses. We should allow the current procedures to continue to obtain.</P>

	<P>Former Taoiseach Deputy John Bruton alerted the Taoiseach to many of the issues, which became findings of the independent commission, as far back as 8 April 2002 in the run up to the last general election. If the Taoiseach had taken Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s views into consideration then and established an all-party committee, it would have saved the country a great deal of money. We are the guardians of the State&rsquo;s purse and it is important that our system is transparent and capable of delivering the best service to the people we serve.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify the reference to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution of which I was a member. Senator McCarthy was correct that the committee produced a report on property rights which reflected a consensus. Nobody had a veto in that case and what emerged from the committee was a balanced view across all parties and independent members. That is not the same as what is <Col N="973"/>proposed in the amendment before us. It proposes to provide one group with a veto which is why it would be wrong to endorse it.</P>
    <Miles com="cl" par="110"/><P>When I was on the other side of the House, I had the experience of proposing an amendment to a previous Electoral Bill whereby pictures of candidates and party logos would be included on ballot papers. I proposed the amendment on the basis of an unfortunate experience of a shouted vote, which I thought was very unfair. If a person is illiterate, everything should be done to accommodate him or her in casting his or her vote in secrecy. The then Minister rejected the amendment, telling me that to accept it would be to introduce a beauty contest.</P>
    <P>We should be very careful about getting into fraught areas. I insist that the amendment is much too restrictive in its references to all aspects of the voting system and all parties. It should be rejected.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is abundantly clear that in passing the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, the Houses of the Oireachtas approved the use of the electronic voting system. I defended the original proposal in section 48 to provide the Minister with the authority to extend electronic voting to the other electoral codes. We took advice and the issue was compared to that of Carrickmines, which was debated in this House also. The Government decided wisely that if there was any question mark whatsoever, it would adopt a belt and braces approach. That is the primary reason we are back here.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this legislation is rushed but we have had many hours of debate on it. Authority was provided through the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act to conduct sample tests with a view to preparing for electronic voting. We did not hear criticism at the time of the 2002 election. In Dublin West and Dublin South, 87% of voters were happy with the system. The public is disappointed, but we are where we are. I will not make a case for electronic voting as it is not going ahead.</P>
    <P>The amendment before us is an unusual one for a Member of the Seanad to propose. It seeks to give more power to the D&aacute;il but not to provide it to the Seanad. While it may be the result of a typographical error, its effect would also be to take power away from Independent Members.</P>

	<P>The effect of the amendment would be to ignore respected Members like Senator Quinn and assert that the major parties should decide these issues. That would not lead to useful legislation. Contrary to Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s suggestion, all legislation coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas is important.</P>
    <P>General consensus is somewhat different to all-party support. If we must have the latter, we will never make any legislative progress. The system in place has served us well for years. It should be remembered that the Government is directly elected by the people. When it takes a decision, the people indirectly do the same. No one is seriously suggesting we should have absolute agreement from Members across the political divide, including Independents. If we adopted that approach, no progress would be made. While there may be some differences on the detail, all parties and Independents agree with the principle of electronic voting and printing. To require by law that an issue must have the support of all parties would be a recipe for disaster and ensure that change would probably never occur.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 6, lines 5 and 6, to delete subsection (9) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(9) Where it is proposed to make an order under this Act, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P LI="2">(10) The order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Due to the breadth of the orders the Minister may make under the Act, this amendment proposes that all orders must be laid before the Houses in draft form and will not take effect until both Houses approve them. This is done in the <Col N="976"/>interest of transparency, which has been talked about a great deal recently and to which my party and I adhere. I ask the Minister of State to accept this valid amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not support Senator Bannon&rsquo;s previous amendment but I am happy to support him on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to stress the paramount role of the Oireachtas in the implementation of this legislation. A sliding scale of importance attaches to ministerial orders. This is expressed by the way the orders are presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas. In matters of a purely routine nature, it is customary to require no more than that the order be laid on the table of each House. We see this regularly and that is what is provided for in this section. With more serious matters the custom is different. In such cases the order is not deemed to come into effect until a resolution approving it has been passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>There is an important difference between the two approaches. A matter which goes to the root of our electoral process is of such importance that the second approach is more appropriate. That is why I have tabled amendment No. 6. It provides that any commencement order shall not come into effect until after a resolution is passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>In proposing this I am aware that during every sitting week we pass a raft of resolutions of one kind or another which, by agreement among the Whips, are not debated in either Chamber and there is seldom any discussion about them. Nevertheless, there is an important reason for requiring that some matters be treated in this way whereas others are considered to be of such a routine nature that they do not even require the waiving of a resolution. This difference relates to the fundamental importance of the matter at hand.</P>
    <P>By allowing an order to come into effect without a resolution approving it, we shout from the roof tops that it refers to a matter of routine unimportance. By requiring that an order go <Col N="977"/>through the process of approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas we are saying it is not a routine matter but one which requires a level of Oireachtas scrutiny, even if it is only of the most cursory kind as is often the case.</P>
    <P>The importance of a commencement order in regard to this legislation springs from the nature of the subject matter itself. As Senators Bannon and Brian Hayes have said, the electoral system underpins our democratic process. There must be no doubt about that and there must be confidence in the electoral process. If we consider democracy important, as I am sure we do, we must attach a similar degree of importance to the process by which we put democracy into effect. We must do so because the respect legislators show for the democratic process and all that underpins it affects, in turn, the respect of the general public for that very process.</P>
    <P>In the course of debating the issue of electronic voting, both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, in recent months, much has been made of the need to maintain public confidence in whatever electoral system we use. We are right to be concerned about that issue and my amendment responds to that need. By passing the Bill in its present form we signal to the general public that commencement orders under the legislation are trivial matters which are so unimportant that they do not merit the few seconds it takes to waive a resolution in the House. We should not send such a signal to the public. Instead, we should send the contrary signal that we respect the principle of democracy and, by extension, the electoral system under which democracy works and that anything to do with changing that process is a matter of fundamental importance to the Houses.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between the two approaches. Accordingly, I commend the amendment to the House. I believe it is important and that the Minister, when he considers the matter, will recognise the difference between the two approaches.</P>

	<P FLI="0">The procedure proposed in section 1(9) of the Bill is the same as that generally used for commencement orders for many years across a wide variety of legislation and I see no need to change the procedure. Having regard to the discussion on amendments Nos. 1 and 4, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 5 and 6. If we were to change this and other pieces of legislation in this way, the entire system might be paralysed. I refer Senator Quinn to my contribution on his amendment No. 4, in which I stated that the first part of the amendment reflects what will happen when the Bill is enacted. Consequently, I asked the Senator to accept my undertaking in this regard. Commencement orders have been used for many years in a wide variety of legislation and there is no particular need for change.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 6, subsection (1), line 12, to delete &ldquo;equipment.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;equipment, or</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) interferes in any way, without due authorisation, with the software used or intended for use in a voting system in the State, including any such interference that occurs during the development or deployment of such a system.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I am not so sure amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are related and I would prefer to take them <Col N="980"/>separately. However, I will speak on amendments Nos. 7 and 8 although I do not believe they are related.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will pay attention to amendment No. 7 because there is a flaw in the legislation, which is encompassed by the amendment. I recall the occasion on which Senator Ross discovered a flaw in a previous electoral Bill which meant the Bill had to be withdrawn. I am concerned about the risk that we will define offences under the legislation so narrowly that particular types of offence would escape altogether.</P>
    <P>Senators may remember a case which arose some years ago of a young student in the Philippines who wrote and disseminated a computer virus which caused untold havoc around the world wherever computers were used. It flourished for only a few weeks but the virus caused an enormous amount of economic damage in many countries. Although the perpetrator of the virus was eventually tracked down and caught thanks to some excellent and sophisticated detective work, in the end it proved impossible to prosecute him because there was no offence in the law of his country to cover the writing and dissemination of a computer virus.</P>
    <P>This was the nightmare scenario which occurred to me as a possibility when I read section 2 of this Bill. While I accept that my previous amendments were tabled to improve the Bill and were not essential, I am very serious about this amendment. In the section, the word &ldquo;software&rdquo; is not specifically mentioned although it is mentioned in the relevant paragraph of the <Col N="981"/>explanatory memorandum. The startling feature is that it is not actually stated in the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is against the software rather than the hardware that the most serious offences are likely to occur. A person who wanted to wreck the voting process would perhaps take a hammer to the hardware but a person who wanted to interfere with the voting and affect the outcome of the voting would have to target the software for interference. The wording of the section mentions two terms &mdash; a different one in each subsection. The first subsection refers to &ldquo;any voting system equipment&rdquo; while the second refers to &ldquo;any voting machine equipment&rdquo;. Neither of these terms is defined in the Bill except in section 4, where the definitions are stated to apply only to Part 2 of the Bill, which does not include the section we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>Even if we moved section 4 back into Part 1 of the Bill and made it clear that the definitions applied to whole Bill instead of just to Part 2, the outcome would not fulfil the need to spell out that software is included within the scope of the offences being captured. In another context, Senators will be familiar with the long-standing controversy over whether the intellectual property of software should be protected under present law or under copyright law, which point we discussed with the Taoiseach in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs. Unless we specifically spell out what we are talking about and that we are including software, I can foresee a great deal of legal dispute in future arising from the issue of whether the terms &ldquo;equipment&rdquo; or &ldquo;apparatus&rdquo; can be extended to include software.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State has a briefing note which argues that there is no possible doubt that the section as drafted includes software. However, with the greatest possible respect, I submit that we cannot be legally certain in that regard. Why should we take a chance when we could so easily put it beyond any doubt whatsoever?</P>
    <P>We need to specify software, beyond any possible doubt, as being within the scope of the offences captured under this legislation. The second deficiency in the Bill is that the definition of offences appears to be too restrictive in terms of time. It seems to focus on interference which takes place during the actual course of an election, disregarding any interference which might take place in advance of an election during the development or deployment of the system which must take place ahead of time.</P>
    <P>The people who have knowledge of the possibilities have pointed again and again to the possibility of the software being interfered with by an insider, in other words, by a person employed by the developers of the software itself. This becomes a greater possibility as the present system is based on proprietary software rather than open source software. The software we are talking about is a jealously guarded trade secret.</P><Col N="982"/>
    <P>Even the Commission on Electronic Voting ran into difficulties in getting access to the software. In these circumstances it is much easier for fraud to occur within the development process itself because the end product is such a big secret. I am not seeking to cast aspersions on anybody, least of all the producers of this system, but however trustworthy that firm may be, what company could vouch for every single one of its employees? It is far from beyond the bounds of possibility that a disgruntled employee or enthusiastic hacker in the employment of the company could secretly introduce into the software an element that could interfere with the results produced by the system. When we introduce the possibility of bribery as a motivation for interference of this kind, which is a real change, the scenario becomes even more likely and becomes a probability rather than a possibility. If that ever happens and we are lucky enough to detect it and track down the culprit, then we should at least be able to prosecute the person or persons concerned. We should define the offence in the legislation broadly enough to capture something that happens in those circumstances, unlikely though that may be in practice.</P>
    <P>Only if we are prepared to guarantee that such interference could never happen, and I do not see how we could possibly guarantee any such thing, should we fail to allow for such a possibility when defining offences under this Bill. This amendment addresses both of the issues I have raised; on one hand, the additional subsection I propose specifically includes interference with software as an offence, and on the other hand it extends the definition of interference with software to include any such interference that takes place during the development or deployment of a voting system, as well as during the electoral process itself.</P>
    <P>Without this amendment or some equivalent measure we run the risk of being unable to prosecute a serious offence. I cannot imagine anything more likely than that to bring the whole system into disrepute. I strongly commend amendment No. 7 about which I feel very strongly. The Bill is flawed by the omission of the term &ldquo;software&rdquo; as words such as &ldquo;apparatus&rdquo; and &ldquo;equipment&rdquo; exclude software. Also, this section only deals with events during an election rather than prior to the election.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 deals with the seriousness with which we treat the electoral process. That seriousness is not reflected in the schedule of penalties in the legislation, although the matter at hand goes to the very heart of our democracy. Nothing could be more important in the running of the State as the way in which we regulate our electoral process. It follows that offences against that electoral process are or can be very serious matters.</P>
    <P>Where electronic voting is concerned, we must allow for the possibility of the most serious offences being committed. The nature of what we are discussing allows for the possibility that a <Col N="983"/>person or persons may make a large scale attack against the integrity of the system, as opposed to a single, isolated attempt on an individual voting machine, which is covered in the legislation. Such isolated incidents could be dealt with summarily, just as individual cases of personation can be dealt with summarily. However, a widespread attack on the integrity of the system is a totally different matter.</P>
    <P>It is essential we foresee the possibility of such an attack and provide for it in the schedule of penalties. We must allow for the possibility of offences being committed that are so serious that treating them summarily is not appropriate. Offences of that level of seriousness should be prosecuted on indictment with an appropriate range of penalties to match. The Bill as drafted does not allow for any prosecutions on indictment, providing only for offences which are dealt with summarily. I was astonished when I first read the Bill to find that offences were being dealt with in so offhand a manner.</P>
    <P>To proceed in this way would be a grave mistake. The summary offences set out in the Bill would be no deterrent to a determined person setting out to commit a very serious offence against the electoral system itself, as such a person would regard that as no more than a slap on the wrist rather than an effective deterrent. This becomes all the more evident when one considers the possible influence of large scale bribery in any such offence. In these circumstances, the size of the fine proposed or the length of the imprisonment would be considered laughable by any determined criminal.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because I concluded that in drafting the Bill the Government had made a fundamental mistake as to the potential seriousness of offences under the legislation. I was strengthened in that conclusion when I looked at other Bills before the Oireachtas for the sake of comparison.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Garda Bill 2004, which has not yet been debated in either House, and which sets out a range of offences and penalties. Section 53 states that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she impersonates a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or makes any statement or does any act calculated falsely to suggest that he or she is such a member. A person guilty of an offence under that section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both. On conviction on indictment there is a difference &mdash; the fine should not exceed &euro;50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004 sets out a series of offences applying to a person who gives false evidence in a personal injury claim, stating that if, after the commencement of the section, a person gives or dishonestly causes to be given or adduces or dishonestly causes to be adduced evidence in a <Col N="984"/>personal injury action that is (a) false or misleading in any material respect and (b) that he or she knows to be false and misleading, he or she shall be guilty of an offence. Section 21(2) states that if, after the commencement of the section, a person gives or dishonestly causes to be given an instruction or information regarding a personal injury action to a solicitor, a person acting on behalf of a solicitor or an expert that is false or misleading in any material respect, and that (b) he or she knows to be false or misleading, he or she shall be guilty of an offence. That Bill also provides for both summary conviction and conviction on indictment. In the case of conviction on indictment the penalties are a fine of up to &euro;100,000 or ten years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>The Public Services Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003 lays down offences that applicants for jobs in the public service may commit in making a false declaration in the course of their application. Section 56 of the Bill states that in respect of a competition for a position within the public service a person shall not (a) knowingly or recklessly make an application that is false and misleading in a material respect for the position; (b) in purported compliance with the requirement for the position, knowingly or recklessly provide any information or documentation that is false or misleading in a material respect; (c) canvass any person with or without inducements on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a candidate for the position; (d) personate a candidate at any stage of the recruitment and selection process concerned; (e) knowingly or maliciously obstruct a person engaged in the conduct of the competition or otherwise interfere with the general conduct of that competition; (f) knowingly and without lawful authority take any action which could result in the compromising of any test material or any evaluation of it; and (g) interfere improperly with the competition process or competition records so as to confer an advantage or disadvantage on any candidate.</P>
    <P>Section 57 then specifies the penalties for the offences. Both summary prosecution and prosecution on indictment are provided for, and in the case of conviction on indictment there is a fine of up to &euro;10,000 or imprisonment for up to two years, or both. These three Bills do not deal with particularly heinous offences, yet all three specify that those offences can be tried summarily or on indictment. Why are we treating this Bill differently? Is it that the Government considers the offence of interfering with the electoral process as less serious than impersonating a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, giving false testimony in a personal injuries action, or making a false representation in applying for a job in the public service? I do not believe anybody could come to that conclusion, nor do I believe the Government has come to such a conclusion. I prefer to believe it is an honest mistake. However, it is a mistake that cannot be allowed <Col N="985"/>to stand because of the wrong signal it would send to the world about the seriousness which we attach to our electoral process and the tenacity with which we will defend attacks on its integrity. We can undo this mistake by accepting the amendment which I commend to the House. I regret those two amendments which are different are being taken together. What is being provided for here is to tackle a person who is cheating the voting system. What has not been provided for is one who attacks the system. It was not necessary under the old system. An attack on the software could damage the whole electronic voting system. We are all aware of what happened in Florida during the last presidential election and that was not an attack on the system. It would be easy to attack the software here. If a person attacks the software, the only crime of which they can be found guilty is the same as if they impersonated their vote. Both amendments are worthy of consideration, but particularly No. 7, otherwise the Bill is flawed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second those amendments. I compliment my colleague, Senator Quinn, on tabling those amendments, the purpose of which is to prevent danger to the proposed system. They are seeking to provide for safety precautions and the Minister should take them on board. I was annoyed at the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government when it was claimed by the company, employed by the Government, that its software was 100% accurate. Rarely can we give a 100% guarantee.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendments. It is important that these amendments are specific. We do not want a repetition of the case in India where heinous and wrong as the crime was, no prescribed law was broken. The amendment goes a long was towards ensuring that is not the system here. We have seen blatant abuse of many systems in recent years. We watched on television a few nights ago a person adept at computers who was able to create a worm which was capable of clogging up thousands of systems. The <i>modus operandi</i> of that individual was to give his mother&rsquo;s ailing computer business a temporary shot in the arm. These are issues of which we need to be careful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 7 seeks to extend the description of the offence described in section 2 in relation to the software used or intended for use in the system. The Bill already covers this point, perhaps in a less direct manner. I refer the Senator to section 1(2) which states:</P><Col N="986"/>
    <P LI="1">The Electoral Acts 1992 to 2002 and this Act may be cited together as the Electoral Acts 1992 to 2004 and shall be read together as one.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It may be somewhat cumbersome but that is the position. I refer Senator Quinn to the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, section 38 <i>(nn)</i> which reads:</P>
    <P LI="1">In section 138<i>(a) </i>of that Act, there were inserted &ldquo;or voting machine or cartridge or disc from a voting machine or software or other voting system equipment used for voting or vote counting&rdquo; after &ldquo;or any unused ballot paper&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I fully appreciate the point being made because it would be necessary to refer back and, perhaps it is not as clear as it should be. However, the matter is covered in that Act. I note the strong case made by the Senator that while summary offences are covered indictment is not covered. I give an assurance that if it is recommended by the commission on electronic voting that electronic voting may be introduced then it will be necessary to introduce further legislation to change the count rules. When we are introducing that further legislation, if it is necessary, to deal with the count rules I give an undertaking to Senator Quinn and the House that matter will be considered. While the matter is relevant it is not relevant to this election. This is not a <i>fait accompli</i>. I will have discussions with the Parliamentary Counsel and request it to consider incorporating amendment No. 7. I will also have amendment No. 8, which is linked with the offence, reviewed and ask the Parliamentary Counsel to consider how it can be incorporated in this or other wording. I do not wish to make light of the proposals but one could say the voting machines and the PCs are stand alone and will be secure from hacking and that the equipment will be used under supervision and under the control of returning officers and of the presiding officers in polling stations. The biggest danger is from malicious damage in polling stations. The message needs to go out that such behaviour will not be tolerated and the best means of sending out that message is to ensure the fines are at a realistic level.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a doubt when the Minister of State says the biggest threat is to the voting machines and that they are stand alone. I am not talking about stand alone pieces of equipment but the software that goes into them in the preparation of it, probably months and years before. That somebody can install into the software a flawed system so that somebody is able to wreck the system with a virus, is a matter that is not covered. If it is covered under the 2002 Act there is no indictment. Therefore, the most one can be fined is the same as if one impersonated somebody. The Bill is flawed in this area and has to be corrected. Otherwise we are passing legislation that is flawed. I realise the Minister of State said he would bring it to the attention of <Col N="987"/>the commission and see what it recommends. We are here to create good legislation. It will not be good legislation if the shortfall in its integrity is to be solved by drawing the attention of the commission to it in the hope it will solve the <Col N="988"/>problem. It is flawed and it has to be corrected at this stage. It would be better not to pass the Bill today which is flawed in that manner.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P><Miles com="is" par="0p10"/><Miles com="ix"/>&ldquo;<Miles com="is" par="0p2"/>&lsquo;source code&rsquo; means the data which defines the principles or logic governing the operation of a system of electronic voting;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">Amendment No. 20 would require the publication of the source code of any electronic voting system, including in the event that a source code is amended, changed or disregarded. The amendment is related to amendment No. 7 which proposes that the term &ldquo;source code&rdquo; be defined. For some time, the Opposition parties have called for the publication of the source code, the guiding principles on which the electronic voting system <Col N="988"/>is based. It is unacceptable to ask people to exercise their democratic franchise using machines when nobody knows how they work. Publication of the source code is fundamental to securing public trust in any system of electronic voting.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is not acceptable to argue that the source code is a trade secret or confidential. The contract to buy the voting machines was funded by taxpayers&rsquo; money. As the public are expected to use the machines, they have the right to know the source code and this is the purpose of the amendments. I was disappointed that the Minister of State did not yield on the previous amendment and ask him to yield on these amendments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I have indicated on a number of occasions that the question of publication of the source code will be examined later in the year having regard to the security and secrecy of the ballot. As intended, my Department will examine the count rules in the context of electronic voting and counting to provide that all the votes of elected candidates are examined in the calculation and distribution of votes. As I informed Senator Quinn, any changes in the count rules would require fresh legislation which would provide the House with an opportunity to <Col N="989"/>revisit the matter. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to include the requirement provided for in the amendment at this time. We will consider the issue at a later date.</P>

  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive and Nos. 14, 15, 19, 27, 28 and 52 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par="0p10"/><Miles com="ix"/>&ldquo;<Miles com="is" par="0p2"/>&lsquo;voter-verified paper record&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it in <i>section 5</i>;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment proposes to insert a definition of voter verified paper records, as demanded by the Opposition parties. The amendment is connected to my proposal under the new section 5 which would require the voting system to produce a voter verified paper record.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 also concerns verifiability and would ensure the definition of &ldquo;voting machine&rdquo; would include a requirement that the machines produce a paper copy of every vote cast. This facility will be necessary in the event that a result is called into question or a recount is called.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12, which is related to amendment No. 11, is designed to ensure the definition of &ldquo;voting machine&rdquo; will require that the machines produce a voter verified paper record. The purpose of the amendments is to strengthen scrutiny of the electronic voting system and ensure the system is trustworthy and has the confidence of the public. It is important we act correctly in this regard.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 proposes to insert a new section on voter verified paper records. The availability of such records is fundamental to the integrity of any system of electronic voting and crucial in auditing and verifying the reliability and accuracy of electronic counts. The use of the electronic voting system caused a shock for certain candidates in one or two constituencies and the system needs to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 proposes a new section requiring the Commission on Electronic Voting to carry out random recounts of the voter verified paper records and to compare them with the results delivered by the voting machines. There is no better body than the independent commission to do that because it has done a wonderful job for the State. Regrettably, politicians did not listen. The former Taoiseach and leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton, pointed this out as far back as April 2002. If he had been heeded at the time, a great deal of taxpayer&rsquo;s money could have been saved and put to better uses in the interest of our citizens by various Departments. Regrettably, good advice was not taken on board and the amendments are intended to help in that <Col N="990"/>regard. I hope the Minister of State will accept them and provide greater clarity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bannon. I refer to amendment No. 52. Of the five themes the commission identified among the large number of submissions it received, the first was &ldquo;the need for a voter verified paper audit trail to ensure that the accuracy of the results can be checked independently of the new system itself&rdquo;. The commission acknowledged the issue fell outside its terms of reference but it also acknowledged it had a bearing on the successful implementation of the chosen system. It broadly hinted a voter verified paper audit trail would be a desirable, perhaps even a necessary, element in ensuring the new system was fully accepted by the public. That is an invitation to us, as legislators, to broaden the terms of reference of the commission to include the issue of a verifiable paper trail.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling rather than a prescriptive amendment. It leaves it open to the commission to consider the issue; it is not required to do so. I raised this issue first more than three years ago and a number of my comments are worth recapping. At a conceptual level what is at stake is a move from voting with an audit trail to voting without an audit trail and not a shift from paper-based voting to electronic voting. That is the basic difference.</P>
    <P>Under the current system, the key characteristic is the physical existence of a vote on paper, which is tracked at every stage. Before a vote becomes a vote, it is counted and the number of ballot papers is carefully controlled. Each paper is recorded and this takes place in full public view. A vote becomes a vote when a voter records his or her choice on that paper. The voter can examine the paper and handle it before giving it up to confirm that the paper reflects his or her intentions. He marks it, examines it again and goes with that.</P>
    <P>The fact that the vote is secret does not mean it disappears from view. It is counted going into the ballot box and again when it is taken out. The ballot paper is guarded while it is in the box. The counting takes place in public so everyone can see it and, if there is a recount, the physical evidence is there to do it. The entire process is so open and visible that the voter has total trust in the integrity of the system and this has not been questioned throughout the history of the State. The fundamental reason for this is the existence of a physical audit trail from start to finish. Our unquestioning trust in the system rests on that foundation.</P>
    <P>I physically create my vote by marking the ballot paper and, from that moment, the ballot is handled in a way that virtually eliminates the possibility of fraud or error. There is no fraud because the ballot is overseen, while there is no error because the raw material is there for a recount if there is a question of doubt. However, under the new system a voter will indicate choices by pressing the relevant parts of a touchable <Col N="991"/>screen and these will be electronically recorded on a medium such as a cassette or cartridge. The voter will not see the record and he or she must trust the technology to ensure his or her voting intentions are fully and correctly recorded.</P>
    <P>There is no feedback, confirmation or guarantee that the voter&rsquo;s intentions have been properly translated into digital impulses. Under the new system the moment of truth, the instant of voting, will disappear into a black hole and it can never be retrieved. The Bill provides for detailed regulations for the care of the recording medium before and after the voting has taken place. The regulations will ensure the counting process can be undertaken repeatedly. However, it does not provide for a means to allow us to inspect whether the translation of the voter&rsquo;s intentions into digital impulses was properly carried out. The new system will require an act of faith that the current system does not require. That, in a nutshell, is what the entire discussion on electronic voting is all about.</P>
    <P>In moving from a manual to an electronic system, must we also move from a system with a verifiable audit trail to a system without such a trail? That fundamental question has not been addressed. No body is better placed or qualified to address this question than the commission on electronic voting. It should, therefore, be left open to the commission&rsquo;s members to consider the issue and to report on it, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 19 is to enable the holding of parallel testing of the system in an election. In other words, as part of the testing of the chosen system, it should be tested alongside the existing system in an election in real time. The commission cited the absence of such testing as one of the reasons it was unable to certify the accuracy of the chosen system on page 20 of its interim report. It stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">There has been no parallel testing of the system in a real election, either against the traditional manual system of voting or against an alternative electronic means; such parallel testing is very important for such a critical system as voting at elections: although the system was deployed on a pilot basis in 2002, these elections were not run in parallel with a paper ballot, and the software has been modified many times since then.</P>
    <P FLI="0">During full testing of the system the commission will seek an element of parallel testing. There is no other way of interpreting its comments. If, on this occasion, it was unable to certify the accuracy of the system because,<i> inter alia</i>, it lacked recourse to parallel testing, it follows that in future testing the same constraint will apply. However, the need for this amendment arises because the Bill does not provide for such a parallel system to operate. This is important and the legislation will be faulty if this provision is not included whereas it will be greatly improved if it is included.</P><Col N="992"/>
    <P>The Minister is open to having a manual election in a number of constituencies and an electronic election in other constituencies. That was done during the last election. However, it is not open to him to have both a manual and an electronic election in the same constituency in the same election. In other words, no provision in existing legislation or in this Bill would permit the parallel testing that the commission sees as indispensable to its coming to a firm conclusion on the accuracy of the proposed system.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates a catch 22. On the one hand, it sets out to empower the commission to complete its work and to give the chosen system a clean bill of health. On the other, it does not create the powers necessary for the proper testing to take place, as far as this aspect of parallel testing is concerned. That is a nonsense and it cannot be allowed to stand. This is an example of the way in which the interim report of the commission has made it imperative to revise this Bill before it is enacted. For these reasons, I commend this amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>The amendment makes a great deal of sense and would provide great confidence in the legislation. A parallel testing system should be provided.</P>

Therefore, I do not understand <Col N="993"/>the argument for it. The last US election made use of chits and chads and guys looking at bits of paper. This is what we are trying to get away from. There is no requirement for a paper receipt for a vote.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>At present, when an election is called we present ourselves at our polling station. We may or may not have our polling card, we are marked off the register and we witness this. We receive our ballot paper, go behind a screen and cast our vote in a box &mdash; a box that is now probably in an auctioneer&rsquo;s hall down in Drimoleague in west Cork. Nonetheless, we trust in the system to the point where we can go home, witness the opening of the boxes in the count centre the following morning, see the ballot papers on the table and receive the information from the tallies all morning. This is how the manual system operates. It has been tried and tested and has produced a level of public confidence that electronic voting certainly could not even aspire to produce. We can see democracy in action from the very beginning, and from the announcements on the various counts to the filling of the seats.</P>
    <P>The point Senator Quinn makes about the running of both systems together is very good. It will not be 100% accurate &mdash; Senator Brady is quite correct in saying this &mdash; because of differences in the two systems. Under the existing system, a bunch of votes is randomly selected for use in the distribution of a surplus. There is no doubt about that but parallel testing inspires public confidence in the fact that the systems, run alongside each other, are accountable, accurate, fool-proof, etc.</P>
    <P>It was the failure of the system in Florida that led to the success of the candidate who did not have the highest number of first-preference votes. We want to avoid this at all costs. It was appallingly bad.</P>
    <P>On the transportation of votes, every time the Garda transfers a ballot box to Clonakilty council offices, I trust it 100%. We have very little choice but to do so.</P>
    <P>One important feature of the commission set up to examine this matter and which has issued its report is that the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, was not on it.</P>

	<P>Senator Bannon has made his point on the former leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, twice today. The Deputy was a candidate in the Meath constituency, where electronic voting was used in the last election. Contrary to what Senator Bannon is saying, the Deputy has been very supportive of electronic voting and urged people to vote.</P>
    <P>Let us return to the question of accuracy. During the last general election, different results were obtained following recounts in the Cork and Limerick constituencies. This would certainly not happen if the electronic voting system were used. Similar circumstances obtained in Roscommon <Col N="994"/>some years ago, in which case the count lasted a week. In the most recent election, some counts lasted a week, notably in Cork. This is not acceptable to candidates, the officials working in the count centres and the families and supporters of the candidates. As Senator Brady stated, if we were to have a parallel system, there would be total confusion in closely fought contests for seats because of discrepancies in the results of the two systems. Voting and counting must be accurate, and this is the case with the proposed electronic voting system.</P>

	<P>On the issue of receipts, I have said before that when one goes to an ATM and inserts one&rsquo;s card to withdraw money, one has the option of getting a receipt. I have always opted for a receipt because I do not trust the machine to do what I command it to do through using my card. Moreover, nobody wants a repeat of the inhumane events in the constituencies of Wicklow, Cork South-Central or Limerick West. Equally, what happened in Dublin North was just as inhumane because of the manner in which bad news was delivered to one of the Deputies who lost her seat. This was completely unfair. That is the other side of the argument.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has been debated over the past few months and I have not heard, even today, any substantive reasons for the inclusion, nor am I aware of any other country using such a facility. It may have been used in Brazil at some stage but I understand it is being discontinued there.</P>
    <P>This matter of the paper trail is causing concern, mostly in the US, regarding the use of some PC-based systems. Whether the facility should be provided is the subject of debate. It is not a proven requirement, nor is it a statutory requirement. There are arguments on both sides but we have to live in the real world. California, where it is proposed that the new equipment purchased in 2005 produce a paper trail, does not yet have machines that can do this. I understand there is a court challenge on the grounds that such a system will disadvantage the disabled and other groups. I noticed that several contributors who spoke on the Bill in the D&aacute;il sought a facility to enable visually impaired voters to vote independently.</P>
    <P>If we compare the various steps in the advocated paper trail system to what the Nedap voting machine does, we will note there is little <Col N="995"/>or no difference. The major argument is that the voter will see an image or his or her vote before pressing the &ldquo;cast vote&rdquo; button. This claim shows the lack of information about the proposed system and the invalid comparisons made with PC-based systems.</P>
    <P>I will not continue repeating that the electronic voting system is a stand-alone system. Other parties in the House were proposing Internet voting and text voting systems that could be hacked. However, this could not happen under the Nedap system. The printing of a ballot paper at the time of voting could lead to constitutional and practical difficulties. It creates a link between the voter and the vote and the printing of a receipt could lead to corruption. Unscrupulous employers could well dictate to their employees how they should vote and ask for proof afterwards of how they voted.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the two systems should be run side by side. We all agree that this would lead to two different results, thus leading to further confusion. Which result do we accept?</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 tabled by Senator Quinn envisages a dual system of paper ballots and electronic voting. Nobody has a problem with parallel testing of the electronic system but I do not favour the use of the two systems for the reasons just given. I doubt that 100% of voters would correctly enter the preferences on a ballot paper, especially if many preferences were recorded on the voting machine or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
    <P>I will refer to Part 4, summary and conclusion, of the commission&rsquo;s report. It states &ldquo;testing carried out by experts retained by the Commission on a significant sample of the voting machines deployed to returning officers confirms that the system can accurately and consistently record voter preferences&rdquo;. It continues: &ldquo;Parallel testing of the counting software programme carried out by experts retained by the Commission using a large number of sample data sets and a similar counting programme developed for the Commission confirms that it can accurately count votes in most situations, including unusual or difficult electoral situations.&rdquo; However, the commission said that the absence of a paper trail raises the standard and quality of the other system testing that is required. I have no problem with that. We will await the outcome of further reports and a final report from the commission. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, stated when the commission was established that the Government would take its recommendations on board. We have done that and abandoned electronic voting in the short term. We will take into consideration other recommendations made by the commission.</P>
    <P>In this instance, however, there is no justifiable reason for the paper trail. If I can go from the sublime to the ridiculous, reference was made to ballot papers being put into the boxes. How many people have looked at the bottom of the box? We had faith in the system and every confidence in <Col N="996"/>those conducting the poll but there was a possibility that the box could have had a hole at the bottom and the votes could have fallen through and under the desk. It is possible. The number one could be changed from one to four or to 11. That is the type of confidence we had. Nobody ever looked at the bottom of the box to see if the ballots were going into a black hole. The other difficulties with the paper trail are two different results, corruption and constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, it does not arise at this stage. We will not have electronic voting and there will be further opportunities to discuss these matters when we are discussing the recommendations from the commission.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister intended to use the Nedap-Powervote system if the Government got its way. We were told by expert opinion that the system is not safe and is flawed. Does the Minister propose to change the system or to continue with it? Will he abandon the system and the machines? Some say the machines are stored in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency at a cost of &euro;25,000 per annum. In fact, the figure of &euro;25,000 was crossed out and a handwritten figure of &euro;50,000 was substituted in the record discovered under the Freedom of Information Act. Will that system be abandoned if electronic voting is introduced?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the constituencies in which the ballot boxes have been disposed of, what have the returning officers done to date to replace them? From where will they come? Will they be replicas of the old boxes or will they be plastic? Who is making them?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ironic that earlier in the debate we were being accused of being too involved in the process. I do not know the answers to the questions. This is a matter for the returning officers, not the Minister. Ballot boxes will be available in ample time for the election. If I were to get involved in the micro-aspects of this, there would be justifiable reasons for making further accusations.</P>
    <P>I accept Members expressing an opinion but they should be more accurate when quoting from the commission&rsquo;s report. Everybody likes to dine <i>&agrave; la carte</i> occasionally but Senator Bannon said the system was flawed. The commission states however: &ldquo;The Commission wishes to emphasise that its conclusion is not based on any finding that the system will not work, but on the finding that it has not been proven at this time to the satisfaction of the Commission that it will work.&rdquo; I do not know how one can extract from this that the system is flawed. We will await the outcome of the further reports but I have strong views about the paper trail. It is not being used in any other countries.</P>
    <P>However, in the event of a court challenge of a result, the ballot papers can be presented to the court. That could have been done within a <Col N="997"/>specified period after the 2002 elections. If questions had been raised, the papers could have been presented to the court. That facility will be available in the future. We are not using any system at present but Nedap-Powervote is our preferred system. No commission would recommend what a major party in the Houses has recommended, that we introduce a system based on texting and the Internet, both of which can be hacked. The system we recommended stood alone.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 25 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (1), line 10, after &ldquo;counting votes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in a non-random way&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The random nature of the manual system of counting votes is one of its drawbacks. The problem was referred to by Senator Brady when speaking to the last amendment. It is difficult to understand why, in adopting a system of electronic voting, the Minister has sought to transfer flaws from the manual system. Among <Col N="998"/>the great advantages of an electronic voting system is that it is capable of counting all votes in the way they were cast. Hopefully, the electronic system we introduce will be fully transparent and unflawed. Amendment No. 13 proposes that any voting system adopted must count votes in a non-random manner to accurately reflect the true intent of voters. Given the importance of such a provision to instilling greater confidence in our democratic system, perhaps the Minister will consider accepting amendments Nos. 13 and 25.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to support Senator Bannon and to provide the Minister of State with a practical example of an injustice under the current system. I hope the eventual introduction of electronic voting will address the problem. The current system is very unfair where there is a <Col N="999"/>close race between candidates. It is fair that when a candidate exceeds the quota, his surplus is factored out in percentage terms. His second preferences are counted out. During the last general election count in Limerick West the surplus of the first candidate to exceed the quota was transferred with the result that a second candidate from the same party was elected by 800 or 900 votes. There is an inherent unfairness and injustice in simply taking those 800 or 900 votes from the top of the pile of surplus votes to be transferred. They could be from an area which is favourable to a particular candidate as happened in my case. Deputy Collins was elected in the western part of the constituency where I live although there is a tendency there to transfer votes within a party.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of an electronic voting system for two reasons. Few people realise the emotional trauma which results from a long, close count for a candidate&rsquo;s family and close supporters. Tallymen enjoy the excitement of the process which they consider to be a blood sport. There is no doubt that one enjoys the process if one wins. If one is waiting while a process drags on after most people have left to celebrate, it is not so exciting. While one must accept the slings and arrows of electoral fortune, in a close contest an important function of an electronic system would be to take the random element out of the process. When a surplus is transferred to a second candidate, all preferences should be counted. The percentage factoring of votes in the case of the first candidate elected should be the same in the case of the second. The votes on the top of a pile may be from the area from which one candidate comes which will impact very unfairly on the others. Objectivity and fairness can only be achieved where all votes are counted and the same pattern followed in the case of a subsequent candidate that was followed for the first to exceed the quota.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I could have made an issue of this at the last election. While I did not want to do so, I realise there is a defect in the system when it comes to distributing surpluses. Randomisation should be taken out of the process. I feel very strongly about this issue. If electronic voting is introduced, the system should be fair. While the human error element can be addressed by providing for delays between counts, an electronic system would result in much more scientific figures.</P>
    <P>One reflects on all of these matters when one is involved in a close count. The number of votes which are not franked by presiding officers is a disgrace. It should be remembered that presiding officers are often playing with a candidate&rsquo;s livelihood. These presiding officers will preside in subsequent elections as that is the pattern. I often wonder where votes come from. In an urban area if a presiding officer does not like a candidate, he can fail to frank the ballot papers of a group of young people. They do not know or care that a <Col N="1000"/>ballot paper has to be franked. I would like to see questions asked in the presiding officer system where there is an excessive amount of unfranked votes to ascertain whether or not they come from a particular polling booth. In that scenario, an analysis should be carried out and the presiding officer involved should not preside in a subsequent election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s argument. In the first Seanad election in which I took part, I saw something unfair take place although it did not happen in my own case. Another candidate lost by a very small number of votes for precisely the reason outlined by Senator Finucane. The random ballot papers were taken from a pile which had clearly been transferred from a particular candidate. It was possible to identify the likely transfers and the votes did not go to the candidate I mentioned. It was incorrect. The process should never be random. All votes should be counted and the proportions allocated in the correct manner. While I assume that would be the case in an electronic system, a flaw appears to exist in the current system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As already indicated on Second and Committee Stages in the D&aacute;il, the Government intends reviewing the count rules following the June polls having regard to the calculation and distribution of surpluses. Senator Finucane has taken us through operations in that regard in terms of how a different result can be obtained if surpluses are distributed in a different manner. He is quite right in saying this is not an exact science. The Government is anxious to ensure it will become an exact science thereby eliminating the random factor.</P>
    <P>The review, referred to earlier, will also cover any other areas linked to some arbitrary and random elements of the count. Senator Bannon will have another opportunity to reiterate his views when legislation to amend the count rule comes before the House. In the circumstances, I am unable to accept the amendment. However, there is general agreement that we must ensure the system is exact. A change in the count rules will be one of the advantages of electronic voting. As I stated earlier, Members will have an opportunity to discuss legislation on the count rules when it comes before the House and I am optimistic the electronic voting system in place for the next election will be more exact.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
  <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 not moved.</P>
  <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P><Col N="1001"/>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;5. The Electoral Acts shall stand amended so as to give independent candidates seeking election, parity with party-affiliated candidates.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to insert a new section between lines 23 and 24 on page 7. Members will be aware that this issue has been raised at executive meetings by a non-political body, the Local Authority Members&rsquo; Association, on numerous occasions. Many Independent candidates make an enormous contribution to society and their local communities. This provision forces an Independent candidate to bring before a returning officer 15 registered voters on the day he or she lodges his or her nomination. It is not enough to bring the signatures, one must bring along the registered voters in person. It should be sufficient to supply the signatures only because many people do not like to be identified. This requirement flies in the face of democracy given our system is one of open voting. We have spoken on the issue of secret ballots in terms of this Bill and the European Elections (Amendment) Act. The provision of secret ballots goes out the window when one is required to drive people to the returning officer to secure a nomination.</P>
    <P>I have no vested interest in this matter. As everybody knows, I am a member of a political party. I do not understand the reason Independent candidates should be treated differently to members of political parties. This is direct discrimination against non-affiliated candidates. It is unfair and unjust and should be changed. In a democracy, everybody has an equal right to place their names on a ballot paper. If not dealt with, this anomaly will be tested in the courts. The Constitution states that we should and must treat all our citizens equally. I do not see Independents as being treated equally in this regard.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to reverse this grossly unfair and undemocratic situation and to avoid a court challenge in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in Senator Bannon&rsquo;s point. However, the main difficulty for all candidates at election time is one of securing the deposit, in particular for European elections for which the deposit is high. I welcome the abolition, by way of court challenge, of the requirement to have a deposit.</P>
    <P>On Senator Bannon&rsquo;s point, this matter has already been tested in the courts. Perhaps this issue could be reconsidered in the context of future legislation. The main obstacle was the requirement to have a deposit and I welcome the abolition of that provision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon has made a valid argument but I am not sure the amendment, as tabled, is correct in that I believe we need controls in this area. If not, there is a danger that a person could interrupt an election by registering 1,000 candidates thereby resulting in one never <Col N="1002"/>finding the correct candidate. The current provision which requires a candidate to have 15 supporters may not be ideal. I would have been happy to support the amendment if it had offered an alternative. It is not a good idea to simply abolish the provision. While I would like the system to be eased in terms of Independent candidates putting their names forward, some sort of controls are required in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to set aside the provisions of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002 which introduced that instead of deposits non-party candidates would require their nomination forms to be assented by 15 assentors in the case of a local election, 30 for a general election and 60 for election to the European Parliament. I would like to point out that provision has been made, in terms of a European Parliament election, that assentors do not have to reside in a particular electoral constituency but can come from across the entire European constituency.</P>
    <P>A party candidate does not require his or her nomination form to be assented to if the form is accompanied by a certificate of political affiliation. Reference was made to the constitutional aspect of this matter. The constitutionality of these provisions was tested in the High Court last year. In that regard, the High Court found the provisions do not infringe the Constitution. Senators will be aware that the European elections order was commenced last Friday and the local elections polling day order will be made this week.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be aware that candidates standing for election to the Seanad &mdash; this provision has been in place for a long time &mdash; are required, even with affiliation to a political party, to have the support of four Members of the Oireachtas. I do not know Senators&rsquo; views in terms of the abolition of that requirement in the future given Senators&rsquo; view that all people should be treated equally. However, that is a debate for another day. This matter was tested in the court by Cooney, King and Stack to which the court gave the ruling I outlined earlier. In the circumstances, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his explanation. A person in the university constituencies standing for election to the Seanad is required to have ten registered nominees. It is interesting to see the number of candidates who have difficulty in finding ten nominees. If a proposed candidate has difficulty finding ten nominees, the chances of him or her getting a respectable vote in the election are slim. It is, therefore, a good discipline. It is not unreasonable to require ten nominees in the case of the university constituencies in the Seanad election or 15 nominees for a local election. I was unaware that 30 nominees were required for a <Col N="1003"/>D&aacute;il election and 60 for a European Parliament election. That seems reasonable to me.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (5), line 46, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It is important that we issue a reminder that we live in a democracy. As this section would empower the Fianna F&aacute;il director of elections to give instructions to returning officers, in the interest of retaining trust in the system those instructions should be made by way of ministerial order. An earlier amendment of mine proposed that a draft of that order be required to be laid before the Houses for approval. This amendment is similar to that earlier one and I ask the Minister of State to accept it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Instructions are not normally given by way of statutory order. Any instructions issued will, of course, be public documents. It is intended that most of the instructions will be in the guidelines to be issued under section 32 of the Bill. These guidelines will also be available publicly. However laudable Senator Bannon&rsquo;s case, his amendment is unnecessary and what he proposes would deviate from long established practice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister of State but I raise a small point regarding the clarity of the language in the instructions given to presiding officers and returning officers, which officials might bear in mind. At a polling station at a European Parliament election, I saw a lady arguing with the presiding officer. When she left I asked the presiding officer what was the problem and I was told that although the lady was on the register she could not vote because she was English. I assured him that not only could she vote but that she could stand for election for the European Parliament in Ireland. The presiding officer referred to the instruction book. Having read the book at least four times it eventually dawned on him that the lady was among the category of people who were not excluded from voting. The language of the instruction book would have led any reasonable person to make the same mistake as the presiding officer. We must ensure that the language in instructions to electoral officials is clear, precise and exact.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>I agree with Senator Dardis. The electoral register shows letters beside certain names indicating that a person may vote in some elections but not in others. The key to what each letter means is found on the cover of the register. <Col N="1004"/>The explanation is often vague and difficult to interpret. I understand how a presiding officer might be confused about a person&rsquo;s voting entitlement. A clearer book of instructions should be issued to presiding officers and such situations explained during the training process. Similar clarification should also be circulated to political parties. Parts of constituencies are sometimes in adjoining counties and names of voters are found in different parts of the registers. This causes confusion and needs to be examined.</P>

    <P FLI="0">We touched on this matter when we discussed sections 7 and 15 and a number of Schedules. These sections are designed to effect non-textual amendments. Legislation, like instructions to electoral officials, should not be unreadable or hard to understand. The use of non-textual amendments is discouraged in the Government&rsquo;s White Paper, Regulating Better. If these amendments are to be made they should be made in an up-front and textual way.

   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P><Col N="1005"/>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (1), line 8, after &ldquo;machine&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par="0p10"/><Miles com="ix"/>&ldquo;, and that each machine has been duly locked and sealed in accordance with <i>section 8(4)</i>&rdquo;.</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">This subsection deals with the vital piece of record keeping which will be central to establishing the evidence that the procedures set out in the preceding section have been properly carried out. As the subsection stands, before the commencement of the poll a statement is required to be printed showing the names of the candidates on the ballot paper at an election or the two questions on the ballot paper in the case of a referendum. This is to certify that no votes have been cast or recorded on the machine. These are two key requirements of the procedures set out in section 8. It is fitting that it is properly recorded that they have been carried out.</P>
    <P>Equally important is the other requirement, spelled out in section 8(4), that each machine has been properly locked and sealed. Why this omission? The requirement properly to seal and lock the machine is central to the integrity of the whole process. It surely follows that this statement of record by the presiding officer should also contain a certification that the essential requirement has been properly carried out. Without such a certification there will be a gaping hole in the chain of evidence if any problem should arise later in the process. It makes no sense to me that we should carefully inspect the recording of certain items while omitting to require the recording of other equally important items. What is the purpose of this record if it is to be seriously incomplete? We can repair this omission by accepting the amendment. I, therefore, commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 refers to section 11(2), which states that:</P>
    <P LI="1">The presiding officer shall also certify that none of the voting equipment has been interfered with in any way during the election process or if any such interference has taken place shall specify in detail the nature and extent of such interference.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment parallels, in important respects, the amendment I proposed to section 9.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) states:</P>
    <P LI="1">As soon as practicable after the close of the poll, the presiding officer, after ensuring that the lock referred to in section 8 on each voting machine in the polling station has not been interfered with, shall cause a statement showing a list of the candidates on the ballot paper at the election or two questions on the ballot paper in the case of a referendum and the total number of votes recorded on the machine at the polling station to be produced <Col N="1006"/>by the machine. The statement shall be signed by the presiding officer and witnessed by another person in the polling station. The presiding officer shall then open the lock and remove the cartridge or disc from each such voting machine so that no further votes can be entered therein.</P>
    <P FLI="0">There is a requirement on the presiding officer to carry out a number of essential actions but not the requirement to certify that he or she has carried out all of those actions. It is surely just as necessary to provide a record of the end to end integrity of the process and that the officer should certify that the voting system equipment has not been interfered with in any way during the election process. It is even more necessary that the presiding officer should record if any interference has taken place.</P>
    <P>As currently drafted, the Bill treats checking that the machinery has not been interfered with as a perfunctory matter, not worthy of being recorded. The very fact that it fails to provide for the circumstances in which actual interference has taken place underlines the lack of seriousness it attaches to the matter. In glossing over this matter, the Bill reveals a fundamental flaw. Checking on the integrity of the machinery used and recording the results of each check after it has taken place should be a central part of our policing of the system and of our guarantee to the public that they can have trust in it.</P>
    <P>Providing for a check without providing that the result of the check be properly recorded is tantamount to a mere genuflection to the requirements for absolute security in an electronic voting system. The public deserves better than this and we can provide it by adopting the amendment proposed. I commend the two amendments to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>We all accept the principle outlined by the Senator. However, I refer him to section 9(1) which deals with the opening of the poll. It reads:</P>
    <P LI="1">Immediately before the commencement of the poll at an election or referendum, the presiding officer at each polling station, after ensuring that the lock on the machine referred to in section 8 has not been interfered with, shall operate the voting machine in his or her charge to demonstrate to such persons as are present in the polling station that no votes are cast or recorded on the machine.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Therefore, the presiding officer is required by section 9(1) to ensure the lock on the machine referred to is not being interfered with. The matter is to be confirmed in writing by the presiding officer on the form VM1. This procedural item will be reinforced if necessary in the guidelines to be issued under section 32 of the Bill and in the presiding officers&rsquo; instruction <Col N="1007"/>book. Form VM1, which I can make available, states that presiding officers are asked to check, before the start of voting, the seal number on the side of the voting machine and the ballot module seal number to confirm both are intact. Acceptance of the amendment would result in duplication.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 10, lines 1 and 2, to delete subsection (5).</P>
    <P FLI="0">The provision as it stands is too bureaucratic. If, for whatever reason, a voter is unable to or has not cast a vote within what the Bill terms &ldquo;a reasonable time&rdquo;, he or she may not be entitled to apply for a second vote. Since e-voting was shelved because of the report of the commission many people have told me that they had not intended to vote. While I will not categorise, I can understand the fears of some about the electronic voting system. Voters do not want to look stupid if they cannot operate a machine at a polling station or hold up a queue or otherwise draw attention to themselves in an embarrassing manner.</P>
    <P>There is also another issue regarding the term &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo;. The period is at the discretion of the presiding officer, which is like asking how long is a piece of string. A reasonable time may be defined by an unreasonable person and Members will have witnessed incidents in polling stations over the years. If there are issues or difficulties, only common sense and reasonable behaviour can iron them out. Staff at polling stations work from early morning until late evening and may be tired, hungry or even incoherent. Despite this, such staff may be charged with the authority to decide what is a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>While I understand a similar provision exists in regard to the existing legislation for D&aacute;il elections, it is just as objectionable in this instance. From the perspective of voters who do not wish to be embarrassed at polling stations, the removal of the obligation to vote in a reasonable time would encourage voters to go to the polls. This provision is too bureaucratic.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsection (5) clarifies the position for presiding officers where a person leaves a polling station. This is the current position in polling stations where paper ballots are used. Once a person is marked off the register of electors, a second ballot paper would not be issued if that person were to leave a polling station. A voter must vote without undue delay and should leave the polling station as soon as <Col N="1008"/>she or he has voted. Voters cannot be allowed to depart the polling station without voting and then return. There must be discipline.</P>
    <P>If the amendment were accepted, it would give rise to circumstances in which impersonation could occur, and I do not think Members would want to provide such opportunities. It could also lead to lack of order in the control of polling station activity. We have had long experience of working the system and most people accept the responsibility of presiding officers. The system has worked well and it would be wrong to amend it. I will not accept the amendment as it is unnecessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the current system, with which voters are familiar. However, I tabled the amendment because the new system is different. The phrase &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; can be construed in different ways in regard to e-voting. If a voter is using a machine she or he has never before seen or used, it is reasonable to assume she or he would spend longer than with the traditional paper system. I first voted at a referendum. I marked the ballot paper and examined it closely to make sure I was not voting against my intent. However, in this context, it is because the system is so new that the lack of knowledge and sense of powerlessness among voters can lead to real fear for some. The Minister when he uses the current system as an example may have the opposite effect to that which he intended. While I will not push the amendment to a vote, it is important to remain cognisant of the issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment as it is being discussed with one in my name. The purpose of the amendment is not in any way to criticise those member of the commission with scientific expertise or, for that matter, other members of the commission but rather to highlight what is a glaring omission in respect of the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is very important that these be included as members of the commission.</P>
    <P>If there is a lesson to be learned from this issue, it must be in terms of consultation and involvement, which is the spirit of this amendment. I would appreciate if the Minister of State gave favourable consideration to the amendment and examined the calibre of the positions which are proposed to be included.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The effect of the combined amendments to section 19 is, in general, to increase the number of members of the commission by adding additional office holders to its membership, namely the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Furthermore, amendment No. 35 seeks to drop two current members. The Bill provides that the commission <Col N="1010"/>is chaired by a judge of the High Court and includes two other office holders, the Clerks of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and two other persons with knowledge or experience in the field of information technology. This is a reasonable balance without an overly large membership, which is what is required for the commission to carry out the specific task with which it has been assigned.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory or other obligation for either of the two office holders mentioned in the amendments to serve on the commission, which has a specific task which does not relate to their official functions. In addition, there are good arguments for not having too many persons on the commission so that it operates efficiently and cohesively.</P>
    <P>The proof of the pudding is in the eating and the commission has clearly operated effectively, independently and well and has produced a comprehensive interim report within a very tight time frame. It will no doubt continue to carry out its functions accordingly and I see no reason for an increase in its membership at this stage in mid-stream, nor do I see a need to replace the two members drawn from the field of information technology, which would be the effect of amendment No. 35.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendments in this case. That is no reflection on the Ombudsman or the Comptroller and Auditor General. The commission is not similar to the Boundary Commission or other commissions referred to and it is essential we have a proper balance and that there are persons on the commission with experience in the field of information technology. Two of the members of the commission are thus qualified. It is not a question of anyone being excluded from the commission but rather one of them not being included.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In this context it is important to consider the composition of other bodies established in recent years. For example, the Ombudsman sits on the Standards in Public Office Commission, established in 2001, the Referendum Commission, established in 1998 and the Constituency Commission, established in 1997, while the Comptroller and Auditor General sits on two of these bodies. Why was the Ombudsman excluded from the commission? The commission breaches precedents set by the Government. Why also has the Comptroller and Auditor General been excluded?</P>

   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Senator&rsquo;s amendments, the Minister does not want to pay him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see a need for the Ombudsman because the commission is qualitatively different from the other bodies which have been mentioned. However, cognisance should be taken of the additional <Col N="1011"/>duties which are falling to the Clerk of the Seanad. Since I came to the House, the functions and role of the Clerk have become a burden. She is a member of the Boundary Commission and the Referendum Commission and now this commission. In addition, if we had our way in amending the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002, the Clerk would also be a member of that commission. It is regrettable that she is not. Nevertheless, cognisance needs to be taken of the workload which is falling on the Clerk&rsquo;s shoulders.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State incorrectly stated that this is not about exclusion. Members of the Opposition were excluded when the membership of the commission was decided. If we are to learn anything about this episode, it is in regard to involvement, participation and consultation. I appeal to the better nature of the Minister of State to give the amendment favourable consideration.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 16, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) such reports on the Nedap Powervote system which present a comparative analysis of the reliability, security, integrity and verifiability of that system as compared with other systems of electronic voting which are in use in other countries, or which are available for acquisition,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We should not tie down the functions of the commission, which are fairly narrow. It should be empowered to take the Nedap Powervote system and compare it with other systems and its hands should not be tied as to the reliability, security, integrity and verifiability of the system.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 seeks to include a provision on such reports as deemed necessary on measures required to make electronic voting accessible to all disabled people such as to enable them to exercise independently their right to vote by secret ballot. I saw e-voting machines displayed in many unsuitable places. In two or three places the machines were on tables where it was nearly impossible for those in wheelchairs to access them. We must ensure that that does not happen on polling days, particularly as I have heard of instances where people could not access the models and candidates pushed such people to get a postal vote. That is unfair.</P>
    <P>Every member of society, irrespective of disability, should be able to access e-voting machines. It is important the machine is placed on a table or bench that allows everyone to access it, which is the reason behind the amendment. People&rsquo;s rights are being infringed because they have told me that they would not go to the polling station due to the way in which the machine was set up. That may not apply in urban centres but in small rural polling booths, there will be problems. It will not be the fault of the presiding officers who will put the e-voting machines on surfaces they feel are suitable, but guidelines should be put in place. These should be stand-alone units rather than machines to be placed on tables, like the models which were on display. I do not know if such machines were modified for polling booths.</P>
    <P>Every polling station should also have a bay for disabled parking at its entrance. People with disabilities who go out to vote often find they have to get out of their car and into their wheelchair in crowded conditions and though I know this is a matter for each local authority, provision for such bays should be part of the general guidelines from the Department. I am glad many public places have improved but not all public buildings have markings or areas for <Col N="1013"/>disabled parking. This should be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now coming to the terms of reference of the commission; I refer to amendment No. 51. We should use this opportunity to revisit the terms of reference of the commission, as by doing so we can ensure we get the best possible result from its deliberations. We can also ensure that the commission is not unduly restricted or hampered in any way by restrictions we put on it regarding what it may discuss and consider. I am aware that the Minister consulted the commission at the outset about its terms of reference to ensure that its members were happy with the brief they were given.</P>
    <P>However, that should not inhibit any of us from looking at the terms of reference again. Much water has flowed under the bridge in a very short time, and we should certainly revisit the terms of reference in the light of the interim report of the commission and the possibilities opened up by that report. Amendment No. 51 covers an eventuality I sincerely hope will not happen, but prudence demands that we provide for it in case it does. We must be ready for the worst case scenario, in which the commission comes back to us and states it cannot certify satisfactorily the secrecy and the accuracy of the system that has been chosen. I hope that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Like the Government, and most people in the country, I hope that we have not thrown &euro;50 million away on this project. I hope, as everyone does, that the commission will eventually find it possible to certify the chosen system, not because I have any flag to fly for the manufacturers of the present system, but simply because we have already invested so much money in that system. However, I am equally convinced that the fact that money has been spent on a system is not an argument for continuing with that system if it fails to deliver the goods, the goods in this case being a system the independent commission is prepared to certify. We should provide for the worst-case scenario. If the commission cannot certify the chosen system, what then?</P>
    <P>The people we should look to for an answer to that question are the commission members. They are the people best placed to tell us how to move forward in looking for a voting system that is likely to be capable of certification. My amendment provides that in the event that it is unable to certify satisfactorily the chosen system as it stands, it will be open to the commission to set out what it considers to be an appropriate specification for any future system, including the necessity, appropriateness or desirability of using publicly-accessible open source software. Senators will note that this wording does not require the commission to set out a specification for any future system but merely leaves it open to them to do so should they deem it appropriate.</P>
    <P>It also leaves it open to the commission to consider an issue which was the subject of many of the submissions received during the first stage <Col N="1014"/>of its work, namely the question of whether open source software should be specified for a project such as this. This is a vitally important issue which has not been sufficiently discussed in public. Senators will probably be aware there are two distinct types of software available: one is proprietary software which, as the name implies, is wholly the property of the company producing it. To preserve the rights in that property, the actual source software is kept strictly secret and not even the person who licenses the software from the company has the right to see into the actual source software itself. In a very real sense, therefore, one is buying a pig in a poke. Another characteristic of proprietary software is also highly relevant in the present case &mdash; when one buys proprietary software one is locking oneself in to one supplier for all time. If one wants to change supplier, one has to throw away the entire investment up to that point and start again from scratch with another supplier. Once we have chosen the Nedap-Powervote system we are stuck with their software for as long as we want to go on using their machines.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The alternative approach, which we have not adopted in this case, is to specify open source software. As its name implies, open source software is indeed open as the source software is publicly available. It can be inspected by anyone and can be used by anyone. If one uses open source software for electronic voting, one is using a system where the software is not secret at all. Strangely this can enhance rather than take away from the security of the overall voting process. Because the software is open it can be inspected by a wide range of experts and any faults in it can be clearly identified. The main advantage of open source software is that using it does not tie one to one manufacturer for all time. As things develop one can, if one wishes, put the project out to tender again and choose a new supplier. That new supplier does not have to throw away the existing investment, but can build on it. I have no wish here to make a case for either proprietary software or open source software. Clearly, if we were starting again from scratch &mdash; I hope we will not have to &mdash; the first question we should discuss and decide on is whether to go for open source or proprietary in terms of the software we choose. That is the fundamental first question that would need to be asked. This is the reason the issue is mentioned in this amendment.</P>
    <P>If the commission should fail to certify the existing chosen system, then it should be open to it to set out a specification for any future system. It should also be open to it to consider, if it so wishes, this fundamental issue of whether we should in future choose proprietary or open source software. As prudent legislators it is our duty to consider all the possibilities and make provision for anything that may happen.</P>
    <P>There have been many surprises on this road already, not all of them totally pleasant. Let us at least show that we have thought out the various <Col N="1015"/>possibilities, and provided a response to them. I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House. The situation in the Ulster Scots Agency as a result of recent developments is worth examination. Despite what has been claimed, the attitude of the Government from the beginning to the proposal and decision to set up the Ulster Scots Agency has been generous and broad-minded. The claims made on behalf of the language or linguistic tradition were virtually taken on trust. The Minister and other <Col N="1016"/>representatives of the Government have attended various Ulster Scots functions. In the past six months I attended a conference in Kilkeel under the auspices of the Schomberg Society but funded by the Ulster Scots Agency and I also visited the institute of Ulster Scots studies at Magee Campus, University of Ulster, which is a fine facility.</P>
    <P>According to my figures &mdash; the Minister may be able to add to the detail &mdash; there has been an increase in funding of approximately 500% since 1999. As in the case of the Irish language where the primary responsibility is with the Irish Government, one would have thought that in the case of the Ulster Scots Agency with the British Government paying 75% , the motor force would come from that quarter. It therefore does not make sense that the Irish Government is being blamed for funding difficulties and deficiencies.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question the British Minister of State, Jane Kennedy MP, claimed there was no demand for the teaching of Ulster Scots in schools. Scots and Ulster Scots are on the borderline between dialect and language. My father-in-law was a lowland Scot and had a Scots dictionary in his bookcase dating from 1930. The language seems to be based on a hybrid between Old English and Norse but it is really more akin to Hiberno-English than it is to Irish.</P>
    <P>Ulster Scots as an expression of identity is superior to the phrase, &ldquo;Simply British&rdquo;, but it <Col N="1017"/>does not encompass by any manner of means all the connections between Ulster and Scotland. I asked the question of one of the leading lights in the Ulster Scots movement, Nelson McCausland of the DUP, whether he considered the McDonnells of Antrim as Ulster Scots and he answered, &ldquo;No, they are Irish.&rdquo; There is no reason why Ulster Scots should be incompatible in any way with Irish any more than it is with British.</P>
    <P>I regret the degree of politicisation that was brought into some aspects of the public projection of the agency which has not found a parallel in any of the other North-South implementation bodies. The attacks made on the Irish Government have been very unfair. We have done our best to be supportive. If problems have arisen, one should first look to the main Government funding the agency, namely, the British Government. Relations between the agency and the British Government have not been good, perhaps due to the highly politicised nature in which its affairs have been conducted. It is also a question of seeking support and understanding from within one&rsquo;s own community. While there have been achievements, as outlined in the Ulster Scots newspaper, considerable work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I repudiate, in particular, any attack made on the record of the Irish Government regarding the treatment of minorities. This is without foundation as can be simply demonstrated by the fact that the equality agency in this jurisdiction has dealt with scarcely a single complaint of religious discrimination since its establishment.</P>
    <P>I hope that whoever takes over as chair of the Ulster Scots Agency will have realistic ambitions. The project is a worthwhile one but its scope should be broadened to become more inclusive. The agency would fare much better if it were not used as a kind of ideological battering ram against the Irish language or nationalism.</P>
    <P>The core issue is the need to recover goodwill. There is considerable latent goodwill in this State for the project if it is conducted in a more conciliatory fashion. I urge the Government to continue to adopt a sympathetic approach to the Ulster Scots Agency, help it to overcome problems and perhaps talk through in a less confrontational manner some of the problems and issues involved in disseminating Ulster Scots culture.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Mansergh for raising this matter and the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to come to the House to place on record the Government&rsquo;s position on the supports we are providing, in partnership with the Northern Ireland authorities, for the Ulster Scots Agency.</P>
    <P>By way of background, the North-South Language Body was set up as one of the North-South Implementation Bodies established in 1999 under the Good Friday Agreement. It comprises <Col N="1018"/>two distinct agencies, Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch &mdash; the Ulster Scots Agency &mdash; and Foras na Gaeilge. Each of these agencies has a separate board and the two boards together constitute the board of the overall North-South Language Body. The chairpersons of the agencies are the joint chairs of the North-South Language Body, otherwise known as Tha Boord o Leid in Ulster Scots and An Foras Teanga in Irish.</P>
    <P>Under the founding legislation North and South, the role of the Ulster Scots Agency is the &ldquo;promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island.&rdquo; The agency is jointly funded by the two Governments. The total budget for the Ulster Scots Agency was &euro;2.4 million in 2003 and the southern contribution towards the 2003 allocation was &euro;600,000. Some debate took place in 2003 as regards funding, which was cut in the Estimates of that year. The effect, however, was much greater on the Irish language element of the North-South Language Body, which lost approximately 15 times more funding. The money was restored later in the year and the reason for the delay was due to negotiations in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Ulster Scots Agency&rsquo;s overall budget for 2004 is &euro;2.47 million, an increase of almost 11% on the 2003 allocation. By agreement between the two jurisdictions North and South, funding for each agency is supplied in the ratio 75:25. In the case of the Ulster Scots Agency the southern contribution is 25%, which amounted to &euro;618,000 in 2004, and the northern contribution 75%. In the case of Foras na Gaeilge, which receives much greater funding because the Irish Government is willing to allocate a considerable amount to the organisation, the ratio is reversed.</P>
    <P>The Ulster Scots Agency would like to obtain more money from both Governments. I am not giving away any sensitive North-South secrets when I say that, nor am I stating anything that could not be said on behalf of any of the North-South implementation bodies or public body whose representatives I have ever met. Any application for increased funding from anyone must, in line with universal good practice, be supported by a robust business case. In the case of the Ulster Scots Agency, the two funding Departments must be satisfied that any business case submitted must be grounded within the statutory role of the agency, which is the &ldquo;promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the Senator will be aware, there is an additional key consideration of which both funding Departments must be mindful. Since the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the North-South implementation bodies have being operating on a care and maintenance basis, which has precluded the development of any new functions. The Ulster Scots Agency finds itself in <Col N="1019"/>a position, therefore, in which in addition to the need to present a robust business case, it must be able to show that any request for additional funding relates to sustaining and developing existing functions. I am aware that the agency, in common with many others, including the Irish Government, have found this situation frustrating. We all look forward to seeing devolved government back up and running in Northern Ireland and Senator Mansergh will know how hard both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, are working with the British Government and all the parties involved to bring about the circumstances in which that can happen.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the Ulster Scots Agency&rsquo;s desire for greater funding, a matter which is decided jointly by the two Governments on recommendations of the appropriate Departments. Due to the sensitivities of the issues, particular last year &mdash; I rejoined the Department in 2002 &mdash; I did not take a proactive part in either of the North-South Language Bodies. We are now in a much more stable political situation and it is my intention to <Col N="1020"/>become much more actively involved in the language bodies because we cannot allow matters to drift for either of them. Subject to budgetary constraints and agreement between the two Governments, I will be willing to consider reasonable demands.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record the regret with which I and my opposite number, Ms Angela Smith MP, the Minister with responsibility for the language body in Northern Ireland, learned of the recent resignation of the chairperson of the Ulster Scots Agency, Lord Laird of Artigarvan. He had provided leadership to the agency since his appointment and had played an important role in promoting the Ulster Scots culture and language in the North of Ireland. I am more than happy to reiterate the comments in our joint statement in response to the resignation, namely, that we both wanted to assure the Ulster Scots Agency and the wider Ulster Scots community, that we will continue to play a full role in helping to promote the Ulster Scots culture and language, in line with the commitment given in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
