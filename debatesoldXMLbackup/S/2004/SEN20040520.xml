	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1.30 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.</P>

	<P>The Leader probably noted the breach of security in the House of Commons yesterday. I wonder if she feels under possible attack from the benches behind me today.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be the Cathaoirleach who will suffer.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should remember that the enemy is behind him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes indeed. In politics, that is the maxim. It is time we had a debate on the ever-worsening crisis in the Middle East. Yesterday and last week we saw a new low in terms of attacks by the Israeli Army on an innocent civilian population in Gaza. Can we remind the Israeli Government that well over 70% of the Israeli people want the occupied territories handed back to the Palestinian people and the Israeli troops removed from the Gaza Strip? There is overwhelming support for that not only in Israel but throughout the world. Is it significant that for the first time in many years the Americans yesterday failed to back the Israelis in a UN resolution at the Security Council? It is important that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should attend the House, perhaps in the next week or so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is President of the EU Council of Ministers. He has expertise and <Col N="1226"/>knowledge and has worked with other countries in trying to find a solution in the Middle East. We need statements on this issue. Europe needs to have its voice heard in this regard and I urge that statements be made on the matter as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business yesterday I noted how important it is for Senators to deal with the process of impeachment and for us to have clarification on the Government&rsquo;s thinking on the issue. I noted that the Government must also recognise that Members of this House must have an input. I express my appreciation to the Leader for setting up a meeting with the Attorney General to clarify some of these issues. While that is very useful and may move the issue forward, this House is required under the Constitution, the same one which gives us the power of impeachment, to order its own business. There is no precedent in this area. It is inappropriate and quite unacceptable for the Government, which under the Constitution has no part in the impeachment process, to establish the procedures by which we would conduct our business in this House. The Government might well have views on that, but it is reasonable that those views should come through the Government parties in the House.</P>
    <P>We need a discussion, which will not deal with the individual case, on how the matter is to be handled. Before we begin, we must know how we will proceed. I have looked closely at how such a matter was dealt with in the Indian Parliament more than ten years ago. I will not go into the details, but it became an extraordinary mess.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I suggested a discussion with the Attorney General in order to clarify matters. Subsequently I want this House to ask how it should deal with the issue and advance matters. It may be that the matter must then be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It might be reasonable to suggest that, but it would be unreasonable to ask CPP members to deal with the matter in a vacuum. The views of all Members of this House on this matter are important. We should listen and understand. In a situation such as the one under consideration, what would be the burden of proof? Must it be beyond reasonable doubt, or what? We do not know. There are many issues to be discussed so that people can subsequently say they dealt with the matter as honestly and openly as possible, and then came to certain conclusions. People might criticise our conclusions but at least we could then show that we did our business honourably, dutifully, responsibly and in terms of procedure, correctly. At that stage someone might want to test the procedure or process in the High Court or the Supreme Court. If so, so be it, but we will know that we are safe in entering such a situation. If we proceed otherwise, the process might then be challenged in 20 different venues and we would be left in this House waiting for the outcome.</P><Col N="1227"/>
    <P>We must deal with this matter on an all-party basis, with every Member having an equal voice. I would be horrified to think the Government would attempt to advance this matter by itself. That would be wrong and unacceptable and would put many of us offside on the issue, whatever the critical issue might be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer first to the decision yesterday by EU Commissioner David Byrne to in effect allow the sale of genetically modified foods in Europe, specifically a form of genetically modified sweetcorn. Two issues arise in this area, the first being the decision itself and the second the manner in which it was taken.</P>
    <P>To put it very mildly, it is unfortunate that the decision was taken by the Commission in the absence of a qualified majority at the Council of Ministers. Such decisions should ideally be taken by Parliament or by the direct representatives of the national governments. For the decision in question to be taken by the Commissioner or by the Commission generally, particularly in the circumstances which obtained, was to say the least unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I am among those with a totally open mind regarding genetically modified foods. If it can be shown that the science involved is safe, I have no difficulty with the sale of such foods being allowed. We need a much better public debate than we have had so far, and this House might facilitate such a debate.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes regarding the appalling actions of the Israeli defence forces yesterday in Gaza. These were brutal acts of terrorism in the literal sense. What they did yesterday was clearly intended to, and had the effect of, inflicting terror on a large portion of the civilian population of that part of Gaza.</P>
    <P>I listened with growing incredulity to the apologists for the Israel Defence Forces and the Israeli Government yesterday as they attempted to defend what was done by saying that basically they needed to root out militants in that part of Gaza before withdrawing. I recall, as I am sure others in the House do, the remarks of Martin McGuinness a few months ago at the Saville inquiry when he said that whatever they intended on Bloody Sunday in 1972, the British Army provided the provos with their best possible recruitment tool and that for weeks afterwards, young men in Derry were queuing to join the Provisional IRA. I am sure something similar will happen in the next few weeks in the back streets of Gaza as young men seek to join those militant organisations looking to inflict violence on the people of Israel. How people in Israel, in the defence forces or in government, can possibly think this adds to the security of the people of Israel beggars belief.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The House should acknowledge the work done by Commissioner Byrne and wish him well in his retirement from the EU <Col N="1228"/>Commission. When he was nominated to the office, there was much criticism about it in that it would be a lame duck job and that it was not a position of stature within the Commission, but he has proved otherwise in the way he managed the BSE crisis, foot and mouth disease and so on. He has been a good representative for Ireland on the Commission and should be congratulated on the work he has done.</P>
    <P>Another good thing which should be noted by the House is the decision by Intel yesterday to invest &euro;1.6 billion in its plant in Leixlip and to bring employment in that plant to approximately 5,000 people. The real significance of it is that it puts the lie to say that a high labour cost economy cannot be a successful one. If we are competitive and if labour is productive, as it clearly is in Leixlip, then we can attract this major inward investment. The management and the staff at Intel are to be congratulated along with the T&aacute;naiste and the IDA in securing what is a huge international coup for this country.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns Iraq and the slaughter of people yesterday in Rafah in Gaza. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been consistent in his denunciation of these events and, as Senator Brian Hayes said, it is notable that the UN Security Council, by a margin of 14 with one abstention, condemned the incident. Perhaps there is a growing awareness within the United States of its responsibilities in this area. It is not on to hear a spokesman for the Israeli Army this morning trying to defend the indefensible. It is also not on to hear the attempt to defend the slaughter of people at a wedding in Iraq. I join with those Senators calling for an early debate on the Middle East.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Last month the Minister for Agriculture and Food was in the House to debate legislation to disband An Bord Glas. During that debate I asked him if he would take action in regard to the improper labelling of imported beef and salmon as Irish on the Irish market. I instanced for him an example of where food was being certified through one agent as Irish for Irish restaurants and hotels. This agent imports non-EU beef and salmon which are being promoted as Irish. Yesterday, a representative of the Food Safety Authority clearly indicated to a committee of the House that this was going on wholesale. I do not know why Bord Bia promotes Irish beef and salmon throughout Europe as quality products while at the same time, we are labelling imported beef and salmon as Irish. There is something wrong with that. The Minister subsequently wrote to me to say what I had said was incorrect but now another agency has verified it. It is important the Leader asks the Minister to come into the House to clearly indicate what is going on in the food industry.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to indicate the progress he has made in regard to access to third level institutions for the <Col N="1229"/>disadvantaged? This time last year he indicated it was a priority. Today a report in <i>The Irish Times </i>indicates the educational apartheid in terms of access to certain institutions, namely, the universities in Dublin. It is important the Minister clearly outlines the new model of league table he has in mind.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on what is happening to the Palestinian people. The war crimes being perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people will shock the world and will be seen for what they are. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been particularly forthright in support of the rights of the Palestinian people. It is important for this nation, and for all nations, to impress on Israel that of all the nations on earth, it should be wary about engaging in activities which could be perceived as being genocidal.</P>
    <P>I am delighted America has taken one small step in not now supporting Israel but we must be much stronger. There seems to be an interaction between all these excesses in different parts of the world. A debate on human rights would be particularly important.</P>
    <P>If the report on the attack on the wedding in Iraq is correct, we have again reached a new low. What surprises us most, if it is true, is why America has been so slow to admit it because given its technology and reporting, it seems to be in a position at times to confirm issues within minutes. However, it has not done so on this occasion. If the report is correct it means that over 40 people were executed by American forces. While seeking a debate on human rights might seem like an old long playing record, we must continue to do so. We must not allow our helplessness to paralyse us when it comes to activities. We must keeping saying this over and over again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that instead of No. 1, as scheduled, we have a debate on the Middle East because the situation is so urgent. We have seen the bombing of a wedding party. There is no question of doubt about it. We have seen the pictures. Small children were blown to smithereens and the Americans described them as &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo;. Now children are terrorists. President Bush is clearly in flagrant violation of international law and of sections of his own domestic law but nothing is being done about it. A special prosecutor was instituted to find out whether Monica Lewinsky gave President Clinton a blow job and here we have a criminal involved in war crimes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not parliamentary language. We are not discussing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know that it is unparliamentary, but it is unparliamentary to allow that man to remain unimpeached.</P>

	<P>We have no authority over&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There are some things we can do. I support that remarkable Christian gentlemen, Bishop Willie Walsh of Killaloe, who said on radio this morning that it was inappropriate and badly timed to have President Bush here. We should withdraw the invitation. I do not believe that man should be welcomed to this country. If he does come, I will protest against the visit.</P>
    <P>Although I am a friend of Israel and insist on remaining one, what is happening there is a disaster. War crimes are also being played out. I know Rafah quite well. It is a squalid place. A peaceful, unarmed demonstration was taking place. I heard the reports this morning that the people were deliberately walking slowly so that they would not attract fire, yet missiles, bombs and heavy machine guns were fired. I heard with horror two spokespeople &mdash; the military spokesman had, once again, an American accent &mdash; refer to it as &ldquo;weeding the garden&rdquo;. Imagine the insensitivity of the language; killing children is &ldquo;weeding the garden&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, we must stop impotently bleating in the House. There is one thing that we can do. There is a human rights protocol attached to the external association agreement of the European Union. Since we hold the Presidency of the EU, why do we not operate that and remove the special status awarded to Israel? What else is happening? If we do not recognise these actions as violations of human rights, we may as well pack up and go home.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Dardis said and draw attention to the latest development from the Intel Corporation. Last week, when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was here, I had related how, the previous weekend, the Fab 24 microchip had been produced in Leixlip. It is the most advanced microchip in the world. I am proud to say that the Intel operation became the jewel in the crown of the IDA when it was under the stewardship of my husband, P&aacute;draic White.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>In the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, spoke during Question Time of the plight of the three Irishmen in Colombia, who have been found not guilty of the main charge of training those involved in FARC. I would like to let everyone in the House know that the men have been found not guilty of the main charge.</P>

   </Speaker><Col N="1232"/>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Last weekend in Carlow there was a gangland shooting. I had warned about such worrying developments in the House. It is time that we had a debate in the House on the availability of firearms and the failure by the Government to address the growing drug problem in the country and the need to provide extra resources to address this issue. I ask the Leader to organise a debate on it and request that the relevant Ministers attend the House. Unfortunately, drugs are no longer a problem simply for city areas, since they are now rampant everywhere. Towns such as Carlow are suffering from the success of drug operations in Dublin, since the criminals have now moved operations to surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, after the local elections on 11 June, the Leader might organise a debate in the House on the election process. The idea of postering is becoming farcical. We have all learnt when canvassing that the register of electors is totally out of date in many areas. There must be a better system. I am not sure what it is, but I would recommend the use of the PPS number, which is unique to each individual. Making people attend Garda stations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;has not worked.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can discuss that when we have the debate on elections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It has turned people off voting when we should be encouraging them to vote. In Carlow, 1,000 forms were distributed and only 200 returned.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Leyden, reminding him of the time constraint.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Members in condemning the activities of the Israeli Government in Rafah yesterday regarding the slaughter of ten innocents and injury of 40 others. Actions speak louder than words, and we should make a request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who is now President of the EU Foreign Ministers and has been exemplary in his work on Palestine and recognising the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. I suggest that we withdraw the special status that Israel holds in the eyes of the European Union. A boycott of Israeli products should be undertaken. It is the only action that will have an effect on current events there. The boycott involving Dunnes Stores workers helped to bring down the South African regime. It is time that other workers decided to boycott all Israeli goods until Israel recognises the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt><?oasys [ah?>
	<P>I join with Senator Brian Hayes and all the other Senators who called for a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, on the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, if the Leader might arrange it. Perhaps she might inform the House of the Government&rsquo;s intended scaleback of the decentralisation programme regarding timeframe, locations and numbers.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Toole regarding the matter discussed yesterday. Fair procedures would dictate a free vote. That is how the Leader and the Members would intend us to proceed. Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others, I am grateful to the Leader for the efforts that she made yesterday and the meetings that have taken place behind the scenes. Perhaps she might say how she sees the House proceeding at this point, particularly regarding primary evidence.</P><?oasys [xh?>

   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Monday was the 30th anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Four or five weeks ago this House welcomed the report of the joint committee on that atrocity. It would be appropriate, particularly today, when the findings of the inquest are likely to be announced, that we call on the Leader to arrange, within the next few weeks, a debate on the report issued by the joint committee.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Norris&rsquo;s proposal that the Order of Business be amended so that we might have a debate on the Middle East. I endorse his sentiments that we should give President Bush a fairly hot reception when he visits Ireland. If we hold such a debate we will have an opportunity to redefine our very complicated relationship with the United States. Senators Dardis and White touched on the obviously positive element of United States investment, such as through Intel, which has been going on here for many years and has been of great benefit to the economy. However, that should in no way mean that we develop a political relationship with the United States whereby we have to kow-tow to its foreign policy. It is timely, now that Intel is putting so much more money in here and that President Bush is visiting in a month, to hold a debate on that relationship with the United States and have the courage to tell President Bush what we think of his foreign policy in the Middle East.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too join with previous speakers in calling for an urgent debate regarding the Middle East, and particularly the activities over the last few days in Israel and Palestine. Enough has been said about that, but I urge the Leader to arrange a debate as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers I welcome the news regarding Intel. Having lived in Leixlip from 1980 to 1992, I saw how it developed. I am somewhat surprised this morning to be corrected, since I had always thought that I, in my capacity as <Col N="1234"/>chairman of the combined residents&rsquo; association, had brought Intel to Leixlip when we met the company in the early days. I am glad to have been re-educated on that matter.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Leader if she could organise a debate on child care, particularly on the delivery of affordable child care, given we are trying to encourage as many parents as possible to return to the workforce. In many cases it is impossible for them in the absence of local, affordable child care.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach, I wish to again raise a matter I raised on the Order of Business about two weeks ago which, on the advice of the Leader, I tabled as a matter on the Adjournment. It was to ask the Minister of State in the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, for a date on which he will remove the razor wire around Farmleigh. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, replied to my Adjournment matter. His said &ldquo;the wire is being taken down as we speak&rdquo;. The wire was still in place yesterday. I have it in writing from the Minister that the wire was being taken down two weeks ago, as he spoke.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Parlon is bringing it down to Laois. Tom will fix it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support those Senators who have called for a debate on human rights and the Middle East. It is a strange policy for people to be put out of their homes, leaving an abiding memory in the minds of their children, and as they leave to see their houses bulldozed behind them. If one was to try to create trouble for the future, that is one sure way of doing it. One hears of helicopter gunships shooting into houses because it is believed tunnels are underneath. What is the point of shooting into a house if there are tunnels underneath? It just does not make sense, as regards people who have suffered so much in the past. The United States and Israel have the right to defend themselves, but the manner in which they are doing so has turned right-minded people against what they are doing. As regards visit of the President of the United States, we should remember that he is more than just a war leader.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>

	<P>Serious questions have arisen over the past couple of years as regards the national car test and the degree of fairness with which it is carried out across the country. We should have a discussion on that. There are issues in the capital, not specifically in the centre but in outlying areas, as regards clamping. In effect clamping is being used as a revenue generating mechanism by the people who operate the system.</P>

	<P>The fear exists that the people who operate the national car test are doing the same thing. I am not saying whether that is correct, but we should certainly have a debate on it. Clearly, the motorist is being neglected in the midst of all this. We need a discussion to bring the issues affecting these people to the top of the agenda as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, raised the matter of the Middle East, the Iraq and Israel-Palestine situations, in the light of the frightful atrocities which have been carried out there. I have received word that there will be a full debate in this House next Wednesday on the Middle East. People have every right to put forward a motion, <Col N="1236"/>if they wish to do so. It would not be possible for me to send back the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who is coming for Second Stage of the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 and to fetch another Minister to debate the Middle East, just like that.

	<P>We will have the debate next Wednesday. Regarding the comments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole, the representatives of the parties are meeting the Attorney General today at 4.30 p.m. Some of our questions, clearly, will be addressed, but we have a responsibility as a House which orders its own business. Therefore after the meeting we should regroup and decide on our next step. Senator O&rsquo;Toole checked on the Indian precedent of ten years ago and it turned out to be a most extraordinary business, leading to mayhem all around.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell raised the matter of GM foods. Responsibility is divided between the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. We will seek to have the relevant Minister come and address the issue. We could link with that Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s point about foods presented as being made in Ireland when they are not as acknowledged by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland during a committee debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis wished Commissioner David Byrne well as he has announced he is not going forward for another term. The Senator also acclaimed the Intel investment in Leixlip and raised the situation in Iraq and Gaza, which will be included in next Wednesday&rsquo;s debate. Senator Ulick Burke noted that Bord Glas is now defunct and what the Food Safety Authority of Ireland said. He also raised the matter of league tables in schools leading to access to third level. It is interesting what both the <i>Farmer&rsquo;s Journal</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> have to say on that subject this morning. I am pleased to see that a great many students from what we regard as ordinary second level schools around the country, community, comprehensive and others, gain access to third level. I was amazed to see that students like to stay in their own locality. I always believed one would like to get away from home when one was 17 or 18. Apparently they are more modest nowadays in their ambitions, or more demure. I do not know which. The Senator wanted a debate on that matter.</P>

I fully agree with what he said about the fact that we can feel helpless as a Chamber in a small country but that should not lead us to speech paralysis on the matter. We have the opportunity to talk and we should do so. Senator Norris praised Bishop Willie Walsh. However, he did say that if President Bush came he should get the respect due to him, while noting that he thought it an inappropriate time for a visit. Regarding Iraq and Israel, the words in <i>The Guardian</i> were chilling. It is just so awful. The Senator said we should operate the human rights protocol. Senator White mentioned her husband, and referred to the very advanced microchip developed by Intel some years ago and which led to further investment in Leixlip. She wants a debate on competitiveness. The T&aacute;naiste was here about three or four months ago for a debate on competitiveness. The Senator also gave us her assessment of the three Irishmen who were tried in Colombia, and I thank her for that.</P>

	<P>Senator Browne spoke about the gangland shooting in Carlow and the growing drug problem which is not exclusive to the cities. He also spoke about the electoral process. There is so much canvassing going on now that the public is confused with so many people knocking on doors. I hope the result will be a high turn out of voters.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden wants the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, as President of the EU Council of Foreign Minister, to withdraw the special status afforded to Israel by the EU, and calls for a boycott of Israeli goods. He referred to the boycott of South African goods by workers at Dunnes Stores during the days of apartheid which affected the food market there. Perhaps it is a point that could be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan asked me to inform the House of the Government&rsquo;s intended scaling back of the decentralisation programme regarding timeframe, locations and numbers. I have not heard of a scaling back of decentralisation. The provinces are delighted at the prospect and posters are going up to welcome people. He also echoed Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point and is quite correct in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh raised the findings of the report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. We are awaiting word from the Office of the Taoiseach that it can be proceeded with. It has been a couple of weeks since I asked about it and I will do so again, particularly as the 30th anniversary of the bombings has just passed.</P><Col N="1238"/>
    <P>Senator Ross talked about redefining our relationship with the United States. We have been saying the US is great, that it is investing in our economy and that it is wonderful, which it is. However, that should not cloud our views on other aspects of US policy, which is the point made by the Senator. One can say one thing about the investment and then go on to criticise other aspects of its policies. The idea that our mouths must remain closed about atrocities because of investment is incorrect. The Senator seconded the amendment proposed by Senator Norris for a change to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan also wants a debate regarding the Middle East, which we will have. He always contributes in a very fine fashion to debates on this subject. He also recalled that it was the combined residents&rsquo; associations in Leixlip that helped to bring all that money from Intel into the community.</P>

    <P>Senator John Phelan wants the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss the plight of the motorist. He thinks car owners and drivers are getting a raw deal.</P>
    <P>Senator Cummins raised the issue of storing the electronic voting machines in Waterford at a cost of &euro;50,000 per annum and wonders how much the cumulative cost will be of storing them throughout the country. I have no doubt that figure will be produced soon.</P>
    <P>As a general observation, there has been a very good series of articles in <i>The Irish Times </i>about the &ldquo;new Irish&rdquo; which has made excellent reading. It covered all the nationalities which have settled here and was aimed not just at students but at anyone seeking to understand the nationalities here and which are contributing to a different Ireland. Students have asked me to praise and acclaim the new Europe supplement to celebrate the accession of the new member states on 1 May and was renewed subsequently. It made very fine reading and was an act of real public service and I am glad to praise it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Adoptive Leave Act 1995 was introduced to provide leave similar to maternity leave for an adopting mother after the placement of a child into her care. The purpose of the Act was to redress a perceived anomaly that women who adopted children were excluded from the maternity leave entitlements in place under the Maternity Protection Act 1994. The 1995 Act replicates all the relevant benefits of maternity leave for women whose motherhood arises from adoption and its provisions were modelled on existing arrangements for natural mothers. It also makes provision for similar leave for men in exceptional circumstances which arise where the employee is a sole male adopter or if the adopting mother dies either shortly before or shortly after placement of the child.</P>
    <P>The Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 seeks to amend the 1995 Act in order to apply, where appropriate, to adoptive leave the recommendations made by the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation. The maternity working group was set up in accordance with commitments in the Government&rsquo;s An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The working group, which was chaired by my Department, included representatives from all pillars of social partnership, relevant Departments, the Health Services Employers&rsquo; Agency, the Health and Safety Authority and the <Col N="1240"/>Equality Authority. In late 2000, the Government accepted the recommendations of the maternity working group in full. Significantly, the Government also decided at that time to amend the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 to incorporate, where appropriate, the improvements proposed to the Maternity Protection Act 1994. The most significant recommendation, to extend the duration of maternity and additional maternity leave by four weeks each, were immediately implemented in March 2001 with identical increases applied simultaneously to adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave bringing the statutory adoptive leave entitlement which attracts payment of salary or adoptive benefit to 14 weeks and additional unpaid adoptive leave to eight weeks. The remaining recommendations of the working group of relevance to adoptive leave require primary legislation to amend the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 and these will be implemented on the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The birth of a child requires considerable advance preparation and adjustment and this is equally true in the case of the arrival of an adopted child. The adoption process is a long and anxious journey for parents but happily in the majority of cases it culminates in the fulfilment of their wishes to have a child. For good reason the preparatory and assessment process is thorough and demands the full commitment of adopting parents. It is important that we ensure that those wishing to adopt or who have just had a child placed with them are given every support throughout this period. The measures introduced in the Adoptive Leave Bill will enhance the existing legislative provisions for employed adopting parents and will offer them greater employment protection and more flexibility in managing their work and family responsibilities during this important period. The decline in the numbers of children available for domestic adoption in recent years has given rise to a marked growth in the number of foreign adoptions. Adoption Board figures for 2002 show that, of the 602 adoptions authorised that year, 336 were foreign adoptions, 99 were Irish non-family adoptions and the remaining 167 were adoptions within families. Senators may also be interested to note that in the same year there were 215 recipients of adoptive benefit payments to employees by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Adoptive Leave Act 1995 was introduced to provide an entitlement to periods of leave from employment for an adopting mother after the placement of a child into her care on an equivalent basis to the entitlement to leave available in the maternity protection legislation to natural mothers. This equivalence was maintained in 2001 when matching increases in the periods of leave available to natural and adopting mothers were applied. In keeping with this policy, a recent proposal on maternity leave <Col N="1241"/>entitlements will also be applied to adoptive leave. As Senators are aware, the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 currently before the D&aacute;il provides for the reduction of the compulsory pre-confinement period of maternity leave from four weeks to two weeks, thereby increasing the period of such leave available post-birth to 16 weeks. In the interests of maintaining parity of entitlements between adopting and natural mothers, the Government has agreed to accordingly increase the period of adoptive leave by two weeks to 16 weeks. This provision in section 3 effectively means that both natural and adopting mothers will be able to avail of 16 weeks leave from work with payment of Department of Social and Family Affairs benefit from the time a child is born or placed into their care.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the growth in foreign adoptions, the Department of Health and Children introduced a structured approach to preparing and assessing prospective adopters for inter-country adoptions. As part of this structure, adopting parents are now required under the standardised framework for inter-country adoption to attend a series of structured group sessions organised by their local health board or adoption agency. Participation in the education and preparation stage of the standardised framework is compulsory for adopting parents and will become a statutory requirement under legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Health and Children to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. This important stage of the process gives prospective adopters an opportunity to learn more about inter-country adoption so that they can make an informed choice as to whether this is an appropriate step for them to take. It provides them with an opportunity to evaluate and improve their knowledge regarding inter-country adoption and a place to meet other applicants who are at a similar stage in the process where mutual support and learning can take place.</P>
    <P>I understand courses normally comprise between six and eight, three hour sessions, giving 18 to 24 hours of preparation and are generally held over a four month period. Alternatively, some health boards run the course over three days. I understand the Department of Health and Children is currently encouraging health boards to explore the possibility of introducing more efficiencies in the education and preparation stage of the inter-country adoption process which may result in classes being held outside of working hours and a reduction in the time between the completion of classes and actual placement.</P>
    <P>All prospective adopters, whether they are involved in domestic or inter-country adoptions, are required to attend an average of five to seven pre-adoption interviews, each of about one and a <Col N="1242"/>half hours to two hours duration, with social workers with respect to their adoption application. I understand that these interviews generally take place during regular office hours at the health board or adoption agency offices. However, this part of the assessment process also includes at least one home visit by a social worker.</P>
    <P>Some employers allow their employees paid time off from work to attend pre-adoption meetings and classes. However, many employers do not allow paid time off for this purpose which places a further financial cost on adopting parents. To alleviate this, the Bill provides for a new entitlement for adopting parents to time off from work, without loss of pay, to attend pre-adoption classes and interviews, which they are obliged by the State to attend as part of the adoption process. This new provision parallels the provisions in the maternity protection legislation for paid time off work before the birth for pregnant women to attend antenatal care appointments. However, it also recognises that the adoption process differs from maternity in that it requires the full participation of both parents at each stage of preparation. This new entitlement will better facilitate prospective adopting parents in meeting their work commitments while also attending the required elements of the application and assessment process for adoption.</P>
    <P>I have set out the detailed provisions of the Bill in the copy of my speech which has been circulated to Members. If Members wish I will go through each section, but if they want to take it as read I am equally happy with that. I am in the hands of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

	<P>I think it would be better to take it as read. I do not wish to delay proceedings and I am anxious to hear the contributions of Members sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to other important developments taking place in regard to adoption. My colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, initiated a consultation process last year on adoption legislation. It is his intention to undertake a complete review of adoption legislation with the aim of making it more compatible with life in the 21st century by ensuring that it takes account of the changes in society as well as changing trends and practices in adoption that have taken place since the 1952 Adoption Act. The consultation process was a broad ranging one examining a number of issues, including a draft Bill to provide for ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption and to make changes to the <Col N="1243"/>role and structure of the Adoption Board. A second draft Bill to provide for a structured and regulated way of providing access to information and contact for those affected by adoption was also considered during the consultation process. The Hague Convention on inter-country adoption needs to be ratified as a matter of priority to provide safeguards for children involved in inter-country adoption by regulating the processes by which children are adopted into this country.</P>
    <P>Nearly 300 submissions were received from a wide range of people and organisations, including adopted people, adopting parents and natural parents. The written consultation was followed by a conference last October at which these issues were discussed in detail. The process provided many valuable insights into sensitive issues needing to be addressed, either on a legislative or administrative basis. The views garnered through both processes are currently being examined by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the context of preparing proposals for changes to adoption legislation. I understand he hopes to submit his proposals to Government before the summer. I look forward with interest to further developments in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Adoptive Leave Bill before the House is part of a suite of statutory work-life balance measures to which my Department is committed under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003, which is currently progressing through the D&aacute;il, implements in full the recommendations of the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation. Once enacted, its provisions will strengthen and improve the employment rights of pregnant mothers and women who have recently given birth and those who wish to resume work while breastfeeding. The Parental Leave Act 1998 is also due for amendment in line with the agreed recommendations of a working group which reviewed that Act. Work is currently under way in my Department on the necessary heads of a Bill and I expect that concrete legislative proposals will shortly be brought to Government.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the contributions of Senators to the debate on the Adoptive Leave Bill. The Bill represents a balanced and progressive response to the needs of employed adopting parents. It builds on progress already made in regard to employment equality legislation and marks another important step towards fulfilling the Government&rsquo;s commitments in Sustaining Progress. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House to deal with this important Bill. Many parents and parents-to-be will also welcome it. I regret that it has taken three years to bring it forward in <Col N="1244"/>contrast with the three weeks required to bring forward the Immigration Act. We can see where the Government places the emphasis. There is no excuse for the inordinate delay in bringing forward the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that parents are supported as they go through the adoption process and this must be reflected in legislation. We should not differentiate between natural and adoptive parents. Many parents who eventually adopt probably go through a difficult time emotionally. Some women who are unable to bear children may decide to adopt. Others may decide to adopt from an early stage. By and large, people who adopt do so after a number of years of marriage and undergo an emotional upheaval in making a decision of this nature.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Bill on which I am seeking clarification. The adoptive leave period is being extended from 14 to 16 weeks and the Minister stated that this will bring the position into line with that which obtains in respect of maternity leave. However, maternity leave lasts for 18 weeks. It is made up of two weeks pre-birth and 16 weeks post-birth. If I am wrong, I am sure the Minister will correct me. Adoptive parents and natural parents should be treated in the same way. If the period of maternity leave is 18 weeks, the same period should also apply in respect of adoptive leave. There should be no discrepancy and the Minister stated that he would ensure equality between adoptive and natural parents.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister has given consideration to the position of the many parents who adopt children from abroad. In some cases, such parents are required to spend time in the country in which the children they are adopting were born. That period varies but it could be anything from three to six weeks. If these parents were given leave before the adoptions take place, it could be of benefit to them if they are obliged to spend time in the country in which the children were born. We should address that matter either in this Bill or in the adoption legislation with which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is dealing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that prospective adoptive parents will be entitled to time to attend pre-adoption meetings and classes. However, I do not recall a provision in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill requiring that evidence of attendance at maternity classes must be furnished to employers. There is no need to include such a provision in this Bill. We must trust that people who are in the process of adopting a child will attend these classes. We do not require natural mothers to provide evidence as to whether they attend maternity classes. I do not recall a provision of that nature in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill and, if that is the case, this Bill should not contain such a provision.</P><Col N="1245"/>
    <P>I welcome the vital employment protections provided for in the Bill. That time spent on adoptive leave would be considered as a period of service is important. The Bill will also prevent termination of employment, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>When we debated the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill we strayed into discussing the area of child care. On today&rsquo;s Order of Business I raised the fact that we need to improve the level of child care provision for all parents in order to enable them to return to work or to carry on with their lives in general. Making child care available and affordable is extremely important. I was recently contacted by a number of child care providers who are concerned about the cost to them of rates. That cost has risen dramatically and is placing a major burden on child care providers. It is being passed on to parents who avail of child care services and this makes child care even more expensive. We must consider how we can reduce the cost of child care provision. More family-friendly work practices are also needed in order to enable parents to return to the workplace.</P>

    <P>The legislation is indicative of the caring element within the Government which seeks to ensure that everybody will be accommodated in a fair way. Child care, adoption and children in general have been tremendous priorities for the Government in recent years and the needs of adoptive parents are being recognised in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Many people have adopted children in the past. Adoption is a most Christian act and illustrates the caring ethos that exists in our society. It has provided opportunities for children who would otherwise not have had them because of the circumstances into which they were born. The parents of such children might not have been in a position to maintain and rear them. Parents who were not in a position to have their own children have gained a great sense of fulfilment from being able to adopt children. I have always found it remarkable that in some instances it was not only parents who were unable to have children who adopted but also those who already had families of significant size. As a result of their beliefs and selfless attitudes, the latter adopted children and reared them to be tremendous citizens. Adoption is deserving of support and recognition and the Bill provides these.</P>
    <P>As the Minister correctly pointed out, there has been a trend in recent times towards the adoption of foreign children. Many people have travelled abroad to adopt and have invested a great deal of effort into securing adoptions. The children they brought back to this country will be reared as Irish citizens and will have access to all the <Col N="1246"/>opportunities we have enjoyed as a result of our citizenship of this State.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated, the Bill came about as a result of a commitment in Sustaining Progress. The latter emerged from our system of social partnership, which has been of significant economic benefit to this country. In the late 1980s, the Government of the day pioneered this new and enlightened approach to society and the country&rsquo;s economic well-being. At that time there were serious challenges to that well-being and unemployment had reached significant levels. Social partnership has been an important component in ensuring the country&rsquo;s economic well-being and in securing the improved and enhanced lifestyle people now enjoy.</P>
    <P>The recent report on Seanad reform recognises that there is, perhaps, a certain gap between what happens within the social partnership framework and the Houses of the Oireachtas. I welcome the recommendation in the report that the Seanad should play a greater role in addressing that lacuna and have increased interaction and liaison with the social partners. I hope this recommendation will be taken on board in terms of changing the structure and the functions of the House.</P>
    <P>There is a belief that much of the social legislation we are putting in place is having some effect on small businesses. It is important we are mindful and measure that as we make the necessary changes. As was stated here previously, competitiveness will, ultimately, determine our economic sustainability. It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that we remain competitive.</P>
    <P>It is right and just that people who adopt children enjoy the same entitlements as natural parents for the rearing of those children, particularly in the early stage which allows them to bond with the child and come to terms with parenthood. The Government should be commended for providing for this in this legislation. I am glad to support this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome this Bill which amends the Adoptive Leave Act 1995. This legislation came about following the recommendations of the working group established for the purpose of amending that Bill. The Adoptive Leave Act 1995 provided additional weeks&rsquo; leave to adoptive parents at the time. One of the main provisions of the Bill is to increase that time further.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry raised the issue of the number of weeks&rsquo; leave for adoptive versus natural parents, 16 versus 18. One can understand how this happens. A biological mother may need time off prior to the birth of the baby to deal with medical problems an adoptive mother would not necessarily have. I remember when it was recommended that the pregnant mother should take four weeks of her leave prior to the birth of <Col N="1247"/>the child. This has now been reduced to two weeks. Is that regulation established in law?</P>
    <P>When the recommended period was four weeks, pregnant mothers were inclined to hang on as long as they could before taking leave, sometimes at risk to themselves, in order to have as much time as possible with their child after the birth. I remember when I worked in the Mater Hospital we went out one Friday evening, as traditional, to have drinks with a girl from my department who was taking maternity leave and to celebrate the pending arrival of her child. About two hours into the session we discovered that the expectant mother was not there. On her way to the pub she had to detour to Holles Street hospital to have her child. This woman may have taken a chance by working right up to her delivery. Perhaps doctors were in cahoots with such women. Some people say they were at the time and that they were willing to change expected arrival dates, etc. Women ran a risk by trying to arrange matters so they could take most of the time off after the birth of the baby and sometimes forfeited their health by staying at work too long. However, 20 years on I am sure this woman&rsquo;s child is getting on well.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are discussing further equality legislation today confirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the equality agenda. The increased leave period and the other improvements recommended by the group are evidence of the growing awareness of the need for greater balance between working and family time. The implementation of the recommendations will make the workplace a better place for pregnant women and new mothers.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry mentioned the problem of the lack of child care facilities. The legislation being introduced today will alleviate this in some way through increased parental leave for adopted children. However, while the situation may be alleviated somewhat, child care remains a serious problem. Perhaps the Minister for Finance would consider giving some form of tax relief to mothers and parents who must pay for expensive child care facilities in order for them to continue in the workforce. Only a few years ago we were crying out for people to stay in the workforce and were seeking ways to try and get more people into it. Such an incentive would encourage people.</P>
    <P>The achievement of the working group in reviewing maternity protection legislation in its entirety is commendable. The group has done a significant job in the area of this complex legislation. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform also faces a ferocious task in dealing with this and with equality legislation which ranges over issues from disability to equality at work etc. The Government is doing a fine job in that regard and I hope this continues.</P><Col N="1248"/>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh mentioned small businesses. Approximately 40 pieces of legislation have been introduced in the equality area since 1997 and there is no doubt but that these have an impact on small businesses. Has any study ever been done on the impact of this legislation on small businesses in terms of their ability to survive and create jobs, rather than lose them? In terms of the minimum wage, I heard talk that small businesses stood to lose 14,000 jobs. It has been said that 29,000 jobs are at risk overall because if there was no increase another 15,000 jobs could have been created. I raise this matter in the context of our ability as a country to continue to create jobs in small businesses.</P>
    <P>If we consider the legislation currently under discussion in the context of a business with ten employees, if three of the staff were on leave at any one time &mdash; maternity, adoptive or sick leave &mdash; this would have a serious impact on the company which might only be surviving by a thread. Flexibility is important for such small businesses. However, flexibility has tightened as a result of the amount of legislation that has been passed in recent years on contracts, dismissals, equality of working time, redundancy, parental leave, now adoptive leave, stress and bullying. We have had a plethora of conditions, including the major one of health and safety regulations, placed on small businesses. These could have a significant impact on the ability of these companies to survive. We must be careful of the collective impact legislation has on such industry. However, in terms of creating equality for all workers, this legislation is commendable.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for coming to the House to debate this fine legislation. I wish to comment on something Senator Kett said but not in a combative manner because I recognise that he researches his topic and speaks well on any issue. If we should say that equality issues should not apply to small firms, we would not be following the equality agenda. It is the right of women, or either parent in the case of adoptive parents, to avail of maternity or adoptive leave. A firm cannot be allowed to opt out on the basis that it is a small firm. That would negate the whole equality agenda. The issue has often been raised with me, so I understand the Senator&rsquo;s point. However, I do not accept it.</P>
    <P>I welcome this excellent legislation which was strongly recommended in Sustaining Progress. On reading it I could see how sensible and practical the arrangements were. My family came about at a time when there was no legislation. Women had their babies and if they had a job they went back to work and if they did not they just got on with life. That was accepted because people knew no better.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1249"/>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>Civil servants did not go back to work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not know that; I was a teacher, but that is beside the point. I always thought that while the maternity leave provisions were excellent they discriminated against adoptive parents. Childbirth is a natural process. Fortunately, very few women have difficulty with childbirth. In cases where they do, they are helped medically. In the context of maternity leave, helping a mother to recover was never the point. The point of it was to allow the mother and child time together to bond, to use the modern word, to get to know and love one another and to allow them to go through that very happy process untrammelled by the duties of paid work outside the home. I thought it was a very good idea. However, it led me to realise, because I went through an adoption process myself, although there was no maternity leave then so it would have made no difference, that an adoptive mother also needs time to bond and get to know and to love her new child. This is, therefore, a very common-sense and practical approach which I strongly welcome.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the change regarding the four weeks a woman had to take before the birth, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, mentioned. It was all very well, but it led to doctors and mothers telling white lies about when the child was expected. In the natural process of pregnancy and birth a woman could be out and about until a day or two before giving birth. Laying up and putting up one&rsquo;s feet was the old fashioned way and does not hold any more.</P>
    <P>I highly commend the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004. I also commend the idea of providing classes. Unmarried women are having babies and keeping them, which is good. Inter-country adoptions are very much on the cards now. Again, classes are being provided to familiarise people with the culture and mores of the country where the adopted child was born. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has received more than 300 submissions in the consultative process in which he is engaged. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, referred to this in his speech in the context of bringing the adoption law up to date and amending the legislation. It is a major process and not one to be entered into lightly given the sensitivities, proprietorial feelings etc. that must be taken into account. There are issues that may arise later in life for the adopted child when he or she reaches adulthood. Similar issues will arise for the natural mother and the adoptive parents. These are not issues which are easily addressed and I commend the care that has been taken in dealing with them. The intention to reform the relevant legislation was announced some years <Col N="1250"/>ago, but it is better to adopt the maxim <i>festina lente</i> in this matter and take the time to hear a variety of views. That more than 300 submissions were received is significant and illustrates the amount of interest there is in the issue.</P>
    <P>Senators Kett and Walsh have long experience in the field of justice, equality and law reform, whereas I speak from a more personal viewpoint on the matter. My experience was many years ago when there was no legislation of any kind. Were it not for what Senator Kett told us I would not have known the Civil Service had maternity leave then. I doubt it. I have never heard that it had.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>What I said was that civil servants could not go back to work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Who could not?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>A civil servant could not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a long time ago. I was teaching and was welcomed back, but the Senator can imagine all the fuss and the arrangements that had to be made following one birth and one adoption. At that time when one adopted a child through an adoption agency, one was encouraged to stay at home for a year in order to get to know the child and give it the care it required. It was not mandatory, but it was encouraged. I do not know whether that is still the case.</P>
    <P>The Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 is a very good, modern Bill. It is certainly high on the equality agenda. I strongly approve of it and commend it to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Terry raised the issue, dealt with under section 7, of an employer demanding that evidence of attendance should be furnished if an adoptive parent attends a class. That is very bureaucratic and mean-minded. In my company shop stewards going to a meeting obtain a notice from the union stating that they will be attending a meeting. That is adequate and we allow the person to go. This provision is small-minded. I mentioned it to the Minister before we came into the House and he replied that the employer does not have to demand such evidence. However, including it is a male, bureaucratic response.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, dealt with the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 in this House. Its purpose was to improve the employment rights of pregnant mothers and women who had recently given birth and those who wished to resume work while breast-feeding. I thought it was nonsense to suggest that anybody could go to work while breast-feeding. How a woman could work and breast-feed a baby is beyond me. She would be exhausted. It was suggested that the woman could go home to breast-feed and return to work. That is nonsense. To do it on site would require nursery facilities in the company. As somebody <Col N="1251"/>else remarked, only a man would suggest a woman could breast-feed and work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I know of a school where it is done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally speaking, it would be very difficult to breast-feed a baby of four months while at work. I said before that I did not think much of the idea. I also mentioned to the Minister that before the end of this session we would like a serious discussion in the House on child care. It is the most serious issue facing the cohort aged 24 to 40 years. The Minister agreed that we should proceed, so before the end of the session we will have statements and a discussion on child care. It is my second priority. After the peace process in Northern Ireland, it is the most critical issue facing this country, and particularly the cohort aged 24 to 40 years.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett made a point regarding small companies giving time off.</P>
    <P>As the co-founder of a small business that employs 50 people, I am aware that people regularly need to take time off. I assure Senator Kett that it is one of many struggles faced by a small employer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>If one cannot handle that, one might as well stay at home and close one&rsquo;s business. Small companies face a struggle every day, from morning until night. The problem mentioned by Senator Kett is one of many struggles. I would not like the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion to be accepted because I know how it would affect companies. The less said the better, because it will become a women&rsquo;s issue. I know the Senator&rsquo;s intentions were good.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not suggest anything.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes. Senator Kett&rsquo;s suggestion immediately struck me as a very alien thought.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is a step in the right direction. We will have to face the reality of the existing child care legislation. Issues such as the cost of child care, the return to work of married women who have had children and the ability of <Col N="1252"/>such women to maintain their positions in companies have to be dealt with.</P>

	<P>When he introduced the Bill, the Minister said that the rights of the child should be the primary concern in this regard. I have made a similar point on previous occasions.

A great deal has been done, but much more remains to be done.</P>

Perhaps such children have received better opportunities than they may have been given in institutional care.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise the great homes that have been made by couples who have adopted children. I know of families who have adopted children and made real homes for them in a family setting. The Government is to be complimented on the many improvements that have taken place. The provision in the Bill of an extra two weeks&rsquo; adoptive leave is welcome because it is important. Similarly, great credit is due to those who have provided that adoptive parents will be entitled to time off from work without loss of pay. We tend to forget or fail to recognise the major developments that have been pursued by the Minister and the Department in this Bill. We look forward to the enactment of such provisions. The Bill has received a broad and general welcome in the contributions that have been made so far. While some speakers may differ in their approaches to certain aspects of the Bill, great credit is due to the many people who have spoken today. I hope the Bill can be passed and enacted at the earliest opportunity.</P>

   <Title>Adoptive Leave Bill 2004: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate on the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides supports to working parents through the equal opportunities child care programme. There have been significant developments in the provision of child care in recent years. Child care was identified as a priority area for investment in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunities child care programme, which will run between 2000 and 2006, was launched by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in April 2000. The programme aims to increase the number of child care facilities and places, to enhance the quality of child care services and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of these services. The funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during the programme&rsquo;s seven-year period is &euro;437 million. Following the mid-term evaluation of the national development plan, I understand that details for additional funding, which will increase the funding available to approximately &euro;449 million, are being finalised with the two regional assemblies.</P>
    <P>The programme seeks to address the child care needs of parents who are working or engaged in training and education activities. It provides capital grant assistance to community and not-for-profit organisations and private child care providers to increase the supply of child care places or enhance the quality of existing places. I do not propose to detain Senators by giving further details of the money that has been spent under the programme. I gathered from Senator White&rsquo;s contribution that it is proposed to have a specific debate on this matter in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that while a great deal of money has been invested, a substantial requirement remains. The Government&rsquo;s policy approach to meet this requirement has been to adopt supply side measures. In other words, the Government is trying to tackle this problem by <Col N="1254"/>increasing the quantity and quality of the supply of child care places. The State will face a major decision in 2006 when it will have to decide how to move forward. The present allocation of funding is co-funded by the European Union, but it is clear that the question of the sustainability of such funding will arise in 2006. It may not be sustainable for us to make a case for it at that time. Ireland&rsquo;s national contribution will also be an issue at then. The equal opportunities child care programme will run until 2006, but it is clear that we have to plan for what we will do after that date. A substantial amount of money has been allocated.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform staff who operate in this area have done outstanding work. They work with the 33 city and county child care committees, which are not established on a statutory basis. The committees bring together the relevant stakeholders in the city or county to work with the Department to improve the quality and quantity of child care provision in each area.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a further advance in employment rights for working parents, particularly for women. It has come before the house at an important time for social affairs, during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU. The Bill highlights Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to achieving greater protection for employees, particularly female employees, and an improved work-life balance for all. We owe our economic success in no small part to our highly trained and educated workforce, in which women play a significant role. The Bill&rsquo;s improvements to adoptive leave legislation are part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help employees to achieve a better work-life balance. Greater retention of women in the workplace is being encouraged by helping to reconcile the often competing demands of work and family commitments.</P>
    <P>Ireland has some work to do if it is to achieve the best practice and high standards set in some Scandinavian countries in respect of maternity and child care provisions. We are setting an example to the ten new member states, however. We can showcase, by means of our Presidency of the EU, our social developments and achievements. The Government will strive to push further its legislative agenda. It will continue to work with the social partners and the EU to bring about further improvements to enhance the working lives of our citizens.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry argued that evidence of attendance at preparatory classes should not be required of employees. There is a similar requirement in the maternity legislation for expectant women who attend antenatal care appointments. The Maternity Bill has a similar requirement concerning antenatal classes so there is no differentiation between the adoption and maternity legislation in this respect. It is normal practice for an employer to seek evidence of <Col N="1255"/>appointments for medical or dental purposes, for example, when employees take time off for these reasons. It is not accepted that it is in any way wrong to acquire evidence of these preparatory classes.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators very much for their contributions to the debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a number of other questions and, while I welcome the Minister of State who has provided us with additional information, perhaps I could remind him of my questions. I have a particular concern about the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should be brief.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I just want to get my questions answered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on Second Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The first question is about the 16 weeks&rsquo; adoptive leave compared to the 18 weeks for maternity leave. Adoptive parents should be entitled to preparation time prior to receiving the child.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator mean that they should have the extra two weeks, too?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, because they are not getting those two weeks currently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>For familiarisation, yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>My other question was about parents who have to go abroad to adopt their child and are obliged to spend a number of weeks in that country. There is no recognition of that time. As the Minister of State has given us further information today, I would like to bring to his attention the fact that a number of child care providers have expressed concern to me about the increase in the rates for their business. This is imposing an enormous cost on them, which they will pass on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator mean the business rates they have to pay?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the rates imposed by the local authority. This cost will, of course, be added on to the cost of child care for parents. The Minister of State should examine that to see if there is any <Col N="1256"/>way we can address the rates problem, in conjunction with the local authorities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am labouring under the difficulty that I did not hear the Senator&rsquo;s original contribution. I have taken such advice as I can concerning her initial contribution but I am afraid that some of the matters may have to be revisited on Committee Stage. As regards paid leave pre-placement, however, the 1995 Act, as amended, currently provides for 14 weeks&rsquo; adoptive leave, attracting a payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and an optional unpaid eight weeks&rsquo; additional adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>In the context of consultations with former members of the maternity working group on the amendment of the 1995 Act, consideration was given to a proposal to provide for paid adoptive leave prior to the date of placement. However, the proposal was rejected, as providing paid leave prior to the day of placement, even if it were confined to adopting mothers or sole male adopters, could weaken the legal basis of the adoptive leave legislation. A European Court of Justice decision in 1983 on proceedings between the European Commission and Italy, determined that confining adoptive leave to women and not to men, in the period following placement of the child, did not contravene the equal treatment directive. The view of the court was that confining adoptive leave to women in the period following the day of placement was justified by the legitimate concern to assimilate as far as possible the conditions of entry of the child into the adopting family to those of the arrival of a new-born child in the family.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the maternity and adoptive leave provisions treat natural and adopting fathers and mothers equitably, there are therefore no plans to provide for that paid leave pre-placement of adoption.</P>
    <P>I will have to revisit the issue of the detailed periods on Committee Stage.</P>
