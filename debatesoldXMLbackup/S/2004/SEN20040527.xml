	<P>I have received notice from Senator Paddy Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline in detail the way in which water and sewerage charges will be levied on all schools, national, secondary and third level; and if his Department will make grants available for them to recoup the costs.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Child Trafficking and Pornography (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; all Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 12.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes; No. 2, Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; all Stages, to be taken at 1 p.m. and to conclude not later than 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed six minutes; and No. 3 Health (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee Stage to be taken at 2 p.m. and to conclude not later than 3 p.m.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Order Paper will be circulated later today in respect of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) (Amendment) Bill 2004, which is being taken in the D&aacute;il this morning and will be taken in the Seanad this afternoon. All Stages of the Bill will be taken at 3 p.m. and will conclude not later than 4.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed eight <Col N="1390"/>minutes. There will be a sos from 12.30 p.m. to 1 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure all Members will agree with me that accepting today&rsquo;s Order of Business and specifically allowing all Stages of both Bills to be taken is an unprecedented move. While we understand why we must debate these matters in their totality today, will the Leader give a commitment that there will be no new legislation to address possible issues that might arise from Article 35 of the Constitution in connection with this matter? We have had a series of good meetings with the group leaders, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General in the past week. While supplementary legislation is being introduced, is any other legislation planned by the Government in connection with this matter? While we agree to take these two matters in their entirety today, we will not agree to this in perpetuity, although we accept the fluidity and unprecedented nature of the current situation.</P>
    <P>I fundamentally disagree with the decision taken by the CAO not to release the details of schools attended by those taking up college places next year, which is a retrograde step. However crude it is to simply list the number of pupils from particular schools who end up in third level institutions, it is virtually the only information parents have at present. It is a backward step and is cowardly. The CAO is using certain legislation as a sop to other people. It is an example of the educational establishment circling the wagons. We must have a debate on this issue. We need some form of assessment whereby parents can establish exactly how their child&rsquo;s school is performing by comparison with other schools. We must not be afraid of this issue as there are too many vested interests which must be tackled. Too often, parents are excluded from the entire education process. They are spoken down to. We must debate this matter in the House. There are a range of views on the issue and I would like an opportunity to express mine, which I suspect is a minority view in the House. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House at the earliest possible opportunity to allow us to have that debate. We must ensure greater transparency and flow of information to parents to allow them to assess the performance of their child&rsquo;s school and of their child therein.</P>
    <P>When will legislation come forward from the Minister for Finance who promised at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis to cap the money paid to barristers and solicitors working at tribunals? Yesterday, the Government adopted a Fine Gael initiative on foot of which those who wish to work within the tribunal system will have to tender before they are accepted by the Government. We welcome the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of our proposal on another Bill. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said at the <Col N="1391"/>Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis that he would stop this. When will that happen?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Minister for Finance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>When will legislation come before the House? The Members opposite are obviously getting very worried.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Minister for Finance. While I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would love to address the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, fortunately he was not invited.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Just as the teachers had forgotten that Fine Gael did not want to pay them their benchmarking, the party seems to be again determined to stop members of the profession from voting for them. I look forward to a debate on the issue from a different point of view.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service was prevented yesterday from having a discussion on decentralisation. I do not understand why. We should have the debate in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We had it a few weeks ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Apparently, the Government parties do not want to discuss how decentralisation will happen, which is wrong. People know my views on the matter. I have supported the Government&rsquo;s position. While I have spoken in favour of decentralisation, I certainly want it discussed to a greater extent. I want to hear different views, deal with the issues, address problems and establish a timescale.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being dealt with by the central review committee.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that this debate take place. I do not know what people fear.</P>
    <P>No one can legitimately object to the Order of Business today in the sense that the Leader has had to make changes to it for wholly acceptable reasons. However, I must remind the House that there are two urgent Bills before us today which we did not know about last week. They have been brought to our attention in the last 48 hours. While I do not contend that they should not have been brought forward, my fear continues to be that there is no plan here. Every day, a new issue or problem arises and we are doing exactly what we said we would not do to address them. Specific legislative changes are being made piecemeal. While I have no objection to dealing with this legislation as I realise it must be done, I am worried about our approach.</P>
    <P>There are two Bills before us but we still do not know what kind of committee will be established next week or if it will have <Col N="1392"/>investigative or other functions. Everybody has bent over backwards to accommodate discussions. The Leader arranged a meeting with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General last week and I could not ask her to do any more than that. While we had a full discussion with those people and received substantial reassurances from them &mdash; I acknowledge that they mean well &mdash; we should take a deep breath and wait until the whole plan is put together in front of us rather than move forward step-by-step to address issues and make changes piecemeal. We might as well build a tunnel to the Four Courts as we will be up and down all the time. I support fully the views of Members on all sides of the House that this matter must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister for Transport come to the House to outline the domestic problems within Fianna F&aacute;il on the break up of the airports? It is a domestic row. People are scratching each other in public, hitting each other with handbags and calling each other names.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is sexist.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know what is happening. Is there a Cabinet position on the break up of the airports?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is postponed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope people on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches will support me in this. Let us hear what is happening. Clearly, there is no plan. The business plan has been scrapped. When finally we got to see it, it was shot down by every business person who saw it. Who is driving this process and what is the position of Cabinet members, particularly the Minister for Finance?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on that very important issue. Government-appointed consultants have made three important points on the break up of the airports, which has become known colloquially as the &ldquo;Brennan plan&rdquo;. First, no business case has been made for the Brennan plan. Second, higher charges will result in three of the airports involved. Third, no additional terminal capacity for Dublin Airport is envisaged, Shannon Airport will be non-viable and Cork Airport will be a loss maker. I repeat that the consultants producing this report were Government appointed. I appeal to the Leader to provide the House with a statement of clarity on official Cabinet policy in this area. The trade unions have seen a PricewaterhouseCoopers report which states the report on the Brennan plan casts doubt on the financial viability of the breaking up of the airports. This has very serious implications, not least for the local economies around Shannon and Cork. It is a serious issue and it is quite clear that there is no unanimity on the issue at Cabinet level. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, was unable to secure <Col N="1393"/>the support of his colleagues at last Tuesday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan has been very active on the State payments scheme and recently introduced a fine Private Members&rsquo; Bill. It is now clear that a practice in terms of interest and engineering charges, which is largely confined to Cork, Mayo, Sligo and Limerick is costing house buyers up to &euro;7,000 due to the operation of the scheme. It is not good enough. It is not very healthy if people must pay 90% of the cost of houses before they can take possession. This militates against many young couples. What are the intentions of the Leader in this regard? I do not mean to steal the thunder of any other Member on this issue, but I would be very interested to know when legislative work will get under way.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I want Senator Leyden to withdraw his comment or to be asked to leave the House. He has made an unwarranted allegation against a person who is not a member of the House and it should be withdrawn immediately.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true. I ask you to withdraw the remark Senator Ledyen.</P>

	<P>Yes, next week, or before that if possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Leyden&rsquo;s point about the price of a pint. The increase implemented by Diageo is six cent, although it is expected that the actual increase will be 15 cent through a combination of factors. What should not be ignored, however, is the excessive duty imposed by the Government. For the working person, this is too much. There is one important factor we should all bear in mind, of which the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism is very conscious. We are pricing ourselves out of the market in the area of tourism. Anyone who goes to a euro zone country can see the difference in prices. The pint is an important component of the Irish pub experience. We should not lose sight of that fact.</P>
    <P>I do not want to elaborate on what has been said about Aer Rianta, but the Cabinet has put off the decision until after the elections because its members understand there may be a reaction against it. Recent developments are creating much uncertainty. In the Shannon area, a committee that was formed last October was stillborn &mdash; it has not met or become involved in any activity. In parallel with the activities of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, the T&aacute;naiste stated that she wants the Shannon free airport zone to be transferred to the new company, thus removing a revenue base of &euro;6 million from Shannon Free Airport Development Company. There is tremendous resistance to these developments among all the American companies within the area and much uncertainty about the future role of SFADCo in the region. We need to discuss this with the Minister. Rather than having statements, the Minister should come to the House to answer questions. We must put the pieces of the jigsaw together in the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EddieBohan"><NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know from where the figure of a 15 cent increase in the price of a pint came. The newspapers, as usual, had it on the front pages. Diageo is to add 6 cent plus VAT per pint. The Licensed Vintners&rsquo; Association and the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland have fought hard with Guinness over the past number of months to try to avoid this increase, but the <Col N="1396"/>company is not listening. These decisions are made in London now and what we do here does not appear to have any influence. I do not think there will be a 15 cent increase. I can almost assure the House this will not happen, although there will be an increase.</P>
    <P>The price of drink is very high. Publicans are suffering severely at present due to the double blow of the smoking ban&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator not vote for the ban?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EddieBohan"><NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and price increases. The high prices are due to the extremely high taxes here. I hope the Minister will consider harmonising our tax and excise duties with the rest of Europe. I do not know where the figure of 15 cent came from, but I know it will not be implemented.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House for a debate on voting registration. The obligation to go to a Garda station to register is a deterrent among certain people. In Carlow, only one fifth of the forms given out have been returned. In some rural areas it is next to impossible to find a garda in a Garda station. There will be a presidential election in November and I hope that changes will be made to encourage as many people as possible to vote. People who will be away on holidays should have the option of a postal vote.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may make all those points during the debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes, my understanding is that the CAO refused information to the newspapers because of a concern that it would be in breach of the Data Protection Act. Such information has been used in the past for the type of crude league tables we are trying to guard against. I am surprised that Senator Brian Hayes appears to be enthusiastically supporting the release of such information.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the fact that this dispute does not involve the Minister for Education and Science, we would all welcome him to the House as soon as possible to outline his proposals for the release of more holistic information to parents and students.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest increase in the price of oil brings the cost to more than &euro;1 per litre. This has the capacity to bankrupt individuals and small and medium-sized businesses. People from the midlands travel up to 160 miles per day to and from their place of work. For a medium-sized car, this costs around &euro;16,000 per year. It is like having a second mortgage and puts a major dent in people&rsquo;s income. It will bring about bankruptcy and people will be forced to give up their jobs. I call for a debate on the possibility of the Government&rsquo;s removing the 5% tax it imposed on fuel in the last budget. It should do this as a goodwill gesture to the people who commute each day and to small and medium-sized businesses.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I also draw the attention of the House to the fact that there has hardly been a wet day since the smoking ban was introduced. Perhaps the sun is shining either on the smokers or on the Minister&rsquo;s decision.</P>

	<P>I endorse the comments of Senators McCarthy, O&rsquo;Toole and Finucane about Aer Rianta. We may not all approach the subject from the same angle, but the fact is that this is a semi-State body that has gone walkabout. It is impossible to tell from the reports in the newspapers and the press conference given yesterday who is in charge. The outgoing board is under threat and is a lame duck. The Minister for Transport is apparently introducing a plan which does not have the support of the Taoiseach. A letter from the leader of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the Cabinet immediately caused a delay. The plan itself appears to be of dubious business value, but we cannot judge because we have not seen it. Dublin Airport is in chaos and is not being properly run. If nobody else intends to, it is high time this <Col N="1398"/>House brought in the Minister and put him through a question and answer session rather than having a debate or statements.</P>

I put a motion on the Order Paper today in this regard. It is regrettable that the National Lottery is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. As a result, it is very difficult to get any information about what is happening. There is a particular instance which the House should examine. While it is difficult to confirm this, apparently it has stopped sellers selling lottery tickets illegally overseas and accepting them for the lottery. This practice went on for approximately 15 years. I tried to investigate the matter but I came up against a brick wall. One cannot get information unless one speaks to the executives involved. Things have gone on behind the scenes which are not clear and which need to be investigated. It is time the matter was either subject to the Freedom of Information Act or there was more transparency from the National Lottery.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Browne&rsquo;s remarks on the electoral register. The current situation regarding the compilation of the register is totally inefficient. The people concerned are doing their best but it is not working in the urban areas in particular. Auctioneers and estate agents could be of great assistance in notifying local authorities of changes in regard to properties they let. The manner in which the register is currently compiled is nothing short of a calculated disaster. Something must be done about it and I ask for a debate in this House on the matter as soon as possible. I am pleased I am not going for election on this occasion and I pity those who are.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to resign?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the break-up of Aer Rianta, will the Leader inform the House whether there is a revised plan? I accept what has been said by other Senators. There is much confusion but we do not know whether it is because of an impending date early in June, further genuine consultation with unions or because a chairman of a company has branded the aviation regulator a disaster. No one knows what the confusion is about. Furthermore, the Leader will be aware that the board of her favourite hotel group, namely, the Great Southern Hotels Group, is totally in the dark. As there is great concern in this area, there should be some interim statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>On the two urgent Bills which are coming before the House, I accept the committee which <Col N="1399"/>will be set up cannot be a committee of investigation and cannot, therefore, make findings of fact. If there is to be a subsequent hearing in this House, how will it obtain primary evidence?</P>
    <P>The Peelo report, to which Senator McCarthy referred, indicates the seriousness of these State payments. The Leader has kindly offered Government time to debate the issue. Perhaps she will be able to arrange for this soon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the electoral registration process. Calls for such a debate are ironic given that the closing date was last Monday. There has been confusion about the different closing dates for different categories of voters. I checked with Galway County Council on Monday, the closing date, when 1,200 people arrived with their registration forms. There should be a better way of dealing with the voter registration issue. I favoured in the past, and still favour, the idea of a census similar to the census of population. There should be a more practical way of ensuring people&rsquo;s names are on the register so that they will not be disappointed on election day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision of the Northern Ireland courts yesterday that the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA are not illegal organisations is a reminder of the dangers of rushing through legislation. I do not how this happened in the North. I would like the Leader to ask the Minister to put our minds at rest that legislation passed through this House ensures these organisations are illegal. That we are making an exception today is understandable, but it is a reminder to us to be very careful. When the Data Protection Act passed through this House, we were unaware that we were depriving citizens, including parents and students, of information we thought would have been available to them. We were unaware we were doing something that rendered the information unavailable.</P>
    <P>I have been reminded by Senator O&rsquo;Toole that it was the 1966 budget that increased the price of a pint to 2s. 6d., currently 15 cent. To put Senator Leyden&rsquo;s mind at rest, people then said they were putting themselves out of business because there was no way people could afford a pint following the increase.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Browne and my other colleagues who called for a debate and, I hope, some progress on the electoral registration process. I have raised on a number of occasions my disappointment that at national level the Oireachtas and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have made no effort to promote local elections and encourage people to vote. It is more than five years since we were given a solemn commitment by the then Minister in the aftermath of the low turnout in 1999 that steps would be taken to <Col N="1400"/>encourage a higher turnout. We are now sleep walking towards a situation where perhaps less than 50% of people will vote in a national election, which is bad for democracy. It may be too late to address the problem for 11 June but we need to have a serious debate on how to encourage people to vote and use whatever means possible to increase turnout during election time.</P>
    <P>On a lighter note, colleagues are quite distressed about the possible increase in the price of drink. A Chathaoirleach, I wonder should you call for a price freeze in the D&aacute;il bar?</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleagues on the drawing up of the electoral register about which there have been serious difficulties. In deference to Senator Glynn&rsquo;s proposal, the auctioneering industry is the last industry I would look to to put people on the register.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Roscommon town?</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>

	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to what Senator Quinn said, the 15 cent price increase is very serious and will cause serious damage to the tourism industry. Hotels and gift shops are experiencing serious problems and the signs are very bad for the industry during the summer. I would like the Minister to come to this House and outline what he intends to do to rescue this serious situation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes asked if I would give a commitment that there will be no new legislation on the matter we are discussing today. I cannot give such a commitment but I am aware that matters are being examined in a painstaking fashion. The Senator disagreed with the CAO&rsquo;s decision and said there are many vested interests which do not allow parents to get information on school results. This is a serious issue. If a complete school assessment was involved, it would be fine, because it would include character training, sport, cultural activities and so on. Merely examining the barren details of who got what place is not the correct way to look at education. However, there should be a debate on the matter. The Senator also wondered when the Minister for Finance was going to cap barristers&rsquo; fees, and said the Fine Gael submission on the matter had been accepted. It seems like a good move.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole agreed there should be whole school results rather than the current way in which they are published. He also asked for a discussion on decentralisation, which would be <Col N="1401"/>worthwhile as we could find out the stage we are at in the process.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will try to get the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to come to the House to speak on the issue. Senator O&rsquo;Toole also spoke about the break-up of the State airports. There is a need for clarity on the matter but the Government is right to await the details of the business plan. He also spoke about today&rsquo;s debates. There is a constitutional imperative on every Member of this House to deal with the matters before us. Last night I stated that this House had a good record of not rushing legislation. However, this is a completely different matter. We have to deal with the matter competently and briskly. Senator O&rsquo;Toole claims we make it up as we go along but there is no template which the House can use to deal with the issue. The Government is taking very clear steps to cover everything. It would be impossible for a Government to say how it will deal with A, B, C etc. and that is how to proceed. By taking these steps, we are closing loopholes which could emerge.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is that we might be missing some steps.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There are very good minds at work and we have to put our minds to work. I accept that everyone&rsquo;s view is important but the meetings we have had and the information we have been given is concrete and definite and the pointers are being laid out. We have a day of onerous work ahead of us and we must carry it out.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy spoke about the Brennan plan and Government policy for the airports. I think it will emerge when the unions have been consulted and when the business plan has been fully accepted. He also mentioned Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s Bill on staged housing. I think it is a good Bill, I am partial to it, and I hope we might introduce it before the House goes into recess in July.</P>

	<P>There are many burdens on young people and it is difficult for them to get enough money to put down a deposit for a house. Staged payments are very common in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden spoke about the Diageo proposal to raise the price of a pint. I would like to think people would stay away from the pubs but I do not think they will. Senator Bohan claimed that people would stop going to pubs but I do not think he is right. He also asked for the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House. Senator Finucane agreed with Senator Leyden and spoke about the uncertainty in Shannon, particularly regarding Shannon Development. The possibility that its activities will be given over to the new airport <Col N="1402"/>board has been mooted and the T&aacute;naiste will address that. Senator Bohan believed that a suggested increase of 15 cents in the price of a pint was not correct. I hope he is correct, and we will ask him to give us a progress report on it. He also claimed publicans were reeling from the smoking ban. The owner of my local pub in Athlone says that is not so.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne mentioned the issue of voter registration and the postal vote. There are four counties in England that are using the postal vote in the local and European elections. The issue has been on the BBC. I believe that going to the polling station and casting a vote is an act of citizenship.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke about the CAO and the Data Protection Act. It made its decision based on the idea of holistic education. Senator Bannon raised the issue of the price of oil and wants the Minister to intervene. Senator Hanafin sought a debate on roads. A very fine report was published two weeks ago by the NRA on the roads system and perhaps we can have a debate on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross called for a debate on Aer Rianta and claimed that people would have different points of view. He felt the business plan published was dubious. We should have a debate on it before the summer recess. Senator Ross also claimed that the National Lottery should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. It was definitely on the schedule of bodies not to be considered under that legislation, but perhaps the time has come to change that. It is dispersing huge amounts of finance so we should know more about it. It is a fine business, but why should we not know more about it?</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn spoke about the polling register and the need to take definite steps to deal with lacuna in it. Senator Coghlan raised the Great Southern Hotel Group. It is not that it is my favourite hotel group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Senator Kitt spoke about the voting register and the need to rely on a census to fill the register. Senator Quinn referred to a decision of a judge in Northern Ireland in which he deemed the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA not to be subversive bodies. That decision has been appealed. He also pointed out to Senator Leyden that the price of pint in 1966 was 2s. 6d. What was each person earning at that time?</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford claimed that no steps were being taken to promote democracy, while Senator Feighan spoke about voter registration. He pointed out that a particular Roscommon Senator has learned Portuguese. All I can say is <i>hasta la vista.</i></P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 has proved to be one of the most effective measures against the sexual exploitation of children in Europe in recent years. It has been widely studied by members of parliaments in other countries as a model law in child protection.</P>
    <P>In the current climate we have a particular sensitivity to issues surrounding child pornography. For that reason, the intricacies of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act have come under closer scrutiny than ever before. One of the concerns that exists about the Act is that it might have the effect of constraining, or even rendering criminal, legitimate investigations by committees of the Oireachtas into matters relating to child pornography. It might also have the effect of restricting the level of co-operation between the Houses of the Oireachtas, or committees thereof, and persons from whom co-operation is desired.</P>
    <P>In this regard, concern arises in the first instance because possession of child pornography is one of the criminal offences established by the Act. This would mean that, on the face of it, <Col N="1404"/>anyone who comes into possession of child pornography for the purposes of legitimate inquiry or investigation would themselves be guilty of that same offence. The Oireachtas, in its wisdom, anticipated this problem and avoided it in most circumstances by providing, in section 6(2) of the 1998 Act, that the Act does not apply to persons who possess child pornography in the exercise of functions under the Censorship of Films Acts, the Censorship of Publications Acts and the Video Recordings Acts or for the purpose of the prevention, investigation or prosecution of offences under the Act. This means, for example, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in the course of an investigation of child pornography offences, can take possession of child pornography without fear of themselves being guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>As the law now stands, no exemption of this nature extends to Members of the Oireachtas who may come into possession of child pornography as a consequence of carrying out their proper functions. This creates the anomalous position that, should a House of the Oireachtas, or any committee of a House, desire to gather evidence in regard to any matter relating to child pornography, any Member who came into possession of such pornography might technically be committing a criminal offence. Any civil servant or legal adviser assisting in such an investigation would be under a similar constraint if he or she came into possession of the child pornography in the course of their legitimate functions.</P>
    <P>Similar concerns would arise regarding the offences of publication or printing of child pornography, which might theoretically expose to prosecution a person who only published or printed the material in question in the course of legitimately carrying out a function of the Oireachtas. There is a concern that there would be an interaction with parliamentary privilege. Clearly, these would not be tolerable positions in which to put any Deputy, Senator or official.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty arises from section 5 of the 1998 Act in that the Act makes it an offence to distribute child pornography. In section 5(2), &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; is defined as including the parting of possession with child pornography. This would lead to a position where a person who is or might be in possession of child pornography might refuse to hand over to the Oireachtas either the child pornography itself or computers on which the child pornography is or may be stored.</P>
    <P>Such a person might possess the material innocently &mdash; if, for example, he or she owned a computer onto which some third party had downloaded child pornography. Such a person might not even be certain that the material in question is child pornography within the legal meaning of that expression but no matter whether a person possessed the pornography innocently or otherwise, that person might well refuse to co-operate with an investigation or inquiry by the Oireachtas because in doing so he <Col N="1405"/>or she might run the risk of committing a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The solution proposed by the Government for this particular problem is to insert a new section 13 into the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. This new section 13 will ensure that nothing in the Act shall prevent either the making or compliance with a direction under section 3 of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997 or the possession, distribution, printing or publication by either House of the Oireachtas, a committee within the meaning of that Act or any person, of child pornography for the purposes of, or in connection with, the performance of any function conferred by the Constitution or by law on those Houses or conferred by a resolution of either of those Houses or resolutions of both of them on such a committee.</P>
    <P>This Act will permit the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, together with any appropriate officials and advisers, to carry out their appropriate functions in circumstances where issues relating to child pornography might be involved. It will clear the way for third parties to hand over relevant evidence without fear of prosecution merely for giving the material over and it will prevent such third parties from relying on the provisions of the 1998 Act in order to refuse to co-operate with the Houses of the Oireachtas or any committee thereof.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been initiated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I understand, as announced on the Order of Business this morning, that another measure in connection with the compellability of witnesses legislation is now before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and will be before Seanad &Eacute;ireann this afternoon. The measure is a straightforward one and I have nothing to add.</P>
	</Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome to the House to present a Bill which is simple, yet extremely important in that it provides protection for Members of these Houses in the carrying out of their duties and any future work in that area.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the Bill is being presented to us in the expectation that the evidence will be admissible but lawyers are still arguing in a particular case whether evidence will be admissible. Even this legislation will not be applicable in that case. The rush to deal with these two important legislative measures is unprecedented in that the two Houses will deal with all Stages of two Bills &mdash; 20 Stages &mdash; in one day. I am not sure that has ever happened previously.</P>
    <P>I understand from people who have attended the briefings with the Attorney General that he said categorically that there would be no legislation in this regard. Why are we being presented with these two items of legislation today? Perhaps the Minister would enlighten me. What was the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice and if it is the case that he said there would be no <Col N="1406"/>legislation brought forward, whose decision was it to bring forward this legislation today? It is important that we know.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with uncharted waters in terms of this legislation and it is important that we get it right and not make it up as we go along. That is the reason I am concerned about the rush. We need time to ensure this legislation is dealt with properly and that we will not find an individual going to the High Court before we have an opportunity to do anything. We must ensure that the Members of this House are protected. If such an event should arise I agree with it but I ask the Minister to address the questions I put to him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for the debate on the Bill, which is short but important in that it will ensure that the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 does not become an impediment to any activities the Houses of the Oireachtas or any committees of the Oireachtas might undertake.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments that the 1998 Bill is a model which other parliaments have examined to determine if their legislation in this area needs to be amended in the same way. It would be fair to say that in recent years there has been an increasing awareness of the need to protect children from child trafficking and other offences. That is to be welcomed. There is a need for such protection throughout the world because in certain countries children suffer from abuse. The need for international co-operation in this area is very much in evidence and I am aware that serious efforts are being made by the European Union and the United Nations to tackle that problem.</P>
    <P>This problem is exacerbated by the increasing ease with which communication can be made between people and with images. That is one of the disadvantages of the electronic revolution over past decades and it challenges states to ensure all legislation is updated to effectively tackle any issues in that regard. Senator Terry referred to the rush to pass the legislation. Given its nature, I welcome the co-operation of the leader of the Opposition in allowing the House to process the legislation so that the Oireachtas can function effectively. It is the duty of the Oireachtas, under the Constitution, to regulate all of society.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has pointed out a couple of areas, under the 1998 Act, where the Oireachtas could be inhibited from proceeding with investigations in this area. The 1998 Act included certain exemptions. The film censor, for example, is not affected by the overall intent and impact of the Act. Exemptions are made for investigations into activities in this area. This facilitates the Garda. The Bill before us addresses a situation, should it arise, where the Oireachtas itself would be exempt from prosecution. The possession or distribution of pornography is an offence. This provision could inhibit the Oireachtas, including an Oireachtas committee, <Col N="1407"/>from functioning effectively on a question of this nature. If a committee of the Oireachtas were to proceed in the hope of an exemption, which was subsequently not given, the deliberations of the committee might be rendered invalid. It is sensible to ensure that any deliberation of the Oireachtas in this regard at any future stage is legal.</P>
    <P>The Members of the Oireachas enjoy privilege, which is as it should be. This privilege must be exercised with caution and respect. Privilege brings responsibilities. If we have general privilege it follows that we should not be inhibited in our activities or investigations. In all fields, and not only in this one, the Oireachtas should have freedom to act responsibly in investigating any matters of public concern which might arise and which need to be investigated. It should not be made ineffective by inhibiting legislation in that field. While the Bill before us deals with a specific area, it may be necessary to make a general exemption for the Oireachtas to carry out investigations and to take possession of materials which would assist it in coming to conclusions, as it is mandated to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party does not have a difficulty with this legislation. If it is necessary to put the legislation in place that should be done. I hope the provision has been thought through and is secure. A drip-feed of legislative measures dealing with issues as they arose would not be desirable. We should consider all possible future situations and put all necessary legislation, regulations and guidelines in place. Are the Minister or his officials engaged in drafting guidelines for Members? Will regulations accompany the legislation? The legislation is required; one cannot argue against it.</P>
    <P>The need for legislation to control pornography has been discussed in the House. The Department has done work in this area but our society needs to consider this issue. While child pornography is generally abhorred, pornography itself is being mainstreamed and there are connections between the two areas. Within the pornography industry there are often links between people who are involved in either area. Exploitation is also a serious issue in the pornography industry.</P>
    <P>Pornography has become acceptable. However, we must be aware that an image which may be fully legal may involve exploitation. As a society, we should do what we can to limit pornography in general. Of course, we must do absolutely all we can to prevent child pornography being made available.</P>
    <P>Pornography has become prevalent and is being mainstreamed. Programmes on terrestrial television stations have portrayed the idea that the women involved in pornography are powerful and are making large amounts of money. However, that is not the reality. We must educate young people in schools to think about any image <Col N="1408"/>they see and to consider what is behind it, if someone is being exploited by it, who is making money from it and other such issues.</P>
    <P>I have called for such a debate on the Order of Business. When it is held, I hope the Minister will come to the House to update us on his work on this and related issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>With other colleagues, I have attended recent meetings on these matters with the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We appreciate the way in which all the officeholders in question have answered the questions posed by Members. The Executive, parties and groupings do not have specific functions in this matter. We have functions as individual Members of the Oireachtas. In the two meetings we have had, Members have been kept up to speed with developments in this fluid situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made an important distinction. We are all constitutional experts in our own right and anyone is entitled to read the Constitution and to form a view on it. As a self-styled constitutional expert, I believe Article 15.10 states clearly that Members of the Oireachtas have the power to proceed without this legislation. The Houses or a committee established by them have freedom of debate and rights of privilege. Article 15.10 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Each House shall make its own rules and standing orders, [there is a clear commitment there] with powers to attach penalties for their infringement, and shall have power to ensure freedom of debate, to protect its official documents and the private papers of its members, and to protect itself and its members against any person or persons interfering with, molesting or attempting to corrupt its members in the exercise of their duties.</P>
    <P FLI="0">If we are asked to do a specific duty, it is clear that we would be entitled to see documents, papers and images which, in another arena, might be criminal. The issue for Members of the Oireachtas is clear.</P>
    <P>The distinction, which the Minister rightly raised, relates to advisers and others who are not Members of the Oireachtas and who may have to help Members of the Oireachtas in respect of any future committee work. That, especially, is where this legislation is needed. It is not needed in the context of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Government is proceeding in a way which ensures that all eventualities are considered. It is being fair to all concerned to ensure that the proper procedures are in place. I accept that. We do not want a situation to arise where basic fairness is not applied. In changing the law, we are ensuring that will not happen.</P>
    <P>The Government is being extra careful about the situation in which the House now finds<?oasys [jy?>itself. Article 35.4, the subject of debate up and down the country in recent weeks, sets out our duties in this matter. We will have to exercise <Col N="1409"/>those duties should such a matter come before both Houses of the Oireachtas. We should not be pussyfooting around the situation by not recognising that the Constitution is clear that should a matter come before the Houses of the Oireachtas concerning suitability or otherwise of members of the Judiciary, we must make a decision in that regard. We should not be so constrained by possible legal impediments that we do not do our job.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary, in particular in relation to advisers to a potential committee. I accept the Government is being extra careful in what it is doing in this area. I again suggest Members read Article 15.10 which provides us with clear powers. I accept that with those powers comes obligations of fairness. However, Article 15.10 of the Constitution makes it clear that Members of the Oireachtas and the House have a freedom &mdash; other freedoms and rights are also given to Members that are not available to general society &mdash; that must be recognised.</P>

	<P>It is interesting to note that the power conferred on the House by Article 35 of the Constitution is conferred on each House and in that regard this is one of those areas in the Constitution where the Seanad has equal status with the D&aacute;il in that neither House is superior to the other in any respect.</P>
    <P>The Constitution regulates the position regarding judges of the High Court and Supreme Court. A statutory provision relates to Circuit Court judges and mirrors the language of the Constitution. Senator Terry, understandably, asked about the unprecedented rush regarding these items of legislation. The reason for the urgency is that further steps are imminent in this matter. It is a matter of public record that there has been correspondence between the Government and a judge of the Circuit Court. It is also a matter of public record that further steps on the matter are imminent. Naturally, the Government is anxious the legal ground be clear-cut and that any matter of concern is put beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry rightly raised the matter of previous advices of the Attorney General. The Attorney General has received a great deal of advice on this matter. Ultimately, however, he must advise the Government on what are the best steps to take. His advice to the Government has been to err on the side of caution and to ensure that all doubts are addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes indicated that there may be some constitutional arguments regarding the privileges and powers of the Houses and that we do not necessarily need all this legislation. That may be the case, but why let doubts remain? We should clarify the matter and put it beyond doubt by way of legislation. The Government and the Attorney General believe we should put this <Col N="1410"/>matter beyond doubt given the imminence of the next step.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh and Senator Tuffy welcomed the Bill and raised the more general issue of child pornography. Senator Tuffy also asked for a debate on child pornography in general. I have no objection to such a debate. I would be delighted to inform the House of the progress we are trying to make in this difficult area. There are many serious concerns about the Internet, the images that can be portrayed on it and their availability to children and the general population and the linkages between that and various social trends. While it would be a worthwhile debate, it is not for me to pre-empt the Seanad in terms of what it wishes to discuss.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. We all realise the gravity of the situation. Not since 1922 &mdash; the current State, as I am fond of pointing out, was founded in 1937 by vote of the people &mdash; has a judge been brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is necessary for us to ensure the legislative scaffolding to deal with this matter is in place.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government amendment makes reference to a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas which may or not have to view material. Does that protection also apply to this House and the other House? While I understand members of the committee would have to view the material and not put forward a view on the matter, but simply present the information to the Houses, I presume such material would not present a difficulty for other Members of the Oireachtas who have not seen it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is similar to that made by Senator Hayes. Section 1(<i>b</i>) states:</P>
    <?oasys [ah?><P LI="1" FLI="0">the possession, distribution, printing, publication or showing by either House of the Oireachtas, a committee (within the meaning of that Act) or any person of child pornography for the purposes of, or in connection with, the performance of any function conferred by the Constitution or by law on those Houses or conferred by a resolution of either of those Houses <Col N="1411"/>or resolutions of both of them on such a committee.</P><?oasys [xh?>
    <P FLI="0">I presume that power is ringfenced to activities which would be devolved to a committee by the Houses of the Oireachtas and consequently to the individuals and does not extend beyond that point. It is important we are not opening up an area which could give impunity to Members of the Oireachtas. Such powers must apply to matters decided by both Houses in advance so no person could subsequently claim it as a defence. I presume that is the case. However, perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address both points. The section applies to the Houses of the Oireachtas as distinct from committees of the House. The section clearly states: &ldquo;the possession, distribution, printing, publication or showing by either House of the Oireachtas, a committee (within the meaning of that Act) or any person...&rdquo;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a comma after House of the Oireachtas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Clearly, the section applies to the D&aacute;il, Seanad and a committee within the meaning of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) (Amendment) legislation.</P>
    <P>On Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point, subsection (<i>b</i>) states &ldquo;for the purposes of, or in connection with, the performance of any function conferred by the Constitution or by law on those Houses or conferred by a resolution of either of those Houses or resolutions of both of them on such a committee.&rdquo; The exemption is connected to the functions conferred by the Constitution or by law on the Houses. Senators should remember that in the case of a Circuit Court judge, as I stated in my reply on Second Stage, this is a function conferred on us by law and not by the Constitution. The law is in the same terms as the Constitution but this is a provision of the courts of justice legislation.</P>
    <P>On the operations of a committee &mdash; Senator Brian Hayes anticipated this point &mdash; we do not know what the committee will do. It will have to decide how it proceeds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect the Minister of State is more expert on this issue than I. Are there any grounds for any individual to object to the passing of legislation on the grounds of natural justice and constitutional probity whereby a specific Act of the Oireachtas is passed to deal specifically with one individual?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that legislation is not directed specifically. There would be situations where a committee of the House might <Col N="1412"/>find it necessary, if specific legislation was being introduced, to access some of these images in order to inform itself for the purpose of tabling amendments that might require to be introduced to legislation generally. This will have a general application, in my view, but I can see where it might be used in specific cases. We should perhaps concentrate on the general application.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is not to deal with any one individual. Clearly the position of one individual has occasioned a very considerable amount of research into how one proceeds in a matter of this type. The legislation is abstract and general in character and applies from its commencement. There is no commencement date for the legislation which will come into force in the ordinary way on signature by the President. There is no suggestion that this legislation relates to any one individual. It is permanent legislation which will provide that the Oireachtas in the proper performance of its functions will not commit this particular criminal offence. It is an exemption.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I bring the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2004 before the House today in order to clarify the position regarding one aspect of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. Intellectual property legislation provides for a complex, multi-layered system of protection for rights holders. As in any other area, the legislator must seek to strike the right balance <Col N="1413"/>between, on the one hand, the rights holders who will be seen as the beneficiaries and, on the other, the users. While I use this distinction, there is no doubt that users also benefit from intellectual property legislation, directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>The rights granted are often of immense value and will vary depending on the nature of the intellectual property concerned. For example, it is possible to renew a registered trade mark indefinitely. This recognises the effort required of the holder to make the trade mark valuable to him. On the other hand, with some exceptions, patents have a validity of 20 years only. The patent system is, in a sense, a contract between the State which, representing society, grants a monopoly to the inventor to profit by his invention in return for his making the product available for general use during the term of patent protection and for making the secret public in order that all may exploit it when the patent expires. In a similar way, the rights granted under copyright and related rights legislation are intended to represent a good balance. For example, the duration of copyright will vary depending on the nature of the protection granted.</P>
    <P>Whether we read books, listen to music or watch television or films, all these activities which improve the quality of life would not be possible without copyright. While the rights holder may properly benefit, it would be foolish to believe that we would have the kind of publishing and entertainment structure we now enjoy if copyright protection was not in place to underpin it. In accordance with the 2000 Act, copyright subsists in, <i>inter alia</i>, original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, sound recordings and films, with certain rights, such as the distribution and reproduction right, given to the holder of the copyright.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to remove any doubt about section 40 of the Act, which provides that the right of making available a work to the public includes, <i>inter alia</i>, performing, showing or playing a copy of the work in public. In the context of the Act, work means, with some exceptions which do not affect the issue before us today, a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast, cable programme, typographical arrangement of a published edition or an original database, and includes a computer programme.</P>
    <P>To what does section 40, in particular the reference to the word &ldquo;showing&rdquo;, relate? I am satisfied that the reference to &ldquo;showing&rdquo; was intended to cover audio-visual works, for example, the showing of a film. It has been suggested, however, that the reference to &ldquo;showing&rdquo; effectively created a public exhibition right. It has been suggested to us that the showing of an original protected artwork in the permanent collection of a gallery could be a restricted act. This would mean, for example, that an artist could prevent the &ldquo;showing&rdquo; of his or her painting by a gallery. Would that be reasonable?</P><Col N="1414"/>
    <P>A case can be made that artists should enjoy a public exhibition right. At one point during the passage of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 through the Oireachtas, consideration was given to the introduction of such a right. This was subsequently dropped, which makes clear that it was not the intention of the Oireachtas to create such a right.</P>
    <P>The fact that a gallery may exhibit a work does not mean it holds the copyright. When selling a painting an artist will, in many instances, retain the copyright to secure benefits from any subsequent commercialisation of the work through posters, photographs and so forth. That the painting in question has been sold does not mean the artist has lost the rights to future revenues.</P>
    <P>One of the grievances of artists, that they do not benefit from a subsequent sale of their painting possibly at a much higher price than they receive, is being addressed. In September 2001, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2001/84/EC on the resale right for the benefit of the author of an original work of art, the so-called <i>droit de suite</i>. The transposition date for this directive is 1 January 2006.</P>
    <P>On balance, I believe maintaining the <i>status quo</i> is justified. The position is perhaps more clear-cut in the case of literary works, where the main benefits will typically accrue from the publication of the work, from which moneys will flow. While section 40 does not create a public exhibition right, the suggestion that it does or might do creates an element of uncertainty. I am not aware that actual difficulties have arisen but I am conscious that this poses problems for those involved.</P>
    <P>If a gallery is approached by a rights holder, should it pay, risk closure or leave the matter to the courts? This is an unsatisfactory position which should be resolved. We had already made clear our intention to make the amendment in an appropriate intellectual property or copyright Bill. Given that many exhibitors may be faced with difficulties in this area, we have decided to make the amendment now, rather than awaiting a suitable intellectual property vehicle.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to give some specific examples of what could be affected. Occasional exhibitions by the National Museum of Ireland could be affected if the museum holds works still in copyright and wished to display such works in the context of a specific exhibition or under a specific theme. Items on display in the National Gallery of Ireland, which are considered important heritage items and form an integral part of the story of the progression of art in Ireland, would also be affected. They include works by Louis le Brocquy, Paul Henry and Jack B. Yeats. In addition, works on display at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, a large percentage of which are by living or recently deceased artists would be affected. The role of IMMA, which incorporates an award winning education and <Col N="1415"/>community department, would be severely hampered by any doubt over the existence of an exhibition right. The National Library of Ireland may be inhibited in its plans to place the works of some of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest writers on display. It has been developing new exhibition spaces specifically to facilitate such displays. This would have a negative effect on its efforts to enhance its role as the repository of the world&rsquo;s largest collection of Irish documentary material.</P>
    <P>There are many other galleries in this country with established national or international reputations, which could be affected by uncertainty on the question of exhibition rights. Two examples are the Crawford Gallery in Cork and the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin where the Francis Bacon exhibition has created great interest.</P>
    <P>It is also possible that the application of the exhibition right to literary and artistic works would travel to Ireland from abroad. Once works where copyright is extant arrive in Ireland, often following lengthy and complex negotiations, the copyright owner could take an action against the public or private institution planning to display the works. The effect of such actions against what are often short-term displays would be catastrophic and could lead such institutions to avoid such exhibitions altogether. These are examples of the situations that could arise, although there may not be problems in individual cases. Where the institution purchases the item directly from the rights holder, there should be no problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide that, for the avoidance of doubt, no infringement of a right created by this Part of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 in regard to an artistic or literary work occurs by reason of the placing on display the work, or a copy thereof, in a place or premises to which members of the public have access. We do not seek to change the current position. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his overview of the need for the legislation. I am pleased to support this short Bill and accept it is an important clarification of copyright law. The urgent need for clarification arises from advice received by the National Library of Ireland, which suggested that one potential effect of section 40(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 is the creation of what is termed an &ldquo;exhibition right&rdquo; and that must be removed. As the Minister of State outlined, this would mean the owner of a literary or artistic work would require the permission of the copyright holder before the item could be placed on public display.</P>
    <P>This would be a perverse development in law covering literary or artistic works. It would represent a restriction on knowledge, a dilution of access to artistic and literary works and a narrowing of the arteries of learning and <Col N="1416"/>knowledge. It would be a retrograde step to restrict the public exhibition of such works of creativity and beauty . The very fact that the question has been raised that such a legal situation may exist calls for immediate clarification. I am, therefore, satisfied the Government is taking reasonable, timely and measured action.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s extensive literary and artistic heritage is a matter of pride to Irish people and a great asset in attracting visitors to Ireland. Cultural tourism is one of the expanding and dependable elements in our modern tourism mix. I like to think that in &ldquo;Beauty&rsquo;s home&rdquo;, Killarney, we invented and perfected the concept of marketing and promoting cultural tourism against a backdrop of immense natural beauty and human charm. Cultural tourism is intrinsically Irish, it is not weather dependent and it spans all age groups and socio-economic brackets. The Minister of State and all Members are welcome to visit Killarney as we celebrate Killarney 250. It is 250 years since the foundations of tourism in Ireland were laid and it happened in &ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s reflex&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If a doubt remained that copyright holders might have an additional right, it would cast another legal and organisational burden on many exhibition venues, many of which are run on a voluntary basis with minimal funding. It would tend to restrict cultural activities and stultify legitimate public exhibition, information and education. I am, therefore, pleased to support this clarifying amendment by the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his senior official to the House. I thank him for introducing the Bill, which removes uncertainty. I look forward to the contribution of Senator Norris. The legislation should be entitled the James Joyce Bill, although it refers to all artists. However, 2004 is the centenary of Bloomsday, which will be celebrated in Ireland and throughout the world. Senator Norris has made a major contribution in terms of bringing the works of James Joyce to a wider audience and a significant industry has evolved.</P>
    <P>I met Stephen Joyce, the grandson of James Joyce, in the Irish Embassy in Paris in 1982 when I launched the Joyce stamp. The stamp was controversial but beautiful and I hope to obtain a copy for my learned colleague some time. Concerns were expressed by Joyce&rsquo;s family regarding alleged exploitation of the great man in the exposition and publication of his works. The National Library is mounting a major exhibition and it would be regrettable, from an economic point of view, if there was litigation in this regard, particularly this year. I am delighted the Minister of State has foreseen the possibility.</P>
    <P>Joyce&rsquo;s work refers to Dublin, Mullingar and Galway. Jack McCarthy III wrote a book and made a film about Joyce. His work on Joyce will also be covered by the legislation. Joyce&rsquo;s writings have been extremely beneficial to the State. I visited Japan when I was a Minister of State. <Col N="1417"/>Japanese people were more knowledgeable about James Joyce than the vast majority of Irish people.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the contribution of Senator Norris as it provides him with an opportunity to recite some works of Joyce.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that be protected by copyright?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be protected by parliamentary privilege and it can be published anywhere the Senator wishes. I wish him every success in his work this year. As a Joycean scholar, I have heard him speaking at many engagements. He brings Joyce alive and makes the occasion special. He has contributed a great deal to getting the message across about Joyce throughout Ireland and the world. He has spoken in New York and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation and it is important that the works of other artists should also be exhibited and protected. The legislation covers all exhibition centres and all work that is exhibited. It is also important that the artist should control copyright. Even though he or she may sell a painting or work, if it is reproduced in future publications, their rights will be protected. The Bill is timely and appropriate. It relates primarily to the James Joyce exhibition but it will benefit many others and protects the State&rsquo;s right. I support it and wish the Minister of State well as it passes through the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I thank Senator Leyden for his flattering comments, which I do not believe I deserve at all. I have always regarded myself as the amateur of Joyce and I certainly have an affection still for the man and his work.</P>
    <P>I remember the stamp Senator Leyden, who was then a Minister of State, launched in Paris in 1982 because our little committee suggested to the post office that it should produce a stamp. The one it produced was a line drawing of Joyce by Brancusi at the behest of an interesting Swiss woman, Carola Giedion-Welcker, who was a great friend of Joyce and who, subsequently, became a friend of mine. Brancusi was a very <i>avant garde</i> artist and this was his first attempt. It was recognisably Joyce in a human context. My <i>avant garde</i> friends in Switzerland were furious because they wanted something abstract and they said, &ldquo;Take it back and do another one&rdquo;. He produced the image of Joyce as a series of concentric circular fragments and a thing like an exclamation mark and they thought that was more like it. It was the abstract essence of Joyce. It was brought back to Dublin and shown to his father, John Stanislaus, who took one look at it and said, &ldquo;Ah, poor James, he&rsquo;s changed a lot&rdquo;. In any case, it is important to emphasise that this is a general Bill. It is not specifically or directly aimed at one person or interest. However, I note from what I read in the newspaper, not from what <Col N="1418"/>the Minister of State said, that we should be grateful to Stephen Joyce for precipitating these circumstances by making an aggressive intervention aimed at the National Library. This highlighted what may be a loophole that goes far beyond the question of the works of James Joyce and also includes the exhibition of artistic works of various kinds that may be inhibited. It could have a very damaging effect. It would be unworthy of this House if the Bill were directed at one person, however much some of us might enjoy it.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech, the Minister of State said the Bill is to remove doubt and that he does not believe it represents a change, but is simply consolidating the position that arises from a very complex area of legislation. He referred to this complexity in his opening remarks. It certainly is complex and that is why we got into this position. It is completely anomalous and very unsatisfactory that James Joyce should have come out of copyright in 1941, stayed out of copyright for three and a half to four years and then, during one of the tidying up operations of the European Union in which it decided to harmonise everything including the shape of bananas and the length of sausages, come back into copyright. Moreover, the Union decided to harmonise upwards in the direction of the French and German copyright laws.</P>
    <P>I was made aware of this and informed the then Minister, a very decent and highly intelligent man who was in charge of this area at the time. However, the legislation came through as a kind of statutory instrument about intellectual copyright, which mainly concerned what I would vaguely call micro-technology, computers and the storage of information. The loophole under discussion came in as a codicil to that and it was not noticed. It was a real pity because I felt we could have got a derogation from it. After all, it is absurd that somebody should come out of copyright and then be stuffed back in. The European Union appears to have recognised this because it provided for the so-called window of opportunity, such that if one had a show, book or other work in preparation between the ending of the first copyright period and the artificial reinstatement of the copyright, one could be granted copyright possession.</P>
    <P>The artificial reinstatement violates a good legal principal that one should not introduce retrospective legislation. As I stated, the Union tried to cover this by granting copyright possession to anybody who could demonstrate they had works in preparation between the ending and reinstatement of copyright and that is why I am still able to do my show all over the world. The reinstatement represents a very bad principle and we could have got a derogation from it.</P>
    <P>The newspaper reports refer to an intervention by Mr. Stephen Joyce. It is an astonishing irony that a man such as James Joyce, who fought for freedom of expression, wanted to reach the <Col N="1419"/>widest possible audience by every means at his command and committed himself so totally against censorship throughout his life should now find his works being confined and removed from public gaze and performance and scholarship inhibited by his own estate. This would make him extremely sad. I have encountered this kind of inhibition in respect of a little puppet show for inner city kids, which was free of charge. It was closed down by the operation of the estate. This is like taking lollipops from blind kids; it is disgusting.</P>
    <P>I notice there is a recital of the various radio and television programmes that have been cancelled as a result of this kind of threat of injunction. I have experienced this kind of behaviour as the director of the James Joyce Centre. In 1992, we had a World Wide Web broadcast of <i>Ulysses</i>, which used Bloom&rsquo;s idea of the day continuing around the planet. There was always daylight in some particular place and there were broadcasts from Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Dublin, Ankara, Cyprus, China, etc. It was marvellous. Mary Robinson was President at the time and she did a reading, as did I, and it was really lovely to feel we were all linked in this way. We intended to do it again but our sponsors were attacked. However, we were able to demonstrate legally that we should have held copyright because we had our material in preparation during the window of opportunity. Unfortunately, our sponsors included <i>The Irish Times </i>and Irish Distillers. <i>The Irish Times </i>decided to settle because it was going through a rough period and I believe it did not want any more turbulence. Irish Distillers responded as do many insurance companies. Although one may be in the right, the company will decide it is cheaper for it to settle and save itself the bother of fighting its case. If this continues, a body of case law will build up and the remaining seven years of the copyright will be very unpleasant for everybody.</P>
    <P>I am very glad this action has been taken. It is general in nature but, specifically, it will act to rescue a very important exhibition being held in our National Library, which was the setting of one episode of <i>Ulysses </i>in which certain aspects of free speech are discussed. It would be appalling to think that over &euro;12 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money had been expended, quite correctly, courageously and appropriately, on acquiring this very remarkable collection of material but that the taxpayers were prevented from enjoying it and seeing what they had purchased because of some obscure and arbitrary intervention under the Copyright Act.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this material be made available to the public in this way and I am very glad it is being done. It shows a certain stiffening of attitude if one considers the case in which the National Library inherited a very important collection of letters that were rescued by a very courageous figure, the late Paul L&eacute;on. His son, <Col N="1420"/>Alexis, came to Ireland for the opening of the exhibition. In a remarkable display of pusillanimity, the National Library, despite protestors such as myself, handed over to Stephen Joyce some letters, which he took with him and later claimed he destroyed. It would make me think very carefully before bequeathing material to the National Library if I believed it would hand it over to the caprices and whims of somebody who is, after all, fairly distant in generational terms from the source of that material, such as Stephen Joyce.</P>
    <P>James Joyce wrote <i>Ulysses</i>, James Joyce wrote <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, James Joyce wrote <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> and James Joyce wrote <i>Dubliners</i>. His descendants, quite far down the line, took no part whatever in that process of creation although they have benefited enormously in a financial sense. If anybody talks of profiteering, he should be asked what he made out of works in whose creation he played no part himself.</P>
    <P>I was in Monte Carlo at a big conference on Joyce, which was attended by Michael Yeats and his sister. Stephen Joyce interrupted and made a very nasty accusation of profiteering against the Yeats family. In a very dignified way, Michael and his sister responded simply by saying they would not attack Mr. Joyce but that it should be put on the record that they gave their father&rsquo;s manuscripts to the National Library. That was all that needed to be said.</P>

	<P>I compliment them on their swift reaction and their entrepreneurial mindset in introducing this Bill to improve the copyright position. Senator Norris has brought the works of James Joyce to the forefront in this country and across the world and we are honoured to have him in the Seanad with us. When Irish people travel abroad the first thing they do is go to an art exhibition. In Paris they go to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa and in Amsterdam they go to the Van Gough Museum. However, we have tremendously inspirational works on our doorstep here. James Joyce was the leading prose writer in English in the 20th century. <i>Ulysses</i> is critically regarded as one of the greatest novels ever written and the most important literary work <Col N="1421"/>of the 20th century. Joyce was one of our own and for such a small country we have made a great contribution to the world. I congratulate the Minister and his modest officials sitting behind him. I know the great work they do on intellectual property.</P>

	<P>I thank the Members of the House for their support for the Bill. While having the advantage of being short, it removes a doubt that had potentially serious consequences. As pointed out by Senator Leyden and others, while the Bill will have wide application, it will cover the major exhibition planned for the National Library in June at which Joyce works will be exhibited. This will form the centrepiece of the Bloomsday celebrations. Like Senator Leyden, I wish Senator Norris well during those celebrations.</P>
    <P>When we transposed the final elements of the information society directive earlier this year, most provisions had already been transposed by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. We undertook a detailed consultation process. Many of the comments received were more pertinent to the Act than to the transposition. We are now examining these to determine whether further changes to the Act are warranted. Already, we have identified some areas where change would be desirable and I expect we will have another opportunity to discuss copyright in the House. Primary legislation may be required on <i>droit de suite</i>. I thank all those who contributed to the debate.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 3 seeks to repeal existing legislation and to remove the structures and procedures under which health boards operated formerly. All Opposition parties opposed the provisions in the D&aacute;il. We are in favour of maintaining the current health board structures. The Bill removes political participation and accountability from the system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Contesting the section represents a degree of hypocrisy by the Fine Gael Party. Over the past number of years, no structure was disparaged by its members to a greater extent than the health board system. As a long-time member of a health board, I bemoan the fact that the previous structures are passing. The health boards did a fine job in one way and another. I am not particularly amenable to the removal from the system of locally elected interests and I understand that the Minister has proposals to make pertaining to the participation of local authority members in the new structures. Therefore, I do not support Senator Feighan&rsquo;s opposition to the section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt><?oasys [ah?>
	<P>The Government takes accountability very seriously. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is aware of concerns expressed on public participation within the restructured system. The Minister has already indicated his intention to bring forward proposals to provide opportunities for democratic input in the context of the new structures. He has given much consideration to the appropriate mechanisms to support the development of appropriate interfaces at regional and local level between locally elected representatives and the health service executive. Provisions to implement these mechanisms will be <Col N="1423"/>included in the legislation which is currently being drafted.</P><?oasys [xh?>
    <P>Provisions are likely to include the establishment of a series of regional fora to facilitate local representatives who wish to raise with the executive issues of local concern about health services within their regions. Membership of the fora will be based on the participation of a number of nominees from each local authority. Putting such arrangements in place will ensure that the voices of local public representatives will continue to be heard in the development of health structures. The arrangements will be designed to complement and reinforce the role of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in expressing the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health system.</P>
    <P>The health strategy identified the need for a more structured approach to community participation in decisions on the delivery of health services. To this end, the health service executive in association with the Department of Health and Children issued guidelines on community participation. These guidelines set out the principles and framework for structures for such participation. Most health boards have established consumer panels that deal with a wide range of issues such as the development and delivery of services. Two boards have also established regional advisory panels for older consumers and their carers. The Minister intends to establish these structures on a legislative basis in the next Bill. I reject the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister referring to section 4? We are not discussing an amendment. We are discussing section 3.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>This section is a technical provision which enables the Minister, on commencement, to repeal certain provisions of the Acts of 1947, 1970, 1996 and 1999. Subsection (2) is a saver for the provisions of the Health Board Regulations 1970, which established the health boards, apart from the ERHA and the area health boards, and defined their functional area. It is required to ensure the boards can continue to operate in their functional areas following the commencement of the section. If this section was deleted, the Bill would be inoperable. I therefore recommend that the section stand part of the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is cheap and disingenuous for Senator Glynn to attack my party on the issue of the health boards. Members of my party are on the Western Health Board, as are members of the Government parties.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am still talking about section 3.</P><Col N="1424"/>
    <P>If the Senator was being honest and truthful with himself he would know that the removal of public representatives from the health boards is a backward step. I appreciate that he must articulate the views of the Government, but most of the councillors on the health boards, including the Government councillors, are disgusted and devastated at this retrograde move. We are letting down the councillors and other public representatives who gave their expertise and time to discuss some complicated issues to do with health boards.</P>
    <P>The so-called committee is merely a talking shop. Politicians will have no real involvement in the health system. If elected members cannot have any involvement, why do people run for election at all? We are leaving things up to the bureaucrats and consultants and effectively telling the health boards to run their own business. Who will ask the hard questions? Who has always brought consultants and middle and upper management to heel? The answer is politicians. Once again, the Minister is appealing to public opinion. He knows that people think politicians should not be on these boards.</P>
    <P>I was elected in 1999 and sat on the boards of the VEC. I am sure Senator Glynn will agree that whatever party they belonged to, politicians have been honest and impartial and have given great service to the VECs and health boards. This is a backward step. That is why I oppose the section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I fought a hard battle with the Minister about whether there should be a democratic input, along with the Association of Health Boards in Ireland, which I commend on its hands-on approach to this matter. Regardless of whether people like it, when the announcement was made there was very little noise from the other side. I accept there is great concern among locally elected members about this issue. I share that concern. However, I must be balanced and honest and say that the issue of representation has been addressed. The merits of the method of addressing it will not be known for some time.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a health board for almost 23 years and chairman for two years. I worked for a health board for many years. Nobody appreciates more than me the value of locally elected members. That is why, as the Minister for Health and Children would confirm if he were here, I made ongoing representations for having local democratic input included in the structures.</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of acceptance among the Opposition of the abolition of the health boards. There is no point in saying black and meaning white; that is the case. The reason I fought so hard with the Minister for the recognition of democratic input was that I would not give anybody <i>carte blanche</i> when it comes to the delivery of a public service. The health service is extremely important and it is imperative that it is responsible and answers to the people. In that context there should be democratic input. The <Col N="1425"/>Minister has acceded to my ongoing representations and those of the Association of Health Boards in Ireland. I wish the new structures well.</P>
    <P>We do not all get what we want in this life. I am a Government Senator and a spokesperson on health and children, so I have a responsibility to the Government. However, I want to be balanced in my comments in the House and I will be so without fear or favour. The provisions for public representation and involvement are not ideal but they are a major step forward from the original proposal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to remember that the reform programme has it origins in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. This strategy sets out the vision and goals to guide planning and activity in the health system up to 2010. While the strategy acknowledges that the current structures have served us well for more than 30 years, it is recognised that they need to be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate and responsive to the needs and challenges of delivering health services in the changing environment of the 21st century. It also identified the need for a consistent national approach to the delivery of health services, based on clear and agreed national objectives. This is an interim measure. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has stated his intention to introduce new legislation later this year. The new system will need to be highly responsive, so it must take into account the views of public representatives.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I highlight to Senator Glynn that representatives of the health boards came to the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meeting seeking support for their proposal that political representatives should be on the health boards. We gave unqualified support to these people. Perhaps the Senator might ask these questions of some members of his own party who were part of that group. We gave an unqualified commitment to oppose this measure. I appreciate that the Senator works hard as the chairperson of a health board and provides a good service. I know he will miss it when he is no longer a member. I still feel, however, that the new structures are fobbing people off. They have been put in place to avoid the meaningful inclusion of elected members.</P>
    <P>People come into my office who have lost their medical cards or who need representations. Where are they to go now? They must go to the people who make decisions without the impartial influence of elected members. Doctors and consultants do not run for election. They are part of this &euro;10 billion system which is wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money &mdash; the money of the people who vote. Yet we are giving power to the vested interests. The only people who do not have a union are patients. Politicians stand up for the rights of patients. If we no longer have a say, it is a backward step. Members of the new structures <Col N="1426"/>may be appointed by the Minister and will probably receive a nice cheque for turning up at the meetings. However, they will have no input into this disastrous health system.</P>

	<P>The Association of Health Boards, which met representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties, received very strong support from within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. The Minister has rowed back somewhat from the original proposal, which I welcome. I made it clear to all concerned that locally elected members &mdash; I said this at a meeting of the Midland Health Board last June when I was interviewed by RTE &mdash; are a very important conduit through which complaints can be channelled and opinions made known to the relevant health boards. The Minister has recognised that locally elected members are extremely important and put in place structures to address the issue.</P>

   <Title>Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) (Amendment) Bill 2004: Second Stage.</Title>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As Members will be aware, this House will be asked shortly to initiate a process to deal with a matter of the highest national importance. I refer to the solemn responsibility placed by the Constitution on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the possibility of <Col N="1427"/>the removal of a judge from office in accordance with Article 35.4 of the Constitution. It is proposed that motions to initiate that process will be brought forward next week. In the meantime the Government, acting on its legal advice, has introduced this Bill to facilitate whatever procedures the Houses decide to put in place to enable it to discharge that responsibility.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides a power that will be available on any future occasion that the Houses of the Oireachtas may be called upon to contemplate the removal of a judge. I hope there will not be many such occasions. Under the provisions of the Bill, a judge may be compelled to appear before and provide evidence to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas that may be set up in connection with the exercise by the Houses of the power provided in Article 35.4 of the Constitution. Mindful of the importance of preserving the independence of the Judiciary, the power to compel a judge proposed by the Bill is framed very narrowly and specifically.</P>
    <P>It relates only to circumstances where the removal of a judge pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution is being contemplated and only to a judge who is the subject of such a process. It is inconceivable that the Houses of the Oireachtas should embark on such a solemn process without having the capacity to require the judge to assist them in that process. In all other circumstances, the exemption from compellability for judges in their capacity as judges will remain. I stress that the independence of judges in the exercise of their judicial functions is in no way compromised by this measure.</P>
    <P>On the detail of the specific provisions of the Bill, it is proposed to amend the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997 by inserting a new section 3A after section 3 of that Act. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the new section 3A provides that section 3 of the 1997 Act shall, notwithstanding section 3(4) and (11) of the 1997 Act, apply to a judge where a committee is established for the purpose of a matter arising under Article 35.4 of the Constitution, section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 or section 20 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act 1946.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the new section 3A clarifies that a &ldquo;committee&rdquo; as defined in the 1997 Act, which is established in connection with the behaviour or capacity of a judge, means a committee established before or after the enactment of the Bill. The paragraph also clarifies that such a committee may deal with the behaviour or capacity of a judge whether the behaviour or capacity in question occurred or occurs before or after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>When enacted, the Bill will mean that a committee, established to consider the possible removal from office of a judge, will have the power to direct a judge to attend before it, give evidence and produce any document in his or her possession or power as directed by the <Col N="1428"/>committee. I stress that it is just an enabling power. It is a matter for decision by any such committee whether it wishes to invoke the power, following the procedures laid down in the 1997 Act, which require, among other matters, the prior consent of the appropriate sub-committee.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be aware that the &ldquo;appropriate subcommittee&rdquo; referred to in section 3A is defined in the 1997 Act. Where a committee appointed by either House of the Oireachtas or a sub-committee of such a committee is seeking powers of compellability, the necessary consent is given by a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of that House. Where the committee in question is appointed jointly by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the consent must be given by a sub-committee appointed jointly by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of each House. Under the existing legislation, a committee already has these powers in respect of other potential witnesses. The issue of compellability is only one component, but an essential one, of a framework in which a committee of the Oireachtas can effectively carry out its functions in regard to a process of this kind.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill as an essential component in a framework under which the Oireachtas can, when necessary, effectively discharge its duty on foot of Article 35.4 of the Constitution, by providing it with the power to call all witnesses who have pertinent information and also to obtain all relevant documentation and material.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of the State. I believe this is the first time the Minister has come before us, as a new Seanad, although I may be incorrect about that. She comes from an illustrious family in terms of its contribution to this House, not least her brother and her father. I welcome her to the House as Government Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>I am convinced about the Government&rsquo;s sincerity in the way it is dealing with this issue, particularly the way it has involved all voices in this House at leadership level in terms of the groups we represent, and in the way it has dealt with the matter in the other House. In putting my views forward on this proposed legislation, I want to make it clear that I am in no way undermining the Government&rsquo;s strategy on this matter or its handling of the matter.</P>
    <P>This is new ground and while our duties are clear under Article 35.4 of the Constitution, I want to make it clear that there is no legal or procedural framework we can follow in terms of seeking precedent in former cases. Because there is no precedent in this matter it is important that we take our time and tease out this matter, and that there is maximum consultation over a period of time.</P>
    <P>I put this question to the Minister of State. Some members of this House attended a meeting with the Attorney General last Thursday, and we also attended a meeting with the Minister for <Col N="1429"/>Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State yesterday, and during both meetings we were not given an assurance that legislation would be needed in advance of this process beginning. That is an indication of the fluidity in the situation and the fact that many new issues can arise. We appear to be determined to follow a course of action whereby at some point next week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, a motion will be put to this House or the other House. I ask the people involved, even at this late stage, to examine this matter seriously and tease it out with all Members in the House to ensure we get it right. We do not want a repeat of other examples where the Houses of the Oireachtas got it badly wrong when some of these matters went before the courts.</P>
    <P>On a second issue, and I will put this view as neatly as I can, are we not putting the cart before the horse in respect of this legislation? The controversy that arose in recent weeks concerning a member of the Judiciary is well known but that member of the Judiciary has told the Government he believes he has a right, which he has, to address the Oireachtas and not the Government <i>per se</i>. That is explicitly the case under Article 35.4. Why should we change that legislation in advance of that committee being established and its work advancing? Would an issue of compellability arise given that the person in question has already publicly stated that he wants to meet the Oireachtas to deal with these matters, as is his right? Why is there a need for compellability? Why is there a need for compellability regarding this matter if the Oireachtas is determined that a committee be established to look into it and if the person in question then deals directly with that committee? If a difficulty arose at that stage, for instance, would it not be wiser for the committee to decide that legislation was necessary in this area in terms of compellability rather than the Oireachtas doing it first? I simply pose that question and ask the Minister to reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that the issue of judicial conduct came to the fore some years ago in regard to the Sheedy affair. A clear commitment was given by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, to bring forward legislation in this area. To his credit, he published a Bill but despite the fact that it is in the Government&rsquo;s programme and identified as an area of priority, it has not yet been enacted in the House. The House has no framework, therefore, upon which the issue of Article 35.4 can be determined. We are rushing through this legislation in that we are taking only one day to deal with what is a fundamental constitutional duty. Would it not have been more sensible to have the legislation in place, tease it out over a period and then deal with the other matter as needs be? All our actions today and in recent days appear to be predicated on the notion that early next week a motion on this matter has to come before this House and the other House. <Col N="1430"/>There is no reason that has to be the case and the matter should be clarified.</P>
    <P>Why is the power to compel required in this instance? I have already stated, and it is public knowledge, that in regard to the matter we are discussing it is clear the member of the Judiciary concerned wants to deal directly with the Oireachtas, as is his right. Why are we forcing, through compellability legislation, a situation where it is already sated policy on the part of the person concerned that he will deal directly with the Oireachtas? If the Oireachtas establishes this procedure, one would presume the person would, in all fairness do that.</P>
    <P>Another question concerns the power of compellability of a person to attend and the rule against self-incrimination, which I am aware was raised by my colleagues in the other House this morning. When it comes to this important issue, if evidence is given at a committee predicated on Article 35.4, can it then be used to support any contention of misbehaviour which may be in the motion before the House next week? This is a fundamental rule of natural justice. If a person gives information freely to a committee of the Oireachtas, can the information be used to come to a determination by the committee or by the House at some later point? Similar rules apply to tribunals. Evidence given to a tribunal, for example, cannot directly deal with a criminal case. Such evidence must be gathered separately.</P>
    <P>If a person is compelled to attend there is no certainty that he or she must answer questions or provide evidence. The stated position of the person in question is that he will deal directly with the Oireachtas in a manner the Oireachtas sees fit. Why, then, is compellability necessary? How does the power of compellability sit with the right to silence, which is a fundamental aspect of our law? Can the Oireachtas, or a committee of the Oireachtas, come to a determination as to whether or not that right can be quashed? Does compellability confer privilege and is that privilege absolute or qualified?</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty in which we find ourselves. All contributions in the House have approached the subject with the single objective of making sure the procedures and process are fair and that the dignity of the House and its constitutional obligations under Article 35.4 are inherently fair and are seen to be so by all citizens.</P>
    <P>Members have an obligation to put questions to the Government regarding its strategy. I thank the Minister of State for her attendance and for considering this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Brian Hayes in welcoming the Minister of State. Deputy Hanafin&rsquo;s family has a long and distinguished connection with the Seanad. I also welcome the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to assist any process initiated with regard to the constitutional or legislative issues which arise under Article 35.4. <Col N="1431"/>As Senator Hayes has pointed out, that process needs to be fair. The Bill seeks to ensure there is a legislative framework for the unprecedented step on which the Houses may embark.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the Legislature and the Judiciary is fundamental to any democratic society. Senator Brian Hayes referred to the fact that following a controversy regarding a judge of the High Court, a Bill was published which outlined a way in which matters in this area could be dealt with in the future. It is my recollection that there was general agreement in committees of the Oireachtas regarding that legislation but that opposition was raised to it subsequently in the other House. This may have led to the Bill not being pursued and processed. With this type of legislation it is important that the groupings in the House come to a consensus to ensure there is broad support in both Houses for the measures to be put in place. Such consensus generates the necessary confidence in any system to be set up.</P>
    <P>I have always felt the need for some form of arrangement which safeguards the independence of the Judiciary but retains elements of accountability which can be processed. That is not the case at present. People on all sides of the House had considerable sympathy for the judge in the case mentioned by Senator Brian Hayes. It was felt the matter needed to be processed in a way which might not, necessarily, have led to the loss of the judge to the Bench.</P>
    <P>The principle of separation of powers is absolutely essential. The Executive cannot have any connection with or influence over the processing of cases by the Judiciary. At a recent Garda conference complaints were made regarding certain judges who, perhaps in an abuse of their position on the Bench, have been critical of garda&iacute;, solicitors and witnesses. While we all have mornings when we get out of the wrong side of the bed and say things we may regret, if the legal system is to have public confidence there must be accountability. Some form of independent commission, removed from the Executive and perhaps including retired members of the Judiciary, could pursue such instances and call such judges to order. We must have safeguards to ensure people who are in privileged positions do not abuse that privilege. This is particularly important in a republic. There ought to be a procedure for dealing with that. There is such a provision to deal with serious issues which arise in the case of judges of the District Court but the same is not the case for other judges. Perhaps this proposal could be examined. The Bill to which Senator Brian Hayes referred could be reactivated and a system, which would be independent of the Oireachtas, could be put in place to process such issues. The Houses might then act on foot of recommendations from that commission if the ultimate step has to be taken.</P>
    <P>Given that motions are to come before the Oireachtas, a legislative framework must be put in place to facilitate committees in operating <Col N="1432"/>effectively. Any assistance to be given to committees should be clearly set out in legislation so they can function effectively. It would be regrettable if a course of action embarked upon by either House subsequently had to be abandoned because the necessary legislation was not in place.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I welcome the Bill. I hope it will assist a committee in dealing with whatever or whoever is brought before it in the future. The steps being proposed have serious consequences for all concerned. We must have a system by which issues of this nature can be pursued and regulated. It is in the interest of maintaining public confidence in the Oireachtas and in the Judiciary that this be done. I welcome the Bill which will give any such committees established the powers of compellability to direct witnesses or judges to attend, give evidence and to produce any documents it considers necessary. The framework we are putting in place &mdash; I am sure Senator O&rsquo;Toole will make this point &mdash; is strong in terms of constitutional issues in that the House must take ownership and responsibility for the process. That, presumably, is the manner in which issues will proceed. Notwithstanding that, it is essential we put in place whatever legal framework is required to assist that process so it is not inhibited or aborted at a future stage.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it chun Tigh Uachtara&iacute; an Oireachtais. This is the first occasion the Minister of State has attended this House. The Government and all concerned are in a difficult situation. The position regarding our relationship with the Constitution in terms of whether we are its guardians or defenders is not clear. I am certain, however, that we have obligations under it to ensure that rights conferred on citizens are observed and available at all stages.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the legislation before us although I believe it raises difficulties. In that regard, I concur with Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s earlier remarks. While I question this process, I have no doubt about the motives of the Government, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I wish to put on the record that I do not wish in any way to impugn their motives because I believe they are acting from the highest and most admirable standpoints on this issue.</P>
    <P>So strong are my feelings in terms of ensuring due process, fair procedures and the outermost limits of probity in dealing with this issue that I would personally take the House to the Supreme Court if I believed it was doing something wrong. I would not be waiting for representatives of those we might be considering to impeach to do it. I hope also that everybody else feels the same. I have many reasons for my point of view. It is in the interests of lawyers representing a person due to be impeached to allow us to make a mess of the process in order for them to undermine it afterwards. Everybody is coming from the belief <Col N="1433"/>that we will be taken to the Supreme Court if we get this wrong. That will no doubt happen. The best thing people, who believe they can catch us on a fundamental point of process which in some way infringes or delimits a citizen&rsquo;s rights, can do is let us make a mess of the process and later have it turned on its head. The public will not forgive us if we get this wrong. I am not speaking of obtaining a result. We must enter this process with an open mind and we will do so. However, if a procedural difficulty arises, we will not be forgiven.</P>
    <P>Many issues arise in terms of this legislation. Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are empowered by the Constitution to carry through the process of impeachment. In doing so, we will begin with a process of assembling a committee which will have the power to collect evidence. That is the mildest power I can attribute to the committee although I have heard others refer to it as an investigative one. The Bar Council, the Law Library and the Medical Council, in terms of how they do their business, always ensure a separation of the investigation phase and those involved in it from the deliberative phase to the judicial phase. In that regard, a question will quickly arise as to what will be the position of people sitting on a committee which we might establish following enactment of this legislation in a process of impeachment which may follow. A question will also arise in terms of the collection of evidence. Such a committee could not form a judgment on the core issue but would be required to form a judgment on what was appropriate evidence to bring before the Houses of the Oireachtas and in doing so would have reached a conclusion about certain aspects of evidence that were not appropriate or relevant. Nonetheless, it could be argued that having seen such evidence, they are different from the rest of us and should be excluded.</P>
    <P>Another issue that could arise is people speaking out of turn on the core issue in the media or other places. It is clear that such people could be seen to be prejudiced. If that happens, who will pronounce them as being prejudiced? Who will deal with the matter of a person speaking out of turn and clearly giving to the media a biased view, thereby tainting or making unsafe any conclusions of the Houses? To that extent, any process going through either House needs to be managed by way of building into that process a management structure, be that a person or a sub-committee.</P>
    <P>There has been little debate on the sub-committee on compellability, a sub-committee of the joint CPPs, which gives permission to allow compellability of a particular person. Members of the sub-committee are also members of the CPP which forms judgments based on evidence presented by members of the new sub-committee. Such a committee must form a judgment that it was appropriate to compel a person on a particular basis. That is its function. I would like a similar protection in the process to follow.</P><Col N="1434"/>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes referred to evidence compelled and where we stand in that regard. The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997 includes a clear statement regarding evidence adduced through compellability and states that such evidence cannot be used afterwards in a criminal trial. I know the simple answer is that impeachment, if it were to take place, is not a criminal proceeding, but neither is it a civil proceeding. Impeachment does not come under the category of criminal or civil proceedings. If such proceedings are not criminal, one could adduce that the burden of proof would be the balance of probability. How does that affect evidence collected? Given that the committee can compel a person to attend the proceedings, can it compel a person to give evidence which could be later used against him or her? A constitutional issues arises in that regard. I am only relating that point to a particular section of the Bill and do not suggest the two issues are the same. However, it is a matter we must consider.</P>
    <P>The right to natural justice would clearly give the person the right to engage with the process and to question it. In normal circumstances, people examine evidence, offer rebuttals and present argumentation. There is no doubt in my mind &mdash; I am sure this is true of others, including the Minister of State who I know has views on this issue &mdash; that we would have to establish a process to allow that engagement. Such engagement may not sit easily with compellability. There is a difference between offering a person the facility to engage and compelling that person to give evidence which could be later used against him or her. I am not saying I know where that might lead us but, nevertheless, an issue arises in that regard.</P>
    <P>If we are to get to the process of dealing with an impeachment arising out of this legislation, we will have to manage the engagement of the person who it might be contemplated to impeach and consider how that person will engage with the process. That issue must be managed. I do not know with whom that responsibility would rest. Would it be the Leader of the House, a person nominated by the House or a sub-committee of the House? How would it be done? Each House of the Oireachtas has rules of engagement in terms of what is parliamentary. Will the rules of parliamentary procedure apply to the process of impeachment? Given its powers, one would assume such rules will apply. However, is that a fair assumption given we are dealing with a person&rsquo;s constitutional rights? Can the hearing be moderated on that basis? We know that court rules need not apply but is that vacuum easily filled by the parliamentary procedures or is there some other way? I raised the question of the burden of proof. Do we give advice to people as to how they should deal with these issues? These are some of the questions that have troubled me. I do not have a problem with the legislation <Col N="1435"/>although I do not think it is necessary. What bothers me is how quickly this is coming before the House, not in the sense of whether the House can cope with it because it is easy enough to read and understand this Bill and come to a position on it. We had a very open and honest meeting with the Attorney General last week and with the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform yesterday. The other legislation which was dealt with in the House this morning was not even mentioned at those meetings. It had not come through as an important issue at that time because I am assuming the Minister of State would have informed us if it had been. I am bothered by that rolling approach. It seems to be a case of making it up as we go along.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between not having a process and making it up as one goes along. I know we must make it up but I would like to make it up before we start. That is the point made by Senator Brian Hayes. I want to be clear in my mind about the way it will go, the timeline and the sequence of events and then press the button and agree to go. In this case we are rushing into it and saying that it must be right for tomorrow and these three pieces of legislation must be put through. I am worried about that approach. As the makers of law, we in the Legislature have a clear duty to ensure that the rights we want our citizens to have are protected in all cases, even in the case of somebody being impeached. That is our duty as much as it is to go through the impeachment procedure. They are equal and they must be balanced. There must be open-minded, fair procedures and we must then do our duty. I will support the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Aire St&aacute;it to the House. I will start where Senator O&rsquo;Toole finished, on the subject of the whole business of making it up as one goes along. We all acknowledge that there is of necessity a certain <i>ad hoc</i> air about this. It strikes me we are just looking around the next corner rather than trying to look around a few corners at a time. In essence, we are doing today what we have been doing for most of the last week which is considering how the committee can be established, how the process can be properly initiated and the procedures the committee might undertake.That must be done and the Opposition has co-operated with Government in looking to put those procedures in place. If thought has been given to what happens once the committee reports, then we have not been involved in negotiations or discussions about that. I have not the remotest idea how the Houses of the Oireachtas will process the report once it comes before us.</P>
    <P>We should now be looking to give a week or two weeks thought to that. What format will the debate take? Will Members be entitled to literally say anything they wish to say? If a Member gives <Col N="1436"/>the impression that he or she has come to a conclusion or came to a conclusion two months ago following the collapse of the criminal trial, is that open in any fashion to judicial review? Is anything which a Member says indicating the basis of his or her decision open to review or does it matter? It may very well be that it does not matter. It may well be that the Constitution gives that power to Members of the Oireachtas and they can make up their minds irrespective of how irresponsibly they choose to do it or based on whatever evidence they choose to take into account. The truth is that we do not know. We need to have a firm view even at this stage or before we initiate the process, be it next Tuesday or whenever, as to how the whole process will pan out and not just how the committee will pan out. I regret that we have not thought sufficiently far ahead and we should take a week or two to do so now.</P>
    <P>Like Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Brian Hayes who spoke before me, I am not sure what is meant by an impeachment process. Is this akin to a criminal trial where the judge is being cast in the role of defendant and the Houses of the Oireachtas are cast in the role of judge, with all the rights and requirements of process that entails? Is it perhaps an investigation where various Members of the Houses can be taken away and put into a committee room for however long it takes to assemble facts and then Members of both Houses make up their minds based on those facts or any other facts, at a later stage?</P>
    <P>It seems to me the Government is taking the second view. I am not a constitutional lawyer but on balance, that is probably right. There is no doubt that it would be safer to take the former view. It would be safer to take the view that the judge is the defendant or potentially the defendant and the Members of the Houses are the judge and jury and to accord the judge all the various rights that go with that state. Implicit in that would be the right not to incriminate himself; the right not to give evidence against himself or to produce documents that would incriminate himself; the right to silence; and the right not to attend, which is important in the context of today&rsquo;s Bill, if we choose to treat him as being defendant or akin to a defendant in a criminal trial. I appreciate it is not a criminal trial.</P>
    <P>We are taking the opposite view that the judge is part of an investigation. That implies we are saying to a judge in those circumstances that he or she is obliged to satisfy or be party to satisfying the Oireachtas, that he or she is suitable for the job. We are placing a certain onus on the judge by putting a resolution before the Houses to state, &ldquo;Yes, I am a suitable person and no, I am not guilty of stated misbehaviour or I am not incapable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If one thinks in terms of a job interview or assessment or membership of a club, to what extent are we entitled to reverse that onus? To what extent must we say to the judge that we do not think him capable or, more to the point, think <Col N="1437"/>he is guilty of stated misbehaviour and then prove that before the judge, in turn, responds? To what extent can we ask the judge to bring along all the documents he has that might be relevant to this case and satisfy us as to his position? I do not know the answer to that question but it is important that we have some advice and concept in our minds as to exactly where it stands before we begin the process.</P>
    <P>My opinion is not worth a great deal but if the Oireachtas initiates the process properly and if it is based on some class of evidence, then there is or should be an onus on the judge to satisfy the Oireachtas that he has not been guilty of stated misbehaviour if that misbehaviour is stated by way of resolution or otherwise. I would like an explicit response from the Minister of State as to whether she thinks that is the case.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat although not overly concerned about the retrospective element. We are setting in place a process of investigation of activities which may or may not have happened before the process itself is in place. That would cause difficulty were we talking about a criminal trial. If one extends the logic of what we were discussing earlier that it is not a criminal trial, then it is not a problem. This requires clarity of thought and I am not conscious we have that clarity of thought. I am anxious to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s thoughts and the Government&rsquo;s view as to whether there is any difficulty in making this applicable retrospectively as opposed to just prospectively.</P>
    <P>It is a pity this is being done so quickly. I would have liked the opportunity over the weekend or over the next week or so to take advice. There are many people in the Law Library, as the Minister of State well knows, who have views on these issues and we all have access to some of them. It is a pity we do not have the opportunity to use some of that advice and to gather together the collective wisdom of our colleagues in the legal profession. The process is moving quickly and there is nothing this House can do at this stage.</P>
    <P>My party did not oppose this Bill in the Lower House and we will not do so here.</P>

    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their welcome contributions and for their non-opposition, as it was phrased in the D&aacute;il, to the passing of the legislation. Two important issues have been raised. One deals specifically with the process in respect of the specific case and the other deals with the legislation. The Constitution gives power to the Oireachtas for the removal of a judge. Equally, the Constitution does not set out the process by which we would have to do that. That is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas. As Senators have said it is the source of much consultation between Senators. It is also before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses in order to put in place procedures <Col N="1438"/>which will ensure fair process. These matters are being considered from the point of view of Standing Orders and from the process to be put in place by way of committee investigation and so on. The points raised about that process are valid but they perhaps belong in that forum rather than just here in the House today when specific legislation is being considered. Even though the legislation before the Houses today is very important to enable us to do our duty and fulfil our obligations under Article 35.4 of the Constitution, it is a general Bill which has general application.</P>
    <P>Senators asked why we are rushing the legislation. As I stated, a particular issue has given rise to public disquiet and concern. The Houses of the Oireachtas have been forced to address it and this is one of the Bills which will allow us to do so in an appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether the legislation is necessary is a valid one on which there are different legal views. The legislation brings certainty and clarity to the situation. The compellability legislation refers to a judge in his capacity as a judge. Would activities of a judge outside of his role in the court, perhaps in passing judgment, be covered by the Act? The answer is that in the context of our constitutional role or any process one would use to come to a conclusion under Article 35.4, the end result would certainly affect the judge in his capacity as a judge. It is for this reason that it is probably better to bring clarity and certainty to the whole process.</P>
    <P>Whereas the Oireachtas will deal with the procedures in the committee, it is important to specify that the judge who is the subject of the process of removal from office is the only person who will be compelled under the legislation. The legislation will not, therefore, be widely applicable to all other judges and does not, therefore, affect or interfere in any way with the independence of judges, an issue raised by Senator Jim Walsh. It also provides for a power which the committee may use, rather than must use.</P>
    <P>To return to Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s point, if a judge were to voluntarily come before a committee in a particular case, the power would not have to be used. It is an enabling power for the committee and may never need to be used. It enables us to put in place the necessary framework and structure before starting to invoke our powers, as it were, under Article 35.4.</P>
    <P>The issue of judicial conduct, which Senators raised, is being addressed in judicial conduct and ethics legislation which is under preparation and due to come before the Houses before the end of this year. Senators will recall that an effort was also made to deal with this issue in a constitutional framework in 2001. Unfortunately, however, all-party co-operation was not possible at the time and it was decided not to proceed. Again, the matter could in future be examined in <Col N="1439"/>the cold light of day to determine how we proceed.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked a question about evidence that could be self-incriminating. Section 12 of the Act of 1997 provides for the non-admissibility in criminal proceedings of evidence given under direction. This appears to imply that evidence or information given by a judge, having been compelled to appear before the House, could not be used subsequently in criminal proceedings. The judge in this specific case is <i>autre fois acquit</i>, the criminal law principle which means he cannot be put in jeopardy in a criminal case a second time for the same offence.</P>
    <P>As regards the question regarding privilege, the privilege attaching to a person who has been compelled is the same as that of a High Court witness. In these circumstances, therefore, the person has a further protection.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised a question about a person who agrees to co-operate with the Houses of the Oireachtas. In the event that the Houses put in place a process, it would involve a committee specially established to receive, record and report. If that was the case, one might need the power to compel somebody to appear before the group in question, rather than the full membership of the Houses. As I stated, procedures and so forth for compellability are being dealt with by other groups in and of the Houses.</P>
    <P>The matter of compelling a judge is obviously a sensitive one, which is the reason we sought to be highly restrictive in the legislation. We recognise the independence of the Judiciary and, naturally, the separation of powers as set out in the Constitution forces us to do so. Equally, however, we must ensure that in using our powers under the Constitution we put in place a framework which ensures due process. We aim to do precisely what Senators have asked, namely, to establish a framework before starting on a process. This is the reason two Bills have come before the Houses today and I admit it has been done quickly.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators and the parties generally for their co-operation on this matter as it allows us to put a distance between a specific process and having a framework in place to carry it out. As has been stated many times, these are completely uncharted waters, which is the reason the co-operation of all parties and the workings and contributions to the various processes being established is so valuable.</P>
    <P>This legislation is narrow in focus and applies only to a judge who is the subject of a process of removal from office. It provides that he or she may be compelled to appear before a committee which is investigating that very process. It is an important part of the framework which will give clarity and certainty to the issue. For this reason, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Minister of State&rsquo;s concluding comments on Second Stage, will she take me through the self-incrimination argument again? It is accepted, and is obviously a matter of law under the 1997 Act, that anything said during the course of the process cannot be used in the courts to sustain a criminal trial or anything of that kind. Surely, however, self-incrimination also applies to the integrity of this process in that we are obliging a judge to appear before the committee and incriminate himself by providing evidence against himself within what is, if not a trial process, then certainly one in which a decision will be made that will impact seriously on him. I ask the Minister of State to deal with that point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 12 of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997 states:</P>
    <P LI="1">A statement or admission made by a person before a committee, or a document given or sent by a person to a committee pursuant to a direction of the committee to the person or specified in an affidavit of documents made by a person and given to a committee by the person pursuant to a direction of the committee to the person, shall not be admissible as evidence against the person in any criminal proceedings (other than proceedings in relation to an offence under section 3 (8) or the offence of perjury) and section 11 shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is quite specific.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that is the case but I am concerned that we are asking, within the integrity of the process we are discussing, namely, the investigation followed by hearings, if any, of the House, the individual &mdash; the judge &mdash; to incriminate himself in a way that will obviously inform the decision ultimately taken by the Houses. Let us try not to discuss a specific case and remain theoretical. We are directing a judge to produce documents which could clearly be <Col N="1441"/>used to inform the decision of the Oireachtas to remove him. That is my concern.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be the nature of the process that the committee will be able to guard as much information as possible. Crucial to that will be the need to have a fair procedure and provide for due process to enable the person who is the subject of the investigation to come before it to give evidence which could be used in the person&rsquo;s favour. One must not assume that anything the person would say would automatically be used against him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not allowing him to produce evidence in his favour but compelling him to produce evidence which can be used against him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we are giving the committee power to compel, which it may not even have to use if, as Deputy Brian Hayes stated, the person appears before it voluntarily.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised a question to which there is clearly no answer. We must have integrity in our process. The analogy Senator McDowell and I have used is that of court proceedings. I referred to the relevant section of the Bill, which I read carefully last night, because it only refers to criminal proceedings. Can this process be challenged? It is a completely different scenario where a committee invites somebody and he or she appears. If compellability is triggered and individuals incriminate themselves under direction, is the use of the evidence within the House hearing challengeable? I do not know the answer but it is one of the issues about which I am concerned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has raised an interesting issue. Is it correct to use the word &ldquo;incriminate&rdquo; as it would apply in a court given that the committee will only gather evidence and establish facts to present to the House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The three Rs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a distinction between that process on the one hand and the court on the other where a prosecution would follow. Evidence will be gathered through this process and it is open to anybody who is called before it, including the relevant judge, to provide the evidence and answer questions. The sub-committee will not act with adjudicative powers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the House will afterwards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The evidence will be presented to the House and it will come to a conclusion based on the facts presented as to whether the judge should continue in office. There is no incrimination in that. Anybody could lose his or her job without being incriminated. It might not <Col N="1442"/>have implications for a criminal prosecution. There is a distinction but it is an interesting issue that must be teased out in a satisfactory manner. One could not afford to embark on the process without being sure about this because one would not want the process to abort as a result of something that could have been anticipated.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction in the process and the analogy of the courts may not be correct to describe that on which we are embarking. As the Minister of State and others said, we are in uncharted territory and we are trying to tease out what should be the process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The House in its process would have the right to get the facts from any person who would have those facts. The subject of the investigation would be one such person. I understand the powers of compulsion appear elsewhere in the Statute Book, for example, under the Companies Acts and, therefore, we could not presume that one is talking about incrimination when somebody just gives information, facts and evidence. It could not be used in a criminal case and a committee set up by the House would just receive and record factual evidence. It would not be used in a biased way when sent back to the Houses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of the status of evidence is essential and nobody knows the answer or how it will be tested ultimately. If a committee was established and it found a judge did not comply with its orders or did not fully provide the requested information, it could seek powers under the legislation. I am painting another way forward. Would it not have been more sensible to wait until the committee was established to see how its work was progressing and then if a difficulty emerged in terms of the provision of documents and the quality of evidence, the powers provided under this legislation could be used?</P>
    <P>By amending the legislation and including the work of the committee under it, is a cover being given to the status of the evidence that will be presented to the committee ultimately? If a judge is compelled to appear before a committee and the evidence he or she gives is put to it, can the evidence be forwarded to the House for it to make a decision? It cannot under the existing legislation. Another avenue would be to wait until the committee is established to see if its work is progressing, as one would have hoped and thought, before this legislation would be triggered.</P>

	<P>In the absence of procedures, due process is the one thing we must ensure. Anybody who is the subject of such a matter would be entitled to know the rules that govern the procedure. It would be wrong to commence a process and then dip in and out to change it as people go along. It may happen as we go along that there may be other issues but, if we can <Col N="1443"/>foresee things that will enable us to put the framework in place to undertake a process that the Houses of the Oireachtas deem to be the most fair, it should be done at the outset.</P>

	<P>The powers of compellability are being extended to cover judges. Will the committee have the power to compel the judge to answer questions or will he be at liberty to refuse to answer particular questions?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It does under the principal Act. It could compel him to answer questions. A judge could not come in and sit there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>What will the committee do in a scenario where conflicting evidence is given? Does it report both sets of evidence to the House so the Houses can adjudicate on the confliction? For example, it could be claimed things happened accidentally or whatever. How is that resolved? Who makes the decision, particularly if it involves significant IT complications that the average person might not be able to resolve in his or her mind? How will that be dealt with in this process?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer again to Senator McDowell&rsquo;s question. Section 3 of the Act refers to the provision to direct in writing any person to give evidence and to produce documentation.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Walsh&rsquo;s question, that should be dealt with by the committee itself or through its terms of reference or Standing Orders.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it envisaged by the Government that the committee members who must assemble the information concerning the motion that will be tabled before both Houses will stand back from the process once they report to their colleagues in both Houses?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>That goes beyond the scope of what we have been discussing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned at the Minister of State&rsquo;s response. I am sure it is in conformity with the Act but I am still a little worried. This is not a criminal trial but it is a process, which may result in the removal of a judge from office with significant implications in terms of his or her reputation and livelihood. A young fellow who appears before the District Court having been accused of robbing a bar a chocolate is entitled to say, &ldquo;You lads go away and prove I did this.&rdquo; We are saying if a judge is brought before a committee, it is entitled to ask him whether he did something that may be tantamount to a criminal offence and is also entitled to an answer from him or her. Perhaps we are entitled to do that but that is a substantial presumption about which we need to be sure before we go down that road. We are saying we are entitled to ask the judge whether he or she committed a criminal offence and he or she is obliged to answer <Col N="1444"/>truthfully, failing which he or she would be guilty of a criminal offence in any event such as perjury or contempt.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an enabling power, which the committee does not have to use. Equally, the section to which I referred grants an enabling power. It states a committee may direct in writing any person to give evidence and to produce documentation. The committee may well decide not to invoke the power to compel somebody to attend at all or, having compelled somebody to attend, not to invoke the power to obtain evidence. I would have thought the bottom line was that, in enforcing their role under the Constitution, the Houses of the Oireachtas would have all the evidence available to them to make a fair and just decision. Part of this evidence would be evidence that a person compelled to attend would possess.</P>
    <P>I will refrain from answering Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s question because it is a matter specifically for the process. We can certainly take it up some other time.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  <P>Section 2 agreed to.</P>
  <P>Title agreed to.</P>
    <P>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending. This Bill is short, just like the one we considered this morning. It provides enabling powers to the committee. Given that the Houses of the Oireachtas will have powers under the Constitution, I presume any committee of the House will have to get its own independent legal advice on the process. I assume some of the questions raised would also have to be clarified before the committee would assume its full investigative role concerning any issue regarding which it might be established to consider with a view to reporting back to the Houses. I thank the Minister of State for being very forthcoming in her answers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, for attending and for the way in which she has dealt fully and honestly with the questions that can be answered at this stage. There are many questions which I suspect will be answered elsewhere. We have a very specific role in this matter under Article 35.4 of the Constitution. The approach taken by all sides, which was, by and large, on the basis of consensus, represents the way to proceed. It may well follow that additional legislation will be necessary as the matter progresses. Therefore, I encourage the Government to continue <Col N="1445"/>consulting the Opposition fully, as it has done, and to apprise it of all the facts of which it becomes aware. It is very important that we continue to work through this issue on a cross-party basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending and for doing her best to answer the questions. No doubt she will get her thanks for taking on this crown of thorns in a different place or perhaps later in the year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and thank him for addressing this matter. I have raised it because a number of boards of management have told me recently that national and secondary schools and third level colleges are paying different charges for water in different parts of the country. In many cases, especially in certain areas, a huge burden is being placed on boards of management to raise the necessary funds to provide water at their schools.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State well knows, new sewerage charges will be introduced shortly and therefore the boards of management, irrespective of the types of schools they run, will have to pay both water and sewerage charges. The Government is now paving the way for public private partnerships and design, build and operate schemes. When these are in place, a capital charge and a running charge will be imposed on businesses and all non-domestic users, including the different types of schools. As the Minister of State knows, these schemes will operate on a contractual basis over 20 or 25 years or some other designated period.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how boards of management will put up with this in cases where a new sewerage scheme is put in place. The EU directive on the provision of sewerage facilities stipulates that a charge will have to be paid. Thus, the schools will have to pay both a water charge <Col N="1446"/>and a sewerage charge. The sewerage charge will be on a water-in water-out basis. Most schools are paying &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 annually at present and in some cases they are paying as much as &euro;20,000. In this case they will be faced with a double charge for sewerage services.</P>
    <P>As the Minister previously pointed out in the House, best practice for sewerage schemes is represented by the Ringsend scheme, which covers a significant part of Dublin and Kildare. Many schools are being serviced by the Ringsend development alone and they will be faced with capital charges and running costs for sewerage and water services. If they are faced with huge bills for water charges at present, which are likely to be paid on a metered basis soon, they will be faced with double amounts in terms of sewerage charges. Boards of management will be faced with a huge task to raise funds to pay for water and sewerage charges for years to come. They will become glorified fundraisers.</P>
    <P>Colleges and schools should not be treated as non-domestic users. The Department should provide an annual grant to the various local authorities to cover those costs. If this does not happen and the local authority needs to waive the charges in the cases of colleges and schools, this shortfall will have to be taken up by the business community, which would place a very unfair burden on it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State can tell me how the Department will proceed on this matter. Government policy is that all water and sewerage services must be paid for except by domestic users. Colleges and schools are in the dilemma of being placed in the non-domestic user category. Either they must pay or somebody else must pay. There should either be a special category for schools or they should be treated in the same way as domestic users.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue. The Government&rsquo;s water services pricing policy framework, which was adopted in 1998, requires the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from the users of those services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>The cost of water services provision is increasing hugely. This is not just as a result of general cost increases, but also reflects the considerable operational costs associated with meeting higher quality standards and the very significant investment in water services infrastructure now being made in the context of the national development plan. This investment is essential if we are to maintain and improve our environment and facilitate our rapid economic development. The scale of this is illustrated in the water services investment programme. In the period currently covered by this programme, from 2004 to 2006, more than 800 schemes are at <Col N="1447"/>different stages of development with a total investment value of &euro;5 billion. Almost 150 new projects worth &euro;556 million have been added to the rolling programme this year alone.</P>
    <P>The recovery of the costs of providing our water services must be viewed in this context. It is vitally important that local authorities have the resources to properly maintain and manage this important infrastructure. It is also very important that major users of water services do so responsibly. We are applying this approach in respect of non-domestic users of water services, while funding domestic use in an increasingly transparent way through the local government fund.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for each local authority to set the appropriate level of charges for non-domestic users of water services. At present local authority water services charges and the process used for calculating non-domestic costs vary hugely, as the Senator said. In accordance with Government policy, local authorities are moving to a more uniform system for determining and applying water services charges. In this regard, the policy framework provides only for the recovery of the actual cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector and that this be done by means of a meter-based volumetric charge.</P>
    <P>Universal metering of non-domestic users will ensure that charges directly reflect actual water usage with those placing the greatest demand on our water services paying the most. The policy is being progressively implemented in the period to 2006 and is in accordance with an appropriate application of the polluter pays principle and the requirements of Article 9 of the EU Water Framework Directive. This policy does not provide for the exemption, whether by recoupment or otherwise, of any non-domestic users, including those engaged in the provision of educational services, from the charging policy. Apart from specific considerations of water services policy, this type of exemption would represent a subsidy from local government funds towards a service the resourcing of which is not the responsibility of local authorities. This subsidy would reduce the funds available to local authorities to deal with services, including housing, industry and social services, for which they are directly responsible.</P>
    <P>I understand the point the Senator is making. However, I presume the confusion relates to the varying charges in different local authorities. As this becomes more standard, it will just represent one more cost for the boards of management, which get their funding from the Department of Education and Science. If such charges are regarded as standard legitimate costs, it is up to <Col N="1448"/>the boards of management of schools to make their pitch to the source of their funding. Schools are being treated as any other type of user. The Government&rsquo;s view is that the only exception should be domestic users.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank the Minister of State for his reply, there is no great comfort for any schools or their boards of management. I note the Minister of State did not refer to the question I asked about sewerage charges. While the Water Services Bill was introduced in this House a few months ago, I note it has been put on hold until after the local elections. I presume this is a ploy by the Government to delay paving the way for the privatisation or partial privatisation of water services. However, the sewerage charge will double charges and have a crippling effect when it comes into operation, as it must according to Government policy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is right that there will be charges for sewerage services in future. However, I do not believe they will be at the level the Senator mentioned. Government policy is that people must make a contribution towards the services they use. I am not sure whether the Water Services Bill has completed its passage through this House. It has not reached the D&aacute;il yet. Yesterday I mentioned that I am actively trying to have the Residential Tenancies Bill passed through the D&aacute;il. However, there is a long waiting list to have various Bills taken in the D&aacute;il where legislation seems to be gummed up.</P>
    <P>In future people will have to pay. A review of local government funding is ongoing and all these matters must be considered. Given the investment of &euro;5 billion over three years, we must get the message to the people and the best way is that the polluter pays and water is metered. The contributions to be made will be relatively small and will just represent one more bill that businesses and school boards of management will have to meet along with electricity, heating, insurance, etc. They will have to seek recompense for that from the Department of Education and Science. It would be much easier for Government to handle it in that way.</P>
    <P>As schools and pupils are supposed to be more environmentally conscious, it is no harm for them to recognise that the polluter pays principle and concern for the environment do not relate only to the rain forests. It is relevant to everyday living. I presume boards of management will submit this as a legitimate cost to the Department of Education and Science while minimising the level of charge to be applied. I am sure they will seek assistance to meet it.</P>
