    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, Senators called for a debate on Northern Ireland. Will the Leader agree to hold such a debate before the end of the session, irrespective of the outcome of talks tomorrow and the final deadline imposed by the Governments? My colleague, Senator Cummins, last week asked the Leader to provide clarity on the issue surrounding two persons who have yet to be convicted for the manslaughter or murder of Detective Garda McCabe. The persons in question, one of whom lives in South America while the other lives in Portugal, fled the country following the murder of Detective Garda McCabe in 1996. Does the Leader have information concerning these persons? Will an amnesty be granted to them in respect of the appalling crimes they committed with their colleagues in 1996 in Adare? Will she put such information on the record? Whatever deal is done &mdash; I hope one is done &mdash; it must involve no humiliation for Mrs. McCabe, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the institutions of the State, which were 82 years&rsquo; old yesterday. Many calls have been made from all sides for a debate on Northern Ireland and I am sure the Leader will do her best to facilitate one.</P>
      <P>I join the request issued over the weekend by the conference of the Teachers Union of Ireland that the Government establish a commission on discipline in the school system. This is an important issue. Teachers tell us that the issue of indiscipline in the school system is more important than the issue of pay. The cases raised at the TUI conference included bullying, sexual harassment and innuendo, spitting at teachers and destruction of personal property. The State has a responsibility to ensure that all teachers work in a disciplined environment and that adequate protection is given to boards of management to ensure the school environment is safe for teachers and pupils. We need to address this issue. A review of legislation has been called for in this area. I support the call by the TUI for a commission on discipline in our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also raised the issue of the proposed release of the killers of Detective Garda McCabe last week. This matter has sparked a major debate. I cannot remember the last time I received such a response to an issue. People are genuinely worried. The debate has been confused, despite the fact that I and others stated we were prepared to defend the position that the individuals concerned come under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement until such time as a clear Government decision was taken. We voted in favour of the Government&rsquo;s position when it emerged and that position should remain. Who is demanding the release of the killers of Detective Garda McCabe?</P><Col N="1807"/>
      <P>Over the weekend, I waited for the convicted killers to express their views on their dastardly act. I did not hear a word of apology or a single indication that they have turned their backs on military means for achieving their aims. I also raised the issue of the two persons who absconded. What is the position regarding them?</P>
      <P>We should have a debate on this issue. Although we sometimes argue that a debate could interfere with matters, that is not the case here. I spoke to many people from Northern Ireland and have been on the media in Northern Ireland in the past couple of days. It is important to hold a debate and place our views on record. At this stage nobody understands the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position. I am prepared to accept the position of the Taoiseach &mdash; and the T&aacute;naiste &mdash; if he comes to this House, after due consideration, and says that although he does not like it, he has considered all aspects and this is the only way to achieve peace in Ireland. That is what leadership is about, regardless of party affiliation. It is unacceptable for us not have a clear understanding from where these proposals emerged and the stage at which we decided to move back from the Good Friday Agreement. If we now extend the Agreement through negotiations about these people, will that be the end of it? Are there other groups who might kill somebody tomorrow and claim the same rights in six months?</P>
      <P>It is crucially important the proposals discussed are published. There should neither be humiliation nor triumphalism. In any kind of negotiation, everybody must back down to some extent. I agree with Senator Hayes that nobody in this situation should be humiliated. I do not have a problem with the concept of a photograph. However, I am strongly opposed to the concept of providing something which leads to more triumphalism and trouble down the road. That is not what this is about. When people sign off on an agreement, they walk away and stick with it. They should live with it. This is about much more than a photograph.</P>
      <P>A recent OECD report shows Irish teachers, in particular post-primary teachers, have delivered good results. In spite of what ignorant people have said in the past ten years regarding reading ability and standards, Ireland is close to the top of the pile. That is a tribute to our teachers and school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader said No. 3 would be taken between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. this evening. She then said the sos would be between 6.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. Can she clarify the matter?</P>
      <P>In comments made yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, spoke of the amount of litter fines issued in this country last year. Approximately 23,000 on-the-spot fines were issued, but figures indicate less than half were paid. This is grossly unacceptable and indicates a failure at local <Col N="1808"/>government level. Litter is an issue which has blighted this country for long enough. We have tried to educate and direct people into thinking of litter as a scourge. Who is at fault? Can the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister of State on this serious issue? We must understand whether it is local government or the Department which is failing in its duties.</P>
      <P>Depression is another taboo issue which is a source of concern. Irish and British experts warn that some doctors prescribe anti-depressants far too easily for mild depression. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK recommends that anti-depressants not be used for initial treatment. This is a sensitive issue. Can the Leader organise a debate and get guidance from the Minister for Health and Children with regard to what UK health authorities have stated? What standards do we have in Ireland with regard to prescriptions for initial treatment of depression?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes regarding a debate on Northern Ireland. Last week, I would have said we should not have a debate given the sensitivity of the issues involved and that we hoped there would be progress. Hopefully this will continue and there will be a full and final settlement in the next few days. However, we should have a debate in the context of clarity about a settlement being achieved or rejected. If the talks were to continue for another week, as they may, it might be more prudent to await clarity on the matter. The net question is whether Sinn F&eacute;in is prepared to accept democracy, put away its arms, eliminate paramilitarism, intimidation and punishment beatings and fully embrace the democratic mandate.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that the OECD report on education is worthy of debate. It is a matter of somewhat considerable satisfaction that standards in our secondary schools, in particular, are so high by international comparison. Credit is due in that regard to the teachers and all others involved. It confirms Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in terms of its educational system, a reputation which has contributed in no small way to the inward investment which has been so successful in driving forward the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague&rsquo;s call for a debate on Northern Ireland. A great deal of confusion exists as to where the Government stands on the issue of State security and law and order. This House needs to debate the issue of law and order to find out where the Government stands on it.</P>
      <P>I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the House to debate the issue of inadequate labelling of Irish beef. A recent survey by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland states that a significant amount of beef, chicken and pork labelled Irish is actually produced in South America. We need to address this issue. The Government needs to gets it act together and deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1809"/>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, call for a debate on Northern Ireland particularly given there may be a full and final settlement tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I welcome the OECD report. Ireland has the finest professionals in its teachers but, unfortunately, they are unable to do their job given the lack of discipline in our schools. Teachers are unable to fulfil the curriculum as a result of the conditions laid down. We need to revisit the issue of discipline in our schools. It is time this House held a debate on the OECD report and on the discipline problem. I ask the Leader to make time available for such a debate in the new year. Teachers would welcome such a debate, a matter made known at the TUI conference last Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like clarification from the Leader on why the House met at 2 p.m. today. I ask that question given the tradition of this House to meet at fairly regular times which, in turn, makes it so much easier to plan one&rsquo;s diary long term. Previously, the House has met at 10.30 a.m., 11 a.m., 12 noon, 2 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. Today, the House met at 2 p.m., a half hour earlier than usual. The Leader has complained with me to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which we are both members, that there is an unusual conjunction in that it and the Seanad tend to meet at the same time. That committee met at 2 p.m. today. I do not mean any discourtesy to the Leader, whose response I will read later with great interest, or to the Cathaoirleach, but when I have asked this question I will attend the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which is discussing the Geneva Convention, an important matter.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. Senator Dardis said matters are delicate. Matters are delicate but the principal participants are not all that delicate. I would not describe Ian Paisley or Danny Morrison as particularly delicate and I do not believe they would be affected by what is said in this House. It is about time we did say something on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris is no shrinking violet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I know; I never said I was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said the Senator was a shrinking violet either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the McCabe controversy, excellently ventilated in the House, over the past week a series of radio programmes was aired and polls were conducted. Over 80% of the people disagree with the release because this was plainly a criminal enterprise. At the time, the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in said these criminals were not theirs, they did not know them and they disowned them. They did so because this was a bank heist, robbery and murder and no less. Now, by insisting on these people&rsquo;s inclusion, the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in are associating themselves with thugs, murderers and thieves, joined in a criminal con<Col N="1810"/>spiracy against society. They should be reminded that until very recently the murder of a garda was a capital offence, the only remaining such offence in the State. That is how seriously we take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I said last week that I was afraid Paisley might talk himself out of the deal. It now looks as if he has done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a discussion on Northern Ireland issues and the Senator can raise those points then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a debate. Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I am glad you have decided that. That is excellent news. On your word I will keep&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I meant to say there could be a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There could be a discussion.</P>
      <P>I intend to continue pursuing the issue of the Gulfstream jet landing at Shannon Airport. I am grateful to the House, particularly the Leader, for co-operation and help on this matter. I will also raise it at the Joint Committee on Transport and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The more I look at it, the more I am convinced there is an arguable case that civilians, having been kidnapped, are trafficked through Shannon Airport for the purposes of torture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s request to the Leader for the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to attend the House to discuss the problem of litter. This would also give an opportunity to raise the issue of the Irish Business Against Litter organisation, which is very much in the media every six months. I draw the House&rsquo;s attention to the disgraceful and irresponsible manner in which this organisation recently chose to sensationalise the results of its selective and highly flawed survey on litter. The survey is not carried out in all towns or in comparable sites in each of the selected towns. However, every six months it is guaranteed headlines to scandalise and slander towns, such as my home town of Sligo, and Swords. In the most recent survey, Swords and Sligo have been deemed the dirtiest and second dirtiest towns, respectively. The survey is funded by State funding yet Irish Business Against Litter sub-contracts it to An Taisce. All Members know that organisation&rsquo;s record for being representative of the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on the OECD report on education. I acknowledge the comparatively high status of our 15 year <Col N="1811"/>old secondary school students in the report&rsquo;s results. However, one important area in which we are falling down is mathematics. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, must indicate to the House her plans for dealing with this and also the lack of discipline and bullying. It is important for the Minister to challenge these particular topics by implementing a recognisable policy for all involved.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to allow local authorities some discretion in spending funds given to them for specific projects? Members speak of traffic gridlock in Dublin, but we have it in the west too. As regards gridlock on the main approach road to Galway, the local authority gave the legitimate reason that it is forced to spend the money within a given period. If it is not spent by a certain date in December, it must be returned to the Exchequer. This is ridiculous. If we are serious about obtaining value for money, it is important for the Minister to give local authorities some discretion to allow them to spend their funds at the most appropriate time to enable works to continue in a reasonable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Brian Hayes in his call for a debate on discipline in schools. Under the leadership of the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Killeen, an expert group is meeting to examine bullying in the workforce. It might be a good idea for the House to consider its findings in the new year. I have come from a conference this morning at which a teacher spoke about 14 to 16 year olds. While it is wonderful to read in the OECD report how well Irish students are doing, there are teachers who are threatened by even the body language of people in that age group. It might be useful for the House to link school discipline with workplace bullying when it considers the expert group&rsquo;s report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on bullying in schools, on which the TUI held a conference at the weekend. I have heard appalling stories lately, including one from a primary school concerning a 12 year old pupil who was brought to a Garda station in Carlow by his mother because he was drunk. This 12 year old boasts openly about assaulting accident and emergency unit nurses during the summer. That is what we are dealing with. In a nearby area, two schools were almost set on fire. The system of suspension and expulsion of students seems to have been changed in recent years. The change caters for a minority given that the majority of students are very well behaved. We have procedures in the House to suspend any Member who misbehaves, but that, unfortunately, appears not to be the case in schools. A debate is called for as there is chaos in the system.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="1812"/>the coverage of certain news events by the State broadcaster, RTE. We found out at the weekend about the existence of an illegal distillery on the Cooley Peninsula. While I understand there are clear links between the distillery and republican dissidents, RTE failed to mention them in its broadcast. It appears that RTE is afraid to refer to links to republican elements in its coverage of events. We witnessed the difference of approach by RTE and the newspapers in the context of coverage of associates of a Member of the other House. It is a very worrying development. The State broadcaster should be free to comment in the way newspapers do. There is a grave imbalance currently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris commented on the murder of Garda McCabe. Has the Government position on Fine Gael&rsquo;s amendment No. 12 to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, in which we call for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a matter for the Leader. It is a matter for the Chair. We will deal with the amendment when we take the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>My contribution relates to the same subject as the contribution of Senator Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will discuss the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will leave amendment No. 12 until we take the Bill. Is it the Government&rsquo;s position on convictions for the manslaughter or murder of garda&iacute; that sentenced persons should not be eligible for early release?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, called for a debate on Northern Ireland. While everyone would welcome rather than object to a debate, it may be obviated by two matters. If there were clarity one way or another it would be very useful, but there is not. The other problem is a lack of time. If Members think this week&rsquo;s agenda is packed, they will consider the same to be true next week. It would, however, be helpful to hold a debate on Northern Ireland in the kind of atmosphere we have in the House. Watching the comings and goings of the various <i>dramatis personae</i>, particularly Dr. Paisley coming out of Downing Street last night, who would have thought he would quote Shakespeare? I knew he had all the biblical references but I would not have thought he had access to Shakespeare&rsquo;s words which were, for him, very appropriate. I was very taken by it. I imagine he plans these encounters and what he will say.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked if I had found out whether there would be an amnesty for the two IRA men who escaped, one to South Africa and the other to Portugal. The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; because when I spoke to the Taoiseach last week I occupied my time talking about the general issue and did not <Col N="1813"/>go into that matter. I will do so, however, and when I get that information I will put it on the record. The Senator said there should be no humiliation for anybody concerned, particularly for Mrs. McCabe, and we would all wish for that.</P>
      <P>The Senator raised the matter of the TUI and called for a commission on discipline. He referred also to second level teachers who are subject to bullying and sexual innuendo and said they are entitled to a safe environment in which to ply their profession. I agree with the Senator.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of the late Detective Garda McCabe and said that if, despite everything, a complete and comprehensive demilitarisation were effected he would be prepared to accept it, but asked about the position of the other groups and how they would be treated. He said there should be no triumphalism, regardless of the outcome.</P>
      <P>The Senator also mentioned the OECD report, about which we were all pleased. We hear the detractors and then we hear about a positive report like this, which I thought was excellent. It is a long overdue accolade to teachers. The foundations have to be laid at primary level, followed by second level and it is clear that the recognition by the OECD is very important for this country. We would wish to have time to debate that report but there will not be time to do so. If we can fit in a debate on Northern Ireland with the other circumstances of which I spoke, we will endeavour to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy asked about a matter referred to yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, namely the major default on litter fines. He asked that the Minister of State be invited to the House to debate that issue. He also called for a debate on depression. We will request such a debate. The Senator also asked about the time for the sos. I may have given the wrong time. There is only a half an hour sos from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. I may have said 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. earlier because I am used to announcing a sos of an hour. The debate following the sos begins at 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>That brings me to Senator Norris&rsquo;s question about the 2 p.m. start. It is not greatly discommoding to ask the House to sit half an hour earlier. I cannot understand how it would upset anybody&rsquo;s diary. Senator Norris&rsquo;s must be a very exciting diary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Slightly indigestible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The half hour sos means we will be free at 9 p.m. instead of 9.30 p.m., which is not too much to ask. We try to keep relatively decent hours here in the evening.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said we should await clarity on the Northern Ireland issue but that he would welcome a debate. He talked also about the standards of education expertise and said that to attract inward investment it was important we had people with the knowledge and a good grounding in education to fill those jobs.</P><Col N="1814"/>
      <P>Senator Bannon echoed the call for a debate on Northern Ireland, law and order and, particularly, agriculture. He asked that the Minister for Agriculture and Food be invited to the House to discuss the inadequate labelling of sourced Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde raised the issue of Northern Ireland and the OECD report. As a teacher, like myself, she was very pleased about that. She also picked up on what Senator Brian Hayes said about the discipline problem. Discipline was always a problem in schools. It might have taken different forms but there has always been indiscipline. How it is dealt with is another matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris stated 80% of people disagreed with the release of prisoners convicted of the manslaughter of Detective Garda McCabe and he continued to probe into what he alleges is the trafficking of prisoners through Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>Senator MacSharry also called on the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to come to the House for a debate. He referred to Irish Business Against Litter and I am always amazed that this organisation leads the news every time it issues a statement. I did not know until yesterday that it subcontracts the work to An Taisce, which is an amazing twist. I noted that both Swords and Sligo had a bad day.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to the OECD report on education and the issue of indiscipline. Mathematics was not a strong subject among the Irish students surveyed unlike languages and science. He also called on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce flexibility on local authority funding. Three-year funding envelopes are provided in various areas but such an envelope has not been introduced for local authority funding. Every October and November every street in Ireland is dug up because local authorities are trying to spend their money. One cannot travel a mile but the road is dug up. The Senator called for flexibility so that the funding could be expended in other areas earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>Senator Feeney made a good suggestion, which is that the commission on bullying, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, should address the indiscipline issue. That makes sense and I will put it to him.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne referred to indiscipline. He also raised what he sees as the imbalance between what is reported in newspapers and by RTE but they do not have a mandate to copy each other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator Cummins referred to Northern Ireland issues and asked what is the Government&rsquo;s position on the release of prisoners. He also stressed the Mrs. McCabe issue. I know she said she did not want our sympathy but there is huge sympathy for her because of her suffering. She will never be free because she will never have closure on her utter grief. The emphasis on her husband&rsquo;s death again must be extremely poignant and sad for her.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 1923 to 2003 (so far as unrepealed by this Act), the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts 1941 to 2003 (so far as unrepealed by this Act) and this Act shall be construed together as one and may be cited as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 1923 to 2004.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In this amendment we suggest the insertion of a general collective citation in the Bill. The Bill does not consolidate all Garda legislation and leaves a considerable amount still in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the intention behind the amendment but I cannot accept it. The Parliamentary Counsel advises that while a collective citation and construction section could be included in the Bill, the recommendation was that it should not be because it could give rise to conflicts in interpretation between definitions in this Bill and those under previous Acts. This Bill effectively supersedes all earlier legislation relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a provision of this type would lead to confusion.</P>

    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 10, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P><Col N="1818"/>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;Every order or regulation made by the Minister pursuant to this Act shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and, if a resolution annulling the regulation or order is passed within the next twenty-one days after the House has sat following such laying, the order or regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to provide the standard provision for accountability to the Oireachtas. A number of powers to make regulations do not involve the laying of regulations before the D&aacute;il or Seanad, for example, sections 106 and 107 regarding organisation and discipline of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and we feel this provision is necessary in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in favour of the amendment. Effectively, it is a blanket provision applying to all orders and regulations made by the Minister. Quite a number of such instruments are provided for in various sections of the Bill. I am advised it is not necessary in every case to lay such instruments before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The approach taken in the Bill is that in each case where the Government has decided that an order or regulation is to be made under the Bill, provision for the laying of the instrument in question before the Houses of the Oireachtas, either with or without a resolution procedure, is dealt with separately. Essentially there are some cases where the procedure should be invoked, for example, under section 108 governing the matter of police co-operation under the provisions of sections 45 to 49, inclusive, in the context of police co-operation and the movement of persons between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Equally there are other areas, for instance, in the case of section 106 and regulations made in respect of the management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and section 107 concerning the disciplinary regulations for the force, where the Government considers that it is not appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Why would it not be appropriate in the case of section 106?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are matters which are appropriate to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas and in other areas there are not. For example, it is not customary in respect of every minute detail to do with management of Garda members that everything should be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I will cite an example. Section 106(1)(<i>h</i>) deals with matters relating to:</P>
      <P LI="1">the payment of pensions, allowances and gratuities to members and their spouses, children and dependents, including&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(i) the conditions under which those pensions, allowances and gratuities are payable,</P><Col N="1819"/>
      <P LI="2">(ii) the rates and scales of payment, and</P>
      <P LI="2">(iii) the penalties for fraudulent conduct in relation to an application for a pension, allowance or gratuity;</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Other areas of regulation include paragraph (<i>p</i>), which states: &ldquo;the limitations, restrictions or conditions applicable to the exercise of the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s powers under <i>section 27</i>;&rdquo; and paragraph (<i>q</i>), which states: &ldquo;any other matter relating to the organisation, training, carrying out of duties, efficiency, management or administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.&rdquo; These provisions are so broad in their remit that it is considered that they are not all required to be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in the manner in which the Senator&rsquo;s amendment suggests. However, they are capable of review by the committees of either House or by the Houses themselves. The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, could discuss any regulation it considered inappropriate. I do not wish to make every aspect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its management subject to far-reaching legislative procedures in the manner envisaged in the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 11, line 12, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), after &ldquo;property&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the human rights of individuals within the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to provide that it would be a function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to protect the human rights of individuals as well as life and property. Section 7(4) already provides for protection of human rights. For that reason it would seem appropriate to provide this function here. Much of the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not relate to protecting life and property but to other fundamental rights such as bodily integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised that something as fundamental as the protection of human rights is not deemed sufficiently important to be the function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The issue was raised by the Human Rights Commission. Will the Minister explain why this provision has not been included in the Bill? I ask him to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1820"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently saw a television programme concerning the training of ordinary members of the force in the Garda Training College in Templemore. I was very encouraged to see that the issue of human rights is taught as a course subject. This is a recent development. Recruits to the force are being educated and trained in Templemore and must now be aware of the issue of human rights. It is important to focus on this function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Much of the adverse or positive comments about members of the force relate to a person&rsquo;s personal experience of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a member of the force. The issue of human rights should be enshrined in the legislation not only because the Human Rights Commission has asked for it, but primarily because it has now become a factor in the education of garda&iacute; and in their daily work on the streets. What is more important than protecting the human rights of the individual? It is the individual experience of dealing with members of the force that informs people&rsquo;s positive or negative attitudes towards members of the force. There is a solid, practical reason that this matter should be included and I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I also favour some strengthening of the reference to and the protection of human rights in the Bill, partly because of the work of the Patten commission which was suffused with this issue. When debating this section, we may be confusing three aspects. One of these is the function to protect human rights in the same way as protecting property and life. One might say that this is implicit in what the force does.</P>
      <P>The second aspect is that the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when dealing with a citizen, should have due regard for the requirements of standards of human rights. The third aspect is that a human rights culture should be inculcated in the Garda through its training programme. These aspects surface on a number of occasions in the Bill and I am not sure where the Minister wishes to place the emphasis. It seems to me declamatory at least and worth saying that the function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to protect the human rights of the citizen. I will deal with the other points as we reach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Human rights are not confined to civil and political liberties as they are sometimes understood to be. Their definition in the Human Rights Commission Act shows that they extend far beyond that. It is not the function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be an enforcement mechanism for the broad category of human rights. The functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are primarily policing functions. There are many forms of human rights which would, in accordance with the Human Rights Commission legislation, come under the aegis of the Human Rights Commission and these would not be in any sense the province of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P><Col N="1821"/>
      <P>I agree with the approach taken by the Parliamentary Counsel, set out in section 7(4), which states: &ldquo;In performing its functions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights.&rdquo; Those human rights are categorically included in all other functions. I draw Senators&rsquo; attention to the provisions set out in sections 15 and 16. Section 16(1) establishes a code of ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Section 16, subsections (2), (3) and (4) state:</P>
      <P LI="1">(2) Before establishing or amending a code of ethics, the Minister shall consult with the Garda Commissioner and may request the Commissioner to prepare and submit to the Minister a draft code of ethics.</P>
      <P LI="1">(3) If requested to prepare a draft code of ethics, the Garda Commissioner shall consult with the following about the content of the draft:</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the representative associations established under section 17 or this Act or section 13 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 1924;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the Equality Authority;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the Human Rights Commission;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) the Ombudsman Commission;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>e</i>) any other person or body appearing to the Garda Commissioner to have an interest in the matter.</P>
      <P LI="1">(4) In addition, in preparing a draft code of ethics, the Garda Commissioner shall have regard to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the standards, practices and procedures applicable to the conduct of police officers in other members states of the European Union, and</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) any recommendations of the Council of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Minister make that a mandatory code? It uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; but if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; were used, it would cover many of those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter can be addressed and I will consider it at a later stage. The Bill, as drafted, encapsulates the notion of human rights. Each member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be required to make before a peace commissioner a declaration under section 15, which includes the paragraph: &ldquo;I will faithfully discharge the duties of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with fairness, integrity, regard for human rights, diligence and impartiality, upholding the Constitution and the laws and according equal respect to all people...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The issue of human rights, therefore, features in the area of conduct and in the solemn declaration, which is effectively the oath of office. A <Col N="1822"/>third area is the requirement under section 7(4) that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an organisation, performs its functions having regard to the importance of upholding human rights. To go further, as the amendment suggests, and provide that it is a function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce or protect human rights places members of the Garda in the position that part of their function would be to stop all torts and embark on a broad mission equivalent to that of the Human Rights Commission. That may be a subtle point but I believe the functions of the Garda are properly stated as policing functions in general terms.</P>
      <P>The value of human rights is incorporated in sections 7(4), 15 and 16. It is better to do this than to make the pretence that it is one of the functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to protect the broad panoply of human rights. Non-criminal, non-policing matters comprehended in human rights are outside the province of a police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 7(4) states the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &ldquo;shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights&rdquo;. What is the purpose of the words &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo;? Will it be mandatory for a garda to have regard to human rights? Legislation frequently uses the term &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; for the purpose of requiring a person to take a matter on board. Does this terminology make it permissible for members of the Garda to take a different course of action or will it force them to have regard to human rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The protection of human rights should be a function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, rather than merely a consideration as is currently the case. Some time ago the Minister described advocates of human rights as part of the human rights industry. Will he expand on this comment? I hope it has nothing to do with his refusal to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am persuaded by the Minister&rsquo;s argument as regards the inclusion of the function of protecting human rights. What is important is how garda&iacute; behave towards citizens. It may be too difficult or restrictive to begin to try to define how garda&iacute; should behave in every circumstance. Could the matter be dealt with by the code of ethics and force orders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has distinguished between, on the one hand, the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Garda and, on the other, the fact that human rights in their entirety are not a matter for the Garda to police. I often get the impression during discussions on human rights that people have in mind criminals in the custody of the Garda. I am much more persuaded by the human rights of the victims of those in custody which have been seriously infringed. They should be part and parcel of the Garda&rsquo;s approach to the protection of human rights. Garda&iacute; should ensure that no stone is left unturned to bring people to justice and prosecute cases. This is an important consider<Col N="1823"/>ation. Obviously, in operating this principle it is important that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not overstep human rights requirements while dealing with those being brought to book or held in custody.</P>
      <P>We must maintain a balance on this issue. A body of opinion holds that, through our legislative process, we have tipped the balance too far in favour of criminals and further from the interests of victims. This legislation is about striking a balance and the phraseology in this context is fair and reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am persuaded by comments made by the Minister and, in particular, Senator Maurice Hayes, indicating that the key issue in this regard is behaviour and the need to show common respect for people in dealing with them. It is fair to point out that garda&iacute; must have regard to the importance of human rights in all their functions, as required under section 7(4).</P>
      <P>This is a relatively new area. New Garda recruits undergoing training are alerted to the issue of human rights in human rights modules of the course. A television programme I watched noted that while it is all very well informing recruits about human rights issues when they are in Templemore, human rights must be inculcated in members of the force when they move to the various Garda stations.</P>
      <P>As has been argued, the main issue is behaviour. By alerting members of the Garda to the importance of human rights in the code of conduct, the legislation will mark a significant improvement on current practice. Too often in the past, garda&iacute; have not been aware of human rights issues and common bad practice in one Garda station or area has come to be accepted. Through the legislation, we must indicate that at all time members of the Garda must observe the importance of human rights in carrying out their functions. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Walsh that the human rights of victims are often forgotten. Tilting the system in favour of criminals rather than victims is not on my agenda. While I accept that a balance must be reached on matters such as this and that human rights are covered in other sections, I tabled my amendment in the belief that the protection of human rights should be part of the functions of the Garda. The Minister made a reasoned point. I ask him to respond to the question I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator Walsh, the purpose of the amendment is to protect the human rights of the wider public, not to afford greater protection to the human rights of one section of it. Although the public wants a strong police force, it also wants it to be accountable and trustworthy. Legislation providing for the protection of human rights is one way of achieving this.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1824"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments were obviously inspired to some extent by the observations of the Human Rights Commission. The real question, a fairly narrow one, is whether protection of human rights should be one of the statutory functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. To make it such a function would require one to define the human rights one is talking about. One cannot, for example, require the Garda to protect human rights normally protected by civil law, which is also a function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. One cannot say that it is the function of the Garda to prevent people from slandering or defaming each other or carrying out myriad acts which would be unlawful in civil law but are none of the Garda&rsquo;s function in criminal law. By the same token and to take the example of defamation, the good name of a citizen must be protected under the terms of our Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. In carrying out their function, garda&iacute; must be mindful of the good name of a person with whom they are or could be dealing. The scheme of the Bill, as currently drafted, considers it a value to be integrated into their behaviour. They must take on board the human rights dimension of dealing with the public. That is qualitatively different to stating one of the remits of the force is to ensure people do not defame each other. That would imply the protection of human rights is an independent statutory function of the force.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is established under the terms of the Constitution and, as a matter of constitutional law, every organ of the State must uphold constitutional rights. It is implicit in every statute that constitutional values are at the heart of the functioning of every statutory body or creature of the Oireachtas. In addition to the constitutional function and obligations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there is also a statutory obligation. For the purposes of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an organ of the State. It is bound by the terms of that Act to discharge its functions in accordance with the convention and to interpret and apply all statutory instruments in a manner that is consistent with the convention.</P>
      <P>I have great respect for the observations on the Bill by the Human Rights Commission and a number of them have been taken on board. However, it would be a mistake to go further and say a protection of human rights as an independent head of activity is an independent function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is too wide a function to confer on a police force.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 11, lines 34 to 41 to delete subsection (6).</P>
      <P FLI="0">Subsection (6) undoes much of section 7 and renders it meaningless. It is an opt-out clause in terms of rights the section might create. Section 7 confers rights, such as how garda&iacute; should act in <Col N="1826"/>their dealings with the public. Why then provide an opt-out clause?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of subsection (6) is to protect the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from civil actions with regard to it having failed in carrying out its functions. When I was a student at University College, Dublin, at the time of Bloody Sunday, I saw a mob burn down the British Embassy. One could argue that the garda&iacute;, who had a cordon around the embassy, carried out their function to the best of their ability. However, we do not want a situation where the protection of life and property, as set out in section 7(10)(<i>b</i>), confers on an individual property owner the right to sue the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if his or her property is destroyed, notwithstanding the force&rsquo;s best efforts. It would create a new form of civil tort whereby the State would be liable for damages if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, culpably or not, failed in its duty or function to protect life and property. It would expose the State to potentially huge claims for damages. When stating the purposes of a body, one does not want to imply the creation of a statutory duty, the breach of which vests in others the rights to damages. If it is left to an individual judge&rsquo;s decision in an individual case to create a tort based on section 7, the consequence for the Exchequer could be very significant.</P>
      <P>If a garda breaches his duty in an unlawful or criminal manner, the State is liable. There are occasions where negligence by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has given rise to liability. I am trying to protect us from a litigious society in which everybody would sue the State because they could establish that the damage done to them could have been prevented had garda&iacute; discharged their function as set out in section 7(1) or section 7(3). It is wise when establishing functions for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make it clear whether we are making them actionable, <i>per se,</i> in the event of somebody suffering loss as a result of the non-performance of those functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s point is valid. If individual members of the force are individually liable and culpable for their actions, very few would want to join because of actions which could be taken against them. However, Senator Tuffy alluded to an important point, whereby liability is required if somebody makes a claim as a result of misbehaviour or inappropriate action by the force. The State has responsibility to discharge liability if an action is taken. Currently, there are cases where the State does not meet people half way, if at all. I am thinking of, for example, a raid on a house based on faulty information during which a person&rsquo;s front door is kicked in and a follow-up cost is transferred to the landlord or owner of the property. It is difficult, in such circumstances, for the person to obtain the type of financial recourse to which he or she is entitled. I am not suggesting individual members of the force should be liable; no one would be willing <Col N="1827"/>to join it if that were the case. The only remedy available to the many injured parties is to go to the courts, an option they would not take if there was a better mechanism through which they could gain payment for damage to their house or other property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>People whose houses are damaged are entitled to be recompensed by the State. However, the appropriate place from which such recompense should be sought is the complaints mechanism. I would be worried if this section were not included. We are all aware of the hay which organised crime could make of an investigation if at every stage a garda could be brought to court and asked to justify his or her actions. Such a situation would make policing impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The point of the section is to require the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to perform particular functions in a particular way. Surely one way of ensuring it follows the provisions is to provide that garda&iacute; could incur liability. I wonder if the Minister is taking away the force of the section in removing such liability.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes mentioned that people have recourse through the complaints procedure. A provision which would allow people to go to court if all other options did not work out would provide a confidence in the system which a complaints structure alone would not provide. Most people will try the complaints structure first for many reasons such as cost and risk. People will have confidence in an overall system which also allows them to take the matter to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister said, we have become a very litigious society. In that regard, any loopholes identified will be exploited. Senator Brian Hayes and others have spoken of innocent victims who get caught up in situations which give rise to their seeking recompense for damages. However, existing legislation provides them with such rights. The more we inhibit the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the greater will be our difficulty in tackling crime.</P>
      <P>One has only to read Paul Williams&rsquo;s book or to look at programmes on television to learn of the serious criminals committing heinous crimes who are not being convicted because the evidential barrier cannot be achieved to prosecute them successfully. The more obstacles we put in the way of the law the greater will be our difficulty. I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes that there are other mechanisms for dealing with such complaints. I am coming at this legislation from the point of view of enabling garda&iacute; to be more effective in the fight against crime while at the same time, as provided for, having total regard for human rights. We can go overboard and create obstacles or excuses as to why people are not being successfully prosecuted. The removal of subsection (6) would dilute the effect of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1828"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points made by Senators Maurice Hayes and Walsh. The removal of subsection (6) would mean that a court could suggest it was deliberately removed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and that the protection afforded by it was expressly removed from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It would not simply be a drafting error. A court could suggest that the Minister on introducing the Bill proposed that the law should have the effect provided in section 7(6) but was later persuaded by the Houses of the Oireachtas to remove that provision. The court could then take as an interpretative guide the legislative history as to what exactly was meant by the remainder of the section. That would be a serious matter.</P>
      <P>Section 7(6) states: &ldquo;This section is not to be taken to confer on any person a right in law that he or she would not otherwise have...&rdquo;. That is a crucial point. If a garda smashes his or her way into a person&rsquo;s house and uses excessive force to arrest him or her, he or she then commits the tort of trespass to the property and to the person. If a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commits a crime or a civil wrong in the exercise of his or her duty, there are, as a matter of criminal law, penalties and remedies available to deal with such wrongs.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) provides that section 7 does not confer on any person a right in law that he or she would not otherwise have to require garda&iacute; to carry out a function or to provide a service referred to in the section or to desist from any such action. That, too, is important. If that provision were not included, a person could maintain his or her property is constantly being vandalised and could go to the Circuit Court or High Court to obtain an injunction requiring a garda to be stationed outside the property to protect him or her. Such a provision would be beloved of some but it would also mean the courts would decide everything and the Minister and Commissioner would be told by the courts how they are to conduct policing in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The same applies to seeking damages. The limitation on damages applies only in cases where a person would not have a claim for damages but for this section. If a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fails to perform his or her function as envisaged by this section, that does not of itself give rise to a separate claim for damages on behalf of an aggrieved or dissatisfied person who claims he or she has suffered loss as a consequence. The more I think about it, the more essential it is that this subsection be included and the more mistaken it would be to remove it. Its removal would turn the section into a charter for litigation against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, both injunctive legislation requiring it to do things and compensatory litigation demanding money on the basis of things it had not done.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (3), line 7, after &ldquo;In&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;deciding whether to institute or in&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 8 is a drafting amendment which seeks caution in terms of the interpretation of the wording currently used. The subsection, as drafted, presumes that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be instituting the proceedings as opposed to making a decision on whether to institute proceedings. The garda in question should, in both cases, comply with the direction referred to in the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision reflects the current position in this area. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a matter of practice no longer institutes proceedings in its own name as common informers. Though that is the current position it used not to be so. The prosecutions commenced by it are generally founded on a direction or authorisation of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is important to note that section 8 introduces new rules governing the prosecution of offences by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It will not be possible for it to decide to institute a prosecution, except in respect of the most basic offences, and then only where clear guidelines exist from the Director of Public Prosecutions. Accordingly, the proposed additional words in the amendment are not necessary. However, I will examine it again for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy is concerned with whether a prosecution should be commenced in the first place. Logically that question precedes the institution of proceedings, for example, if the Director of Public Prosecutions made a general direction that prosecutions shall be brought in particular cases. However, the effect of the amendment could be that if they are not brought this could constitute a breach of Garda duty. Take the scenario where the Director of Public Prosecutions said that anyone found in particular circumstances doing a particular thing is to be prosecuted. If a garda then decides, on his or her initiative, not to prosecute in a particular case, it may be argued that the subsection has no application, as it merely says that in instituting or conducting a prosecution, the person should comply with the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions. In such a case, the garda involved could say that he or she did not institute or conduct a prosecution and, therefore, subsection (3) has no effect. I will examine this amendment between now and Report Stage. I want to think through carefully whether garda&iacute; would not be obliged to comply with a direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions in cases where they decided not to prosecute.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s comments. Amendment No. 9 seeks to clarify whether the Director of Public Prosecutions is entitled to prohibit members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from instituting certain types of proceedings at all or without specific reference from the director. Amendment No. 10 provides that proceedings shall not be invalid where the section has been ignored. It would be wrong for proceedings to go ahead until the Director of Public Prosecutions gave a specific direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from the amendments tabled by Senator Tuffy and the Minister&rsquo;s undertaking to examine them prior to Report Stage, a related issue is when the Director of Public Prosecutions decides not to take a case, based on the file submitted. Under the current system, the director is not obliged to give an explanation as to why this happens. In some cases this has led to frustration within the Garda. I am not sure how this circle can be squared and it may not be possible to do so. However, such action can impinge on Garda morale. Garda&iacute; may have invested much time in pursuing a case where they felt comfortable the evidence was sufficient to back it up in court. However, it is then not prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions for good reasons he or she may have. As there is no liaison on this, it can lead to an adverse effect on morale within the force. Can this issue be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are good grounds that reasons for not prosecuting cases are not given. For example, the Garda could believe that an individual, making an allegation of, say, assault, rape or robbery, is being untruthful. The Garda could argue that, in the past, the individual had a reputation for fantasising. A reporter could then ask the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions why a case was not brought and be informed that the individual concerned was a shifty character and an unreliable witness. To publicly state so would be a great injustice to that person. I accept this is a basic and unlikely example. However, the Director of Public Prosecutions often has private reasons for not prosecuting and, if put into the public domain, these could be injurious to the injured party or someone closely associated with him or her.</P><Col N="1831"/>
      <P>This is not an easy aspect for the Director of Public Prosecutions to deal with. The director must also deal with the proposition that if reasons are given in some cases, as they are inoffensive to the parties concerned, and not in others, the natural inference will be that something was wrong with the injured party. It is not easy to push this through.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh raised the issue of where investigating garda&iacute;, having put much effort into a case, put together a file they consider will lead to a successful prosecution, only to find, to their dismay, that the Director of Public Prosecutions declines to proceed and offers no real reason for such a decision. Based on my experience at various levels in the prosecution process, and as an officeholder, in such cases the director will normally explain the basis of the conclusion reached. There are few cases where a one line answer is given to the Garda, with no explanation offered if asked. We are dealing with human blood and flesh in these decisions. If a team of detectives has made a great effort in putting together a case against an individual and convinced itself it has done the needful, it is disquieting and disheartening if someone sitting in an office 100 miles away declines to proceed. However, this is the whole point of having an Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Otherwise, prosecutions would be brought by the people at the coalface without the intervention of the director.</P>
      <P>I understand what Senator Jim Walsh is driving at. I am aware from my own experience that what he says has been true on occasion. Teams of detectives and individual prosecuting officers have felt greatly deflated when projects have not been accepted for prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The obverse of the coin is that if we did not have an outside authority to decide whether a case had made the grade, there would be no Director of Public Prosecutions and no outside view. I temper my remarks with my experience, which has been that the Director of Public Prosecutions works closely, but not improperly closely, with investigating teams and, generally speaking, offers advice and guidance to them. I would be very surprised if the director did not offer a reason for his or her decisions, except in the most extraordinary circumstances. To offer an entirely theoretical explanation, it might have been the case that the director had come to the conclusion he or she could not trust what he or she was being told. The director might not be inclined to say that to the garda&iacute; in question. If that happened, it would be on a very rare occasion.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, before section 9, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;9.&mdash;The Commissioner and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall be accountable to a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Board, which shall consist of a chairperson and members appointed in a manner determined by regulations made by the Minister, and the Board shall have the function of giving general direction and control to the Commissioner and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and shall perform such other functions as are specified in regulations made by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to provide a new section 9 and is based on the Labour Party policy which seeks the establishment of a body to oversee the operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. While I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s legislation and recognise that he has many ideas in common with the Labour Party, such as the need for an ombudsman, I wonder if he considered the idea set out in this amendment. The body would be similar to the one in place in Northern Ireland and this is the Bill into which measures to provide for it should be inserted. Is the Minister consider<Col N="1833"/>ing introducing such a body in future or is he totally against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Tuffy. As my earlier comments indicated, I am very much in favour of providing greater empowerment to the Garda and of the reasonable removal of some of the inhibitions which may constitute obstacles to its effectiveness. If such provisions were made, there would be a concurrent need to provide for strong accountability. I am persuaded to a greater extent by the amendment Senator Cummins will move later on providing for accountability at local level. It would be much more effective to provide for accountability in that way rather than on a national basis. The best approach is to provide for co-operation between the Garda and local public representatives to create a dynamic for the accountability which is essential to a modern, effective police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am against the idea of an independent police authority in Ireland. It is a proposal to which the Labour Party is deeply attached. On Second Stage on 11 March this year, I set out in general terms the reasons for my objection. There would not be much point in rehearsing everything I said on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Unlike the PSNI, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not a regional constabulary established within a sovereign state. It is the national police force of Ireland and has the functions the British Government is providing in its creation of an FBI for Britain. The Garda is also our MI5 and MI6. With the enactment of this statute, the Garda will be a force in respect of which there will be significant accountability measures, not least of which shall be the requirement for the Commissioner to come to the House and be accountable to committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts, for the manner in which he or she discharges his or her functions. The provision constitutes a significant, new layer of accountability on top of what already exists.</P>
      <P>The model used in Northern Ireland and among regional English constabularies is quite political. Places on the police board in Northern Ireland are, in part, handed out on d&rsquo;Honte principles to political parties. We must ask if we want a police authority which is broadly political in complexion. Is it a good idea to have nominees of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il on the police board? Is that something people really want? It is by no means self-evident to me that such a board would represent an improvement. The Government has the right to hire and fire the Garda Commissioner and his deputies, which creates a very immediate accountability mechanism. Under certain circumstances, the sovereign Government of this independent State can tell the Commissioner his or her services are no longer required. While there are legal and stronger limitations under the Bill concerning the exercise of that power, it makes it very clear that in the last analysis it is the Govern<Col N="1834"/>ment of the people of Ireland which calls the shots in the context of policing in the State.</P>
      <P>Under the 1924 Act, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the person who is responsible politically to the D&aacute;il for the execution of the police function in the State. What would happen if the police body was like, as I said before, the RTE authority, indifferent in the way it carried out its work, incapable of bringing about reform and in place for five years? Who would take the rap? Sometimes, some of us in the Houses, whether in Opposition or Government, become frustrated by media treatment of particular issues. It makes one want to lift the phone. Whatever accountability one has, one must admit that the RTE authority has very little influence over how fairly or unfairly one is treated. By contrast, it has to be said that the holder of my office is brought before the Houses, answers questions, is summoned before committees and, ultimately, can face a motion of no confidence in the Houses of the Oireachtas and must defend his or her decisions on policing. That is a better degree of accountability than is to be found with independent police board models put in place.</P>
      <P>I am not saying the matter is beyond argument but the Northern Ireland model is not something that attracts me. It is a politicised model, for obvious reasons, that was necessary to bring into the whole policing function democratically elected politicians and to put party representatives onto the policing board. I do not believe management of policing in Ireland requires a cross-party consensus as to how it is done or explicit recognition of party political issues in the composition of a board.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Labour Party has taken the view that what is good for Northern Ireland is good for the Republic and that the Patten report should be transposed lock, stock and barrel south of the Border, but we are dealing with something different here. We are dealing with a national police force, an intelligence service, a security service and a society in which it is not necessary for Fine Gael and Labour Party people to be involved in the policing function when Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats are in office. Otherwise, society&rsquo;s support for the police will split in two.</P>
      <P>I note, and it has been evident here today, that members of the Opposition bent over backwards in asserting their total support for the policing function, which is always a feature of Irish politics. They always tell the poor Minister of the day that he or she is not being sufficiently supportive of the police service in one shape or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment includes a reference to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; in that the Minister would determine the manner in which the members were appointed to the board. It provides also that the board shall perform such other functions as are specified in regulations made by the Minister. Contrary to what the Minister said, the board envisaged by this amendment would not be a political body in the way he outlined. The idea behind it is for the public to have a broader input into the operation and direction of the Garda and so on. The Minister is a member of a political party and most people in society have some interest in politics. One could say that anybody has a particular political philosophy or whatever but that is not the purpose of the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned earlier the constitutional role of the Garda. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is run in a way that is accountable to everybody and in which everybody can have confidence. There should be a feeling of democratic accountability, the type of accountability the Minister is trying to provide in terms of his provisions on liaison between local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no disagreement about the need for accountability. Members on all sides of the House agree with that principle. The difference arises as to the way that should be exercised. The Bill goes a long way to doing what the amendment proposes.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy also made the point about democratic accountability. The ultimate place for democratic accountability is within the Parliament. The Minister is responsible to the Parliament and, therefore, there is a direct line of accountability which is a stronger accountability than ever would be the case if a body of this nature was established, which in some ways would be another independent quango operating in isolation.</P>
      <P>Section 21 states that the Garda Commissioner may have regard to the most recent report of each joint policing committee. The policing committees, therefore, which will have local democratic input, must be taken into account in terms of the Garda Commissioner preparing the report. Section 21 also states that the Minister shall cause a copy of the policing plan to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and section 22 states that following the approval of the Government, the Minister may issue to the Garda Commissioner written directives concerning any <Col N="1836"/>matter relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That is the appropriate place where the exercise of the function should be applied rather than through the type of body Senator Tuffy recommends. The Bill goes quite some way to providing a type of non-governmental control or input into policing, which has been absent until now. From that point of view, the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 15, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;13.&mdash;The Commissioner, in consultation with the Minister shall establish guidelines and structures so as to encourage members of police forces outside the jurisdiction to&mdash;</P>

      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I am aware measures are in place to allow members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be seconded into the Garda and <i>vice versa</i> but that type of approach needs to be expanded to allow garda&iacute; avail of the experience and expertise of members of other forces not only for secondment arrangements, but also for permanent membership. Garda&iacute; would benefit from a measure such as this and I ask the Minister to consider it favourably.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1837"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As my colleague rightly said, there was an agreement between the British and Irish Governments to allow members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na join the new PSNI  and a substantial number of existing and new officers have been recruited from this jurisdiction to the new PSNI. That is welcome but Senator Cummins made a useful point on this matter. On the issue of race relations, for instance, it could be argued &mdash; rightly, in my view &mdash; that much experience could be gained by allowing, either by secondment or direct recruitment, members of police forces in major cities like London, Manchester or Bradford, which has had to deal with the issue of race relations 20 years before we had to deal with it in this jurisdiction, join the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The same argument could be made in regard to, for example, drug trafficking. We could learn much from what Dutch police officers have learned over a significant period of time.</P>
      <P>Given the positive co-operation, good intelligence gathering and sharing of surveillance and intelligence information at EU level, the Garda could gain significantly by recruiting members of forces in other EU jurisdictions or by taking them on secondment. This issue should be addressed. A modern police force requires from time to time the ability to take on people with new ideas and a great deal could be learned from the experiences of police forces in other jurisdictions. Ireland is only now going through many of the problems experienced in large cities and countries over the past 20 years. A great deal could be learned from such recruitment. The amendment may not be useful or acceptable but the proposal needs to be expounded. If the Minister can address the issue through another means, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I would go some way towards supporting the amendment but whether members of other police forces should become full members of the Garda is another matter. Secondment should be welcomed. The Army has a tradition of participating in command and staff courses in other jurisdictions such as the US and the UK and that has resulted in enhanced expertise and performance. The Garda has similar arrangements with other police forces and co-operation is exercised through international agencies such as Interpol. I question whether members of other forces should become full members of the Garda.</P>
      <P>The issue relating to members of the PSNI is dealt with in the Third Schedule, which states a programme shall be introduced to facilitate members of the police force of Northern Ireland being placed in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and <i>vice versa</i>. However, it is questionable whether the appointment of members of other police forces should be formalised in law. Nevertheless, the thrust of the argument is reasonable and, perhaps, the Minister will consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have proceeded on the basis that there is international service and service in Northern Ireland and members of the <Col N="1838"/>PSNI will be taken in but the possibility of taking in officers from other forces has not been considered. A number of issues need to be considered if we go down that road. Will members of other forces be taken in on different terms from members of the PSNI? Could this be accomplished by the Minister making orders to extend the PSNI regime to other police forces? I would have to think about this proposition carefully.</P>
      <P>There are also industrial relations issues. I would not like, without consultation, to impose upon the Garda representative associations the notion that plum jobs could suddenly disappear from under them if people come in from overseas forces. It might make sense to import members of other forces who are from specific ethnic backgrounds or who have expertise in certain areas by way of secondment. I must think about this issue carefully before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Many members of the PSNI would probably make good garda&iacute; but we should be mindful of our recent history. Members of the security forces in Northern Ireland, including the PSNI, engaged in activities that were outside the law and involved loyalist paramilitaries. The Minister must take account of this issue in establishing the new structures. I have alluded to this issue in the past. The State also needs to be protected. While the peace process is in place, we should not be totally forgetful of what happened in the recent past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 15, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;14.&mdash;(1) In making provision for any Garda recruitment process, the Commissioner shall set a target percentage of the minimum level of recruits who shall be ordinarily resident in an area designated as a RAPID area.</P>
      <P LI="1">(2) In recruiting members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Commissioner shall ensure that at least the minimum target level set under <i>subsection (1)</i> is achieved.</P>
      <P LI="1">(3) In the Annual Report, the Commissioner shall provide details of the numbers recruited pursuant to <i>subsection (2)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I feel strongly about this issue and I hope to persuade the Minister to do something about it between Committee and Report Stages. The unconventional amendment I have tabled may be tweaked or changed but I ask the Minister to subscribe to the general principle underpinning it. I represent a large swathe of west Dublin in which there is an attitude problem between the community and the police and <i>vice versa</i> and something must be done about it. The amendment attempts to do so.</P>
      <P>I refer to the issue of recruitment. The Minister may have noticed a series of parliamentary questions tabled in the other House on my behalf by Deputy Richard Bruton. I was trying to find out the number of Garda recruits from RAPID areas. While one may hate the name of the scheme, areas are designated as disadvantaged under it and their problems are highlighted through a range of economic and social factors. I suspect few recruits come from these areas. While the situation in Northern Ireland is totally different, a substantial cohort of people, for whatever reason, have a bad attitude to the police and <i>vice versa</i>. The only way to get to the root of this problem and to prevent other political parties with vigilante tendencies &mdash; I refer the Minister to his remarks prior to the local elections &mdash; is to do something specific.</P>
      <P>The Garda should recruit young men and women from disadvantaged backgrounds. I am not a great believer in setting percentage targets but the legislation should provide for a specific policy under which the Garda Commissioner and his colleagues recruit young men and women from communities in which there is a disengagement with the police. The best way to prevent vigilantism and to improve attitudes among police and such communities is to recruit young people from them. The Patten report referred to the disengagement between the Roman Catholic community and the RUC and it made a proposal to radically increase the number of young recruits from that community.</P>
      <P>The same scenario does not apply in this jurisdiction but it is analogous. A deliberate policy of recruitment of young men and women from disadvantaged communities should be intro<Col N="1840"/>duced. It may not be appropriate to provide for such a policy in the legislation and the Minister has not said much on recruitment in the Bill. I ask him to seriously examine this issue.</P>
      <P>I am flabbergasted by some of the attitudes to garda&iacute; in parts of west Dublin. Some people have an ignorant attitude, try to provoke garda&iacute; and argue that they do not have a legitimate function. The best way to change this attitude is to generate young recruits from these communities. I passionately believe in this. I urge the Minister to look at the RAPID model which has created designated communities because of social deprivation. We know these communities and must do something significant for them. I have put the case and am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s reply. As a matter of principle, we need to include a provision in the Bill with regard to recruiting young people from this kind of background and community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the idea behind this amendment, although it is too particular in identifying an area. I support the idea that recruitment should be as broad as possible and that the force should be representative. Recently the Minister proposed an amendment with regard to the recruitment age, which I welcome. He could have gone even further. I do not see why people cannot apply at an even later age. It would be a good idea to have more people from different or disadvantaged communities in the force.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes mentioned the attitude of people to garda&iacute;. There is a RAPID area in my constituency also, but the main attitude there is that there should be more garda&iacute; and that they should have more resources. Much good work is done. For example, in my constituency garda&iacute; and the community try to work together on different issues through a safety forum, which is positive. It would be good for communities if some of their members were recruited by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am sure there are already some, but anything that can be done to improve the numbers would be beneficial.</P>
      <P>This is a good opportunity to mention Garda resources. The Minister is aware of a case reported recently in the newspapers of a young Garda who was killed four years ago in an accident involving his Garda car. It was involved in a car chase and ran into an electricity pole. The second garda in the car was from Lucan. More needs to be done with regard to providing garda&iacute; with better equipment to do their jobs. What is the Minister doing in that regard? This is particularly important when we expect young garda&iacute; to look after people&rsquo;s lives. It is unsatisfactory that Garda equipment often does not provide them with the best security and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some sympathy for the sentiments expressed by Senator Brian Hayes. Whether this is the mechanism to achieve his proposal, it is important that all social strata are represented within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This <Col N="1841"/>enhances the activity and acceptability of the force, which is important.</P>
      <P>There may be a better way of achieving this aim without referring specifically to RAPID, under which only some areas receive a designation. However, if young people could be recruited from certain areas in all towns, even though they might not serve in the locality the fact they were garda&iacute; would create an acceptance in the community that one of their own had become a garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Community acceptance is important to functioning effectively. Perhaps the Garda community liaison officer system, which does much valuable work, could be a mechanism for targeting and encouraging young people in such areas to become involved. While I am unsure that this should become part of the Bill, it is desirable as a <i>modus operandi.</i></P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make may be a little irrelevant to the Bill, but it is a factor in getting community support. In the past, garda&iacute; tended to live in the local villages and towns, be it Ballycullane, Duncannon, Campile, New Ross or whatever. Now, however, garda&iacute; commute from Waterford to work in New Ross. They are not known and do not know the people. There is a price to be paid for this with regard to effective policing. There may be industrial relations difficulties with regard to this, but to function well, a garda should live in the area for which he has responsibility. Even if he is only out for a pint at night, he will garner information which may assist him. Living miles away is like a politician who hopes to be elected for a constituency living ten, 15 or 25 miles away from it. Such a politician would not be as effective nor would his or her seat be as safe. This area should be examined. Such matters, which may be peripheral to the Bill, are important for getting community support and effective policing, which is what the Bill is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe we are pushing an open door with the Minister because I heard him recently talking about what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be and how inclusive it should be, etc. Therefore, I hope he takes these remarks on board.</P>
      <P>The amendment may be too confining by mentioning only RAPID areas. There are many disadvantaged areas in my city that are not included under RAPID. While we may be a little too specific, the message we want to get across is that a large section of Garda recruits should come from areas deemed disadvantaged. &ldquo;Disadvantaged&rdquo; is not a word I like to use but it is a fact of life with regard to some areas of Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The idea of the amendment is similar to the argument made in the Patten report in Northern Ireland in respect of increasing the number of Roman Catholics in the police force in order to <Col N="1842"/>have representatives from all sections of the community. I accept the point made by Senator Jim Walsh that having a garda in an area, or commissioning a garda from an area, gives some respect to the position. It would get people talking and improve respect for the police force in many areas.</P>
      <P>It is sad that in many areas respect for garda&iacute; has gone. Anything we can do to raise the profile of garda&iacute; and improve their significance in such areas is of paramount importance and will help restore a sense of community to the 99% of law-abiding people in estates. It is usually the 1% who give a bad name to many of these areas and recruiting garda&iacute; from such areas would help the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective of the amendment is good, but it is stating the obvious to remark that garda&iacute; must derive from the community they serve. Any police force must be formed in this manner if it is to be effective. The point has been conceded with regard to RAPID areas. I would not favour restriction to such areas as it is too narrow a base. In any event as the RAPID programme will eventually be replaced,  the provision would become redundant.</P>
      <P>I am not keen on the use of target percentages. The commissioner should have a general objective which could be spelled out, rather than specifying targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There are obvious advantages to the point made regarding local policing and the need for garda&iacute; to be located in their working area. Such garda&iacute; would have intelligence on the local gurriers. Unfortunately, modern society has moved to the point where garda&iacute; must almost constitute a rapid response force. They must be mobile and cannot be located in every village in the country as they were in the past. Modern living has moved the force into a different mode of operation and this may be removing garda&iacute; from the community. Something can be done to reduce the impact of that development but it will not eliminate it completely. I suspect the target percentage and the reference to RAPID might need to be changed but the general objective is a reasonable one that should be taken on board by legislation or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.</P>
      <P>Although the underlying idea is a good one, I do not consider it would be practical for the Commissioner to set requirements as to the areas from where recruits would come. Would recruits also need to be drawn from various immigrant groups now that there are so many people from abroad living and working here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Minister has advocated, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1843"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt that will be the case in time in regard to recruits taken on by the Civil Service Commission. The standard is very high, which I am sure will continue to be the case. There is no barrier to anyone&rsquo;s application, provided he or she fulfils the requirements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is a matter for people who come from RAPID or CL&Aacute;R areas to apply.</P>
      <P>I live in a rural Leader area which is fortunate to have two members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resident. This is most helpful and has made this one of the safest areas of the country. The garda&iacute; are part of the community and do not erect barriers between themselves and others. They socialise and mix with everybody in the area and they know what is happening there, which works very well.</P>
      <P>Roscommon town, which has a Garda headquarters, is reputed to be one of the safest small towns in the country. It has been a great benefit to the town to have so many members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na based there.</P>
      <P>The proposal contained in the amendment is worthwhile and I am sure the Minister will take it into consideration, but it may not be practical to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I sympathise with the underlying sentiment in the amendment, which is that if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in the words of its first Commissioner, Michael Staines, is to govern effectively with the consent of the people based on the people&rsquo;s respect, it must be seen to be a force which is drawn from the people and representative of the people as a whole. There cannot be an underclass in society who feel it is beneath the recruitment criteria for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is not to say that people of bad character may not exclude themselves.</P>
      <P>However, in terms of socio-economic groupings, one cannot have a situation where there are people in society who feel themselves to be beneath the recruitment catchment area of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That is a very important issue and it is the reason for the particular reference to the RAPID programme. I accept that we must ensure that every section of our community, the haves and the have-nots, equally identify with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>The second point is the question of geographical spread. It is the case, and one would need to be Einstein to solve it, that one cannot require members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to live in the house beside the station or wherever else, as a condition of service in the force, nor can one go back to the days of John McGahern where the sergeant and garda&iacute; were all required to live in an RIC barracks and, therefore, be physically located at all times within their community. We clearly live in a different world in which people who have chosen a career in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na live in places where family, economic circum<Col N="1844"/>stances and opportunity dictate. One cannot insist that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must live close to their station, if only for the reason that they are liable to be shifted from A to B and the cost of moving house would be quite significant in any of these circumstances.</P>
      <P>What are we to do about all of that? In section 20, the Bill provides for a three-year strategy statement to be prepared by the Commissioner. If the Commissioner does not voluntarily draw up recruitment criteria, and I have every confidence he or she would, the Minister of the day would, in consultation with the Commissioner under section 20, set as one of the strategic objectives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the force should be recruited in a way which would make it broadly representative of Irish society.</P>
      <P>I accept that it is possibly a little disorderly to look forward to the next section which relates to a Garda reserve, which Members may wish to discuss, but in this context it is important to say that when I put forward that idea I was very conscious that critics would immediately say, &ldquo; Aha, what is going on here is he will not pay for the recruitment of additional Garda but he will produce yellow pack reservists to stanch the wound so he can say the numbers are such and such and that everything is okay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At a policy level, in conjunction with the Government, I have concentrated on getting on with our commitments to expand the size of the Garda force. I will not repeat at too great length what has happened. Roughly speaking, the size of the force has gone from 10,800 in 1987 to 12,200 last month. The second phase of what was promised is that it would expand by another 2,000. Over the next three years, enhanced recruitment at the rate of 1,100 members per year is planned so that, allowing for predicted retirements, the total number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will rise fairly rapidly to over 14,000 members. Taking those in training and those fully attested into account will lead to a total of more than 14,000 garda&iacute; as early as 2006. The training process in Ireland, of which Members of the House are aware, is slightly longer than in other states. It is two years here while in some areas in Britain, for instance, it is six months. The core strength of the force, fully trained and attested, will reach 14,000 approximately 18 months after that.</P>
      <P>With an expanding population in Ireland and increased urbanisation, that rapid expansion of the force should have the effect of providing some of the resources that are needed for the increasingly complex role of the police force. If it were not to happen, I have no doubt looking at the pattern of events I have seen in the two and a half years I have been Minister, there would inevitably be pressure on the Commissioner, who now handles the <i>de facto</i> day-to-day deployment of the force, to take people away from rural communities &mdash; to which Senator Leyden referred &mdash; and to move them to the new conurbations where villages have been transformed in the course of <Col N="1845"/>two or three years into sizeable towns which still have a Garda station in their centre.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt there would be significant pressure to reallocate the force in a way which would strip some areas of their current level of policing and concentrate it in other areas. That is why the increased size of the force is not some flamboyant electoral gesture; it is vital to keep the force adequately strong across the country without diminishing the level of service in those areas which are currently least populous.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, it is important that, in every area, some members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should live in the community, as pointed out by Senator Leyden. This gives communities a sense of identification with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is one thing, and it also gives a sense that the force is deeply rooted in these areas. From that point of view, the phenomenon of commuting garda&iacute;, to which Senator Jim Walsh referred, is a reality. It would be naive for us to think that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or anyone else could wave a magic wand and provide accommodation all over the country for families as geography might dictate; it simply will not happen. This is why a volunteer reserve is a good idea and is more vital in the case of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na than that of the Defence Forces. The presence of FCA units around the country identifies the Defence Forces to the people. There are people in every community who have been involved with the Defence Forces, who understand that way of life and who are ambassadors of goodwill for the forces within their communities.</P>
      <P>The reaction to such proposals is strange but understandable. Special constables, as they were known in Britain, had a particular meaning on the island of Ireland. In Nationalist Ireland the term &ldquo;special constable&rdquo; had a pejorative meaning, to put it mildly. Therefore, I can see why reservists have traditionally not even been contemplated in Ireland because there is a clear legacy of history which runs contrary to that notion and one would be naive to think otherwise. Nonetheless, it is a strange fact that Ireland is, to my knowledge, the only common law country in the world which does not have any police reserve or special constabulary to back up the permanent police force.</P>
      <P>Whereas section 14 makes skeletal provision for the establishment of such a force &mdash; in that it neither mandates nor requires it, since it is only provided for in enabling form &mdash; the interests of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its members and the representative associations would be enhanced rather than diminished by the presence of a volunteer reserve. I can imagine the very skilled professionals in the representative bodies thinking that the provision of reservists will diminish the opportunity for overtime or will take pressure off the Government to provide extra resources. It is a valid point which I do not deny. However, the obverse side of that coin is that policing activity requires roots in the community and, in the broader sense, it is in the interests of serving <Col N="1846"/>members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they should have such strong allies and roots.</P>
      <P>I am sure it is not the case but, even if all the garda&iacute; from Donnybrook Garda station lived outside Dublin 4, it is in the interests of policing and serving members that allies of the police should live there, whether they are members of the force or people interested in upholding the force and committed to it on a voluntary basis, in other words, men and women who would serve as voluntary reservists.</P>
      <P>The same applies to the talent which is lost when people retire at the age of 50 or 53, as will be the case in the fullness of time. Many people who leave the force do not want any further connection with it; they want to get on with the rest of their lives and regard themselves as having done their 30 year stint, with which point of view I fully sympathise. However, there are also people who are sufficiently expert in particular or broad areas of expertise such as community relations who, as reservists, could discharge functions of a supplementary nature relating to, for example, school liaison and community Garda activities. It is as plain as a pikestaff that such a resource should be available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>The question of what reservists can do that full-time garda&iacute; cannot is similar to that which applies to the FCA and the PDF, the answer to which is obvious. For example, garda&iacute; in Kerry might have to preserve a scene, police a race meeting and search a mountainside at the same time or an illness such as influenza might deplete the force suddenly in a station such as Kenmare. In such cases, it is always useful to have available locally-based people as an alternative resource to help out with policing functions on an emergency basis.</P>
      <P>I accept that the intent of Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s amendment and his comments are correct. It is important that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has roots in the community. No community should regard itself as an area from which policemen are not recruited. We should have a recruitment policy which ensures that people in such communities do not feel their young men and women would never join the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. With a combination of decent recruiting policies and the potential use of a reserve, the gap &mdash; which is widening in front of our eyes &mdash; can be closed again to some extent, if not completely, although that may be idealistic.</P>
      <P>In terms of recruitment ensuring the diverse ethnic, socio-economic and geographic representation of the entire community, the power to make a strategy statement which involves targeting this area, married with section 14 which, when we have 14,000 garda&iacute; in the fullness of time, will enable us examine the concept of a reserve, will go a good distance towards addressing the yawning gap and its social and policing consequences, to which Senator Brian Hayes has drawn the House&rsquo;s attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the Minister in his proposals for a volunteer force. For all the reasons he has set out, it is very important. One of the reasons the Patten commission was so keen to have a part-time reserve for the Police Service of Northern Ireland was precisely to enable it to recruit people fairly quickly from areas from which police recruits had not come previously. There are many people who want to give a public service and they should be allowed to do so. It is of enormous help for the police to have local roots. Nearly all the professionals, such as teachers, social workers and police, who service inner city areas in particular live outside these areas, although some nuns and priests remain. It is important that there is some of the connection to which the Minister referred. He may have to be careful in terms of regulations so that the people do the jobs for which their training suits them. However, I support the general line being taken by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not address the issue of recruits as it is the subject of another amendment. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on my own comments. The issue I have is how we will achieve our objectives. There are 7,000 houses in close proximity in my constituency. I suspect not one recruit of the force has come from that area in the past 20 years. The issue for this House and specifically for the Commissioner is what will he do about that.</P>
      <P>My crude amendment was a fairly botched attempt to achieve the objective. If the Minister is stating that in his strategy statement he could do something to highlight the issue of recruitment to the Garda Commissioner to develop good strategies to get good young men and women from those communities into the force, then I am with him on that. In ten years&rsquo; time, however, I want to stand up and say to the Minister who, I suspect, may be in another job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Living in Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that he has achieved his objectives. It is an absolute scandal. No other medium to large-sized town in the country would have a situation like that in my constituency. It perpetuates this awful attitude of the community and police to each other because there are no recruits in the constituency.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be an interventionist. To take the argument of the Senator opposite about acceptance, the police will be accepted only when one, two or three of them lives in our midst. The argument put up on countless occasions in some parts of my constituency is that the police do not live among the people, do not care about the people and run through the estates in their cars, that they are not engaging and are not part of the community.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with the Minister&rsquo;s comments that they must be rooted in the community and I have tabled an amendment on the issue of housing. We <Col N="1848"/>must be much more novel in the way in which we provide housing options for young members of the force who cannot afford to buy a house &mdash; I refer to the typical couple, a teacher and a garda. We must be much more novel about how we encourage people to live in all parts of society.</P>
      <P>I leave the Minister with one case, that of a woman in my constituency whose son joined the force. She had to leave her house because of the bullying and intimidation she faced because he had joined the police. Lunatics and thugs attacked her house on a constant basis. It was so unreal for a member of that community to attempt to join the force that she was hassled and bullied on a continuous basis, so much so that she had to leave the community. My community would not accept that. There must be the same kind of revulsion within her community and the only way that can be achieved is through a general policy of recruitment.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at this issue. Perhaps it could be dealt with in section 20 which deals with the strategy statement to which he referred. If the Minister could be more explicit, if he is giving the House a commitment that when he sets objectives for the Commissioner when this Bill is enacted he will tell him that this is an issue about which the House feels strongly and about which the Houses would ask him to be imaginative, that he would establish new recruitment policies in schools in those areas in particular to ensure we improve the number of recruits from these areas, if he gives me the assurance that he will make that a key priority for the Commissioner or he can do something in terms of tweaking section 20, then I will withdraw my amendment which was a rather crude attempt. The point is crucial. The only way to achieve acceptance is to improve the recruitment rates in these communities.</P>

	<P>I give Senator Brian Hayes the assurance that I will draw attention to the view of this House that there should be representation in recruitment. I certainly will make that a priority as far as I am concerned. I am sure the Commissioner does not need persuasion on this issue. He is a highly intelligent, highly-motivated individual and he probably senses this as strongly, <Col N="1849"/>if not more strongly, than most Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I scarcely dare to mention that it may be necessary in some cases, in respect of recruitment criteria, to take the view that minor infringements of the law should not mean total disqualification and that an absolutely clean record may not be reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister is looking at a strategy in this area, expectations must be a big factor. If he were to compare the Defence Forces to the Garda, I am sure he would find a different level of representation in different types of community. One must ask why that is so. It is similar in the case of a college. It is a kind of quota that Senator Brian Hayes is suggesting and I can see why a quota might be helpful. Generally I am not one to push for quotas. The Minister needs to improve the overall level. It is a little like the circumstances in college. It has to do with overall expectation and making sure that everybody from different types of communities has the same right to expect to go to college, to be a member of the Garda or whatever. How the Minister goes about achieving that would be the issue.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment refers to the issue of a volunteer force. I oppose this section because elsewhere this system has been tried and has failed. The PSNI is disbanding its reserve at present.</P>

	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Such people need to be qualified and experienced garda&iacute;, not, as the Minister described them, yellow pack garda&iacute;, which is the last thing we need. I do not think we could be in favour of the model proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, I did not describe anybody as &ldquo;yellow pack garda&iacute;&rdquo;. I stated we all wanted to avoid the notion of yellow pack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>To be more accurate, the Minister mentioned the term &ldquo;yellow pack garda&iacute;&rdquo;. My party is not in favour of a reserve model as proposed by the Minister. People with Garda <Col N="1850"/>powers must be properly trained and must have the appropriate experience. It cannot be a half-way house, as the Minister proposes. He should focus his efforts on his recruitment drive of which he has spoken on many occasions.</P>
      <P>We favour the establishment of panels of retired members of the Garda so that they be available on a needs and divisional basis. To take a simple example, a garda on maternity leave cannot be replaced. If there were a panel type approach such as we propose, this problem would not arise.</P>
      <P>If there is to be any credibility in a reserve force, it should comprise former members of the Garda or police forces and they should be appointed after a rigorous selection process.</P>
      <P>We are not suggesting in any way that it would be a cushy number for retired garda&iacute;. That is not a charge which we would like to have made against us. We believe there are quite a number of people within the Garda who would retire early who would want, and would consider being on, a reserve panel. We will deal with the amendments on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure I would go along with Senator Cummins in dismissing this idea. I see certain merit in it. If one looks at the analogy which the Minister has made with F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, one will find that people got a training there which gave them an understanding of the Army and they got discipline which stood to them in other aspects of their lives. Many regarded it as good training for young people, apart altogether from the benefits which would accrue nationally by having a trained reserve force within the Army. The same could be applied in the police force as a way of soliciting greater community support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its activities, which is essential to good policing, in my view. The more support given to garda&iacute; on the ground and the more tangible that support is by way of co-operation and information, the better it will be for society.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Minister has discussed with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights the possibility of examining best practice in other jurisdictions. Those operating in a functioning capacity will require to be trained effectively and there will probably need to be a limit put on their range of activities in that they may not be given the full range of responsibilities and activities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>This proposal could be an enhancement of the community contribution to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It should be rolled out on a pilot basis and tweaked in order to make it effective. The proposal should not be dismissed out of hand. Section 14(3) states: &ldquo;While on duty, a volunteer member has the powers, immunities, privileges ad duties as a person appointed under <i>section 13</i> to the rank of garda.&rdquo; I disagree with amendment No. 20 which proposes that the volunteer members would not have the same powers. They <Col N="1851"/>must be given the same powers as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, otherwise they would be neutered and ineffective.</P>
      <P>Another point was raised in an earlier debate about recruiting people from areas which historically may not have been recruiting areas for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Some such communities may be home to criminals involved in the drugs trade. It is important to ensure that the people recruited would be given all the protection afforded a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that they are not isolated within those communities.</P>
      <P>I see merit in this proposal as it relates to traffic control. The N4 is a three-lane carriageway in each direction with a speed limit zone of 40 mph. I am appalled to see garda&iacute; trying to catch people speeding on that road. I travelled 160 or 170 miles one day and that was the only location where I saw garda&iacute;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator mean distance or speed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was not speed, it was distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has privilege so it is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>When I travel to Dublin on the N11, the most likely place for me to see garda&iacute; is on the Kilmacanogue bypass where the speed limit on the dual carriageway is 40 mph. This brings the whole system and the speed limits into disrepute. The use of a volunteer force would allow for greater visibility. It is counter-productive to see garda&iacute; hiding behind corners at the roadside. The police are visible in the United States but it is too late when one sees them. This means that every road user is mindful that speed checks take place. I suggest a common sense approach. I commend the Minister for this innovative proposal which is worthy of examination in an unbiased manner. It could be shaped into a proposal which would be of advantage to methods of policing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the idea of a reserve force. Senator Cummins&rsquo;s idea of having pools of retired garda&iacute; is a very interesting one and it could be extremely useful. I do not think other people should be excluded from the reserve force.</P>
      <P>To clarify a point about the position in Northern Ireland, the Patten commission recommended that the full-time reserve be stood down. It seemed to us that a full-time reserve force is a contradiction in terms; a full-time person is a policeman. Some of these people had been on their sixth or seventh three-year contract and they were being disgracefully treated in regard to terms and conditions of employment. The commission was very keen on the notion of a part-time reserve force, which, for instance, gives the <Col N="1852"/>force a foothold in the community. I have seen reservists doing wonderful work. They bring different skills from their varied backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a country-wide force and people naturally move in and out of a district. Very often, the one continuity provided on a local patch comes from the reservists. They become the old heads in the place and they pass on the wisdom learned from dealing with the public. They are also the kind of people who are generally quite content to do foot patrols and go out in the evening. This is a very important aspect of policing. It provides reassurance to the elderly and to mothers. I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a problem with the idea behind this proposal but I have some concerns about the wording. The Minister mentioned the Army reserve force but that is a very different type of organisation. I am concerned about the use of the word &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; because it might be restrictive in this section.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh referred to the need to examine best practice in other jurisdictions. The proposal needs to be worked through and its ramifications need to be examined. The section allows for the provision to come into play very quickly. Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The power to appoint persons under <i>subsection (1)</i> may be exercised not earlier than 12 months after the commencement of this section and then only if&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the Garda Commissioner has submitted proposals to the Minister for the training of persons to be so appointed, and</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) regulations have been made concerning their recruitment and training and prescribing the terms and conditions of their position.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Much greater consideration needs to be given to this. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be on board because there are issues to be dealt with about how members would relate to these volunteers. For example, section 14(3) states: &ldquo;While on duty, a volunteer member has the powers, immunities, privileges and duties as a person appointed under <i>section 13</i> to the rank of garda.&rdquo; The volunteers will have a very different role. I have concerns about the section but I do not oppose the provision of a reserve force in itself. The Minister may need to flesh out the proposal. Will the regulations be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in favour of the proposal for a volunteer force and that it should have exactly the same powers, responsibilities and immunities as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A second class force could bring the whole system into disrepute. The point has been well made about the need to root the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the community and to have its members living in the community. The volunteers would be ideally suited in this regard. They can be the eyes and ears of the members in <Col N="1853"/>the patrol cars. The volunteers are the people on the ground who know what is going on and they can fulfil a valuable function.</P>
      <P>The point was made about An F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il. Those of us who were members of the force, such as the Minister and I, know that the training alone was of great benefit, apart from anything we did. We learned to handle firearms, discipline and even square-bashing. It could be mischievously said that the reason people in boarding schools joined was to acquire a greatcoat that could be put on the bed at night to keep them warm but that is a separate issue.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made about retired members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have a great talent and knowledge. A local garda of my acquaintance was very expert in the drugs area and had visited all the local schools and was well known to the young people. When he retired all that expertise was lost and it was not really replaced. I made approaches to the local authority to find some way of incorporating him into the local authority system in order to retain his expertise. A vehicle should be available for harnessing the knowledge such people acquire over a lifetime in the event that they wish to continue to be active and involved, as opposed to confining their time to fishing and so on.</P>
      <P>I am a little confused regarding Senator Cummins&rsquo;s views on training given that section 14(2) states: &ldquo;A person is not eligible to be appointed as a volunteer member unless he or she has completed the prescribed training.&rdquo; As such, training appears to be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>My point relates to the nature of the prescribed training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage I pointed out that it does not seem sensible that when renewing my gun licence I must visit a local Garda station because a member of the Garda must be involved in the administration of such renewals. This could be done by a volunteer or competent secretary. While I realise that guns must be controlled and tracked, the licence renewal procedure should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>In the past, garda&iacute; were involved in noxious weed control and came out to check whether one had cut ragwort. I recall from my youth that the local garda cycled out to take the annual census of livestock. Thankfully, this is no longer the case, although I suspect that Garda responsibility in such matters remains on the Statute Book. There must be a more rational approach to organising some of the activities in which garda&iacute; are involved.</P>
      <P>On the question of powers, local models are available. I am a member of an angling club, several of whose members have warrants. As water keepers or bailiffs, they carry a warrant which confers certain powers on them. We must ensure that the volunteer force has the same powers, responsibilities and immunity as the main force.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1854"/>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>To follow up Senator Dardis&rsquo;s point regarding noxious weeds, we had much less ragwort than now when the Garda was involved in this area. This created a certain fear among people as regards that noxious weed.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on securing an increase in the number of garda&iacute;, about which we hear nothing. Once the Minister obtained Government approval for funding to increase the force to more than 14,000 members by 2007 to meet the commitments in the programme for Government agreed in 2002, newspapers, radio, other media and the Opposition suddenly lost interest. We no longer hear a word spoken about the Minister&rsquo;s great achievement of securing agreement to increase the strength of the Garda to its highest level in the history of the State. As he stated, if he had not achieved this result, garda&iacute; in rural areas would have been transferred to larger urban areas. I congratulate the Minister and his officials on their achievement.</P>
      <P>In light of the number of additional garda&iacute; who will be recruited, will it be necessary, on reflection, to recruit an auxiliary force to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na? The Garda Representative Association made a detailed submission to the Minister in November. I request that he hold discussions with the GRA on the proposal in section 14 to recruit an auxiliary force. The goodwill of the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors will be required to achieve the Minister&rsquo;s objective to recruit a support force. We do not want a two-tier system to develop in which the auxiliary force and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proper would not co-operate. I understand departmental officials propose to meet the GRA in the next few weeks and the Minister may have further information in this regard on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party opposes a volunteer force and seeks instead a divisional panel or reserve. I do not see much difference between its proposal and the Minister&rsquo;s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It wants to have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>While it appears to be in favour of a volunteer force, it simply wants to produce a different proposal. Its amendments should be thrown out lock, stock and barrel because they are not relevant. Amendment No. 20, which is part of the group, would make it a toothless force. One might as well not establish an auxiliary force if it would not have the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am declaring that I was nominated by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, which includes the Garda Representative Association. The GRA has sent me a detailed document which I have studied. On the basis of being supported and nominated by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, I would appreciate if the Minister or his officials or both would meet the GRA to discuss section 14.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made a persuasive argument, particular regarding an emergency which may arise in a particular region at a particular time and would require support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Outbreaks of violence and so forth arise from time to time, even in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Members of the Houses are served extremely well by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As the premier institution of the State, the Oireachtas is a reflection of the State. The Army is responsible for security in the Houses at night and on weekends, while the Garda is in charge during the day. I would like this position to be maintained, irrespective of what supplementary force is established in the future. It is important to have garda&iacute; in the Houses. They look after Members extremely well and present a great public face of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Leyden for his remarks regarding the recruitment of members of the Garda. I assure the Senator and Senator Cummins that I was conscious from the outset that if I did not deliver 2,000 additional garda&iacute; before promoting the idea of a volunteer reserve, people would put two and two together and would not get 22. They would know exactly what was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has still not delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am by no means dismissive of the reservations of the representative associations. I accept that some people might consider it strange that a person who has received less than 24 months&rsquo; training could exercise exactly the same powers as a garda. I also have a clear picture regarding the points made about resources, overtime earnings and so forth. I am not ignoring these points, nor do I view them as wholly insubstantial.</P>
      <P>I make the broader point that, from the point of view of effective policing, the question we must ask is whether, even if I were to treble the numbers of garda&iacute; or expenditure on the Garda, I would have recruits from the communities to which Senator Brian Hayes referred. There are different issues, including the need to have local community roots for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We live in a changing society. People commute and lead lifestyles immeasurably different from those which supported policing in the past, when local <Col N="1856"/>people were members of the force and acted as its eyes and ears locally. The community naturally had a loyalty to such garda&iacute; because they were neighbours. Without the neighbour principle in policing, we will lose something.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Maurice Hayes for expressing the view that there was not a decision in Northern Ireland to scrap volunteer policing, but to scrap the anomaly of full-time reservists. That is almost a contradiction in terms. There are many good people in the full-time reserve of the PSNI, but that is having things both ways. The state engages members on a full-time basis, but will not give them any of the comforts of being a full-time policeman or policewoman. That is a strange phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said nobody would be eligible to be appointed unless they completed prescribed training. Senator Cummins asked what constitutes prescribed training. Section 14(4) states: &ldquo;The power to appoint persons under <i>subsection (1)</i> may be exercised not earlier than 12 months after the commencement of this section ...&rdquo;. There are two ensuing conditions. First, the Garda Commissioner must come to the Minister with the proposal; the Minister does not instruct the Garda Commissioner to create a reserve. This was deliberately included so the proposal would be made in the best interests of the force, not in the financial interests of the Minister. Section 14(4) also provides that regulations must be made concerning the reservists recruitment and training, and prescribing the terms and conditions of their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The reservists will not be the same as other members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No. Senator Cummins tabled amendments which are broadly hostile to the concept. However, we have developed a system of training members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is unique in these islands. It is a two-year process and involves spending time in stations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The system has stood the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good system and I am not detracting from it in any way. It might be the appropriate length of time for somebody who will make his or her career out of the force and serve full time. Other police forces allow for far less time. However, it would be nonsense to suggest a reservist should have identical training to a full-time career policeman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <?oasys [cl10.7]?>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point. We are giving them the same powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A reservist and a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na both belong to a disciplined force. Volunteer reservists cannot rise through the ranks. They can only be appointed to the rank of a garda. Much of the training at <Col N="1857"/>Templemore is designed to create a member who, in principle, could one day be the Garda Commissioner. It may not be necessary in the case of a volunteer reservist. There would an attenuated and limited form of training for a reservist. However, they would be disciplined. Section 14(3) provides that the same powers, immunities, privileges and duties apply to a reservist as a garda. They have an obligation to do as they are told and not do something which is inconsistent with their level of training and expertise. Implicit in the system is the understanding that a reservist would not be used as a fingerprint expert on their first day of the job. Theoretically garda&iacute; are obliged to carry out such functions.</P>
      <P>This is not something the representative associations should oppose tooth and claw. If they have an overall view on the long-term interests of policing in Ireland, they should reflect on what I say as I reflected on what they said. It is essential we attempt to bridge the geographical and socio-economic gap between the force and the community it serves if we are to create a climate congenial to its members carrying out their functions as a lifetime career. I am trying to bridge the gap partially with a number of measures. However, it is meant in good faith and the beneficiary will not just be a notional clerk in the Department of Finance worried about sums or overtime bills. That is not the purpose of these measures in any way. The community at large wants to know the gap will not widen and become an ever-widening gulf which will distance the force from the people.</P>
      <P>We cannot turn back the clock. I was at a Neighbourhood Watch meeting last night in Harrington Street in Dublin and we discussed the society&rsquo;s changing attitude to the simple matter of being law-abiding. There was a time when everybody left their key in the front door, when the bread man could walk into a house, go to the kitchen, put down the bread, sign it into the book and leave. That world will not return. However, one value that was and still is strong in Ireland is <Col N="1858"/>total community support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na generally.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon which Senator Brian Hayes speaks of is a worry, and not simply confined to the heart of his constituency. It applies in a reverse sense to my own, in particular to Donnybrook. How can a young garda buy a house there? How can he or she live in that community to serve it? They may be able to share an apartment. We must address the question of how Donnybrook will have Garda roots in the area just the same as we address the issue in a place such as Fettercairn. It is the same phenomenon and not something which comes from the top downwards in society. It applies across the State and to rural communities also. Will garda&iacute; live in those communities or will they police communities where they know nobody and have no innate understanding of the population and must therefore learn very slowly?</P>
      <P>Section 14 is carefully balanced legislation. It is not designed to ram some notional &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; Garda force down the throats of serving members, the Commissioner or the public. It will probably be my successor, rather than myself, who will receive a request from the Commissioner to establish such a force. It is designed to make that possible, rather than have the new constitution for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na render it impossible. That would be the case if section 14 did not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides. In theory it may sound like a good idea, but it is not fully thought out. It would not operate as outlined in section 14.</P>
      <P>The divisional panels of reservists which we propose are worth taking on board. I could not support section 14 as it is constituted. The Minister has said the representative associations are also opposed to the measure. I am opposed to the section and will press my amendment.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We have already indicated that we are opposed to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question put and declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 15, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;15. &mdash; (1) The Garda Commissioner may subject to <i>subsection (2)</i> and the regulations, establish a Dublin Metropolitan Police Service.</P>
      <P LI="1">(2) The power to establish a Dublin Metropolitan Police Service shall be exercised within 12 months after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with the structure within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Dublin. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that no regional structure is attached to the Garda which one can argue is one of its strengths. However, as Dublin city expands westwards, northwards and southwards, specific policing problems are also growing. In the future, it may be logical for a regional structure to be put on policing in the capital city. We have given our proposed force the title, the Dublin metropolitan police service. While we are not suggesting this should become immediate policy, it may be useful to insert this in the Bill if a future Government wishes to choose this route.</P>
      <P>An advantage to a regional structure in Dublin&rsquo;s policing would be the prioritisation of the best possible use of resources in the area. Divisional status for the Garda in Tallaght was agreed upon in principle eight years ago, but due to the lack of police accommodation in the area to house the chief superintendent it has not been delivered upon. In the future, we may have to broach the issue of a Dublin metropolitan police service for the entire region. This legislation presents the only opportunity over the coming years to deal with root and branch reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This proposal may be utilised in future years and should be considered for inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept this amendment in its present form. A solid case for the re-establishment of a Dublin metropolitan police <Col N="1860"/>force would have to be made before I could accept such a radical departure. An Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for the Dublin area exists. Dublin garda&iacute; have distinctive badge numbers on their epaulettes. Would such a proposed force be separate with its own uniform? Are promotional opportunities to be segregated into this force? I would have to consider these and a series of other issues.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the amendment makes it mandatory to create this service within 12 months of the passing of the Act. This means it will not be some distant possibility but a mandatory change in the structure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. There was a time when there was a separate police force. DMP men wore their helmets while the rest of the Garda did not. When the Garda was made a unified force, the Dublin metropolitan region members still wore their traditional helmets until the 1950s when it was changed. I do not believe there is support in the service or Dublin city for the establishment of a separate force without making a case as to how it would operate.</P>
      <P>I do not want to establish a geographical distinction within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which would have the effect of reducing the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s capacity to deploy the resources of the force across the State as is necessary. Would DMP men be liable to be sent down to serve on, say, a presidential visit by Mr. Bush to Shannon? Would those garda&iacute;, not in this proposed Dublin metropolitan police force, be liable to serve in the city centre during May Day demonstrations? I do not know the answers to these questions and am not convinced that this is a worthwhile venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister is correct to say this would be a radical departure, there is, as he also points out, an historical precedent if one looks back beyond the turn of the last century. It may well be the case that a future Government will consider this issue. There are particular problems with the organisation of the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that the amendment mandates a future as opposed to the current Government to carry this out in 12 months. The Senator may be optimistic about the fall of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I had that in mind when I was framing the amendment. I gave the Government only another six months. The proposed provision may well become part of the remedy to create a better policing structure in the city and county in the years ahead. The Garda has specific structural <Col N="1861"/>problems in Dublin which do not simply involve manpower issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Fingal a part of the Dublin metropolitan area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I alluded in my initial remarks in particular to the accommodation problem the Garda has in the city. We will leave the matter to another day and wait to see what influence the composition of a future Government has on the matter.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 15, line 31, after &ldquo;sincerely&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, promise and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment seeks to make a small change in the declaration to make it more consistent with the wording of other declarations of this kind such as the judge&rsquo;s declaration in Article 34 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister is seeking to provide for a multicultural force, should he not make some provision to allow for affirmation on a basis other than God? I am not making an anti-God remark, but am considering that people have different conceptions of him. Some might find it difficult to solemnly and sincerely declare in the manner set out in the Bill. There should be room for affirmation or attestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a party which had problems in this area some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember speaking to Senator Norris on one occasion about the widely held view that the Progressive Democrats Party had tried to take God out of the Constitution. It was not true, of course, as the text we proposed contained at least three mentions of God. That is history. Senator Norris said he admired the Progressive Democrats Party because having alienated 90% of the country by proposing to delete references to God, it alienated the remaining 10% by proposing to put them back in again. It was Senator Norris at his best. He said that was political courage.</P>
      <P>As Senator Maurice Hayes said, it is legitimate to make provision for a person who wishes to make an affirmation. The appropriate way to do so is in the form of my amendment No. 25 which provides that the words &ldquo;before God&rdquo; may be omitted from the declaration at the request of the declarant. It is a fair compromise.</P>
      <P>I will consider amendments Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, between now and Report Stage and <Col N="1862"/>ascertain whether they change the sense of the declaration or add to its value. In general, I do not wish to add surplus material which does not change meaning. I do not know whether the inclusion of the words &ldquo;and to the best of my knowledge and power&rdquo; and &ldquo;faithfully&rdquo; in the context of the discharge of duties would reduce or increase the effect of the declaration. Amendment No. 22 proposes the insertion of the word &ldquo;promise&rdquo;, but this is a declaration not a promise. We will consider these matters between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 25:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 15, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following subsection:</P>

    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 15, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>While other Members focused on the reference to God in the preamble to the declaration, I have some difficulty as an advocate for human rights with its third part. A member of the force will be obliged to declare that he or she will not form, belong or subscribe to any political party. I am not quite as concerned about the reference to &ldquo;secret society&rdquo;. As an extension of their civic mindedness, garda&iacute; would be interested in participating in the political process. While I am not seeking a response now, I ask the Minister to consider whether rank and file garda&iacute; should be required to make such a declaration. Officers above the rank of inspector perhaps constitute another issue. Involvement in the political process at local level is commendable and I encourage as many people as possible to take part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree. The prohibition on Garda membership of political parties has worked well. While garda&iacute; have their own political persuasions, membership of political parties is a different ball game. I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s proposal in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an occasion on which I will disloyally agree with Senator Cummins and disagree with Senator Jim Walsh. Should a garda be allowed to canvass door to door at election time, seek contributions among the business community or shake a box outside a church on national collection day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Or attend a Minister&rsquo;s meeting?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1863"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Jim Walsh has the happy idea that garda&iacute; would come to swell the ranks at cumann meetings, listen to the minutes, the secretary&rsquo;s report and the correspondence, but I think they have more sense. I would be much more worried about the list of activities I have outlined.</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda have many responsible privileges over the rest of us, including the power of arrest. While Garda functions are not judicial, they have far-reaching implications for the community. To take an example which does not involve my party, it would not be fair for a Fine Gael Senator to be breathalysed while driving home by a man he knew was out canvassing against him the previous night. It would be problematic even if all parties were acting above board and the Senator in question had not a drop taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That could not possibly happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Perception is very important. I am not sure if the Director of Public Prosecutions is prohibited from joining a political party. Perhaps civil servants are not so entitled.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>There is no law which states that a judge shall not be a member of a political party but there is clear legal convention that it would be a sacking offence if he or she were to join one. The same applies to garda&iacute;. They are better served by not being able to be members of political parties, which is not to say that they do not have strong political opinions and the same right to vote as the rest of us; that is their entitlement and I would be opposed to changing it. To adopt Senator Cummins&rsquo;s phrase, this has worked well to date and I do not see many members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na battering down my door or sending their wives or husbands out as proxy members of political parties or whatever. We would be better off to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a son who is intent on joining the Garda after doing his leaving certificate next year but only last week he warned me not to include him on the membership list of Fine Gael because he will be applying to join the Garda. He is ahead of the posse in that regard.</P>

	<P>Government amendment No. 26:</P>

It is to expand the number of people who should be consulted in the context of the process whereby the code of ethics is drafted.

	<P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 16, subsection (2), line 28, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Section 1 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 1924 allowed representative associations to associate <Col N="1865"/>with other bodies. Why is the Minister reversing that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Our amendment No. 29 proposes the deletion of section 17(3). The purpose of the amendment is to delete the statutory prohibition on members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being members of a trade union. That prohibition is excessively restrictive on the right of freedom of association of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is not fitting in modern times. I do not understand the reason members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot be members of a trade union just like members of the Civil Service and so on. I would like the Minister to reconsider including this subsection and accepting our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The omission of the material contained in subsection (30), which is a ministerial amendment, was done inadvertently. Although people may think it was deliberate, it was an inadvertence pointed out to me by ICTU, which came to the Department. When it was pointed out to us we realised it has simply slipped off the word processor. That is the explanation. There is nothing more sinister to it.</P>
      <P>In regard to garda&iacute; joining a trade union, I do not accept that is legitimate. As I said earlier, garda&iacute; have significant powers but I do not accept that we can extend the notion of industrial disputes to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is a disciplined force, just like PDFORRA is a representative body for ranks in the Permanent Defence Force. I do not propose to have a situation where industrial action is taken by the Defence Forces or by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is something I could not contemplate because the Garda is a disciplined force upon which the State relies. Sometimes it has to intervene, tangentially, in industrial relations disputes.</P>
      <P>Sometimes garda&iacute; have to cross pickets or arrest picketers or whatever which is not to say that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot have as sympathetic a personal view as they like of the whole notion of the trade union movement, which is a valuable part of social partnership in our society. We must remember that if we are to have a sovereign Government, it must be in a position to carry out its wishes and not be inhibited in that respect by industrial relations considerations. That is not to say that there is not a sophisticated scheme of industrial relations relating to Garda conditions which operates day in and day out but it is one that is special, <i>sui generis</i>, and I cannot go down the road of allowing members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to join trade unions or become subject to industrial relations law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of representative associations not being allowed to associate with other bodies, it could be construed that they could not associate with other policing bodies such as EuroCOP and so on. What is the Minister&rsquo;s position on that? I would not think that is <Col N="1866"/>what he had in mind but it could be construed that they would not be allowed associate with members of police forces in other associations on the European scene which are of benefit to those associations and the Garda as a body. If that was the case, it should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The omitted material that fell off the edge of the word processor covers that and would authorise the Minister to authorise membership of such an association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>On amendment No. 29, the Minister spoke about the special role of the garda&iacute; and the Defence Forces but the same logic could be applied to other employees. For example, it would be difficult to do without health professionals but they have the right to join trades unions. I do not understand why the garda&iacute; should not have a similar right to be members of a trade union and, if necessary, take industrial action. A few years ago the Garda engaged in action similar to a strike. It had to be done in a vague, unaccountable way. Would it not be better if everything were above board and garda&iacute; were given the same rights as other workers? Most workers do not strike. The right to strike is the ultimate sanction on the part of employees and it is also a negotiating tool, which enables them to highlight their cause. It is not lightly used by anybody and members of the Garda, similar to health service staff, realise the consequences of going on strike. I presume the Minister&rsquo;s main concern is that the Garda would not strike.</P>

	<P>It would be incongruous if the Garda and the Army were trade unionised in the normal way, including having the right to strike. One could imagine the social consequences of industrial action by them. Members declare an interest when contributing to debates relevant to their nominating bodies. There is an onus, therefore, on Labour Party Members whose party is a significant benefactor of trade unions, which disturbs many trade union members, to make a declaration in this regard. This is a serious issue, which has arisen on other occasions both here and in the D&aacute;il.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s amendment allays the GRA&rsquo;s fears. The GRA was concerned about external association. The GRA is also associated with EuroCOP and other organisations such as the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations and it is important that such associations should continue openly, with the approval of the Minister. Section 13 of the Garda Act 1977 allows the Minister to decide and that is fair. The GRA is happy that the Minister should have such a right. The association is an active member of ICPSA, which nominated both myself and Senator Cummins to the Seanad. A GRA representative is honorary secretary of ICPSA, which is in contact with the other affiliate organisations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has no intention of debarring the GRA from membership of such a reputable organisation, which nominates seven Members of the Seanad. If the original Bill were followed to its logical conclusion, the GRA could not directly contact Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>

	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s officials will meet the GRA&rsquo;s representatives in January. Will he confirm the meeting will take place? The GRA is happy with the Bill generally but it wishes to raise other issues. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, which covers the points raised in the GRA&rsquo;s submission on the legislation. This ensures Senator Cummins and I will not have a difficulty meeting one of our nominating bodies. Senator Cummins will concur totally.</P>

	<P>I was elected to the Seanad by Oireachtas Members. However, Senator Walsh has claimed that in tabling my amendment, I should declare my membership of the Labour Party.

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 17, before section 19, but in Chapter 2 of the Bill, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;19&mdash;The Minister shall, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government shall devise a plan under which members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be encouraged to live in RAPID areas and other deprived parts of the country.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I will not bore the pants off Members by airing all the issues discussed earlier. I propose that the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should provide housing assistance to young Garda recruits after they leave Templemore. It has long been accepted that it is increasingly difficult for young members of the force to afford their own homes. The advantage of such a scheme is that, similar to the practice years ago, housing would be available for young recruits. <Col N="1869"/>Imaginative thinking is needed on this issue. The Minister should consider, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a housing scheme.</P>
      <P>A weighting applies to public servants in London. They are given an income boost so that they can purchase houses in certain locations. We must examine a similar scheme to provide incentives for officers to live in communities. The advantages of having officers living in all areas of the community leads to greater protection and ensures the community and the force are rooted together. Some scheme should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We spoke previously about the need for garda&iacute;, particularly young garda&iacute;, to live in council estates and disadvantaged areas because this helps the policing of the area. The Minister has said that people with families live wherever they choose and we do not suggest it should be otherwise. However, there should be co-operation with local authorities to make houses available for young garda&iacute; coming into the community. This would provide a Garda presence in areas where it is needed. The idea is worthwhile and should be considered. It would be useful to disperse a number of officers to various locations throughout the country. The Minister mentioned the same idea with regard to a volunteer force. This amendment proposes another way of doing it. Some monetary incentive must be given to garda&iacute; to live in these areas. The concept of free or reduced rent should be considered.</P>
      <P>The St. Paul&rsquo;s parish area of Waterford city, which I represent, is a disadvantaged area that has pushed for a Garda sub-station in the area, encompassing Ballybeg, Lisduggan, Larchfield etc. The proposed amendment would go some way towards fulfilling that need through providing a greater Garda presence in council and other estates. I urge the Minister to liaise with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to come up with some kind of imaginative scheme to help these communities. Having garda&iacute; in the communities would raise the profile of the force and assist communities that have not had a visible Garda presence for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We have discussed the idea of the geographical presence of garda&iacute;. However, giving cash grants to live in RAPID and deprived areas is not a way to achieve that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not suggest cash. I was talking about rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I mean rental supplements. It would be desirable to have members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resident in every neighbourhood, if that were possible. However, it is not that easy. Garda&iacute; are free to choose where they want to live. It is not that easy for somebody in the Phoenix Park or St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to think up some scheme to encourage them to live where they do <Col N="1870"/>not want to live. If we were told by somebody else that we lived in one place rather than another, we might begin to query the right of people to tell us where to live.</P>
      <P>The suggestions we had about the reservists and recruitment criteria were probably more apt than providing rent subsidies to live in a particular area. It is an advantage for politicians to live in the area they represent. In my constituency somebody who conspicuously did not do that paid a heavy price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a great believer in practising what I preach and I live in my constituency. The Minister is welcome to come and knock on my door any time he wants.</P>
      <P>The issue of financial incentives is important. They are provided throughout the country. A teacher teaching in a Gaeltacht area gets a cash bonus in salary. I have always argued that teachers teaching in deprived communities should also get a cash bonus, because the problems with which they must cope are more difficult than those in an average school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator think they should live in their school&rsquo;s local area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is a worthwhile suggestion if there are schemes provided to encourage that. I suspect the Minister is inundated with requests from politicians for new Garda stations here, there and everywhere. It would be much more cost efficient to give young officers the opportunity to live in an area at a reduced rent for a period. That house would not only become a type of sub-station, but also the place where the garda lives. The Minister pointed out earlier that we used to provide accommodation quarters for members of the force, but most of those are no longer habitable.</P>
      <P>More thought should be given to this idea. We could run a pilot scheme. As the Minister knows, young officers could not afford to live in the area in which he lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the answer is to provide a subsidy for them to live where they do not want to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying that an opportunity should be provided in order to offer a better dispersal of members of the force.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to discuss the issue with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Many local authorities would like to take up some kind of scheme along the lines I have proposed. <Col N="1871"/>In parts of west Tallaght in my constituency the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already provides advice units in some centres two days a week. Building on that kind of initiative would be useful for the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not given this proposal the consideration we hoped he would. Communities throughout the country want this. People in the area I represented for many years would love to see garda&iacute; live in the area and to see young recruits allocated local housing. This would be of tremendous benefit to communities. I support my colleague in urging the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to consider this, even on a pilot basis. The idea should not be discarded totally because it could work. I ask the Minister to reconsider. Perhaps he could come back to us on Report Stage after discussing it with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The idea is worthy of consideration because it could solve many of the problems on housing estates throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a scheme existed in the 1970s throughout the country, although I am only familiar with the one in Roscommon. All the houses in the scheme were sold on to garda&iacute; and are now gone. Those houses were provided by the National Building Agency. The same may apply if the Minister decides to initiate a similar scheme. Senator Cummins has put a good case and in the circumstances I see no reason that the National Building Agency could not provide housing on behalf of the Office of Public Works. However, in time these would be sold to the members of the force. The housing in Roscommon was a great addition to the town because young garda&iacute; were given houses which were sought after.</P>
      <P>There was a slight contradiction in the Senator&rsquo;s argument. He did not support the Minister with regard to the reserve force. I have reservations on this also. The reserve force would &mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The reserve force would be part of the community and its members would live in it. The Minister&rsquo;s idea is to recruit the reserve force from within the community. The Minister is reasonable in his approach. The Senator&rsquo;s points are worth considering, particularly with regard to built up areas in cities where it is hard to get accommodation. It would be worth investigating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators will recall that when I was here on 17 November last, I gave notice during the debate on the amendment of the terms of reference of the planning tribunal that I intended to bring a short Bill before the Oireachtas. The Bill will give legal backing to the discretion granted in the amended terms of reference to the tribunal to decide which issues within its terms of reference to investigate. The Attorney General advised me that it would be important to underpin this new discretion with legislation.</P>
      <P>On 3 December, I made the instrument giving effect to the amended terms of reference as passed by this House and the D&aacute;il. Under paragraph J(7) of the amended terms of reference, the final date for receipt of any new complaint or request for investigation is fixed by the terms of reference as of 16 December of this year. The exercise of the discretion by the tribunal on any new matters that come to its attention before 16 December is vital to the running of the tribunal. Otherwise, I was advised that an argument could be made that the exercise of the discretion may be considered to have been outside of the tribunal&rsquo;s powers. This is the reason this legislation has been brought before the House so quickly. I briefed Opposition spokespersons on the amendment to the terms of reference and on the need for this Bill prior to the motion to amend the terms of reference being brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of any Members who were not present for the debate on 17 November, I would like to review the reasons for amending the terms of reference and the consequent need for this Bill. The tribunal was established by the Oireachtas in 1997 to examine certain specific activities and letters that had aroused suspicion of corrupt acts in the planning process. It was also mandated to investigate any other matters that came to its attention that could amount to corrupt acts in the period since 20 June 1985. In July 1998 the terms of reference were expanded further, at the request of the tribunal. As a result, the tri<Col N="1873"/>bunal had a mandate to investigate any allegation of corruption, whatsoever, associated with the planning process. This was a very wide remit indeed.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the tribunal was expanded to include three members in 2001, the work of the tribunal, based on its terms of reference, has proved to be unwieldy. As a result, the tribunal itself in its fourth interim report issued on 15 June of this year requested a change to its terms of reference to allow it more discretion in the issues it investigates, with a view to shortening the anticipated duration of the tribunal&rsquo;s activities.</P>
      <P>In the report, the tribunal indicated that it still has a large volume of work on hand which, if its mandate played out to its fullest extent, would all have to be investigated. The tribunal therefore indicated that it could see the work carrying on until 2014 or 2015. The tribunal recognised that this situation could not continue and it sought a discretion to decide what matters it should investigate. In addition, if the tribunal decided that the continued pursuit of its inquiries were of limited or no further value in discharging its mandate, it sought the power to report that to the Oireachtas and to convey to the Oireachtas the wish of the tribunal that its investigations and inquiries should terminate on a date to be specified by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the report, the Government mandated the Attorney General to consult with the tribunal on changes to its terms of reference. That arrangement for consultation through the Attorney General was queried elsewhere but that is clearly envisaged under the 1998 tribunal&rsquo;s legislation. The changes which were then consented to by the tribunal go further than those originally requested in the interim report. The amended terms of reference were agreed by both Houses on 17 November this year when we had a good debate on the topic. The tribunal has indicated that the amended terms of reference, together with the additional resources given, will allow it to complete its public hearings by March 2007, a substantially shorter timeframe than that indicated in the tribunal&rsquo;s fourth interim report.</P>
      <P>Since we have already debated them, I will not repeat the detail of the changes made in the new paragraph J which was added to the terms of reference. Suffice it to say that paragraph J enables the tribunal to complete its current investigations into planning issues in Dublin, including the Carrickmines and Quarryvale modules and interlinked matters. Any new complaint or request for investigation must be received by the tribunal by 16 December of this year. By 1 May 2005, the tribunal must decide which new matters on its books will proceed to a public hearing. To allow the tribunal to prepare its final report, no new investigation can be referred to public hearing by the tribunal other than matters that come to light during existing investigations.</P>
      <P>The discretion being granted to the tribunal, which is the subject of this legislation, is in para<Col N="1874"/>graph J(6) of the terms of reference. This will allow the tribunal to decide to carry out any preliminary investigations as it sees fit, in private, using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts, in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists regarding any matter before it to warrant proceeding to a public hearing if deemed necessary; to decide not to initiate a preliminary investigation or a public hearing of evidence regarding the matter, notwithstanding that the matter falls within the tribunal&rsquo;s terms of reference or in any case where it has initiated a preliminary investigation in private, whether concluded or not, but not yet initiated a public hearing of evidence in the matter; or to decide to discontinue or otherwise terminate its investigation, notwithstanding that the matter falls within the tribunal&rsquo;s terms of reference. This is a rather convoluted provision but, if Senators consider it, they will see it is not an unreasonable discretion requested by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>In exercising this discretion the tribunal must have regard to the following matters. First, the age or state of health of one or more persons who are likely to be in a position to provide useful information, including oral evidence to be given privately or publicly. This would include the age or likely state of health of any such person at the possible date in the future when that person or persons might be expected to be called upon to give oral evidence or to otherwise co-operate with the tribunal. In particular, the tribunal may consider the issue as to whether such person&rsquo;s age or state of health is or is likely to be an impediment to him or her being in a position to co-operate with the tribunal or to give evidence to the tribunal in private or in public.</P>
      <P>Second, the likely duration of the preliminary investigation or public hearing into any matter. Third, the likely cost, or other use of the resources of the tribunal, of such investigation or any stage of the investigation into any matter. If, for example, the tribunal were to receive an allegation that &euro;250 or &euro;500 had been improperly received, under the existing arrangements, the tribunal would have to pursue discovery which could cost &euro;9,000 or &euro;10,000 to investigate. The tribunal should have the discretion to take a common sense approach in such matters.</P>
      <P>Fourth, whether the investigation into the matter is likely to provide evidence to the tribunal which would enable it to make findings of fact and conclusions or to make recommendations. Fifth, any other factors which in the opinion of the tribunal would, or would be likely to, render an investigation, or the continued investigation into any matter inappropriate, unnecessary, wasteful of resources, unduly costly, unduly prolonged or which would be of limited or no probative value.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the tribunal&rsquo;s amended terms of reference, the issue of using more positive language in regard to the discretion was raised. However, the language used is that requested by the tribunal. The tribunal&rsquo;s legis<Col N="1875"/>lation requires that any amendment to the terms of reference must have the consent of the tribunal. Therefore, I pointed out at the time that my hands were tied on this matter. In any case, the tribunal and the Government are happy that the language in the terms of reference will allow it to exercise its discretion flexibly and effectively.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate in the Houses on the amendment of the terms of reference in November of this year, reference was made to future investigations of allegations of corruption. The Government has put in place a number of mechanisms to investigate allegations of corruption. These include provisions in the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Local Government Act 2001, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001. If the tribunal, on the publication of any interim or final report, recommends further action in this area, I assure the House such recommendations will be given full consideration.</P>
      <P>In particular, the legislation brought forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and enacted in July of this year as the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 allows for commissions of investigation to be established. It is envisaged that these commissions will conduct their inquiries in a less confrontational manner and will be more cost effective than tribunals of inquiry. We all know that the costs involved and the length of time taken to come to conclusions has been a cause of public disquiet. Among other things, the legislation addresses a point which I know to be of concern to Senator Bannon, as well as to the Government, namely, to ensure that the legal costs of these investigations do not go out of control. This matter was raised by a number of spokespersons when I spoke on this issue in the House previously.</P>
      <P>The Commissions of Investigation Act provides that a specified Minister may direct that a competitive tendering process be used in selecting persons to work with the commission, including barristers and solicitors. In addition, when a commission is being established, the full costs of the commission will be estimated and the chairperson of the commission will have to seek authority from the specified Minister if the estimate is to be exceeded. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will shortly bring forward legislation to address the issue of the legal costs of tribunals, particularly third party legal costs. This will give this House an opportunity to debate the issue more thoroughly.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the planning tribunal has been given additional legal resources to allow it to complete its work within the time limit it has set for completion. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that the work of the tribunal will be completed fully and properly. When allied with the changes to the terms of reference, the additional staff will result in a substantial reduction in the projected life of <Col N="1876"/>the tribunal and, as a result, an overall reduction in the final cost of the tribunal to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation will underpin the tribunal&rsquo;s exercise of its discretion as to which matters it will investigate or bring to public hearing. This will help the tribunal to complete its mandate in a more timely way and within a more certain framework. The changes in the terms of reference and this legislation will allow the tribunal reach findings and make recommendations to help ensure that the events it has investigated cannot occur again. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and pay tribute to the work carried out to date by Mr. Justice Flood and Judge Mahon. While it has been an excessive exercise, involving a significant financial burden, the tribunal&rsquo;s value has been in the exposure of corruption and the lack of transparency at the heart of Government and the suspicious actions of some Ministers. The tribunal has exposed a web of corruption in planning in Dublin on a scale far beyond that expected by the public and involving developers, public representatives and a former council official.</P>
      <P>No one could deny that the tribunal has done a major service in exposing such duplicity and opening the door to the prevention of such corruption in the future. No stone has been left unturned in this matter and the worms underneath have been exposed. Unfortunately, such a process is not as rapid as had been hoped. The Mahon tribunal is now in its seventh year and has incurred high ensuing costs for taxpayers. The expenditure of this money raises emotive moral issues in regard to its alternative uses. Many believe this money would be better spent on our under-resourced and crumbling schools and hospitals. This evening we have heard there are several hundred people on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country. This sad problem is not unique to Dublin. The expenditure of this money would be better spent on the marginalised, the disabled &mdash; the list could go on and on &mdash; and all the people who would benefit from money many people across the country consider has been wasted on nothing more than fat-cat lawyers.</P>
      <P>What we want and expect to see from the Government now is a proposal to change the system and make a difference. We, on this side of the House, want to see a different planning system and we want corruption exposed in a more efficient manner than going through a tribunal. Even a fraction of the money spent on the tribunal could be used properly on resourcing the planning system to ensure an open transparent planning process. This is what is demanded by the public and politicians across the country. Some 99% of politicians are decent honest people and that must never be forgotten.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to tell us what he envisages will replace the Mahon tribunal as a forum for receiving complaints of corruption, which <Col N="1877"/>have dogged this investigation. Fine Gael is proposing the setting up of a committee of investigation to investigate such allegations. It is apparent that the current tribunal suffers from grave problems. It moves too slowly, it costs too much and its remit is far too broad &mdash; the Minister referred to that this evening.</P>
      <P>In proposing to wind up some investigations, and not even begin others, the tribunal will also refuse to accept new business in the form of new allegations. From 16 December, the date the Minister has set, many people will go home happily and eat their turkey in peace this Christmas. Interestingly the date now given for the conclusion of the tribunal&rsquo;s work, March 2007, coincides with the timescale for the introduction of a drastic cut in lawyers&rsquo; fees. Former Minister McCreevy&rsquo;s much publicised move against barristers&rsquo; fees will have no discernible effect on the planning tribunal, where senior counsels will collect approximately &euro;2,400 per day for the duration.</P>

	<P>The &euro;36 million cost of the tribunal since 1997 is tantamount to legalised corruption. The cost is unbelievable. People in every walk of life and in neighbouring EU countries are talking about the high costs of the various tribunals.</P>
      <P>In the 1930s and 1940s in Ireland, the County Management Acts were introduced because of widespread allegations of corruption and jobbery. As a result, the process of power within local government shifted from the elected representatives to officials, with the effect that we now have probably one of the weakest local government systems in Europe. This needs to be addressed and I hope the Minister will do so, decentralising more powers to the elected members and making them more responsible. That is what we all have been crying out for. We all served terms on local authorities. I served 18 or 19 years on a local authority and I know how cash and responsibility starved were local authorities over that period. I hope the Minister will do something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and bring a more positive response to the development of local government.</P>
      <P>It is time for change. That change must be seen in the planning process and the way we do business, in particular in dealing with development plans and rezoning issues, which are undoubtedly at the heart of the corruption which has been exposed by the tribunal. According to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, bad planning and corruption in the 1960s and 1970s cost this country approximately &euro;160 million. This is not acceptable under any circumstance. Fine Gael wants to see an end <Col N="1878"/>to a back door unofficial system and the nod and wink planning that has been exposed, through the tribunals, in the former Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council. We want proper sustainable development and realistic development plans.</P>
      <P>It would be an outrage and totally untenable if, when the costly and lengthy work of the tribunal comes to a natural end, there was nothing to replace it and if what happened in the past were to occur again, with all concerned taking one step forward and an inevitable two backwards. This inevitability must be anticipated, prevented and thwarted by proper structures being put in place. While we are aware that the tribunal has already highlighted problems in regard to corruption in planning decisions, I would be interested to know if the tribunal is fully satisfied that legislation is in place to prevent any reoccurrence of such corruption or any other. I stated on 17 November that in the programme for Government a commitment was given to introduce a proceeds of corruption Bill, but strangely the Government seems to be withdrawing from that commitment. What is the Minister&rsquo;s policy on this?</P>
      <P>It is imperative that we, as legislators, consider how we can improve the planning process and make it more accessible and open. What proposals is the Minister prepared to make to assist local councillors with regard to meetings between them and developers? They requested such assistance and a forum should be established to address their concerns. Apart from arguing that there should be no such contact, steps must be taken to ensure that if it does take place it should be done solely through the council. There should be no impediment to a developer writing to or appearing before the council to make his or her case. This should be transparent and in the council arena and should not involve approaches to individual councillors. I have called for this measure for a long time.</P>
      <P>Can Members of the Oireachtas put an added value into the planning process to improve accountability and transparency? In that regard, the ball is in the Minister&rsquo;s court. Many councillors are concerned about the issue and feel that the current situation must change. Councillors are prepared to take on the responsibility of making good planning decisions but they are being put under excessive pressure in many cases. This pressure can be personal and localised and is always totally unacceptable. In the search for the greater good, the Minister must consider what will be good for local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Mahon tribunal has been in existence since 1997 but it could be 2007 before it makes recommendations. During this long period there has been little or no response from the political system, apart from the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. We in the Oireachtas must be seen to be pro-active and must consider measures to ensure that despite human weakness and greed, such a tribunal will never be required again. The only way this can be achieved is by <Col N="1879"/>changes in the planning laws. This is the least that the public, who have paid the excessive bills of the tribunal, can expect and strongly deserve.</P>
      <P>At the very least the public must be kept fully informed on a regular basis on the findings of the tribunal. I have tabled two amendments to this effect. The tribunal must publish reports as soon as they are completed, not wait until some future date when the passage of time has blurred their impact and immediacy is lost.</P>
      <P>As the tribunal winds its inevitable way to a conclusion, the decision to divide it into three separate inquiries is welcome but I wonder why this was not done at the time new judges were appointed to sit with Mr. Justice Flood two years ago. The tribunal is currently required to investigate every matter and discrepancy brought before it. Strangely, however, its title and the title of this Bill is the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments Bill. Where there is a demand for investigation, no matter what the subject, there is a lawyer only too happy to take the case.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day &mdash; many days in this case &mdash; a number of questions need to be answered. These include if the public has achieved value for money from the work of the tribunal. Has it revealed the scope of the corruption culture and, more importantly, will it ever be stamped out? Has the public been well served by an investigation lasting almost five years into the actions of a single person? The tribunal did what had to be done but the question now arises as to what is to be done in the future. The answers must come from the Minister. The first thing he could do is to accept my amendments. I received a notice about my amendments from the office of the Cathaoirleach. Surely in a democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Like Senator Bannon, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Justice Flood and Judge Mahon and the tribunal. The tribunal&rsquo;s work is very important. The Minister has explained to the House the reason the legislation is required. He made the point about the need to allow the tribunal discretion on the amended terms of reference. The Minister introduced motions which were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 17 November 2004. The Minister has clarified a number of issues which were raised in the House in previous debates. He explained the discretion allowed because of the age and state of health of one or more persons who are likely to be in a position to provide useful information to the tribunal. The Minister also said that it could take up to 2014 or 2015 to complete the work of the tribunal if there <Col N="1880"/>was no change to the terms of reference. This has now been done.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the age and state of health of certain persons. Other issues were raised by Senator Bannon about the likely cost and duration of the investigation and whether the investigation is likely to allow the tribunal to make findings of fact and conclusions and-or make recommendations. We must consider that any other factor which the tribunal considers could have an impact on its investigations.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the public hearings of the tribunal would be completed by March 2007. He stated that 16 December 2004 is the cut-off point for submissions to the tribunal. I am pleased the Minister has brought forward this instrument which was signed on 3 December 2004. A good day&rsquo;s work is being done today in clarifying these matters.</P>
      <P>The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;not unreasonable discretion&rdquo; and this is very true. The tribunal now has the opportunity to look at issues. The case of a small sum of money which may cost the tribunal &euro;9,000 to investigate highlights the way in which costs can get out of control.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to other legislation on planning and development and local government which he and his predecessors introduced. These include provisions in the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Local Government Act 2001, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been proactive in the planning process. Many local authorities have had planning difficulties. I was a member of Galway County Council in the 1970s when section 4 motions were used for the first time in the county council chamber in order to implement decent planning laws. RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme came to County Galway to look at some of the proposals and section 4 motions that had been passed. I do not think the programme found anything that was irregular. Everything was done with proper planning and development and there was no question of corruption.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the Minister and his predecessor, there is more understanding of what it means to build a house in rural Ireland. The regulations on one-off housing have been particularly helpful. Problems still exist about pre-planning meetings and this is an issue which should be dealt with as a priority by local authorities. Electoral area committee meetings are being held and County Galway has five electoral areas. This issue could be raised at those meetings in conjunction with other issues.</P>
      <P>In Galway it is proving difficult to see a planner. I recommended to the county council that it should make more staff available as one way of dealing with issues that could cause problems with the planning process. Once a planning application has been submitted it must be decided upon within a statutory period of time and this is to be welcomed. Very simple things such as the taking over of a housing estate seem to be lower <Col N="1881"/>down the list of priorities. It can be very difficult for residents of housing estates when they are informed that their housing estate will not be dealt with promptly. This is not acceptable to me nor to any county councillor in Galway. The process of finalising housing estates and taking them over is not happening.</P>
      <P>A similar situation applies to the enforcement of planning permissions. The question of quarrying is also an issue in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency as it is in County Galway. It is a matter of waiting for enforcement officers to deal with these issues because they must deal with planning applications first. If issues such as pre-planning are dealt with, there will not be difficulties down the road.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Flood and Judge Mahon have discovered that corruption took place. I am pleased that these issues are being discussed. I hope it will lead to another debate in this House about planning, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and interest groups who have a role in planning. I welcome this legislation and welcome the Minister&rsquo;s explanation of the thinking behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Roche, to the House. I was not present on the last occasion on which this matter was debated but I contributed to a debate on planning following the Minister&rsquo;s appointment. These are related issues. I welcome the legislation and I will be supporting it. The tribunal must be given as wide an ambit as possible. Back in 1997 nobody would have envisaged the amount of time, effort and expense put into the then Flood tribunal, now the Mahon tribunal. If the wisdom of today had prevailed at that stage, it is possible the House would not be having this debate. It is important that we broaden the terms of reference and scope of the tribunals.</P>
      <P>For nearly ten years, tribunals have been a permanent backdrop to politics and public life. The public, by and large, wear tribunal glasses, so to speak, when looking at the body politic. It is sad for politics and many politicians of all political persuasions and none that a handful of people were corrupt. We need be mindful that of the 1,500 or 1,600 parliamentarians, Deputies and Senators, since independence, only a small, albeit unacceptable, number were corrupt. The vast majority of politicians have always been hard-working, decent people.</P>
      <P>The cost of the tribunals is an important factor in determining how people judge their performance. Rightly or wrongly, this is the yardstick by which some people measure their workings. People are not ready to sift through a great deal of fine detail. Several interim reports have been published and much of the language used has been difficult to understand for the layman. Nevertheless, the value of the tribunals is being realised, particularly when one considers the manner in which Mr. Justice Flood was able to call a spade a spade in his interim report. He was able to state that Mr. X or Mr. Y was corrupt and <Col N="1882"/>took payments while abusing his public position to advance the cause or positions of private individuals. To reach the point at which the tribunal has correctly pointed a finger was a positive development.</P>
      <P>For many years, rumours abounded about corruption in the planning process in Dublin. The dogs in the street knew of them. Although the Garda investigated corruption in the early 1990s, it was unable to find someone who could provide names or proof that corruption took place or link corrupt payments with specific planning decisions. Thankfully, the tribunals have been able to do this. While costly, the tribunals have proved vital in exposing the corruption and dishonesty which characterised a number of individuals, particularly in the Dublin area, during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Flood, who has retired, deserves special mention, not least because he worked beyond retirement age on the tribunal he chaired. In addition to chairing many public hearings, he spent many days and weeks locked away in private investigation. With his distinguished legal career and expertise, he did considerable work and brought structure to the operation of the tribunal. His achievements as chairman of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments since its inception in 1997 went above and beyond the call of duty. The House must single him out in that regard.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Flood proved that private interests were advanced by those who abused public office and that some of the people who gave rise to the establishment of the tribunal deliberately obstructed and lied to it. He had no bones about calling a spade a spade and identifying the individuals responsible for the filth emanating from the tribunal.</P>
      <P>We can thank the inquiry for creating the culture of recent years whereby a light is shone into the area of planning, in particular, and public life in general. The element of transparency and expectation would not prevail had it not been for the work of the tribunals. It is, at a minimum, disappointing to learn in the interim reports of what everybody knew but nobody could prove until Mr. Justice Flood took the chair of the tribunal, namely, that a number of people, primarily developers, politicians and, specifically, one senior official of a local authority, worked hand in hand to ensure their material vested interests would be served at the price of honesty and transparency in public life.</P>
      <P>Senators know many public representatives working at local and national level. We know the amount of energy, commitment, hard work and effort invested in this role despite the absence of a guarantee that one will have one&rsquo;s job after the next election. One of the direct consequences of the behaviour of a small number of people involved in corruption was to bring opprobrium on all politicians of all persuasions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the costs of tribunals, the Mahon tribunal is in its seventh year, which is a <Col N="1883"/>long time. While we all realise the benefit of the tribunal and we hope it will achieve its overall objective, we must also be mindful that it is extremely expensive. Members of one profession have made millions out of the process. In April this year, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance told the Committee of Public Accounts that all tribunals and inquiries had, by that date, cost the State &euro;144 million, of which &euro;103 million was spent on legal costs. A further &euro;300 million was estimated for third party costs, which brings the total cost of tribunals at that date to well over &euro;400 million.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the efforts made by the T&aacute;naiste, while Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in the area of insurance and what has been achieved since the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established, on the recommendation of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board chaired by Dorothea Dowling. The Government considered the legal costs of insurance claims, namely, litigation and associated costs, the profits of the legal profession and the manner in which it made money out of young people from insurance policies. Having examined the issue, it decided the system was not fair and established two excellent boards, one as the consequence of the other. As a result, the price of insurance premia have fallen, albeit not on the scale which would make us all happy.</P>
      <P>Some representatives of the insurance industry and the legal profession did not want to know about the creation of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board or its successor. While insurance and the tribunals are different areas, the same principle applies. We need the services of solicitors, junior counsel and senior counsel but we need to examine the issue with a view to ensuring value for money is obtained and the amount of money spent on tribunals is worthwhile in terms of what they achieve. A good case has been made in favour of introducing a process of tendering. Provided the approach to the manner in which the costs of the tribunal are negotiated and settled is mindful and coherent, the process will be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>One of the satirical political television programmes of recent years concentrated five minutes of its 28-minute weekly production on two men in wigs and black gowns counting out money. While the programme took the mickey out of the system to an extent, it also displayed in no small way the mindset associated with the involvement of the legal profession in the tribunals and the manner in which the costs of the tribunals have escalated at an alarming rate in recent years. That said, the process is worthwhile. If we must admit it is a painstaking process, so be it. The work carried out by Mr. Justice Flood and, in the past year, Judge Mahon has helped to establish that we have confronted the issue. Proof is available that people corrupted the system.</P>
      <P>Senators must ensure the tribunal is allowed to operate within the remit it requires. We can <Col N="1884"/>amend its terms of reference to give it the powers and scope necessary to tackle the issues before it in a constructive fashion. That is a follow on from the debate in the D&aacute;il with regard to the appointment of two additional judges. This measure is expensive but absolutely necessary. When one considers the projected dates of the tribunal&rsquo;s conclusion, it reinforces the requirement for us to deliberate and ensure the enactment of legislation which will give the tribunal the powers it needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is a short but important and welcome Bill. Why has it taken so long to provide tribunals with the discretion necessary to allow them do their work more expeditiously? Nobody would agree to the original and untenable proposition that they might continue to 2014 or 2015. There has been widespread public dissatisfaction with the length of time and cost of the tribunals. We owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Justice Flood and Judge Mahon and members of the Judiciary involved in other tribunals for the work they do. However, there is understandable public disquiet. The public sees no concrete outcome; it sees tribunals dragging on interminably and lawyers getting fat in the process. However, the tribunals have carried out a valuable public exercise and the money has been well spent. Indeed, money has been derived for the Exchequer which it would otherwise not get. The net cost is perhaps not as dramatic as it could be.</P>
      <P>As Senator McCarthy said, the tribunals have shone a light into areas of public life that otherwise might never be subjected to such scrutiny. That is to be welcomed. Irrespective of the detailed outcome of the tribunals, their work has helped improve public governance, the relationship between Government and private enterprise and developers as well as the relationship between local authorities and those in private enterprise in pursuit of rezoning. In that regard, they have had a beneficial effect.</P>
      <P>The legislation is eminently sensible. I welcome the discretion conferred on the tribunal in paragraph J(6) of its terms of reference, as outlined by the Minister, with regard to deciding whether preliminary investigations take place in private or whether to initiate a preliminary investigation. Why did this not happen earlier?</P>
      <P>One cannot say, as Senator Bannon did, that tribunals are terrible, while all the parties in both Houses were vocal about the need for such inquiries. There was unanimity in establishing them and providing them with terms of reference. There is a question mark as to whether to use such a vehicle. The terms of reference were expanded at the request of the tribunal, but in future we may need to look more critically at drawing up more narrow terms. Otherwise the tribunal becomes open-ended.</P>
      <P>People have constitutional rights and they exercise these rights. It can be a frustration and impediment to the workings of tribunals. <Col N="1885"/>However, these rights must be vindicated, if necessary, through the courts.</P>
      <P>We must look at other ways of dealing with matters of this nature. The committee of investigation has been mentioned. One was recently and expeditiously carried out in the House of Commons and reached firm conclusions in a matter of a few weeks, rather than years. Much can be said about dealing with some of these matters by way of parliamentary inquiries or commissions, notwithstanding the case of Abbeylara which created its own difficulties. There are other methods of dealing with these matters and perhaps we must give them prominence. This is, however, based on hindsight. The original momentum to establish the tribunals was irresistible, and there was widespread public demand. It has, as Senator McCarthy said, shed light on certain areas.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Bannon&rsquo;s point about legalised corruption. If farmers, trade unions or any other group in society tried to defend actions similar to those of the legal profession, they would be shouted out of court. However, the Houses seem transfixed, like rabbits in the headlights, when confronting the legal profession. In terms of budget speeches, there was widespread and correct dissatisfaction with the small number of wealthy individuals and millionaires in this country who avoided tax. However, we allow enormous fees to be paid. Why can a tribunal not be like any other organ of State, in that it applies, works and sits office hours? Why is it tied to the terms of the court? Obviously, people must have holidays and I do not dispute that. However, it is based on the judicial system and the way matters are dealt with in the Four Courts. This is not appropriate for a tribunal. I do not know whether it is necessary and cannot be changed.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about penalties which might accrue from tribunal findings. Tribunals make findings of fact, people have a constitutional right to defend themselves and the court has a different way of doing things. Compared to other jurisdictions, such as France, the penalties applied here indicate a defect in the law.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon spoke about money for good planning. There is no question about the issue. Local authority planning departments have not been well endowed with funds and there have been many hold-ups and difficulties. However, it is wrong to say that if tribunals did not exist the money would be allocated to planning departments. It does not work like that. The money might go to planning departments, but I doubt that would happen. It has been said that the sum of &euro;160 million was the cost of bad planning. There is a lack of conjunction between the cost of the tribunal and what is required in terms of money for planning, and the cost of the planning system.</P>
      <P>The State is entitled to ask that highly paid and privileged people have some degree of morality. There is not much morality in the fees earned by extremely privileged individuals. There is a lack of conjunction between what they are paid and <Col N="1886"/>the resources of some of the people who must enter the doors of the Four Courts. However, that might be beside the point.</P>
      <P>The tribunals have been effective, irritating, frustrating and costly. However, they have performed a useful service. This legislation will improve how they operate and it is appropriate we give the tribunal the necessary discretion to expedite its work and reach its findings as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I also welcome the Minister to the House. He brings with him considerable experience in the area of planning. He has championed a number of causes in his own county and will bring this to bear in his role as Minister.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation which, as has been pointed out, bolsters and enhances previous amendments to various Acts relating to tribunals. The 1997 legislation has been amended a number of times, the most recent change being, as referred to by the Minister, the one which provided for the chairman to apply to the High Court for direction on the matter of costs and to divide up the work of the tribunal among different divisions as determined by him. These changes are welcome. The legislation, which was requested by the tribunal, will enhance work already being done.</P>
      <P>We must look again at why the tribunal was established. It was established to find the truth regarding grave accusations made against people in public life. If we are to continue to have confidence in the system in which we work and for which we are responsible we must ensure that public office is not used for private gain. The tribunal was established to find the truth. This legislation will enable the chairman and his staff to get to the truth quicker and in a more cost-effective manner. That, too, is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>It is when the tribunal has completed its work and due process has taken place &mdash; another basis on which the tribunal was established &mdash; that the D&aacute;il and Seanad will have to take appropriate action. We must work to overcome some of the legacies left to us and to restore trust in public life. The essence of the tribunal is an exercise in restoring that trust and we all have a role to play in that regard. The Minister referred to the raft of legislation introduced to deal with corruption. Other recently introduced legislation includes the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 introduced to deal with matters relating to general and local elections, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 introduced to deal with donations. Much of that legislation was introduced as a result of issues which took place before our time. The first tribunal Act was introduced in 1921; it is not a new phenomenon.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned that the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced provisions to deal with planning matters. It is up to Members of the Oireachtas to implement legislation and to ensure it works. Following the resignation of Mr. <Col N="1887"/>Justice Flood, legislation was enacted to deal with the issue of determining costs and to allow the current chairman to make an order on costs, part of which, as he was not chairman at the time, he would not have been party to. Despite everything we have done, there is widespread dissatisfaction about costs. Anyone who canvasses at doors or attends meetings on a regular basis is aware of that dissatisfaction. It is an issue with which we all have to deal, sometimes on a daily basis but, particularly, at election times. The public&rsquo;s cynicism is palpable. It is up to us to restore trust in the institutions in which we are involved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Commissions of Investigation Bill which will provide a different and more cost-effective mechanism for dealing with such issues. However, that legislation will not prevent the establishment of tribunals, if needed, subsequent to its findings. That is to be welcomed. The Law Reform Commission studied all aspects of tribunals and their implications and made recommendations which are being studied closely. The tribunal has, since its establishment in 1997, proved to be effective to a certain extent. However, it is becoming more difficult to justify costs and to convince the general public there will be results and consequences. It is up to us to ensure that is what happens. Legislation such as this will ensure that that happens sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide the chairman with the ability to finalise the proceedings to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction, including the tribunal&rsquo;s satisfaction, which is most important and will hopefully result in the restoration of some confidence in the structures in which we work.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section dealing with issues such as the age of witnesses. We all recall the pictures of Mr. Redmond in handcuffs being taken away from court. Perhaps that picture is what was needed for people to realise the consequences of their actions. We must bear in mind that the aim of the tribunal is to get at the truth. It is not an exercise in humiliation but in finding the truth and making recommendations based on the facts established in the course of its proceedings. This legislation will ensure that happens.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the tribunal indicated it may be 2014 or 2015 before its work is completed. It is essential this legislation is brought forward and implemented as quickly as possible as it may result in the tribunal completing its work in 2007 and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Bannon, Kitt, McCarthy, Dardis and Brady for their contributions. Senator Bannon was a little unfair in suggesting I would not accept amendments. It must be pointed out that the amendments tabled were out of order for the good reason that neither he nor I tied the hands of this House when the legislation was enacted in 1998. The process is well understood. The tribunal <Col N="1888"/>requests amendments and that is what prompted this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with Senator Bannon that more productive use could have been made of the massive resources employed in tribunals and nor do I disagree with Senator Dardis who said a degree of public scandal had been caused by the costs involved. To be fair to the tribunals, these arrangements were put in place by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The point has to be made that if these arrangements have proven to be unwise or unnecessarily cumbersome, the blame lies with us and not with the tribunals. Sometimes, when criticising what has happened, we tend to lose sight of that reality.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for the wide-ranging debate. I would like to touch on a number of the issues raised. I have already dealt with the issue of resources but, at the end of the day, it is important if we are to cleanse our system of the suspicion of corruption that we spend the necessary resources.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon also indicated his concern regarding corruption and suggested that not enough has been done. I suggest, with respect, that he is being a little unfair to himself and other Members of the Oireachtas. The Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a number of changes to deal with the issue of transparency. One issue dealt with in the conclusion of the report of the tribunal was the non-application of development charges in a particular case, which was an issue of corruption. Greater transparency has been created in the 2000 Act in that the whole system of charges, once decided in secrecy, are now decided by council members. Not only was more transparency created, a job was given to councillors. In the past several years, the Department has been proactive in providing policy advice and guidelines, for example, on residential densities, telecommunications masts and child care. I will shortly issue guidelines on one-off rural housing. Our planning system is and always has been more transparent than elsewhere and we are sometimes inclined to flail ourselves unnecessarily on this issue. Modern guidelines make the system more transparent.</P>
      <P>Senator Brady pointed out that arrangements for dealing with the planning code and disclosures of interests have been introduced. Legislation and a regulatory framework have been introduced that deal not just with the conduct of public representatives but also of public servants, a positive and beneficial development. The Local Government Act 2001 provides a comprehensive ethics framework for local government. The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 was also important legislation in this regard. The framework has the three basic requirements of annual declarations of interests, the disclosure of any interest in a matter coming before a local authority and the public register of interests. I put it to Senator Bannon that this is more transparent than the frameworks in place in most other European states. The Freedom of Information Act also provides for a sur<Col N="1889"/>prisingly open system. The final framework for separate national codes of conduct for local authority councillors and employees has been drafted. A framework that did not exist in the past is now being put in place. It did not exist in the past because people did not see the need for it. However, they see the need for it now.</P>
      <P>Other legislation against corruption has been introduced, such as the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001. It strengthens the laws on corruption by providing a presumption of corruption where there is proof that certain persons in public office received moneys. The Standards in Public Office Act 2001 is another important part of the architecture of preventing a recurrence of these events. Most Senators will accept that we cannot legislate to create standards. We as public representatives must create the standard and must be more vigilant than we were in the past. This is an issue for everyone holding public office. The corruption of one brings blame on us all. As Senator McCarthy said, if the thousands of individuals involved in both Houses of the Oireachtas and local government were taken into account over the years, corruption has not been a feature of our system. We have been remarkably lucky that there has been no corruption within the public administration body. Far too often, we are inclined to flagellate ourselves on this issue, rather than look at comparisons elsewhere. That is not to say that we should not strive for standards of excellence, but we have generally done so in the past.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon raised the matter of the fees structure continuing until 2007. On 17 November, I told the House it was not practical to introduce a change to the structure before the tribunal terminated on 31 March 2007. I made a joking reference to the fact that the date is my birthday. The best birthday present we could all have is that the tribunals will be wound up by then. A question was raised on the cut-off date, 16 December 2004, for submissions to the tribunal. As the tribunal has been operating for seven years, there are few people, even in the remotest parts of the island, who are not aware of their existence and have had adequate time to make submissions.</P>
      <P>This slight Bill will give the tribunal the self-discretion it should have been given in the first instance. When these issues came to public light, there was an anxiety on all sides of both Houses to get the tribunal up and running. No Member, however, anticipated the tribunal taking on a life of its own. The more modern arrangements introduced under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 are less cumbersome and inflexible. It must be remembered that the capacity to appoint a tribunal of inquiry into any other issue will always remain with the Oireachtas. We are not seeing the end of tribunals. Hopefully, we will see the end of the need for tribunals but the legislation will always be there.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon&rsquo;s amendments were not ruled out of order because of any inflexibility on this <Col N="1890"/>side of the House. It arises directly out of the 1998 legislation requiring the Oireachtas to respond to proposals that come from the tribunal and removes the capacity for us to adopt the type of additional amendments he wishes. I am sure other Senators wished to table similar amendments. Sadly, that is not the point at which we are. The measures to be introduced in the Bill are focused on meeting the requirements of Judge Mahon and his group. Tribunal meetings in plenary session have been a cumbersome device. We are now assured when the modules currently in public hearings are completed, different sessions of the tribunal will take place. That is how the tribunal intends to brings its work forward. I am grateful for the contributions made in the House. I do not wish to appear inflexible or arrogant, of which occasionally Ministers are accused when rejecting amendments. However, I am sure Senator Bannon understands the basis upon which the decisions were taken. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt corruption will continue and some system must be in place to deal with it. A system of tendering for lawyers must be introduced. Tribunals have been overshadowed by the cost issue. If one enters a public house or other forum in which people congregate, one will hear them talk about the cost of the tribunal process. They do not look at the purpose for which they were established, which was to deal with corruption. It is crazy and unjust that lawyers could receive &euro;2,400 per day in this society.</P>

My colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, successfully convinced the Minister of the merits of tendering for lawyers in the debate on the Commissions of Investigation Act. The Minister, Deputy Roche, is probably aware of that. I would like to see the same process being used to engage lawyers for tribunals of inquiry. Perhaps the Minister will consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be helpful and understand that Senator Bannon is anticipating my reply. I will not be as rude as Senator Brady has been by suggesting we should not hold our breath while waiting for Senator <Col N="1892"/>Bannon&rsquo;s party to return to government. I wish the Senator well.</P>
      <P>The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 contains several features aimed at cost control and management based on the experience of tribunals. Under the Act, a statement of cost must be prepared and a commission must use a competitive tendering process. It is not possible, however, to change half way through a process, which is the situation in which we find ourselves here. As I said to Senator Bannon, the learning experience in this area has been especially costly.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon asked reasonably what will happen when the tribunal finishes. We will be back in the position we were in before the tribunal was established. However, if complaints of wrongdoing come forward we will have recourse to the devices which have been put in place, including those provided in the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 and the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. The Oireachtas always has the option to establish new tribunals should the need arise. One cannot talk about putting in place a permanent tribunal however.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon made the point that the House has some responsibility in this area. When the tribunal was originally established, I was not a fan. It is a matter of record that I said we would be better served by spending the money on providing the fraud squad with the resources it needed, including forensic accounting skills. Those resources are still not in place. That was then and we are where we are. In the context of fees and tendering, Senator Bannon said it might be better to establish a standing committee of the Houses. I am not sure that is the case. The Roman poet, Juvenal, asked &ldquo;Who guards the guardians, who judges the judges?&rdquo; As I am not sure what the answer is, I will not ask who judges the judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>However, if we were to be the guardians and the judges of our own behaviour, the process would probably not have much validity in the public view. Perhaps in the longer term it will. While the architecture of processes and procedures in place is novel and largely untried, it certainly represents an improvement on the system in which there was either nothing or a tribunal. Now, one has a variety of options.</P>

    <sTitle>Decentralisation Programme.</sTitle>
    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>The announcement in December 2003 of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme provided a significant boost to the entire country. We in County Cavan were delighted that our county town, Cavan town, was one of the <Col N="1894"/>seven towns selected for one of the main Departments. The news of the reallocation of the headquarters of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to Cavan town was welcomed by my colleagues on Cavan County Council and Cavan Town Council and was a major confidence boost to the town and county of Cavan and surrounding counties. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my Oireachtas colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, the late county manager, Brian Johnston, and his officials, and Mr. Vincent Reynolds, chief executive officer, Cavan County Development Board, for their tremendous efforts in promoting Cavan town as a suitable location for decentralisation.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of suitable sites for the location of the headquarters of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources have been examined. I am most anxious that a decision be made and a site selected to allow us progress in regard to the relocation of the Department to Cavan town as soon as possible. I ask the Minister of State to make contact with the Office of Public Works and get an immediate decision on the choice of site in the town. The county manager, and all his senior officials, are anxious to work as closely as possible with the Office of Public Works to facilitate the acquisition of a suitable site. Progress can and should be made without further delay.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent letter to the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, and myself from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, reiterating the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the earliest possible implementation of its full decentralisation programme. I urge the Minister of State to make contact with the Office of Public Works so that a site can be acquired and we can get on with relocating over 400 civil servants to Cavan town as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Wilson for raising the issue regarding Cavan town and its hinterland. I am pleased to address the House this evening about the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, with particular regard to Cavan.</P>
      <P>I wish to start by reiterating the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to the decentralisation programme. I assure the Senator that the Office of Public Works, is, as a matter of priority, moving forward proposals to finalise the acquisition of a suitable site for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in Cavan town. As I am sure the Senator knows well, the Office of Public Works is pressing ahead with the procurement of suitable sites for all the locations involved in the decentralisation programme.</P>
      <P>As the Senator is no doubt aware, following the request for proposals for suitable sites or buildings, the OPW received in excess of 700 responses from landowners and developers throughout the country. These proposals were evaluated in a <Col N="1895"/>three-stranded framework as follows: first, an initial architectural assessment by the OPW architects; second, a valuation process of sites and buildings short-listed by the architects, undertaken by both the OPW and private sector valuers; and, third, an assessment by reference to the business needs and staff requirements of each decentralising Department or agency.</P>
      <P>In regard to Cavan town, I can confirm that the OPW is very close to reaching a final decision on the best site option for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The OPW received in the order of 20 proposals for the town. A number of these proposals have been short-listed by the OPW architects and valuation reports have been completed on the land options concerned.</P>
      <P>Also, the OPW is working with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on a detailed assessment of the business needs and technical requirements of the accommodation needed to meet the brief, with particular regard to the specialised requirements of the Geological Survey of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the OPW has opened negotiations with a number of landowners in the town. Once the fine-tuning of the Department&rsquo;s space requirement is completed, the OPW will purchase the site that best meets the Department&rsquo;s brief in keeping with the standards for the selection set out in the first decentralisation implementation group report.</P>
      <P>The main factors that will influence the OPW&rsquo;s decision on a site in Cavan are as follows: first, location, proximity to commercial, leisure and public facilities; second, size &mdash; the site must be capable of accommodating all of the Department&rsquo;s requirement for offices, support space, technical space and car-parking; third, value for money; fourth, appropriate zoning for development; and, fifth, access to a good quality road network and public transport.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that the decentralisation of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources headquarters will involve the transfer of some 388 positions to Cavan. To date, 176 persons have expressed an interest in transferring to Cavan through the central applications facility. I have no doubt that the number of applications for Cavan will increase as soon as the site purchase is completed and the indicative timetable for development of the site is published.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the acquisition of a suitable site for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in Cavan is being pursued and will be finalised as soon as possible. I am aware of the great interest Senator Wilson has shown in this topic and I assure him that his representations in this matter, which are ongoing, will be heeded and the matter progressed as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the House for my absence. I got caught out in terms of the time.</P>
      <P>A constituent of mine served in the Garda for 30 years. During that time he would have driven over 100,000 miles on Garda motorcycles; that is a conservative estimate. When he retired, with a distinguished record in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, he maintained his love for and interest in motorcycling. On applying for a licence as an individual, however, he was dismayed to learn that having served 30 years or more in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and having driven so many miles with a perfect record, he would have to apply for a provisional driving licence. As a result, he could not ride a motorbike with an engine over a certain cc. Basically, he was being treated like a 17 year old.</P>
      <P>I understand this is the position in many other counties but a little common sense should be applied in this regard. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to everyone involved in the emergency services, be it the fire service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the ambulance service. In unique cases such as those involving a retired member of the force who, while a member of the force, is entitled to use any motor vehicle but, on retiring with a perfect record, is asked to apply for a provisional licence, the Minister and the Government should show some latitude in granting such persons a full licence. They should not be forced to apply for a provisional driving licence and to resit the test. That is insulting to them. I hope the Minister will use common sense in examining the relevant legislation with a view to introducing a short amendment. The Road Traffic Bill is before the Houses and perhaps there is an opportunity in that Bill to deal with the problem. If not, perhaps it could be dealt with in this House. I am sure many of the Minister&rsquo;s own constituents may fall under the same remit. I ask the Minister to examine this issue and look forward to his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Transport, the Minister is not aware of the difficulty that may have arisen from the current driver licensing arrangements that apply to former members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Road Traffic Act 1961 requires that a person must hold a driving licence in order to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place. In order to obtain a driving licence the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999 require that documentation accompanying an application to a licensing authority for a driving licence must include a certificate of competency to drive. Normally, such a certificate is obtained when a person successfully undergoes the driving test. In the case of a former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, such a certificate of competency is not required to be submitted with an application for a driving licence, in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>An application for a driving licence from a former member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not require a certificate of competency arising from the successful completion of the driving test, <Col N="1897"/>where the applicant is a person who, as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within a period of five years prior to the date of the application, held a certificate issued by or on behalf of the Assistant Commissioner, training, in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to drive vehicles of the category to which the application relates and whose application is accompanied by a certificate by or on behalf of the said Assistant Commissioner that the person is competent to drive vehicles of that category. I assume if the person to whom Senator Browne referred made an appropriate application to the Assistant Commissioner, if he had experience in the relevant category, he would receive it. However, as his exclusive experience was in the area of motorcycles and that might have created a difficulty in his particular case.</P>
      <P>The application for a driving licence must be made to the licensing authority in whose functional area the person ordinarily resides. It is a matter for the appropriate licensing authority to determine the eligibility of a person for a driving licence and to issue licences.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not aware of any particular problem in regard to the processing of driving licence applications in respect of former members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who hold valid certificates issued by or on behalf of the Assistant Commissioner, training, by licensing authorities. If there are problems about which the Senator is aware, perhaps he could forward the relevant details to the Minister for Transport.</P>

	<P>I will forward the reply to the retired garda and I accept the comments made by the Minister of State. The difficulty in this case may be that the garda&rsquo;s certificate of competency did not issue before he retired. Many garda&iacute; may not think of that before they retire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important matter. I call on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the actions he proposes to take to resolve the impending postal dispute. Thousands of members of the Communications Workers Union will protest outside Leinster House tomorrow.</P>
      <P>This is a serious issue. There will be a strike tomorrow and the postal service will come to a standstill, which will create serious difficulty for the elderly, social welfare recipients, small businesses and people who want to send Christmas cards. The Minister should intervene in the dispute as quickly possible, although I acknowledge work is going on behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>The board of An Post decided in July to close the SDS division. The CWU has asked for a stay on the closure because its financial consultants <Col N="1898"/>examined the rationale behind the decision and found that SDS revenue should be higher and, consequently, its losses should be reduced. They want a stay on the closure until an independent party has been brought in to review the decision. I am concerned that the rural delivery postal network will be destroyed. It is a tremendous service and I am afraid it will be undermined.</P>
      <P>The Government has intervened on a number of occasions in disputes at CIE and Bus &Eacute;ireann. European law does not allow governments to support postal services but the British Government has invested more than £300 million in its rural postal network. A two-tier postal service is not needed but the Minister, An Post management and the unions must come together to address this serious issue. The Government cannot intervene<i> per se</i> but the Minister is working behind the scenes and I wish him well. The Government should find some way to provide funding.</P>
      <P>The non-payment of a national pay agreement increase to the CWU workers is a sticking point. Everybody in the company is in it together and I cannot believe the workers have been overlooked for this payment. I hope this will be resolved as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this serious issue. Mechanisms are available and, hopefully, everybody will sign up to resolving the issues involved. The postal sector has changed significantly in recent years following liberalisation of the European postal market and the movement of postal operators from national into international markets. Along with the increased competition arising from the liberalisation of the market, An Post also faces the challenge of falling mail volumes and competition from electronic substitution. It is important that An Post should be structured towards the newly emerging competitive market with high quality services and meeting customer needs the priority objectives of the company. With full liberalisation of the sector a possibility by 2009, the company must begin preparations in order to ensure that An Post continues to be a strong player in the domestic postal market.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances and following the heavy and unsustainable losses of &euro;43 million in 2003, the restructuring of An Post is essential if the company is to return to financial stability and to continue to provide customer focused services and sustainable employment for its staff, which all of us wish to see. The recovery strategy approved by the board in October 2003 sets out the basis on which the company, in partnership with the trades unions, can move forward. To progress the required restructuring, the management of An Post has been involved for several months in a dynamic negotiating process with the company&rsquo;s unions, including the Communications Workers Union, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.</P><Col N="1899"/>
      <P>Proposals on restructuring, brokered under the auspices of the LRC, have been put to An Post employees and the result of this ballot is expected this week. Regarding the closure of SDS, both parties have agreed that unresolved issues will be dealt with under talks chaired by Mr. Peter Cassells and that process is continuing.</P>
      <P>An Post and the CWU have agreed on Christmas delivery arrangements in a deal brokered by the Labour Relations Commission which covers overtime, casual workers, extra deliveries and so on. Specific local difficulties with the agreed Christmas arrangements which arose in Galway were resolved earlier at the LRC.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general industrial relations unrest, the CWU has obtained a mandate for strike action from its membership. The first manifestation of this action is a one-day strike scheduled for tomorrow. An Post anticipates that there will be no postal deliveries and that company post offices will be closed. The extensive sub-post office network will remain open. Arrangements have been put in place for social welfare recipients to ensure minimum disruption during the stoppage.</P>
      <P>As the Senator stated, the deep seated problems of An Post will not be resolved by strike <Col N="1900"/>action. The only way forward is for both sides to communicate and to use the industrial relations machinery of the State to tackle outstanding issues and, hopefully, resolve them to satisfaction. The critically important objective of restructuring the company remains an imperative. All parties have agreed that change in the company is necessary if it is to be financially viable and positioned to meet the competitive challenges that can be expected to intensify during the months and years ahead.</P>
      <P>I urge members of the union, together with management, to work through the established industrial relations procedures to resolve remaining areas of disagreement. Negotiations between the parties concerned provide a superior basis on which to solve the problems in An Post compared to strike action which, at the end of the day, solves nothing.</P>
      <P>An Post customers and the community at large are entitled to a postal service, especially at Christmas, and I hope all parties involved will ensure no further disruption of postal deliveries takes place. I hope that is helpful.</P>
