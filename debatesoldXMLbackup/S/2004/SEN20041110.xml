	<P>I have received notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce by-laws to move Eircom and ESB poles as they are a danger to users of county and regional roads.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide additional special language teachers for Sacred Heart national school, Hartstown, Dublin 15, which has an international pupil intake of 225 out of a total enrolment of 930 students.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, under Standing Order 30 I raised the matter of approximately 36,000 British passport holders on our electoral register who are unable to vote in the upcoming referendum on the EU constitution. I said this matter should be rectified, and the Leader kindly agreed to raise it with the Government to see whether these people would be entitled to vote in the referendum. Mr. Blair and the British Government have given a commitment that all citizens in the United Kingdom will be able to ratify the constitution, so why will 36,000 British passport holders be disenfranchised in our State when their fellow citizens will be able to vote on the matter? This is an EU-wide treaty and has nothing to do with our Constitution. It is a matter for the people of Europe as a whole to determine and ratify. I ask the Government, through the Leader, to raise the matter to see if a conclusion can be reached.</P>
      <P>Some eight months after the first appeal from the Mahon tribunal, the Government has decided to amend its terms of reference to ensure latitude in aspects of its investigations and allow for the three judges to deal with three separate cases at the same time. When will this matter come before the House? Has the Leader information on this? It is important the tribunal be allowed to get on with its work as it sees fit in the context of its terms of reference. This issue should be expedited, considering the matter was first brought to the attention of the House eight months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We are within a month of the budget and the Estimates will shortly be published. This will set the tone of taxation for the next year. Whatever people think of taxation, tax breaks and the importance of having an attractive tax regime, the idea that people who earn millions pay no tax at all is utterly unacceptable to ordinary people around the country. People should not be able to write off their entire tax obligation against tax breaks. This is wrong and should not be allowed. There should be a minimum amount below which people cannot drop. Some people pay no tax at all because of tax breaks. Since this information became available, there has been much misunderstanding as to why it should be the case. This inequity is unfair and we should deal with it.</P>
      <P>People with big jets, large amounts of money and residences abroad play ducks and drakes with the residency rule. Certain people who earn millions and pay no tax in this country are often presented as model employers. Some of them are able to claim non-residency on the basis they are out of the country at night because this is counted as a non-day in Ireland. I have no problem with non-residency rules and tax breaks but if somebody is in the country for any portion of any day, <Col N="963"/>it is a day. Anybody who earns millions should pay some form of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The best way to deal with people who claim to be non-residents is to require them to prove they are non-resident, rather than the reverse whereby the Revenue Commissioners must prove they are resident. We should adopt the approach of the United States. Any tax paid by Irish citizens abroad, if they are non-resident, should be offset against their Irish tax but if this still leaves them owing tax in Ireland, they should pay. That is what the United States requires its non-resident citizens to do.</P>
      <P>A company I will not mention by name announced this morning in Cork that 120 employees, some in Mitchelstown and others in Mallow, are to be moved to an office in Cork Airport because there are no suitable premises anywhere nearer. I thought we had partnership in this country, which would mean that such destructive decisions, which mess up people&rsquo;s lives and families, were not taken arbitrarily and announced out of thin air, but were negotiated and agreed on. I thought this was what partnership meant. I appeal to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to intervene on behalf of families whose lives have been turned upside down by a company which seems to be determined to emulate Ryanair in the quality of its industrial relations.</P>
      <P>As we speak, the brutal assault on Falluja continues. It is worth pointing out that all journalistic news reports from Falluja are currently subject to military censorship. This is not something I picked up from any of the Irish media but from the BBC in one of its reports. We have regularly asked for a debate in this House on the Middle East, and I know the Leader supports that. Before we have that debate I would like to see a statement from the Government as to whether it believes Kofi Annan is right when he says the assault on Falluja is illegal and foolish or whether it supports the US-led coalition in this brutal assault. The coalition will of course capture Falluja but will lose the minds of millions of Iraqi people in the process. Again I ask that we discuss in this House the implications of this extraordinarily foolish adventure in the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the adoption or otherwise of the European constitutional treaty, I am in agreement with Senator Brian Hayes that the franchise should be as wide as possible to the extent that all European citizens in this country should be able to vote. Such people can already vote in European elections and even stand for those elections if they so wish. Matters are not as simple as one might think because of our own Constitution. The difference between Ireland and the United Kingdom is that in the case of a constitutional amendment or the election of the President, only Irish citizens can vote. In the United Kingdom they do not elect their Head of State <Col N="964"/>and do not have constitutional referendums. They may hold a plebiscite but that is not the same. I suggest to the Leader that she ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government what might be possible in this area because the general proposition being made is reasonable and should, if possible, be adopted.</P>
      <P>The Middle East issue was raised yesterday by Senator Norris and others as it was today by Senator Ryan. It would be appropriate for us to return to the matter. We should not merely consider Iraq but must always give serious consideration to the situation in Palestine, given the circumstances there and the apparently imminent death of President Arafat. Hopefully there will be a peaceful transition of power there, the extremists on both sides can be resisted and the terms of the road map can be implemented. It would be appropriate for us to revisit that matter in the next few weeks; the House has a good tradition regarding such debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has stated that Fine Gael was guilty of anti-Garda propaganda. I do not know what evidence the Minister has for this assertion. I remind him that Fine Gael established the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That Minister has great cheek and arrogance to make such a statement, which is absolute rubbish. This is the same Minister who formerly asserted that garda&iacute; were taking bribes from journalists and who, when asked to substantiate the allegation, said &ldquo;I know what I know&rdquo;. It is galling to hear that Minister lecturing the Fine Gael Party and I will not tolerate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to address these issues. This is the same Minister who asserted that the IRA was involved in racketeering activities in the Dublin docklands but was again unable to follow up his allegation when asked to substantiate it. Accordingly, I regard the recent remarks about Fine Gael as cheek and arrogance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for an ongoing debate on the situation in Iraq, the slaughter now taking place there and the general situation in the Middle East. The Very Reverend Matthew Byrne, a former dean of Kildare, has written a wonderful article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent.</i> Reverend Byrne was a chaplain with the Royal Irish Fusiliers in the Korean War. He mentioned a young soldier in a trench and said it was very strange that politicians who have no qualms about waging war never fight themselves and do not know the young men or women being sent out to do their dirty work. He said that we have learned nothing from the First World War, the Second World War or the Korean War. He made <Col N="965"/>an excellent suggestion that the politicians who promote war should all be brought into one room and given one long sharp needle each with which they could prod each other; he guaranteed there would be no bloodshed in that room.</P>
      <P>We can learn an important lesson from this. I wish we had a system whereby we could bring someone such as the Reverend Byrne, a gentleman of such calibre, experience and insight, into this Chamber to address us. At times we feel we are not succeeding in having our voices heard but we must have them heard because otherwise chaos will prevail in the world in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues who have called for a debate on the Middle East, in particular the situation in Iraq, which is disastrous. A number of us said the attempt to take Falluja would have dire consequences. As Senator Ryan said, the coalition can physically take the city but the repercussions will continue for a long time.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said about politicians. Not a single child of any member of the House of Representatives or the Senate in the United States is currently fighting in Iraq. The members would worry a little more if they were worrying about their children.</P>
      <P>There is also a brutalisation of the military personnel in Iraq. In one of yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers there are reports of comments made by American soldiers which are chillingly similar to those made during the Vietnam War. It is not pleasant to hear such gloating and sneering remarks as, &ldquo;Yeah! Battle damage assessed.&rdquo;; &ldquo;Buildings gone. I got my kills.&rdquo;; &ldquo;I am coming down. I just love my<?oasys [jy?>job!&rdquo;. Many such quotations are given.</P>
      <P>I agree that a debate on the Middle East should be extended to the situation in Palestine which is currently very volatile because of the parlous health of Yasser Arafat. That however provides an opportunity for Ireland, with its role in the European Union, to help ensure at least some positive direction emerges from this tragic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I find myself slightly at odds with some of the comments made in the House today but that is not unusual. I agree with the need for a debate primarily focused on the Middle East in the light of what sadly seems like the impending death of President Arafat. It may not be widely known that Ireland not only plays a key role at a political level but that under our development aid programme we contribute directly to UNRA, which operates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. As my colleague Senator Norris knows, yesterday&rsquo;s debate at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs centred on the involvement of the various NGOs. Senator Ryan also attended that meeting. Perhaps I remembered Senator Norris because one contribution was more voluble than the other. In that context, we should consider what is happening in the Middle East but we should focus specifically on events in Palestine and Israel. I am sure the Leader and Members on <Col N="966"/>all sides will agree this is where the key to providing solutions to the ongoing problems lies. Prime Minister Blair publicly stated in recent days that in his first post-election meeting with President Bush he intends to make that issue the focus of the bilateral dialogue. As a result of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the region, it would be appropriate for the House to engage in a debate on the matter. Perhaps the Leader will set time aside for such a debate, in which my focus would be on the Middle East rather than events in Iraq.</P>
      <P>Despite the pro or anti rhetoric we have heard this morning, from a human perspective we should think of the families who are being killed. We should also consider the families of those dying on the other side of the battle in Iraq. We sometimes lose sight, with all the rhetoric being uttered, of the human cost of war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s call for statements regarding comments made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. What the Minister said is somewhat rich, particularly as he does not trust the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What was the first issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite her friend, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to come before the House to debate the removal of the means test for those providing continuous care to people with high-care requirements? In a time of plenty, it is shameful that fewer than half of those who cater for the needs of people who required full-time care are not receiving support from the State. The removal of the means test relating to the individuals to whom I refer should be addressed in the <Col N="967"/>forthcoming budget. Women who are providing care are being discriminated against on foot of their husbands&rsquo; or partners&rsquo; incomes. This matter must also be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues of national importance which will have an impact on rural communities. First, will the Leader contact the director of the RTE Authority regarding its coverage of the story involving variant CJD. Unfortunately, the first case of a human contracting the disease in this country has been confirmed. RTE appears to be hell bent on doing maximum damage to the agricultural sector, particularly the beef industry, by showing the famous footage of the mad cow on its evening news programme which goes out at dinner time. Such animals never enter the food chain. Will the Leader call for greater sensitivity on the part of RTE in respect of the beef industry?</P>
      <P>My second point relates to rural Garda stations. Will the Leader ask the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to explain why the pilot project in respect of eight stations in Limerick and Tipperary is not proceeding? Despite significant involvement of consultants and the putting forward of a private solution in respect of the difficulties relating to this matter, the project has collapsed because it is not attractive. The same difficulties exist in respect of 100 Garda stations in other rural areas. Will the Leader invite the Minister of State to come before the House to outline how he proposes to deal with this matter, which is another clear indication of the effect of lack of planning and bad Government decisions on rural communities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to preserve the part of the REP scheme which comes under her Department&rsquo;s remit? There has been a serious intrusion in this area on the part of other agencies, particularly local authorities. Farmers are being obliged to suffer an invasion of inspection personnel. This is a total waste of money and it is undermining the REP scheme because anything up to 12 people from various agencies can inspect a particular farm. The REP scheme has done wonderful work in terms of preserving rural areas and organising farming in an environmentally friendly way. However, it is a waste of resources to have representatives of local authorities and various safety agencies involved in the same kind of inspections of farms. Will the Minister for Agriculture and Food streamline the inspection process and stop the intimidation being visited upon the farming community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come before the House to discuss the recent decision by the Attorney General to issue a letter to local authorities in respect of the waste collection waiver scheme? I understand the <Col N="968"/>Attorney General has advised county managers that the scheme should not be allowed for in their estimates when they are framing their budgets. This will have a severe impact on the marginalised in society. It will not affect private waste collection services but it will have an effect on local authorities which still carry out waste collections.</P>
      <P>In light of President Bush&rsquo;s election victory last week, are there any plans to invite him to make an address to a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas? He has not done so to date and almost every other recent President of the United States has made such an address. Perhaps it is time to issue an invitation to Mr. Bush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on the Middle East. We must keep this matter to the fore in terms of our foreign policy. I look forward to discussing the issues and I hope the Leader will make time available for a debate in the near future.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House. It is time we listened to the policies put forward by one of the most reforming Ministers for Justice-&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, referred to people&rsquo;s eligibility to vote on the EU constitution. We notified the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, about that matter. The people to whom the Senator referred could only vote if some new procedure was brought forward and it would require a change to the Constitution. I have left the matter in the hands of the Minister. This is an important issue because people in other countries will all be able to vote on what is a fundamental right.</P>
      <P>The Senator also inquired if the matter of the amendment of the terms of reference of the Mahon tribunal would come before the House. The matter will have to be debated by both Houses. When the additional judges were appointed, the House dealt with the matter. I imagine that we will not only have to deal with the amendment of the terms of reference but Judge Mahon will also be obliged to announce the matters he does not intend to proceed with, otherwise the matter would be deemed incorrect. We will be dealing with the amendment in this House, hopefully next week or the week after. We sought clarification on the matter before the Order of Business but we were not able to locate the person to whom I wished to speak. I will be able to give details to the House tomorrow.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole when he states he sees nothing wrong with tax breaks nor with the residency matter to do with living abroad. However, everybody should pay some tax and I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s point that there should be a limit. I do not believe anybody would have any gripe about that. Everyone in the PAYE sector and all those who pay tax must have their noses out of joint when they read about the number of people who are getting away with paying no tax. They use legitimate tax breaks to plead their case. The Senator&rsquo;s point is that they should not be <Col N="970"/>allowed relief on their total income in that manner.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the firm moving to Cork Airport. He asked for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to deal with the matter. He also raised the question of the brutal assault on Falluja and asked for a debate on the Middle East. That debate has been requested and I hope it can be held next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis is in agreement with Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s general proposition on voting rights but is of the opinion there would be a need for constitutional change. He asked for a debate on the Middle East and Palestine.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane referred to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, accusing Fine Gael of anti-Garda propaganda and he asked that the Minister come to the House. Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked for a debate on Iraq. He referred to the retired dean of Kildare, the Reverend Matthew Byrne, who was the Church of Ireland chaplain to the Defence Forces. The Senator referred to an article written by Reverend Byrne. As always when Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; speaks on these matters, he has the gift of allowing the integrity of the person shine through. The Senator made excellent points.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asked for a debate on Iraq and referred to the gloating words used. He also supports the call for a debate on Palestine and the parlous health of President Arafat. That debate is well due and it may be held next week. Senator Mooney asked for a debate on the Middle East. He asked that the families of the dead and injured soldiers be given some consideration. I was unable to hear Senator Bannon&rsquo;s first point because of the r&iacute; r&aacute; in the Chamber.</P>

The Senator&rsquo;s point was well made but it would be neither possible nor correct to have that discussion with the Minister in a pre-budget situation. Senator Bannon also referred to the matter involving the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>
      <P>Senator Coonan complained that RTE is showing pictures of the staggering cow at inappropriate times and therefore damaging the rural community. He asked a question about the eight pilot programmes in Tipperary and Limerick involving rural Garda stations which are not now being proceeded with. He asked that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, come to the House to explain the situation.</P><Col N="971"/>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke asked that the Minister for Agriculture and Food keep the REP scheme within her Department and he spoke about the serious intrusion in this area on the part of other agencies, particularly local authorities. I presume their purpose is one of health and safety. The Senator asked for codification of what is happening.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne proposed that the President of the United States of America be invited to address the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Senator might be the only listener. We will not be issuing him an invitation; it would be for a higher body to so do. Senator Minihan gave a very spirited defence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I regard him as a very fine Minister. He always comes to this House when invited. He is open, he listens to the points made and he stays for the full debate. He deals with amendments. I have no complaints about him and I am sure the Cathaoirleach feels the same. I imagine the Minister would be very heartened by Senator Minihan&rsquo;s contribution. The Senator should send a video of his contribution to the Minister and the Senator will go higher up the ladder.</P>

    <Title>Competitiveness and Consumer Protection Policy: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this House as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, particularly on the vitally important areas of competitiveness and consumer policy, which fall within the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business heard from the chief executive of a major supermarket multiple on the reason supermarket prices are higher in this country than elsewhere. Last month, the National Competitiveness Council published its statement on prices and costs and its annual competitiveness reports outlining the cost disparity between here and other countries.</P>
      <P>We have very compelling evidence. We also have robust analysis and no shortage of prescriptions. The National Competitiveness Council has given us a set of recommendations highlighting the areas of action on which we should focus. We also have the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group to take us forward.</P>
      <P>The first point I would like to make clear is that tackling the issues of competitiveness and costs, both consumer costs and the costs faced by business, will be one of my major priority areas over the coming two years. I will shortly set out the actions I will be taking in my Department to address the cost and competitiveness issues but it is useful, first, to set things in context.</P><Col N="972"/>
      <P>It is interesting to reflect and recall where Ireland has come from in terms of prosperity over the past ten years. We are now the second wealthiest country in the European Union, after Luxembourg, having been one of the poorest as recently as a decade ago. This remarkable pace of development has brought us to a situation of virtually full employment. This is perhaps the most important factor in assessing the real level of prosperity here and one of which we should feel justly proud. Furthermore, our recent prosperity means we can now afford to look to the future in terms of investment in the sources of growth for the next generation, particularly publicly-funded research and development, and provide better for the social needs of the current population.</P>
      <P>Behind this modern legacy lies a deep and firm commitment on the part of the Government to competitiveness and growth. Ireland&rsquo;s competitive success has been and continues to be built on key competitive strengths such as having one of the most favourable taxation regimes in Europe, access to the European Union&rsquo;s Internal Market, a well-educated and skilled workforce and a history of pursuing Government policies that are pro-business, investment driven and which provide a benign business environment. Furthermore, our modern legacy is uniquely and most importantly underpinned by a shared commitment between the social partners on sustaining the progress we have made.</P>
      <P>I would like to give the House some figures, which I believe tell their own story. In 2003, the labour market was particularly resilient, with employment growth of 1.9% creating 33,600 new jobs. This strong employment growth, while much lower than some of the rates recorded over the past decade, kept average unemployment for 2003 at a comparatively low rate of 4.6%. Despite the appreciation of the euro, the Irish economy grew last year by 2.8% in GNP terms and 3.7% in GDP terms. The performance of business, both on the part of our overseas investors and our increasingly important home-grown industry, continues to strengthen even in the face of the recent adverse global trading conditions. The performance of Irish industry has also been robust. Last year, Enterprise Ireland reported &euro;1 billion in new export sales and 60 new high export growth companies established.</P>
      <P>These positive trends are continuing this year. Significant improvements have been recorded in the growth of GNP, employment and a reduction in the unemployment rate during 2004. Foreign direct investment, business confidence and industrial output have also all recovered strongly in 2004. According to the National Competitiveness Council the essence of national competitiveness is how we capture economic benefits available from industries ensuring that they locate and develop within our jurisdiction. By any standards we continue to perform well in terms of our attractiveness to industry and providing employment to our citizens.</P><Col N="973"/>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to competitiveness and growth is a mirror reflection of the basic objectives of the European Union&rsquo;s Lisbon goal to make the European Union the most competitive, knowledge-based society. Ireland is playing a strong part in this process which I will briefly illustrate.</P>
      <P>Ireland is set to maintain its public finances so that it continues to meet the terms of the EU Stability and Growth Pact. Sound public finances provide the basis for GDP growth averaging approximately 5% per annum over the coming period. That is well above the European 15 average.</P>
      <P>Inflation levels here have also fallen significantly in recent years. Measured on a harmonised basis, the differential between Irish inflation and the euro area average has narrowed significantly since the start of 2003.</P>
      <P>In line with the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda, tax policy in recent years has been geared to promoting a job-friendly environment in order to facilitate robust employment growth. Over the period since 2000, the Government has successfully continued its policy of alleviating the tax pressure on labour, particularly on the low paid.</P>
      <P>Concerning the composition of public expenditure, Ireland&rsquo;s level of public investment, at 5% of GNP, is among the highest in the European Union and is twice the EU average. Public investment under the national development plan is targeted at addressing the infrastructure deficit, investment in research and development, education, employment supports and training. These are investments in our future prosperity and competitiveness. Significantly, they are also bringing us closer in our transition to the Lisbon goals.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these facts, we cannot stand still and we should not be complacent. There are challenges and the Government is committed to taking action to address both the shorter and longer-term competitiveness issues that have arisen. The National Competitiveness Council and the enterprise strategy group have given us a set of prescriptions in the following key areas. These are enterprise development and entrepreneurship, innovation, science and research and development and the business and work environment, including regulatory reform, consumer and competition policy.</P>
      <P>These are among the key foundations of our competitiveness in terms of how we influence the competitiveness and cost environment both now and into the future.</P>
      <P>An enterprise strategy group was set up in 2003 to prepare an enterprise strategy for growth and employment in Ireland up to the year 2015. The group&rsquo;s report, published in July 2004, identifies the areas that need to be addressed to ensure success in the new knowledge economy. The report indicates the five key areas in which Ireland can establish sustainable competitive advantage which are as follows: developing an expertise in international markets so that business can be <Col N="974"/>more responsive to the needs of customers; building a world-class research and innovation capability to support the development of high-quality, high value products and services; renewing Ireland&rsquo;s historic commitment to education and training to provide the skills base industry will need; maintaining a competitive tax environment to drive economic growth; and providing capable and flexible Government that can quickly identify policies for facilitating change and implement those policies in a cohesive manner.</P>
      <P>That last point is important because many people who have located here have pointed to the responsiveness of Government to business and enterprise coming into the country and the capacity of Government to respond quickly to any obstacles or issues that arise and facilitate not just the location but the start-up and development of industry here. They would compare us very favourably with any other government in Europe. Sometimes the political system does not give itself enough credit in terms of the job creation agenda and the role it plays in facilitating both the attraction and expansion of industry in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the report of the enterprise strategy group will be significant in terms of setting competitive industrial policy for the Irish economy. The report identifies the need for firms here to complement their existing production and operational strengths with new capabilities. Irish enterprise will need to focus on developing expertise in international markets to promote sales growth. It will also need to focus on building technological and applied research and development capability to support the development of high-value products and services. That in turn will involve working with Enterprise Ireland in terms of restructuring and reorganising the skills sets so that Enterprise Ireland is in a position to assist Irish companies in their internationalisation process. The second major leg of that is to develop the research and development capability of indigenous enterprise, which is a significant challenge going forward.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be bringing an action plan to Government on the implementation of the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group. This will focus on what is being done to give real effect to those recommendations. Enterprise in Ireland has supplied the oxygen for prosperity, provided the basis for unprecedented employment growth and the resources for social progress and investment. I want to ensure that enterprise and enterprise issues are embedded at the heart of Government policy and will be recommending new structures to see that this is achieved.</P>
      <P>Today, Ireland is widely recognised for its high level of performance in an investment driven context. We secure a disproportionate share of foreign direct investment relative to our size and have become the location of choice for manufacturing and international services in areas such as electronics, pharmaceuticals and financial <Col N="975"/>services. We are an exceptionally open economy, critically dependent on trade. As a result of our willingness to embrace openness we have benefited hugely from the creation of the Single Market within the European Union and from the wider trend towards global trade liberalisation but the process that has yielded those benefits also brings challenges. Put simply, the industrial structure which was appropriate to our development in the late 20th century will not serve us in the new millennium. Many developing countries are now competing to be the location of choice for routine manufacturing operations and lower value added industries, and rightly so. It is a step on the same staircase to prosperity that we took. As our competitors ascend the staircase, we must also keep moving upwards.</P>
      <P>Our challenge is the direct and demanding one of moving from being an investment-driven economy to an innovation and knowledge driven economy. A central part of that is to dramatically improve our performance as a world-class research centre.</P>
      <P>I view the research agenda as one of the most important parts of my wide-ranging departmental brief.</P>
      <P>Our national research and development action plan has set an overall objective, namely, that Ireland, by 2010, will be internationally renowned for the excellence of its research and be at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress within an innovation-driven culture. The action plan sets targets by which the objective can be realised. The most important of these are as follows: gross expenditure on research and development should increase from 1.4% of GNP in 2001 to 2.5% of GNP by 2010; business expenditure on research and development should increase from &euro;917 million in 2001 to &euro;2.5 billion by 2010; research and development investment in the higher education and Government sectors should increase from &euro;422 million in 2001 to &euro;1.1 billion by 2010; and the number of researchers should increase from 5.1 per 1,000 employees in 2001 to 9.3 per 1,000 employees by 2010. While these are challenging targets, they represent the kinds of metrics we need to achieve if we are to come close to the research and development performance of the economies we wish to emulate. More important, they are achievable.</P>
      <P>If we want to be a world-class economy and generate the resources to support the level and quality of services to which we aspire, below average or average research spending is not good enough. We must aim to be one of the most research intensive countries in the developed world. In a recent speech on the challenge of research and development, I outlined steps I intend to take via the Cabinet sub-committee on research to set clear intermediate targets and put flesh on the bones of how we will achieve the Lisbon targets by 2010. We will ask the various funding groups involved in the research area to <Col N="976"/>come together and chart the way forward on a step-by-step basis to enable us to benchmark and monitor progress over the next six years.</P>
      <P>Regulatory reform, while perhaps not the most exciting subject, is one on which incremental progress can make a real difference to the red tape burden faced by business and, consequently, the costs it faces. I am pleased an initiative commenced during the Irish Presidency is bearing fruit. At the European Union Competitiveness Council later this month I hope we will be able to agree a list of priority areas of law for simplification. Following a joint initiative with my Dutch counterpart, we asked member states for a list of burdensome or complex rules amenable to simplification. This trawl around the European Union produced a list of 330 rules and regulations. The European Commission, in the context of its new rolling simplification programme, will examine each of these rules and address the problem areas. These EU rules have a bearing on the red tape burden faced by business here. This was a practical and effective initiative which will bring results.</P>
      <P>In January this year the Government published its White Paper, Regulating Better, which sets out six core principles of better regulation and a detailed action plan. It covers actions to deal with the stock of existing legislation, including provision for sectoral regulatory reviews, an ongoing programme of statute law revision and a major review of pre-1922 legislation to streamline the Statute Book. In terms of the flow of new regulations, the Government White Paper signals the introduction of regulatory impact analysis in support of a more evidence-based approach to policy making. This will facilitate better understanding of the burdens and costs associated with proposed new significant regulations and provide for better consultation with the business sector and wider society.</P>
      <P>With regard to sectoral regulatory reforms, progress has continued in a number of areas. There are ongoing reviews of certain building, legal, medical and construction professions by the Competition Authority which, when completed, may have regulatory implications. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has developed proposals for major reform in the liquor licensing area. Other work is ongoing towards codifying the law governing particular sectors, such as company and consumer law, conveyancing law, criminal law and social welfare law.</P>
      <P>The consumer agenda is extremely important for a modern market economy. Knowing that we are getting a fair price and value for money for the goods and services we purchase is what matters to consumers and is critical to ensuring that our economy remains competitive. There is growing concern that consumers are paying more for many goods and services than their counterparts in other European countries. Why is this the case and what can be done about it?</P><Col N="977"/>
      <P>The most effective way to positively impact on price levels in the interests of ordinary consumers is to facilitate effective competition. To do this we must ensure shoppers have a choice across the entire spectrum of consumer goods and services. We must guarantee that choice can be exercised in an informed manner in order that consumers can get the best value available in the goods and services they require.</P>
      <P>Exercising choice is only part of the solution. Consumers must be protected from unscrupulous traders. A comprehensive and easily understood body of consumer protection law must be in place, consumers must know their rights and have easy access to redress when things go wrong. There must also be adequate sanctions against unscrupulous traders who break the law and take consumers for granted.</P>
      <P>Considerable responsibility and obligations rest with business which must learn to value a satisfied customer and understand that giving value for money makes good business sense. Customers who have not obtained value for money will not return or encourage others to do so. Where choice does not exist, we must ensure a regulatory regime is in place which guarantees fair competition and allows others into the market to provide the choice customers want and deserve.</P>
      <P>The Government is tackling the consumer agenda on all these fronts. We have legislation in place which ensures consumers are provided with clear price information prior to making a decision to purchase goods. Traders who do not display prices in the required manner are liable to prosecution. We have reviewed the level of fines for breaches of consumer legislation and I will shortly introduce legislation to update these and bring them into line with the demands of a modern economy.</P>
      <P>My Department has worked closely with the Central Statistics Office, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland and Forf&aacute;s on the issue of price transparency. This resulted in the publication last July, for the first time, of the CSO consumer average price analysis for Dublin and outside Dublin for May 2004. My Department proposes to continue to work with all interested parties to consider if there is further potential to build on this initiative so as to enhance price transparency for consumers and empower them to seek out the best value possible.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has published and highlighted the results of price surveys on products such as petrol, potatoes, over-the-counter medicines, compact discs and drink price increases coinciding with major sporting and social events. These provide valuable information for consumers wishing to make informed purchasing decisions.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious that confident and discerning consumers play a key role in making the businesses with which they interact more competitive. If business listens to and acts upon customer comments and complaints, it leads to <Col N="978"/>improved goods and services and the possible identification of innovations to win more customers.</P>
      <P>The consumer strategy group was established last March to advise on the development of a national consumer policy strategy. The group is focusing on the key principles guiding the consumer agenda, namely, access, safeguards, advice and support, redress, consumer power and business and the consumer. In the performance of this role the group is carrying out a range of activities, including studies investigating issues of special concern. The studies are intended to identify areas where policy intervention could lead to improved consumer access, choice, and redress. I expect the group&rsquo;s recommendation to form the basis of national consumer policy over the coming years. I look forward to receiving its final report, which is due at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Commentators on consumer issues often raise the issue of price control as a possible measure to curb price inflation. Price controls do not have any part in a modern economy. Price control is a crude instrument, which has been proven to be ineffective. It does not encourage cost efficiency, positively discourages pricing based on market forces and it distorts markets by preventing justified price rises due to higher costs incurred by business. When we had stringent price control in the 1970s inflation was running at up to 25% and the maximum price set for a product was nearly always the minimum price. Consumers had little choice and considerable manpower resources were utilised in trying to police a system which had no real benefit to the economy and is now judged to have been detrimental to consumer interests.</P>
      <P>There is a more powerful alternative to price control. Developments in sectors such as the airline industry have shown that competition is the key to bringing better value for the consumer. The Competition Authority has the resources and autonomy to investigate the reasons for price levels, which do not seem justifiable and to report publicly on its findings. I have already mentioned ongoing reviews of certain professions by the authority. The authority has the necessary powers to investigate price fixing and other anti-competitive practices. My priority is to ensure the removal of unwarranted restrictions on competition in all sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>The Government has tackled with determination the issue of high insurance costs. Initiatives such as the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board have helped to drive down insurance costs and business and ordinary consumers are reaping the benefits in the form of lower premiums and greater choice as a result of new entrants into the market.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken decisive action to ensure a fair deal for the consumers of financial products. The new consumer director of IFSRA, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, has already demonstrated her determi<Col N="979"/>nation to ensure the interests of consumers are adequately represented and protected.</P>
      <P>These are just some of the actions being taken in the area of competition and consumer policy. For example, we continue to provide funding to the Consumers Association of Ireland and contribute to the anti-inflation group established under Sustaining Progress. A key issue identified by this group has been wage inflation.</P>
      <P>A critical issue for the next round of social partnership talks will be the issue of wage competitiveness. The evidence we heard at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business is stark. The latest figures from EUROSTAT show that Ireland continues to be sharply out of line with other EU countries in terms of real wage increases for the period 1998 to 2003. During this period Irish wages increased by 12.1% compared with 5.5% growth in the then 15 EU member states. We cannot ignore this evidence if we are serious about sustaining our progress.</P>
      <P>Competitiveness is not just an issue for the Government. The Government, for its part, is determined to address competitiveness and cost issues. We intend to do so in consultation with all the social partners to help create and maintain the dynamic, innovative, competitive economy which we aspire to now and for the next generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for the first time in his new role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I warmly congratulate him on his appointment. I thank him for a comprehensive outline of his views and intentions and for addressing the many challenges ahead.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of a competitive tax environment to drive economic growth is vital and a goal to which we all subscribe. I wish the Minister well with the outcome of the report of the enterprise strategy group and I hope the bringing of that report to the Government will lead to success for our economy. One of the biggest challenges referred to by the Minister was the demanding one of moving from an investment-driven economy to an innovation and knowledge-driven economy.</P>
      <P>We wish the Minister well in regard to all of these challenges and goals, to which we all subscribe. However, the facts in the Ireland of 2004 are as follows. Two years ago the Government promised to keep personal and business taxes down in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy. In the following two years it implemented 31 stealth tax rises which cost the average family &euro;1,800 per year. The average tax contribution per household this year increased by &euro;2,800. Between 2001 and 2002, Ireland overtook the UK and Sweden to become the third most expensive country in the EU for consumer goods and services. By 2003, Ireland was almost on a par with Finland as the most expensive country within the euro zone, <Col N="980"/>both countries being significantly more expensive than the next group of euro zone countries.</P>
      <P>Dublin is now the 21st most expensive city in the world and more expensive than Los Angeles, Paris, Miami, Singapore, Honolulu, Vienna, Helsinki and Abu Dhabi. It is the fourth most expensive capital in the EU, behind London, Paris and Copenhagen. Ireland has gone from fourth in 2000 to 30th this year in the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s global competitiveness report, due mainly to the Government&rsquo;s failure to control prices.</P>
      <P>The National Competitiveness Council stated that Irish prices rose 22% more than those in other EU countries in the years 1999 to 2003. Economic consultants Compecon Limited suggested the lack of competition in the banking sector is costing small business &euro;500 million. The National Competitiveness Council stated in its 2004 annual report that the need to recover cost competitiveness was crucial to the country&rsquo;s medium-term economic future. Ireland came 14th out of 15 countries in terms of broadband penetration in a survey by the European Competitive Telecommunications Association. It has only 63,610 broadband telephone lines whereas Denmark, a country of similar size, has 839,170.</P>
      <P>This, unfortunately, is the record of the outgoing Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. In March 2000, she stated the Government was determined to tackle inflation by exposing previously sheltered sectors to competition. In September 2000 she stated that huge areas of the economy were still not exposed to competition, that this put pressure on inflation and that if competition was our yardstick, we had much more to do. She pointed to the telecommunications industry as an example, stating that the introduction of competition there had substantially reduced prices and improved quality, and that this must also apply in other sectors of the economy. She further stated that taxation of work was still too high and that in an environment where there was 20% tax on capital gains and 12.5% tax on corporation profits, we could not have a situation where the only people paying taxes above 40% and 20% were those who work. The T&aacute;naiste also remarked that low to medium income earners &mdash; for example, those earning below the minimum wage &mdash; should not have to pay any tax.</P>
      <P>In November 2001 she stated that job losses in Irish industry have less to do with the ownership of enterprises than loss of competitiveness. It is now almost 2005 and nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>Small Business has borne the brunt of the Government&rsquo;s abject failure to protect our international competitiveness. The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association has warned that 35,000 small firm jobs are in danger. According to a survey carried out by the association, one quarter of companies stated they expect to be employing less people this year. The same survey showed that most small business owners perceive <Col N="981"/>the Government as being regulators of small business instead of facilitators.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in achieving the goals he outlined in regard to a code of simplification. The Minister knows and we all accept that red tape and bureaucracy is bedevilling small businesses in particular in every part of the country. As I stated recently in the House, one of the best measures we could take on behalf of small businesses would be to increase the VAT threshold &mdash; the limit at which VAT applies. It would be an easy measure to take in an area that has not been touched for a considerable period and is crying out for redress. I urge the Minister to speak to the Minister for Finance in this regard so that, hopefully, this can be put right in the upcoming budget.</P>
      <P>Mr. Jim Power, chief economist with Friends First, stated that Irish competitiveness has been seriously eroded by a sharp increase in the overall cost base, which will not be reversible. He further pointed out that to ensure the future prosperity of the Irish economy it is absolutely essential that investment in education to upskill the workforce, and a correction of the very damaging infrasturctural deficit, are given immediate real priority, not just lip-service. However, this is not the preserve of high-flying economists. Fine Gael&rsquo;s website, <i>www.ripoff.ie</i>, received 50,000 visitors in its first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to hearing from Senator Leyden on that as he was the first Senator to introduce the concept of &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; to the House. Visitors to the website told us their stories first-hand. Lest the Government think rip-off Ireland is a myth, as a Minister from my part of the country stated last week, I will detail some of the e-mails received on this issue. One sober Dubliner wrote that by the time he had paid the entrance fee to a local pub and bought one glass of cola, he had forked<?oasys [jy?>out &euro;11.50. A ripped-off, health-conscious customer was charged &euro;18.64 for a small organic chicken in a local supermarket. One visitor to the <i>www.ripoff.ie</i> site stated that he paid &euro;19,000 for his new car. Later, a kind friend e-mailed him a link to a German car dealer who was charging &euro;10,500 for the same vehicle. New homeowners e-mailed the website complaining that the builders requested &euro;70 to install the necessary wiring for a doorbell. The cost of a bottle of Irish whiskey &mdash; distilled and bottled in this country &mdash; is cheaper in Boston duty free shops than in Irish airports. Rip-off Ireland is now as topical as the weather in conversation.</P>
      <P>The solution to the problem must be rooted in a vigorous adherence to the principle of competition, ending the practice of the Government becoming the godfather of rip-off through more stealth taxes and increased charges. It must also be rooted in respect for the consumer in the same way as producers, employers and unions are <Col N="982"/>respected. It must involve a reassessment of social partnership and a reappraisal of how things are done. The Fine Gael Party has already taken the first step by outlining its proposals on the creation of a consumer rights enforcer. I was glad to note the Minister spoke about introducing a similar post.</P>
      <P>However, we propose that the consumer rights enforcer will conduct regular price surveys, highlighting good value while naming and shaming those charging excessive prices. The enforcer would create a price league website with tables on all major products and develop codes of conduct for service providers and retailers on issues such as passing on exchange rate movements. The enforcer would also devise and promote a good practice provider quality mark for suppliers of goods and services that agree to be bound by relevant codes of practice. The enforcer would work with local authorities to drive a pro-consumer agenda at local level involving regular price surveys and measures that protect consumers&rsquo; interests against local cartels. The enforcer would also have the power to impose fines for non-display of price lists in petrol stations, pubs, hairdressers and restaurants up to a maximum of &euro;3,000, from the current level of &euro;127.</P>
      <P>The enforcer would also represent the consumer in national partnership agreements. Recent agreements have been dominated by the producers with little thought given to consumers. As long as employees have trade unions, employers have IBEC and both have the Government&rsquo;s ear, the consumer is lost. The Minister has recognised this and spoke about his plans to address the situation, which is welcome. Without that powerful advocacy, prices soar, costs increase, competitiveness is eroded and rip-off Ireland thrives.</P>
      <P>It is time for action to be taken. In his remarks, the Minister has shown he is prepared to address matters. We wish him well for the sake of the economy. To date, little has been done in this area and much must be done. I hope the Minister has a greater period in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment than he had in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the smoking ban? The Senator is being mean-minded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator White should not misinterpret me. I am trying to wish the Minister well. He is up against it and his speech showed all that has to be done. For the sake of the economy I wish him well, but it will not be easy. I look forward to the Minister reporting progress on his endeavours in this area. I hope the issues I outlined will prove helpful to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for attending the House to debate this issue and I congratulate him on his new appointment. A change from a social Ministry like the Department of Health <Col N="983"/>and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is an interesting one. I went a similar route when, as a Minister of State, I moved from the Department of Health to the Department of Industry and Commerce with special responsibility for trade and marketing. The Department is an exciting one in which to work with an excellent and innovative staff who have great knowledge of the field. The Minister, Deputy Martin, will bring great innovation to his portfolio.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an enormous responsibility, including consumer protection. In this regard the issue of costs is important. I criticise the rip-off mentality as projected by the main Opposition party. It puts forward the problems but not the solutions. Ireland has the highest minimum wage in the world at &euro;1,183 per month. This compares to Japan at &euro;906 per month, the US at &euro;877 per month, Greece at &euro;570 per month, Malta at &euro;535 per month, Spain at &euro;451 per month, Portugal at &euro;365 per month, Hungary at &euro;252 per month and Bulgaria at &euro;56 per month. Is the Fine Gael Party advocating a reduction in the minimum wage? If a high minimum wage is necessary for our people &mdash; some of them are earning it in the supermarkets that Senator Coghlan criticised for high prices &mdash; then it follows there are higher prices. What solution is being put forward by the main Opposition party?</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party claims its rip-off website had 50,000 hits. However, as the website is accessible internationally, it has discouraged people from coming to Ireland by highlighting prices externally. While I have no problems arguing the case within our economy, why is Fine Gael trying to jeopardise employment and tourism by discouraging people from visiting Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is wronging the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have travelled in different parts of Europe and, irrespective of the costs, Ireland is relatively competitive in many areas.</P>

	<P>Senator Leyden, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This has not been recognised on the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s website. One company in north Dublin closed its business as it was highlighted on the website. However, the party does not take responsibility for this.</P>
      <P>Take the example of petrol prices. The price of a barrel of crude oil has, due to the war in Iraq and other factors, increased to approximately $52. In June, AA Roadwatch published a comparison of petrol prices in Europe. In Finland, consumers paid 118 cent per litre for unleaded petrol and 96 cent per litre for diesel. In <Col N="984"/>Germany, 120 cent per litre. I recently passed a filling station in the midlands where the price per litre for unleaded petrol was 107 cent and diesel, 103 cent. In other parts of Ireland, the price per litre is as low as 94.9 cent. With differences in prices, consumers are choosing to be more selective when purchasing motor fuel. More competition has resulted since prices are displayed in forecourts, allowing people to shop around for the best possible price. It is hard to compare like with like because of the big players in the petrol market. Concessions are given to their own stations and others to owner stations. However, the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s rip-off website did not highlight how petrol and diesel prices in the rest of Europe are much higher. In Italy, for example, unleaded petrol costs 115 cent per litre. In Northern Ireland it is somewhat higher. We are relatively competitive in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have a major input into the budget in December. It is vital that there is no increase in value added tax on diesel and petrol because such an increase would raise costs throughout the economy, in particular transport costs. This is an island economy and import and export costs are higher than on mainland Europe. Those factors must be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business is investigating supermarket chains and their costs and competitiveness. We have received interesting submissions, including one from the Director of Consumer Affairs. This is a very complex area but I hope we will soon submit a report to the Minister on the subject. The committee is carrying out extremely good work under its chairman and is meeting at the moment. It is considering all aspects of competition within the supermarket industry, including below cost selling and the size of supermarkets and superstores, all of which have a role to play. It has received good submissions in this regard which it will bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</P>
      <P>The Government has contributed significantly to progress in recent years. As a result of the national wage agreements our economy is extremely effective, efficient and wealthy. Employment has never been at a higher level. The Consumers Association of Ireland should be strengthened. The Minister should provide it with an amount in the region of &euro;60,000 to &euro;100,000 per annum. It is understaffed and does not have the necessary resources. I hope the Minister will look at that and expand the area of consumer protection to create a national programme working through an organisation such as the Consumers Association of Ireland or other methods. It is worth considering this.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister and the Government on bringing forward the decentralisation programme. This will spread 10,000 people around the countryside into areas where costs are lower than in the capital city which in turn gives people in rural areas the chance to create more business, competition and opportunities. That policy should be pushed because housing costs, for <Col N="985"/>example, in areas such as Roscommon are much lower than in Dublin. The same is true outside the other major cities such as Galway and there is a major building boom. Already the decentralisation of the Prison Service to Castlerea has boosted that area and the Minister must see the benefits of decentralisation and development in his own constituency. It is difficult to attract some industries to areas outside major centres. Continued incentives in the Border, midlands and western area in particular, where 40% of all inward investment should be located, are essential. I urge the Minister to ensure revitalisation of those areas through inward investment.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the scale of the task before the Minister. Many of the new member states of the European Union are looking at the success of &ldquo;Ireland Incorporated&rdquo;, through Enterprise Ireland, the Industrial Development Authority and the ways in which we have been so progressive. The Minister&rsquo;s networks around the world, working through the IDA, in particular, Enterprise Ireland and the former trade board have been very effective. The trade missions in which Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and others in the Department are involved will highlight the new opportunities in China, the Middle East and elsewhere. While those areas may not relate directly to the subject of this debate the more success and progress made in the economy, the more competitive costs will be and the better the opportunities.</P>
      <P>The Minister put forward an excellent manifesto today for his direction in this portfolio. There is no shortage of reports from his Department and now action is needed. The Minister will no doubt take the necessary action on competitiveness. The December budget will be vital to keeping Government charges down, such as the charges on telephone and electricity costs that have a knock-on effect on overall costs. Members of the public are more aware of costs and are more willing to contact the Department or their public representatives about competitiveness. As the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor said, it is important to shop around for the best supermarket prices. There is more competition in the market place than ever before.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business researched insurance costs. We have made progress on this area of great responsibility. The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor set up the Personal Injuries Assessment Board which is progressing. That is a marvellous initiative and this Minister will be responsible for continuing the downward trend in insurance costs which were imposing an impossible burden on small industry and small businesses. There has been, and will continue to be, progress in this area. The more companies the Minister can attract into the economy, the better.</P>
      <P>In its submission to the committee last week, Tesco outlined its plan to go into the insurance market with another overseas company. That will provide more competition in that area. Insurance costs are far too high and there is not enough <Col N="986"/>competition but companies such as Tesco bring partners into the economy, although it is self-insured. I welcome the introduction of these partners, which will create more competition and allow people to shop around. I am concerned about fuel costs and hope the budget can at least contain the lowest possible costs for diesel and petrol which have a knock-on effect on the economy.</P>
      <P>Finally, I urge our friends in the Opposition to put forward more solutions and do less highlighting of the difficulties. If they have the misfortune&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When I hear references to Ireland being the most open economy in the world, I wonder if I am living in the same country. Senator Leyden, whom I understand to be Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Seanad spokesman on matters such as trade, has suggested that we should draw a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around the country. He thinks we should con people from other countries into coming to Ireland by failing to tell them about its problems. Contrary to what people think, one has to win the trust of those one is doing business with if one is to do business successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If we pretend that Ireland is a low-cost economy, business people who come here will last for a couple of days before they disappear when they realise they have been conned. They will head for Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong or the free trade zones in China where they can access as much cheap labour and low costs as they want. Regardless of whether the website mentioned by Senator Leyden continues to exist, we will continue to have a free media. I think the term &ldquo;rip-off Ireland&rdquo; derives from the term &ldquo;rip-off Britain&rdquo;, which was coined in that country a number of years ago. I am sure many people in Sweden and Denmark would say the same about their countries. We should ignore the peripheral nonsense of those who want to pretend this is not happening.</P>
      <P>That Ireland is now an expensive country in many ways is the inevitable consequence of giving our people a decent standard of living. Only in <Col N="988"/>those countries with governments which have conspired to facilitate the exploitation of working people have prices been maintained at a low level as a high standard of economic performance has been enjoyed. The minimum wage in the United States, for example, is equivalent to approximately &euro;4 per hour, although it varies from state to state. It can be as low as &euro;2 per hour in the catering and related industries because tips are regarded as part of normal income. If people want to live in a society with profound inequalities, they are welcome to do so. The engine of economic growth in such societies is essentially a vast number of poorly paid people who live in mobile homes because they are unable to afford proper housing and who do not enjoy job security or benefit from a proper health service.</P>
      <P>I prefer the European model, based on enterprising economies which are vigorous and innovative and an environment in which workers who are adequately rewarded and properly protected enjoy a reasonable level of security of employment. This country needs to develop such a model, which involves the identification of anomalies and peculiarities. It is astonishing that Grafton Street, which is approximately 200 yd. from Leinster House, is the fourth most expensive place in the world in which to rent retail property. The cost of renting property on the street does not reflect the type of business being conducted there or any sort of historical accrued value. The market is being distorted. The Minister should examine how Grafton Street has become so outrageously expensive that a company that was tempted to sell two attractive and historical buildings on the street to capitalise on their value now has to close two of its restaurants because the rent they are paying to the owners of the buildings reflects the commercial value of the properties. That does not make sense. It does not seem to be a model of a functioning market economy.</P>
      <P>Many of those who speak loudest about the need for competition and free markets usually want them for other people. The legal and accountancy professions, which are the most eloquent in the defence of the free market, run very effective closed shops &mdash; they do not use that term &mdash; to ensure that something as demeaning as price competition does not arise in their cases, whatever about other sectors. They restrict numbers and control entry to the profession, although who would ever suggest that they would restrict entry to the profession? Many people in this country who are keen for others to get involved in a competitive market economy are keeping themselves out if it.</P>
      <P>If we are to make a serious effort to deal with rip-off prices in a rapidly growing economy, the first thing we should do is ensure there is serious competition in the market. In a civilised society, such competition should not focus on determining who can pay workers the least. I do not want that model, which has been successful in other countries, to be pursued in this country. I am sure most Irish people agree with me in that regard. <Col N="989"/>One of the best modern economists, Dr. Paul Krugman, has argued that the idea of &ldquo;national competitiveness&rdquo; is a nonsense. He claims that while sectors within countries can be competitive, that has nothing to do with the nation or the state. From what I have read, I think he makes a valid point when he says there is no such concept as &ldquo;national competitiveness&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If this country is to facilitate the sectors of activity and enterprise it is good at, it has to be able to access its markets which, in turn, have to be able to access it. One of Ireland&rsquo;s natural advantages in such sectors is that it can access an enormous market of 600 million people. Regardless of the type of business in which we are engaged we have to have a national and international transport infrastructure, within this country and serving this country, that does not put us at a disadvantage. It should be repeated that Ireland&rsquo;s national roads infrastructure is approximately 25 years out of date and its rail infrastructure is approximately 40 years out of date. I travel occasionally in carriages which were old when I started to come to the House 25 years ago. I am sure many other people have the same experience. I do not know which of our many Governments lost the plot in that regard.</P>
      <P>We allowed our railway system to deteriorate almost to the point of collapse.</P>
      <P>Our road infrastructure is primitive and worse than what one would find in a country such as Hungary, which I have visited within the past 12 months. Its motorway network is considerably better than that of this country. Members should go and look at the rail and road infrastructure of countries such as Italy that we are inclined to see as perhaps a little off the wall in comparison with our great economic achievements.</P>
      <P>This country has a problem. It is a wonderful one to have, but we have not yet addressed it: how we can guarantee that we remain at this level of prosperity that the work of successive Governments has generated. Perhaps I might respond to something. No Government in the history of the State ever inherited a better set of economic conditions than that which came to power in 1997. At the time, the country was generating 1,000 jobs a week and had a significant trade surplus. The Exchequer had a substantial revenue surplus, and the beginnings of a spectacular period of economic growth were handed on a plate to the incoming Government. My party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, says that one of the things that will keep academic students of this country&rsquo;s politics going for 50 years is the question of how the coalition Government lost the 1997 election in the teeth of the best economic conditions that the country had ever had. The election was handed to the incoming Government on a plate, and the wrong decisions have been made since.</P>
      <P>It was obvious from the 1980s that the country needed transport and telecommunications infrastructure. I have no interest in whether our infrastructure is provided by the private or public sector or by an efficient combination of the two. My <Col N="990"/>interest is in what works efficiently regarding prices, delivery and time. Now we have a disaster in telecommunications. A company set up by taxpayers was privatised so that, ironically, people were paying twice for something. It went off on a tangential operation of asset-stripping on a scale that would have horrified us if attempted by anyone else. It sold off property and its biggest asset, which was its mobile telephone operation. Then it decided that it had to pay off the new investors, with the result that our telecommunications infrastructure is rapidly becoming as out of date as our rail infrastructure. How many people have been denied access to broadband because the last part of the telephone network is out of date and old? There are split and divided lines &mdash; things that were never known before. There has not been even the suggestion of investment to change that, with the result that there is now the ridiculous situation that a parallel telecommunications infrastructure is having to be constructed to deal with the ineptitude of a privatised monopoly. If we have learnt anything in this country it is that if one privatises monopolies, they will get worse without the kind of vigorous regulations so singularly missing here.</P>
      <P>Ireland is slipping backwards on the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s competitiveness index. I do not have the report with me, but we are barely among the top 30 countries. Those countries in Europe with which we should compare ourselves are not large, powerful economies such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy but the small economies. The well-established ones, such as Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland are all nearly 20 places ahead of us.</P>
      <P>It is trite and simplistic to suggest that our competitiveness and achievements are all because of our low-tax regime. Such a regime does not even exist, since 55% of those paying income tax are now doing so at the top rate. Having said that, I admit that we made an attempt to reduce taxes. We inevitably discovered that, in a civilised, modern society, if one tries to reduce public expenditure or taxation revenue excessively, one ends up having to pay for things somewhere else because of the need for basic services. That is why we have such high waste charges, which may double within the next four or five years. This morning the abolition of waivers for people on limited incomes to pay for waste charges was mentioned. There are also extraordinarily expensive line rental charges to pay for the greed of those who now own Eircom.</P>
      <P>We have charges all over the place and matters are getting out of hand, since one cannot do it on a low tax base. Countries in northern Europe have demonstrated how to construct civilised societies that function within extraordinarily efficient economies. That is what we should be considering. If we blink, we ignore it. Half of us look to the neighbouring island, which is no great model for anything, while the other half looks 3,000 miles away at an even less appropriate one. There are good models on our doorstep for how <Col N="991"/>successful economies can match compassionate societies, but we do not attempt it.</P>
      <P>The time is overdue for the Minister to examine the agencies supposed to facilitate and encourage competition, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Competition Authority. As I said, the Competition Authority has singularly failed to get our banks and legal and accountancy professions to compete. It recently had a spectacular achievement in the courts when it managed to catch the credit unions. What good will that do for any consumer in Ireland? If the Competition Authority makes that system unviable, the credit unions will close down, and hundreds of thousands in this country will discover that no bank will lend them a penny, making them much worse off.</P>
      <P>The other matter concerns the Director of Consumer Affairs. I have no idea what that office does; all that I ever see from it are warnings to petrol stations about their not displaying the correct price. That is not what the country needs. I would seek reliable comparable data on costs and prices. I would like to know how a publican in this city can have a margin of 200% or 300% on a soft drink. Why does that not apply in other countries? Why are things like that? Why are groceries in this country 25% more expensive than in Northern Ireland? Perhaps there are cost issues. I would like to know, and a Director of Consumer Affairs should be finding out and telling us what is wrong.</P>
      <P>On the question of price competition, which, as I have tried to explain, is only a very small part of competitiveness, the ultimate solution is to tell the public as much as possible. For instance, any advertisement for a second-hand car should name a price. It is a deliberate deception to try to draw someone into one&rsquo;s premises by not telling the person the price before he or she gets there. Consumers are entitled to know clearly what is on offer, including the price.</P>
      <P>There should be more publicity on prices, more analysis and reflection, and a greater willingness not to pull punches. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is a model for an agency that has begun to do its job properly. One can see the improvement in standards regarding food services and hygiene because it is prepared to name and shame. We need the same vigorous activity from the Director of Consumer Affairs. I have never believed in price controls, since the best control on prices is vigorous competition policed by agencies that see themselves as exclusively on the side of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, and congratulate him on his promotion. I also thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, for his contribution.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan spoke of a compassionate model and said we should not look 3,000 miles away, or to our nearest neighbour who does not have a model to show us either. The model of a success<Col N="992"/>ful economy is the country in which we live. This country has created thousands of jobs in the past few years. Those jobs were filled primarily from the ranks of the unemployed, previously referred to as &ldquo;human set-aside&rdquo;. We now have one of the highest rates of employment and the lowest rate of unemployment in Europe.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this morning&rsquo;s debate because I have run a small business since 1986. It is benchmarked from here to China. There is certainly competition within some sectors of the economy, although not all. However, some sectors have brutal competition.</P>
      <P>With regard to insurance, I know the developments of the past few years will be vigorously continued by the new Minister. Prices used to rise phenomenally each year. When one got one&rsquo;s insurance premium, one was afraid to shop around because nobody would give one a quotation. One was afraid that if one did shop around, one would be asked why one was doing so. One was delighted to write the cheque and post it the following day in case insurance was refused.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, the cost of building insurance has fallen from &euro;12,230 to &euro;7,800. These amounts did not come from the same insurance company, they came from shopping around. The previous Minister advised people to do so in order to get a competitive price. That is how competition will be effective in this economy. People are not forced to pay high prices; it is their choice not to shop around.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the ESB and Eircom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>Competition is not evident in all areas, but it is in many. I witness it on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>With regard to telecommunications, not a month goes by without my business receiving a call from a telecommunications provider offering lower charges. I have lower charges year on year by changing providers, not by being loyal to one. On a monthly basis, we are asked by telecommunications providers to submit our bill so they can cut it by 5%, 10% or 20%. That is what happens when one shops around. That is what competition is about.</P>
      <P>Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world in terms of cross-border movement of goods and services. If Irish companies are to be in a strong position to compete in international markets, it is important our cost base is not out of line with our main trading partners.</P>
      <P>In a week when the euro reached a new all-time high of &euro;1.29 against the dollar, Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness is cause for concern. The Central Bank&rsquo;s quarterly bulletins consistently refer to the risk of euro-dollar exchange rate movements to our competitiveness. Our loss of control over exchange rates means there is now a real challenge to develop new policy tools which <Col N="993"/>cushion Irish competitiveness and growth from the effects of exchange rate volatility.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the work done by the National Competitiveness Council in tracking our competitiveness. The council was established by Government as part of the Partnership 2000 agreement. Its job has been to advise Government on areas in need of particular attention in order to maintain and improve our competitiveness. The recent publication of the council&rsquo;s seventh annual competitiveness report on the benchmarking exercise and its competitiveness challenge report regarding policy recommendations makes this debate very timely.</P>
      <P>The basic principle of the NCC is that the Government can have the greatest impact on competitiveness through policy measures across key areas of the economy such as competition and regulation, the labour market, taxation and macroeconomic policy, infrastructure, education, enterprise development and research and innovation. The correct policy mix will deliver rising productivity, sustainable wage levels and a competitive cost base. If we are successful, benefits will materialise in terms of strong economic and employment growth, improved living standards and a better quality of life for all people on this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>The NCC&rsquo;s benchmarking exercise has raised many interesting issues. The council acknowledges the tremendous success of the Irish economy over recent years, much of which can be attributed to the success of policies taken by Government. For example, the benchmarking exercise ranked Ireland second after the US out of 16 countries in terms of GDP <i>per capita </i>above Switzerland and Denmark; first out of 15 countries in terms of real GDP growth over the five-year period 1998 to 2003, which represents over 41% in real terms; and the fourth lowest unemployment rate out of 15 countries in 2003. Senator Ryan wondered about a compassionate society. The exercise also ranked Ireland as having the fourth highest employment growth in 2003 out of 15 countries.</P>
      <P>The council notes the economy is doing well at present, but in order to sustain our economic success into the medium term we must sustain commitment to promoting national competitiveness. The Government has a key role in ensuring that commitment is honoured.</P>

	<P>The international benchmarking exercise suggests that, on aggregate, Government policies proved a significant competitive advantage to firms operating in Ireland. Our key strengths are apparent. Ireland&rsquo;s standard rate of corporate tax, 12.5%, is the lowest out of 16 countries and has been a key factor in <Col N="994"/>Ireland&rsquo;s success in attracting high levels of inward direct investment over the past decade.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of taxation, the council commends Government on changes to the structure of the Irish tax system, and in particular the lowering of direct taxes on both personal income and corporate profits. These changes have supported competitiveness and have been important factors behind our economic success over the past 15 years.</P>
      <P>Ireland is ranked as one of the most open economies in the world in terms of trade in goods and services. Within the EU, it had the highest percentage of trade with non-EU countries, an indication of which is our close trade connections the USA. This high degree of openness leaves the Irish economy vulnerable to fluctuations in the value of the euro and global economic downturns. However, the NCC rightly points out there is no guarantee our future performance will be as good unless the right policy decisions are taken now.</P>
      <P>It is important we take on the challenge of doing whatever is necessary to keep Ireland Incorporated competitive in business and at the top of the league of the most competitive economies. There are a number of areas on which the NCC and others believe our attention should be focused over the medium term.</P>
      <P>With regard to competition and regulation policy, Ireland ranked 13th out of 16 countries in terms of the intensity of local competition. The council&rsquo;s statement on costs in September concluded that the lack of competition in some sectors was partly responsible for business costs and consumer prices in Ireland being out of line with other advanced economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is getting down to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>The report ranked Ireland as the most expensive country in the euro zone, on a par with Finland, and significantly more expensive than the next group of euro zone countries.</P>
      <P>In the area of taxation policy, the council points to the need to reinforce and sustain the advantages which our taxation system has generated for the economy, growth and employment over the past 15 years. I agree with its principal recommendation that we must keep direct taxes on profits low and lower the taxation of personal income. To do the opposite, as some members of the Opposition suggest, would jeopardise our economic growth and competitiveness. With over &euro;1.5 billion available to finance his budget day measures, the Minister for Finance should allocate the bulk of what is available, after social welfare increases, to increasing tax bands and credits ahead of inflation.</P>
      <P>Government investment in infrastructure has increased substantially in recent years. We see <Col N="995"/>that right across the country. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to spend 5% of GNP will further add to our infrastructure. However, the council noted that in respect of infrastructure, Ireland performed poorly in a number of areas. It was 11th out of 12 countries in terms of public infrastructure relative to our GNP and 15th out of 16 countries in terms of the efficiency of distribution infrastructure, encompassing all forms of transport. There are few areas on which I agree with Senator Ryan but I could find common ground with him regarding Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure. As an island nation we must ensure that our goods and services find destinations on foreign markets at a competitive price. Successive Ministers have worked to attract such markets. Ireland came 14th out of 15 countries in terms of broadband access and was 15th out of 16 countries in terms of the adequacy and efficiency of our energy infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The major contribution to our economic success of our past investment in education cannot be overstated. We rank sixth out of 15 countries for the highest proportion of population aged 25 to 34 with at least third level education, but we need to be at the top of this league. The level of investment in pre-primary education is a specific concern.</P>
      <P>We have a thriving economy. I am not saying that everything is rosy in the garden for the future. There are areas of concern on which this Government must keep its eye in order to maintain the level of inward investment we have been fortunate enough to win over the years. I look forward to this Government being very proactive in that area. We have seen, for example, in the insurance area where direct action by the Government can help small business and help this country generally by reducing costs and prices. I hope this type of policy will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Ulick Burke. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House. I congratulate him on his recent appointment and wish him well.</P>
      <P>Costs in Ireland are out of line with those in other developed countries. This was confirmed by the National Competitiveness Council in its statement on costs and prices published last September. This is a confirmed fact, despite what Senator Leyden said.</P>
      <P>What is the Government doing to reduce the costs to Irish industry and has it any plan to combat the haemorrhage of jobs currently evident in many parts of the country? My own constituency of Waterford saw live register figures rise by more than 1,000 last month. In Waterford city we have learned of 75 job losses at Kromberg and Schubert, another 70 jobs at Nypro and other job losses in the city and county. This is a matter of grave concern which needs to be addressed. I ask the Minister of State to set up a jobs task force in Waterford now or bring all the relevant agencies <Col N="996"/>together to ensure this situation does not deteriorate any further.</P>
      <P>When we speak of competitiveness, most people immediately talk about our wages and labour costs compared to those of other countries, where they are relatively low. This is a major factor, but we must always play to our strengths by developing new bases for competitive advantage. We must develop our innovation potential by removing barriers to competition and also develop our economic and technological infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The risk of a further sharp decline in the value of the dollar against the euro also presents a growing threat to jobs in Ireland and to our competitiveness. Waterford Crystal and other similar companies are hit badly by the decline of the dollar against the euro and many people pray that the current trend will be reversed in the near future.</P>
      <P>Large sections of our economy suffer from low levels of research and innovation. Limited sales and marketing capabilities have also resulted in low levels of productivity compared to those in other advanced economies. Raising our productivity through innovation will be the key to improving the nation&rsquo;s living standards in the coming years. Increased resources for scientific research are necessary and we need to ensure they are well targeted and support the needs of Irish industry.</P>
      <P>The lack of proper infrastructure is crippling many parts of our country, stifling growth and blunting the competitive edge which is so vital in these times. In Waterford city, access is still one of the barriers which prevents the city from growing and realising its full potential. This has been the case in the past and unfortunately still continues to be so. The development of the N9 and the proposed motorway is way behind that of routes to the other major cities. The train journey time from Waterford to Dublin is the same as it was 30 or 40 years ago. The city&rsquo;s airport is operating without a PSO licence, which places it at a competitive disadvantage compared to other regional airports. The city has advanced considerably in the past decade but the poor infrastructure and access problems which beset us must be addressed and allow us to rise to the competitiveness challenge which faces Waterford and every part of the country.</P>
      <P>Human capital has become increasingly important to economic performance. Human capital consists of the education and skills of a country&rsquo;s supply of labour, which has a key input into economic development. Any increase in the level of education and skills increases the quality of our labour input and boosts productivity and economic growth. The Minister for Education and Science should issue a considered response to the report of the task force on the physical sciences, setting out clearly the Government&rsquo;s policy on science education and awareness, including a progress report on implementation.</P><Col N="997"/>
      <P>In order to reduce bureaucracy, requests to industry from Government agencies should be consolidated through the use of technology. The Government should increase the representation of small businesses on the company law review group to ensure the promotion of entrepreneurship and enterprise in general. I also urge the Minister of State to consider the Competition Authority study on banking services to small and medium-size enterprises in Ireland and take some action in this regard.</P>
      <P>The up-skilling of those already in employment should be a priority in order to protect existing jobs. There are many areas of concern outlined in the recent report by the National Competitiveness Council and I ask the Minister of State to address them as a matter of urgency. If we are not competitive where costs are concerned, we are in for a rough time as a nation in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. Having listened to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as to Senators Leyden and Morrissey, it is obvious that the concept of rip-off Ireland is beginning to hurt politically. Throughout the year, lip-service was paid to the notion, but it was recognised by the T&aacute;naiste, the then Minister with responsibility in the area of consumer prices, that a response was needed. She established the National Competitiveness Council to make recommendations before the end of this year, but prices continued to increase. There has been a 20% increase in prices over the past five years and a 24% increase in electricity charges. Senator Morrisey must have no electricity in his house given that he has not recognised that latter increase. Postal and TV licence charges have risen. Any service charge one mentions has increased. Is it ironic that today we are talking of consumer price increases and competition while it is the Government which has restricted competition?</P>
      <P>In every area in respect of which it has responsibility, the Government has restricted and curtailed competition. A prime example of this is the airline industry. What happened in this area? Ryanair introduced competition and stifled the increases that would have occurred if matters had remained solely in the hands of Aer Lingus and if there had been no competition. Aer Lingus has been obliged to reduce its prices as a result of that competition. Those who want to criticise Ryanair state that its cabin crew are not as active as they should be in delivering in-flight services. That is humbug. The reality is that the Government has failed to allow competition in the area over which it has greatest control. That is some indictment.</P>
      <P>Everything the Minister stated earlier is a clear indication that he intends to respond to the hurt caused by rip-off Ireland. On &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night he stated that the concept of rip-off Ireland is Fine Gael propaganda. Senator Leyden also attacked the concept earlier. This despite the fact that he stated in the House at the beginning of <Col N="998"/>the year that he was going to name and shame all of those petrol stations with higher fuel prices on his route from Roscommon to Dublin. What happened? The Senator was afraid to name and shame those involved. He has failed, just like the Government in respect of the areas for which it has responsibility, to do anything.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has made statements about the matter under discussion. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism also made comments about good value in restaurants. However, while the Minister criticised the various hotels and restaurants throughout the country for the escalation in prices and the poor value for money on offer, he is withdrawing from his previous stance and has come to the realisation that rip-off Ireland is real and genuine.</P>
      <P>The Consumers Association of Ireland is no longer effective and Carmel Foley seems to have become invisible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not refer to people outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that but the person to whom I refer has ceased to be an effective agent as regards the control of prices. I do not know why that is the case but perhaps she is afraid to rock the boat for the Government, which has failed to take action.</P>
      <P>There were reports in yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers &mdash; this matter will be of great interest to the Cathaoirleach &mdash; that the Revenue is going to investigate price-fixing among car companies such as Ford and others. The Government can make moves, through the Revenue, to stop such price-fixing. This is another area in which consumers are being ripped off.</P>
      <P>The lip-service paid to consumers rights by various Ministers to date has fallen on deaf ears. It hurts the Government when we mention rip-off Ireland. The Minister must put in place effective measures to control price increases in areas over which it has greatest control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House and I wish him luck. He has a tremendous reputation in Leinster House and in County Clare. I am aware that everybody in Clare is crazy about him. Even Senator Ryan stated that it is about time he was awarded an elevated position.</P>
      <P>I may be accused of exaggeration but the Minister&rsquo;s speech is probably the best I have heard delivered in the House in respect of enterprise and employment. I have read Ahead of the Curve, the Annual Competitiveness Report 2004 and the Competitiveness Challenge 2004 and in my view the answers to the points raised therein are to be found in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. The Minister showed vision while in the Department of Health and Children in driving through the smoking ban. It was a difficult Ministry for him but he will go down in history for what he has achieved. The points raised in the documents <Col N="999"/>to which I refer and in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution provide an outline of what he must do. He has a tremendous opportunity to make progress.</P>
      <P>Despite all the positive figures &mdash; the fact that unemployment has fallen to 4.5%, that GNP will grow by 4.25% this year and that business confidence, industrial output and FDI are all on the increase &mdash; I am concerned that the Government might become complacent and that people will believe the Celtic tiger economy, which is not, perhaps, as strong as it was previously, will remain in place. That is a dangerous assumption. There are threats abroad of which people are not aware.</P>
      <P>The documents to which I referred earlier indicate how stands our cost base relative to those of our trading partners. According to the Annual Competitiveness Report 2004, the average cost of Irish goods and services, relative to that of our major trading partners, has increased by over 20% since 2000. There is no doubt that the rise in the value of the euro against the US dollar and sterling &mdash; about which we cannot do much &mdash; has been the biggest cause of deterioration in our competitiveness. However, fast growth in domestic prices and wages have also contributed. The Government further contributed to inflation but I believe it has learned its lesson. I am afraid to refer to stealth taxes but these were real and they added to inflationary costs.</P>
      <P>The loss of competitiveness is already undermining the ability of many Irish-based manufacturing companies to compete in international markets. An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> last week stated that the Small Firms Association said that continuing job losses in the manufacturing sector are a major cause for concern. It is also stated in the article that more than 900 manufacturing jobs were lost during October &mdash; bringing the total number this year to over 7,000 and an overall total for the economy of over 20,000 &mdash; and that the Small Firms Association blamed deteriorating cost competitiveness for the 30,000 job losses in manufacturing and production during the past three years. The total number of people in employed in manufacturing has, therefore, dropped from 330,000 to 300,000.</P>
      <P>If the decline in cost competitiveness persists, there will be a continued loss of employment. The growth in employment during the past four years has occurred mainly in the public and building sectors. A decline in our competitiveness has resulted in manufacturing jobs being lost.</P>

	<P>Much of the Irish economy remains characterised by low levels of productivity, relative to advanced economies. According to the annual competitiveness report, people employed in Ireland produce an average 16% less for each hour worked than their US counterparts. This productivity gap is particularly evident in those sectors of the Irish economy less exposed to international competition such as retailing, agriculture and parts of the public services. Even in those sectors of the economy more exposed to competition, pockets of weak productivity and performance remain. Large sections of our industrial base, both Irish and foreign, remain beset by low levels of research and development and innovation and limited sales and marketing capabilities. The document produced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ahead of the Curve, spells out exactly the failures of marketing capabilities and innovation.</P>
      <P>An inconsistency exists. High technology production is not widespread. There is high production in the capital intensive multinational industries and from which Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for high productivity emanates. However, job losses have occurred in the manufacturing sector because it is not efficient, not sufficiently innovative, not competitive and does not possess the marketing skills.</P>
      <P>Last year&rsquo;s budget introduced a tax credit scheme for research and development which was generally welcomed by industry. However, a survey of Irish exporters on the expected take-up of this scheme by both MNCs and SMEs indicated a significant resistance to further research and development expenditure as a result of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The main problem with the scheme is twofold. Its incremental nature is seen as a fundamental weakness. A review of similar research and development tax incentive schemes in 30 countries was found to show that the vast majority were based on straight volume of expenditure. The fact that the scheme does not apply to internationally traded services research and development activity is a major shortcoming, given the focus of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland on moving companies up the value chain and into service-related activities. This scheme should be reconsidered in the forthcoming budget. This is also the recommendation of the Irish Exporters <Col N="1001"/>Association. It calls on the Minister for Finance to introduce a straight volume-based research and development tax credit system which would go a long way to ensure that the Government&rsquo;s targeted level of 2% of GDP by business in its research and development spend is achieved over the next few years. The scheme should be expanded to service export innovations. I appreciate the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s patience and I apologise for reading a script.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I congratulate Senator White for lecturing the Government on its bad and ill thought out policies on competitiveness and consumer protection. The Senator is listening to the people on the ground, unlike some members of the Government. It is not often that I use the words &ldquo;equality and fairness&rdquo; when referring to the Government. However, today I wish to point out the interesting fact that under this Government there is a parity for our citizens and visitors alike &mdash; they are both being ripped off in equal measure.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority&rsquo;s strategy statement 2003-05, states that credible enforcement against anti-competitive behaviour is important in maintaining an environment in which markets benefit consumers. Fine Gael&rsquo;s rip-off Ireland website is a continuing testament to such anti-competitive and anti-consumer behaviour. As I have stated in the House on other occasions, the Government is throwing its citizens to the financial sharks. The other side of the House can deride Fine Gael&rsquo;s rip-off Ireland site and make accusations such as those made by Senator Leyden yesterday in respect of its effect on tourism, but the truth is that tourists are not fools and once bitten, twice shy, with the inevitable effects on our tourism industry.</P>
      <P>In the four years to May 2004, the average price of Irish goods and services increased by 22% relative to our trading partners. Ireland&rsquo;s consumer price inflation has exceeded the euro zone and 15 EU countries for the past seven years. By 2003 Ireland was almost on a par with Finland as the most expensive country in the EU. Ireland is now the most expensive country in the euro zone for food, non-alcoholic beverages, tobacco and housing rental. It is the second most expensive country for alcoholic beverages and for the services of restaurants and pubs.</P>
      <P>As with prices, wages in Ireland have been rising faster than in other EU countries for a number of years. There is considerable evidence to suggest that both business costs and consumer prices here are now out of line with other advanced economies. Our relative cost position is not justified by economic fundamentals and poses a threat to our continued economic success.</P>
      <P>Improving Ireland&rsquo;s international costs competitiveness must be a high priority for the Government. Consumers must be entitled to know whether they are getting value or money. Retailers must not be able to blame high prices <Col N="1002"/>on high operating costs without the consumer being party to information about the retailer&rsquo;s turnover and profit. In order to achieve higher living standards and to provide more jobs, it is essential to increase the output and added value of goods and trade services which are produced by private and public enterprises. No corporate enterprise can be above accountability and none should have a get-out clause when it comes to declaring its profits for public scrutiny.</P>
      <P>There is no escaping the reality that Ireland must and can achieve a higher level of industrial and commercial output. This is vital not only to the generation of additional jobs and higher living standards, but as a guarantor of all social benefits. A higher level of output in Ireland will have to be achieved in a less protected background. With 25 member states in the EU, less protection inevitably means the survival of the fittest. Ireland must offer a competitive environment for enterprise and enterprises operating from an Irish base must themselves be competitive in areas such as innovation management and quality as well as in terms of productivity. Great strides have been made in recent years in terms of the creation of a competitive environment for enterprise thanks to the foundations laid by former Deputies Alan Dukes and John Bruton. Ireland has an inflation rate lower than the EU average. Interest rates have fallen but a number of key business costs must be reduced if we are to maintain our competitiveness.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The fall in the cost of insurance for many businesses and consumers over the past year has demonstrated the potential of lowering prices for consumers and improving cost competitiveness for businesses. Shame on the Government for not bringing costs into line with other EU countries. We need to upgrade the following public economic infrastructure areas &mdash; transport, energy, education, health care, training, environment services, telecommunications, modern language training, airport development and tourism.</P>
      <P>In terms of industrial development, it is vital to emphasise the important part technology can play in job creation. The Government performance in this area has been dismal in failing to harness more jobs and earning higher living standards.</P>
      <P>Without Government action, the combination of the recent acceleration in Irish consumer price inflation, alongside the growing risk of a sharp decline in the value of the dollar against the euro, leads me to conclude that the possibility of a further deterioration in Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness is all too possible, putting employment and living standards in jeopardy throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In my own area of Longford, there is disgust and disappointment at the failure of the Cardinal Health project, with the loss of 1,300 jobs, and the let-down of being left out of the national spatial strategy with all the ensuing benefits.</P>

	<P>What about decentralisation?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1003"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with the Senator&rsquo;s comment in a minute. Given the infrastructure problems which have a negative impact on our development, this was a major blow. The lack of a quality and reliable train service from Longford town, which I highlighted last week on the Order of Business, the traffic congestion that would be alleviated by the widening of Richmond Street, a street that Senator Leyden often uses travelling east-west, and the fact that the national development plan cannot even produce a dual carriageway from Longford to Kinnegad or complete the Longford southern bypass, which is strapped for cash under this Government, are all symbolic of the problems preventing my area and others throughout the country achieving their full potential.</P>
      <P>It is time for the Government to wake up and listen because the evidence from the results of this year&rsquo;s local and European elections is that the people in power are not listening. They must listen and if they are not prepared to listen to the general public on this issue and many others, it is time for them to quit. They have lost the plot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important debate. I incline towards the view that we cannot afford to show any complacency. We are in the euro system and that means we do not have the option of a depreciating currency to restore competitiveness. If one takes the perspective of the past 17 years, to quote the IMF report this week, the social partnership process has made an important contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s exceptional economic revival.</P>
      <P>We cannot be doing everything wrong given that employment is rising. Inflation has been brought back to the European average. I recently came across a competitiveness table in a German magazine which gives the success index of the Bertelsmann Foundation for economies in 21 industrial countries investigated for 2004. It refers to index points for economic development and economic policy, and Ireland is top of the list, followed by the United States of America and then Norway. I am afraid France and Germany are at the bottom of the list.</P>

	<P>I have some reservations about what one might call catchy tabloid phrases &mdash; they have been used by different people in different contexts &mdash; like rip-off Ireland.

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of competitiveness is, in many instances, market forces. If alcohol prices go too high, the volume drunk will fall off. The same applies to accommodation. If the price of accommodation goes too high, it will not be filled. We have particular concerns about the sheltered sector of the economy where the forces of competition are not what they should be. The Government has done a substantial amount to try to break the rise in the cost of insurance and to start bringing it down by a number of different measures; the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor deserves some credit in that area.</P>
      <P>I share the Minister&rsquo;s emphasis on the importance of research and development. That is very important and it is important that in our third level sector, for example, the equipment and facilities are made available in terms of our competitiveness.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator White, raised the question of the research and development incentive in the recent budget. To save money, it was to be applied only to additional expenditure so as to avoid dead weight and there is some suggestion that may not be working as well as intended. We have to look at what other countries are offering in this field and match them.</P>
      <P>The Government is making an enormous investment in improving our infrastructure. I will not go into the details of that; we have debated it on other occasions. An enormous number of facilities are coming on stream. I notice in the IMF report that the greatest emphasis is put on investment in infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Some of us believe, in terms of housing policy, that the price of housing has not been a positive contributor to our competitiveness. There is much interesting material in the IMF report on the effectiveness or otherwise of Government measures. Obviously, the Government has been extremely effective in terms of increasing supply, perhaps a little less successful in terms of affordability.</P>
      <P>There is one issue on which I took issue with Senator Ryan yesterday and, therefore, I must also take issue with the Minister. It is unwise of us to use language in speeches to the effect that we are the second richest nation in Europe. That is using the GDP measure, which includes billions repatriated by foreign companies. The IMF report states that in 2003 we were at 99% of the EU average in terms of GNP, which is a far more accurate measure of living standards. One can assume that by the time the EU enlarged on 1 May, we were at 100%. We do not do any service to ourselves, however, if we make boasts that are not, strictly speaking, credible. It also leads to demands to the effect that if we are the second richest nation in Europe, why have we not done X, Y and Z? The answer is that we are not the second richest country in Europe. It takes many years of accumulating high levels of income to <Col N="1005"/>build wealth. High income in a given year is not the same as wealth, which takes time to accumulate. While we may be rich in terms of income, countries such as Germany, Britain and France are well ahead of us in terms of accumulated assets. Economic debate should be conducted on the basis of a realistic assessment of our position. We should not preen ourselves in the belief that we are far in advance of our real position.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to a suggestion by the leader of his party, Deputy Rabbitte, that we will need a thesis to explain the reason the rainbow coalition lost power in 1997, despite the good state of the economy. That is not the case. There is one economic and two non-economic explanations. The rainbow coalition lost the confidence of the public in its ability to manage the important issue of law and order. In addition, the public strongly believed a Fianna F&aacute;il Administration would be able to handle the peace process more skilfully &mdash; the first ceasefire broke down during the coalition&rsquo;s period in office.</P>
      <P>In terms of the economy, the recovery started in 1987. To find impartial evidence in support of that statement, one need only look at the IMF report. The term &ldquo;Celtic tiger&rdquo; was a phrase coined by an economic journalist in the early autumn of 1994, before the change of Government.</P>
      <P>I freely accept the rainbow Government kept the economy moving at a good pace, although perhaps without much flair or imagination. To suggest the Celtic tiger economy was created in two and a half years by the rainbow Government only makes one smile. I noted from a radio broadcast this morning that at least one economist, Dan McLaughlin, believes the Celtic tiger economy mark II is upon us. The period of progress since 1987 accelerated from the mid-1990s onwards. While I do not wish to deprive the rainbow coalition of any share of credit it may wish to take in this regard, it is false to paint a picture of a Celtic tiger created by the coalition and subsequently messed up by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>Although our economic achievements are highly respected, we are all conscious that we remain vulnerable and have a major agenda to fulfil. It will be necessary to maintain sharpness and competitiveness and avoid complacency.</P>

I wish the Minister well in his new portfolio. This is an important and welcome debate.</P>
      <P>I am amused by Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments on the Fine Gael Party website, <i>www.ripoff.ie</i>. The site is a forum in which people can air their views and read the views of others. I am at a loss to understand the reason the Senator is so bemused by the availability of a website to allow those who have been ripped off to air their views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Fine Gael Party doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator has pointed out on numerous occasions, it is for the Government to govern and the Opposition to raise issues. He has also frequently informed the House that he will not be stopped from raising issues. Perhaps he should use the website as a means to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh is correct that the economic recovery started in 1987. However, many Ministers who wish to highlight a point in the House go back only as far as 1997. The Minister for Finance in 1987, former Deputy Ray MacSharry, did a wonderful job but the House should also acknowledge the role of the then leader of the Fine Gael Party, former Deputy Alan Dukes. He should be complimented on agreeing not to force a general election provided the minority Government in office acted within specific parameters.</P>
      <P>Two of the main reasons for the Celtic tiger were the introduction of the single currency and the reduction in interest rates. I recently saw an interest rate quote of 3.5%. I remember paying rates of up to 20%. No business could survive today if it had to pay interest rates of 15% to<?oasys [jy?>20%, which was the order of the day in the 1980s and beyond. In the early 1990s, the current Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, was placed under considerable pressure by the Opposition to devalue the punt. During his term of office, interest rates exceeded 30% and he was forced to devalue the currency. The greatest contributory factors to the economic recovery were the single currency and reduced interest rates. Our currency was a target for many speculators and was vulnerable and membership of the single currency created greater stability.</P>
      <P>Small businesses are under considerable pressure on a number of fronts, notably wages, insurance, rates and taxes, and many will be lucky to survive. A new set of taxes, imposed through increases in water rates, refuse and sewerage charges, is also placing them under significant pressure. At times, local authorities appear to believe the multinationals are a never-ending well. It is often the case that the main contribution to local authority funds comes from a small number of companies. County managers frequently favour increases in rates and charges on the grounds that they will only affect a small number of companies, rather than the largest groups in the local authority area. This practice will drive many multinationals and other companies out of the country.</P>
      <P>In many areas, the roads network does not meet required standards. In recent weeks, the Allergan plant in Westport, which has complained for years that its produce for export was being damaged in transit, laid off 325 employees. Although the roads network was not the principal reason, it was a contributory factor. The company can manufacture its products more cheaply in other parts of the world.</P><Col N="1007"/>
      <P>I was amused by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement that he was delighted President Bush, rather than Senator Kerry, was elected because it would be better for Ireland from a tax point of view. I do not know how he could have come to that conclusion. One need only consider <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> report from Sunday last headlined, &ldquo;US tax amnesty will take billions out of Ireland&rdquo;. The law it refers to was signed only days before the presidential election in the US. The report states:</P>
      <P LI="1">In a report to be published this week, investment bank Morgan Stanley warns that US companies will reduce the amount they invest in Europe as they absorb the money flowing back home. Morgan Stanley has identified the US companies which will most likely repatriate huge amounts of profits. . . . The companies, which lobbied for the tax break in the run-up to the election, are also big-name investors in the Republic. They include Dell, Intel, Oracle, Hewlett-Packard and Wyeth. Irish tax lawyers have warned that the move to repatriate billions of euro from Irish subsidiaries back to the US will raise burdensome duties for Irish directors.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Taoiseach stated he was delighted that President Bush was re-elected and that this would have positive consequences for American multinationals in Ireland. He went on to state that had Senator Kerry been elected, the Taoiseach would have lobbied him in regard to the tax laws. The Minister should ask the Taoiseach to outline the current position, which I would also like to know. This law was changed in the run-up to the presidential election and this will have serious consequences for companies here. The Taoiseach should immediately contact President Bush in this regard. It is a serious issue and we do not want companies to leave the country, as in the case of Allergan which is moving part of its business to another location.</P>
      <P>To sum up, there is significant pressure on small businesses. Increases in rates, water, refuse and recycling charges will add further to the cost of production. I am in the restaurant business and see first-hand the increases taking place. We regularly read in the national press that the prices charged in restaurants are out of control. While restaurants are at the lower end of the market, it is difficult to keep prices down because costs are high. When one compares the inputs businesses in this country must take account of when calculating their costs, they are at a significant disadvantage compared with businesses in other countries.</P>
      <P>The 1% increase in VAT is a contributory factor in many instances, particularly for the service industry, including the transport and restaurant business. The increase plays an important role in increasing charges and the Minister for Finance should consider reducing it.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1008"/>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss competitiveness. I will not consider in detail consumer issues and the talk of a rip-off Ireland which has featured in the debate. However, some points need to be made on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. It is significant that Ireland was renowned in recent years as one of the most competitive countries, possibly in the top five in the world, whereas we have now fallen past 30th place in terms of competitiveness. This is interesting and a wake-up call to all of us that we cannot, as Senator Mansergh stated, sit back on our laurels and expect to continue as successfully as in the past.</P>
      <P>There is a wide variety of reasons for this and some clear tangibles upon which the Government must act and deliver if we are to reach a scenario where we have sustainable competitive advantage. Infrastructure is the most important issue, not only physical infrastructure but human infrastructure. If we are to achieve sustainable competitive advantage, the biggest investment we must make is in our human resources or human infrastructure because it is our human currency which will be the most valuable when it comes to procuring foreign direct investment or stimulating indigenous commercial activity.</P>
      <P>The Government has made commitments to research and development and lifelong learning but more needs to be done. &ldquo;The future belongs to small populations who can build empires of the mind&rdquo; is a quote which could not be more apt in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s future competitiveness. If we are to build a knowledge-based economy which will compete among the nations of the world, we must seek to move away from manufacturing other people&rsquo;s ideas and come up with ideas of our own. It should be Ireland which, as a knowledge-based economy, generates the ideas which can move our manufacturing further up the value chain in regard to other countries and low-cost economies, thereby bringing income into this country.</P>
      <P>Senator Paddy Burke pointed out that the fiscal management of the 1980s had much to do with the phenomenal success of Ireland&rsquo;s Celtic tiger. I acknowledge that the Tallaght strategy of the mid-1980s played its part in ensuring that the budgets of 1987 to 1989, inclusive, were successful. The then Fine Gael leader, Mr. Alan Dukes, deserves great credit for this, although it is ironic that it probably led to his ultimate demise as leader of Fine Gael. However, the foundations of success were laid even further back in the 1960s with the introduction of free secondary education and the planned expansion of third level education. We need to continually adapt and improvise as the changing needs of the global economy demand. The Minister for Education and Science yesterday stated that the attraction and retention of postgraduate researchers is critical. We must invest significantly in research and development and create our own intellectual property, or import it if necessary, to ensure we are in a position to compete.</P><Col N="1009"/>
      <P>Much has been said about physical infrastructure over the years but there is no doubt that while much has been done, more remains to be done. Dublin has experienced very significant investment and the benefits of this are becoming clear in the context of Luas and other projects. Coming from the north west and having spoken often about regional imbalances, I suggest a significant opportunity exists for the Government to embrace the national spatial strategy in terms of the nine gateway centres, particularly those outside Dublin, and the hubs. We must reach a scenario where we will invest multi-annual capital funding in key projects essential to allowing these areas to develop. In this regard, in unison with the human resources we must have the physical infrastructure to allow the development of telecommunications access, educational facilities and other sectors.</P>
      <P>Tax may be an issue as companies look to Ireland as a location for investment. It is important we maintain competitive corporation taxes and worth noting that Costa Rica, Singapore and other areas have low corporation tax. I ask the Minister to consider these points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of the public must be informed of this legislation through press releases and public relations exercises. Those who drafted the Bill should be proud of it, as well as those who will see it through to enactment.</P>
      <P>The issue of identity between physiotherapists and physical therapists needs to be addressed. Senators were contacted by the school of physiotherapy which believes that the term &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo;, as is used in Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, Europe and the US, should be used in the context of a physiotherapist. It means one and the same thing in other jurisdictions but it does not in this State. The international organisation of physiotherapists would also like to see the two terms recognised as meaning the same thing.</P>
      <P>I am in no way demeaning the role of physical therapists as they do excellent work. I have seen their scope of practice which is excellent and no Member is seeking to damage their livelihoods or practices. From speaking to physiotherapists, they want to work hand-in-hand with physical therapists. They see the need for them but under a different title and I suggest those who drafted this legislation could rejig the name &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1010"/>
      <P>I look forward to the Bill&rsquo;s progress through the House. Minor items that were tinkering around the edges of the medical practitioners Acts and the nurses Acts have been put right in this Bill, particularly on the issue of fitness to practise measures and the health committee.</P>

	<P>He is most welcome in the House as an old friend.</P>
      <P>I feel the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists had a point on the use of language, particularly having read its admirably succinct submission. So many bodies believe that unless a submission is 20 pages long, one will not be impressed. The opposite is the case and I share the views of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds. If it cannot be put on one page, then the writer does not know what he or she is talking about.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech was a mixture of brave and interesting comments. The brave ones referred to the health strategy again. Until some part of it begins to work as distinct from being an aspiration, the bravest action for the Government is not to mention it. However, the T&aacute;naiste, being the woman she is, did refer to it. Whether one agrees with her, her comments are often interesting in a provocative way. The country should take seriously her reflections on professional regulation. Although I do not agree with her, there is a way of doing things in this country that achieves the worst of both worlds. For example, when one buys a brand new car to use as a taxi, one must have the national car test done on it. This is a classic example of regulation gone mad.</P>
      <P>I have always expressed scepticism about self-regulating professions. My profession, engineering, is to a degree self-regulated but it is also regulated by a competitive market. In spite of occasional efforts by the engineering profession and its prominent members, the numbers of engineers qualifying in third level institutions has increased dramatically. The professional institutions have had no real option but to recognise all as professional engineers. Any self-regulatory mechanism must not become a vehicle for protectionism. I am intrigued that there is no section on poor professional performance in the appropriate legislation governing regulation in the Bar Council and Law Society. Although there is a provision for malpractice, no authority is given to either body to adjudicate on a lawyer or barrister <Col N="1011"/>who has done a bad job. It is an extraordinary omission and is the best argument against our understanding of self-regulation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill yet we are slow to take actions, which are self-evidently necessary. Let us consider the issue of unqualified people practising as physiotherapists. Their victims may have civil cases against them, but they must be entitled to more from the State than just the right to go to court when their spine has been permanently damaged by quackery. I have no political objections but certain issues in this process need to be addressed. I am glad that the councils to be established under this legislation will have a substantial lay membership. No profession should be regulated by a body controlled exclusively by its own members. There is a need for lay participation in, dare I say, the Law Society, the Bar Council and accountancy.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill&rsquo;s remit covers poor professional performance. In this area, the public must believe there is a simple straightforward process for dealing with a person claiming to be professional, yet manifestly failing to do his or her job.</P>
      <P>We often hear people say in dealing with allegations of medical malpractice that if somebody had only told them the truth from the beginning and let them know what was happening they would have had no interest in pursuing the matter through the courts. There is a conundrum there because if one admits to having done something wrong one gives one&rsquo;s opponents a strong case. That is why mediation serves a very useful purpose in this legislation. There are many people who simply want to feel vindicated in their belief that nobody looked after them properly in any profession, including engineering and teaching, the two hats I wear from time to time. I would be delighted to see some proposals to extend this remit on poor professional performance to other professions as well. </P>
      <P>The listed professions are the nub of the Bill. I read the Minister's speech on how these professions were chosen with great interest. I do not have a major argument with her about the professions, none of which should be absent from the Bill. One might ask, however, what else should be in it. I am not entirely happy with the criteria. The Minister stated: &ldquo;The 12 professions to be subject to the provisions of the Bill in the first instance were selected because they are long-established providers of health and social care within the health service and in most instances have experience of self-regulation.&rdquo; I accept some of that but I worry about many new quasi-medical professions in the area of therapy, counselling and so on which are not long established or well regulated. In many cases that is because the practitioners do not want too much regulation nor do they want any suggestion that they would be regulated in the same way as the medical profession. I am married to a consultant psychiatrist and while I have no professional interest in this I <Col N="1012"/>might be accused of being part of a lobby, which is not the case.  </P>
      <P>There are wonderful people working as therapists and counsellors but there are many who appear to be able to do a six or 12 month course in any university and put up a plate declaring themselves counsellors or therapists. This is very dangerous and is why I am not happy with the Minister&rsquo;s emphasis on &ldquo;well established&rdquo;. This is not a political argument. We must also consider new professions. I am sceptical about practices such as homeopathy. The State has a role in evaluating many of these new remedies which may well work but consumers are entitled to some attempt at objective assessment of their effectiveness. If people want to sell coloured liquids which are otherwise harmless and claim they are cures for baldness then let them at it, as long as we are sure they will not do much harm.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no profession in the list to which I object. I am not suggesting that chiropody should not be on the list but while the harm a chiropodist can do is quite significant, the harm a poorly-trained therapist can do when starting to explore people&rsquo;s subconscious and working into that area is significant for individuals, for their relationships and sometimes for society. The area of therapy, psychotherapy and counselling desperately needs regulation. Whether it needs as much regulation as this Bill contains at this stage I do not know but the nettle must be grasped to convince people that this is not a takeover by the medical profession, because that is how many people would see it, but is in their interests. There is a need for formalised recognition of who can call himself or herself a counsellor or psychotherapist and so on.</P>
      <P>The psychologist is defined here quite precisely and correctly but as the role of the church in society declines, a profession is growing of replacements for the clergy who are being paid to do all the listening that good clerics used to do. Most priests, however, had a reasonable five or six years training and before the church would allow them undertake that sort of delicate work they were presumed to have some maturity. I am astonished at the number of people who, on getting stuck in a job they do not like, decide it would be more satisfying to be a counsellor and move from something utterly unrelated to counselling people, having completed a 12 month course. I worry about this. The capacity exists in the legislation to add other professions but apart <Col N="1013"/>from the reference to &ldquo;well established&rdquo; if one accepts &mdash; and I do &mdash; the criteria listed by the Minister, which includes &ldquo;the potential for harm to the public&rdquo;, that area carries a considerable potential for harm.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go on at length about the Bill. I welcome the level of lay participation. Senator Feeney spoke yesterday about the importance of having a health committee as well as a fitness to practise committee. I accept her expertise on the matter as she suffered the Medical Council, which is probably a reasonable way to describe it. She knows it better than we do. I am always worried about the possibility of people being targeted for malicious complaints but that is the world in which we live. Those of us involved in politics do not have any reason to be too touchy about it. We live with malicious complaints. Anyone claiming to be a professional must do likewise. The balance in the legislation is reasonable in terms of protecting a person&rsquo;s good name while also protecting the public. With those reservations I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to the House. The Minister herself was very welcome here yesterday. When we think of health reform we think of hospitals closing, the Hanly report and various other matters. However, that is not what health reform is all about. This Bill is part of the health reform programme whereby the consumers, the patients availing of the services of the ten bodies enumerated in the Bill, will be ensured a proper regulated service. It is the right kind of legislation and regulation. We often think of regulation as being heavy handed and demanding. This regulation will guarantee that if one goes to a chiropodist or to another health provider or social worker enumerated in the Bill, one receives a certain level of service, knows what this person can do for one and where to lodge a complaint if one feels hard done by. This is serious medical reform that has nothing to do with infrastructure, hospital buildings or anything of that nature. It serves the patient and the consumer.</P>
      <P>Patients and consumers are often overcome with mystification about the particular services a practitioner can carry out. I note that we will have legislation on medical practitioners and nurses, which will update and regulate these professions in the light of modern trends and the demands made on people today. Senator Feeney&rsquo;s idea of obliging practitioners to display their qualifications on the wall is a good one. When a Bill is published, we normally receive many letters and telephone calls. In this case, we only received correspondence from physiotherapists.</P>
      <P>A survey was done that showed that more than 90% of Irish adults are aware of physiotherapists and almost 30% are aware of physical therapists. I have never heard of a physical therapist, but I have heard of physiotherapy and how difficult it is to get into it, how long and arduous is the <Col N="1014"/>course and the work undertaken by physiotherapists. When I hurt my ankle three years ago, I was lucky to have a chartered physiotherapist living near me and to whom I repaired very often. She displayed her qualifications on the wall explaining what she was entitled to do. I found that she was a wonderful woman practitioner.</P>
      <P>I had never heard of physical therapists. A physical therapist clearly does more or less the same work, but does not have the same qualifications. There is room for confusion because the terms are interchangeable in 90 countries. If that is the case, we should clear it up and create a common parlance for the remit of the profession. I thank the physiotherapists for sending us the information, because it is useful and was backed up with a survey.</P>
      <P>More than one in four people in the survey believe that a physical therapist requires a university qualification, which is not the case and therein lies the danger. We are not being elitist when we talk about a university qualification, but if one spends five years learning one&rsquo;s profession and receives a hands-on training, then one is highly qualified and is capable of carrying out one&rsquo;s profession. If that is not the case, then there is a danger for customers. While someone can claim to be a beauty therapist, how do we know that the person is one? The person may look beautiful, which is a good advertisement for what the person is practising. The person&rsquo;s name is often followed by a puzzling set of qualifications because we do not know where the person got them. I am suspicious of someone who parades 14 letters after his or her name. What does it mean?</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Ryan. We all become public representatives and we perform a counselling service in our clinics. I do not like the word &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; because it betokens that someone who attends it is ill. I do not use the word myself, but it has become common parlance for people doing constituency work. I often find that people who come to see me do not have a real query, but want to tell me something, so I have to develop a listening technique. Senator Ryan was worried that in so doing, we are professing to have a profession for which we have not been trained. It is an interesting question, but life brings forward those skills in people and listening is not a difficult component to acquire. It only requires that we shut up ourselves and listen to someone else. We like talking and like being listened to, so every Saturday there is a change of emphasis in our lives as we are doing the listening.</P>
      <P>I have often commented on the lack of engagement between people. If they talked to one another rather than at one another, then the doctors&rsquo; clinics might be empty. Doctors do not have the time for this. When someone goes to a doctor, the doctor wants to know that person is ill, what is wrong and then wants to write a prescription and send the person on his or her way. The lack of communicative skills is difficult in dealing with patients.</P><Col N="1015"/>
      <P>It is interesting that we are now going to impose strictures, qualifications and parameters on all of these practitioners. Years ago, if a patient was ill and in a hospital, he or she would lie there meekly while the doctor would discuss in loud tones what was wrong, where the patient would have to go and what would have to be done. Female doctors would be more discreet in what they were doing, yet no one questioned doctors. No one questioned their qualifications or their pronouncements and the patient went meekly along with it. We were supposed to assume that doctors know best.</P>
      <P>This legislation will give us empowerment, a word I dislike but I use it here. Consumers will be empowered and will know the shape and the make of the person to whom they will have to consult on a one to one basis about their ills. That is real power for the consumer. The fact that it is enshrined in legislation will mean that the person who feels that he or she has been wronged by a practitioner can seek redress. I welcome that.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste previously worked in a Department where regulation was heavy handed. I believe in giving more power and knowledge to consumers. They should have a right to find out about who they wish to consult. If they feel that they have been badly handled, they will be able to find out how they can take a case against such practitioners. I like the idea that the general council is composed of 12 members who are from the professions and 13 who are outside people. Why should the professions have a majority? They would only regulate themselves if they had one. It should be weighted in favour of the consumer and that is what will happen with the proposed membership of the council. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to discuss an issue which needs to be addressed. Many resources are used to ensure that our doctors are trained to a high international standard after seven or eight years of preparation. A significant proportion of those who qualify as doctors leave the country immediately afterwards to study elsewhere or to travel around the world. I accept that the role of the State does not involve telling people what they can and cannot do, but we have to cop ourselves on in this regard. Substantial public resources are expended on training doctors, nurses and care professionals who are needed as never before, especially as the population of this country has increased by 500,000 in the past ten years. We should include certain obligations in the contracts of people who have benefited from public resources. The Government&rsquo;s hands are tied <Col N="1016"/>when a person on whom resources have been spent leaves the country at the end of his or her period of training, for example, to engage in international travel. We should consider whether that is acceptable in light of the current level of demand on our health service. We have to find a solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise a consumer issue which is not directly related to the Bill. GPs in the Dublin area impose charges which can vary from &euro;35 to &euro;50 per visit. As a consumer with two small children, I regularly use the GP service. One third of people in this country get everything for nothing through the free medical care system, while the other two thirds have to pay for everything. There is nothing in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the great dilemma in our free health care system. When the health and social care professionals council has been established, medical scientists will have to deal with this issue in terms of general practice. Why is the wide variety of cost to families and consumers who use the GP service acceptable? I ask the Irish Medical Organisation to take up this issue. It is not acceptable for a wide variety of charges to be imposed by GPs who are providing services to a community. It is an important point.</P>
      <P>The problems caused by a cowboy element who offer a way out to those who are trying to cope with difficult diseases have regularly been raised by Senators on the Order of Business. The cowboys to whom I refer offer miracle cures to those suffering from cancer and other diseases for which there is no hope. I hope the council will come down heavy on those offering such miracle cures because they cause people facing a terminal illness misery and suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has been raised many times during the proceedings of the House. I hope the council will do some significant work in this area.</P>
      <P>I was approached some time ago by practitioners of alternative medicine who have been calling for an alternative medicine registration system for many years. While such a register cannot be provided in the Bill, has the Department considered the establishment of a registration body outside the ambit of the council? Such a body would facilitate some form of registration on the part of this country&rsquo;s thousands of practitioners of alternative medicine. I do not know if the alternative medicinal practices stand up to medical scrutiny, but I am aware that significant sums of money are being spent on them. Therefore, there should be a registration process.</P>
      <P>There are real problems in our schools because the demand for speech and language therapists, which has increased following the expansion of the speech and language therapy service in recent <Col N="1017"/>years, is not being met. According to a quote in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 November last, &ldquo;there are 500 speech and language therapists in the country but only about 400 are working.&rdquo; The article also referred to a new organisation which has been established to offer hope to people with autism. Many such bodies have been established in the United States over the past ten years to offer something other than a quick-fix solution to the parents of children with autism. I do not doubt that there is a need for the services of those who are qualified and those who are establishing a commercial activity, but we need to distinguish between them in the area of speech and language therapy. I hope the new council will penalise those who offer hope to people but who simply take money from their pockets.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of self-regulation, generally speaking, because it is important that people outside a profession should be involved in regulating it and deciding how complaints can be made against those involved in it. In this regard I welcome section 9(3)(<i>b</i>)(iv), which states that nine ordinary members of the council will be &ldquo;representative of the interest of the general public.&rdquo; That is very important. The section also states that they will be &ldquo;appointed with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.&rdquo; As the Departments of Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are involved, I assume that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children will have the power to appoint various people under the seal of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, or at least to recommend that they be appointed. It is important that as wide a group as possible should be part of the council to represent &ldquo;the interest of the general public.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Third Schedule lists the Irish qualifications which are required by existing practitioners if they are to qualify to register at the outset. It is not clear that similar provisions will apply to those who qualified outside Ireland but have been validated and are entitled to work in this country. Can the Minister of State clarify this matter? Does the Third Schedule deal specifically with those who received their qualifications in Ireland? Does it cover those who are practising in Ireland, even though they received their qualifications in other jurisdictions? I ask for some clarity in that regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which will lead to much more public confidence in a range of professional services in the medical and educational spheres. The House will do its utmost on Committee and Report Stages to progress the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Maurice Hayes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will defer to my colleague, Senator Norris. I will speak after him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my gratitude to Senator Maurice Hayes for his courtesy in allowing me <Col N="1018"/>to speak before him. Perhaps his generosity was inspired by the profusion of Hayeses in the House. I am grateful for his kindness because I am scheduled to do an interview. I would like to take up a point made by Senator Hayes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The lesser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;number one, which relates to one of my principal reasons for wanting to speak on the Bill, which I welcome. I congratulate the leader of the Minister of State&rsquo;s party, Deputy Harney, for choosing the poisoned chalice of medicine. It was an extraordinarily courageous act because the job of the Minister for Health and Children is probably one of the most difficult in the Government. I hope she will make a difference and I believe she will.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Bill before the House does not address the development of quackery throughout the country. In the past year, there has been a series of horrendous cases of people promising wildly unrealistic cures for cancer to the vulnerable. Sick people have been offered medicines and various forms of treatment which do not have any impact. Some of them have been persuaded to leave the course of chemotherapy or radiation therapy on which they had embarked. Patients and their families will grasp at any straw of hope in such circumstances. This practice should be stamped out because it is utter cruelty. I am amazed that such people have not been disbarred by the medical profession. I am surprised that they have not been prosecuted. It may be that it is difficult to persuade grieving people to take on an additional burden, but I think the State has a duty of care and guardianship to those who suffer from the extraordinarily cruel actions of others.</P>
      <P>One could understand the practice if it involved people who genuinely believe they have a cure and are keen to try it out on a couple of people. However, when they continue to pursue it and to charge exorbitant sums for medicines that are patent rubbish after they have received evidence that they do not work it is one of the cruellest activities in which so-called medics can engage. They dishonour the noble profession of medicine.</P>
      <P>I would also like to turn to the question of chartered physiotherapists. I am glad the Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, raised this matter, but there are several other worrying issues to which I do not think she referred. They concern the confusion between physical therapists and physiotherapists. I mean no disrespect to some practitioners of physical therapy, who I am sure may be good. The difficulty arises principally because, in the United Kingdom and many other European jurisdictions, the title &ldquo;physical therapist&rdquo; is synonymous with &ldquo;physiotherapist&rdquo;. To practise as the former, one must have certifications, qualifications and so forth. However, in this country that situation does not obtain. I am sure that there are good physical therapists who would welcome a process of registration. It is <Col N="1019"/>necessary that the Bill review the matter, if necessary by amendment, since serious consequences result from the confusion.</P>
      <P>Having just passed my 60th birthday, I place myself in the vulnerable category of the elderly. People, including the elderly, can easily be confused, leading to a situation where they go for treatment &mdash; they may be living on a pension &mdash; under the illusion that a course of treatment provided by a physical therapist is regarded by the insuring bodies in the same light as a physiotherapist and that they will be reimbursed by the VHI, BUPA or whoever. However, that is not the case. Vulnerable elderly people take a course of treatment that has not been assessed professionally and find, in addition, that they will not be reimbursed. That is a great pity.</P>
      <P>Although I represent the graduates of Dublin University, I am less worried about the question of university qualifications. In nursing and so on, there may now be a little too much emphasis on university and academic matters. I was an academic for a while, and I do not denigrate that, but nursing is a caring profession, and experience, motivation and personality are just as important. One can over-academicise matters.</P>
      <P>The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists makes the point in a position paper that there are differences between physiotherapy and physical therapy, and this continues the confusion. I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to examine this aspect of the legislation with a view to addressing the matter. She should also bear in mind that physiotherapists are not being snobbish or elitist. They say at the end of their submission that they would be very happy to work under a proper arrangement with their colleagues in physical therapy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I wish that it went further by attacking the quacks. I look forward to a vigorous assault on their noxious practices from the Department. I thank Senator Brian Hayes for his courtesy in allowing me to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to the House. It is always a pleasure to have him here. I also welcome the Bill. I am strongly in favour of its main thrust and have just a few points to make, most of which will echo what Senators have already heard.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the qualifications and how they are described, particularly, as Senator Brian Hayes said, in the Third Schedule. The Minister may tell us that people who qualify in Northern Ireland or elsewhere in the UK will be covered by the recognition of EU degrees, but it is very important that qualifications be stated in such a way that there is both recognition and transferability on the grounds that many of the courses proposed as proper for recognition were pioneered on this island by the University of Ulster. They are of very high quality. Equally, when I was working in Northern Ireland, we were <Col N="1020"/>blessed with people in various disciplines who had trained in Dublin and elsewhere in the Republic of Ireland. They made an enormous contribution to services.</P>
      <P>In passing, perhaps I might deal with the point that Senator Brian Hayes made about tying people to service. I believe that it will be very difficult. I have seen it tried in the past, and when tested it becomes extremely difficult to enforce. There must be a matching of the number of training places to the number of professionals likely to be needed in a society, and that is also a difficult piece of arithmetic. However, I argue for the expansion of most professions supplementary to medicine. Most of the time we have been thinking of such people in hospital settings, but they can transform primary care and keep many people out of hospital through work in the community. I have a little difficulty with the description of a social care worker. I know what a social worker is, but I am less familiar with a social care worker, apart from the child care aspect. I need a little more definition.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see bodies tying themselves to the chariot wheel of a university qualification in everything. Some professions, in a desire for legitimacy, have over-estimated the need for university degrees. There is a great deal to be said for the introduction of what in the North are known as NVQs and HNVQs &mdash; vocational qualifications. There is much to be said, particularly in hospitals but also for those caring for the elderly in the community, for enriching the jobs of people such as home helps and care workers to give them an interest. Cleaners in hospitals, for instance, are an enormously important part of the caring team, and there should be a way of recognising that too. I am glad that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has left room for the recognition of other groups. I am thinking of people such as chiropractors, since I am lucky enough to be looked after by one with a four-year degree. Their body seems to be as professionally competent and controlled as any other.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for dealing with malpractice and complaints. However, it does not deal with the question of insurance as opposed to indemnity. Many such people will be working in a health board setting where the employer will look after them, but some may not. There must be something roughly comparable with the Medical Defence Union so that patients who feel that they have suffered and have a case for civil action do not find that there is ultimately nothing with which to compensate them. Like other Senators, I am worried by the emergence of counsellors of various kinds, some of them of doubtful provenance, but some very good. An effort must also be made to provide definition and regulation in that field.</P>
      <P>I would like to see attention paid to alternative medicine for two reasons. Some is very good, and some practitioners are excellent, but in recent years many abuses have arisen in the field, includ<Col N="1021"/>ing cases of people being exploited both financially and emotionally. The matter is worth addressing, be it in the Bill or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I commend and welcome the Bill. It is a good idea to bring together professions which are supplementary to medicine, and have one body rather than a proliferation thereof. I am concerned about the transferability and mutual recognition of degrees and qualifications across the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome this long overdue Bill, which has been spoken of for many years. It is good to have some sort of proper regulation. It is also an issue of public confidence and it is important we assure the public those involved in these professions and disciplines are qualified and capable of treating people. I welcome the establishment of the council and the registration boards for the various disciplines.</P>
      <P>Other Members have alluded to the danger of self-regulation. We must monitor this situation regularly to ensure there is no over-regulation. There is also a danger in terms of competition. There is a need for competition in every discipline. We must have a complaints and mediation procedure. There is also the issue of appeals to the High Court in the event of people not agreeing with the complaints or mediation procedures.</P>
      <P>There is no need for university degrees for some of the positions within the health service, many of which require caring people with experience. They should not be barred from entering these professions.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business I often raised the issue of cowboys, as I call them, who advertise cures for cancer. Most other speakers have mentioned such people within the medical profession. Under the terms of the Bill, sufficient procedures are now in place to tackle these cowboys. However, I am worried about those outside the medical profession who advertise these cures. When regulation is in place to tackle people within the medical profession, we will be able to come down harder on those outside. It is despicable to give people hope where there is none. Some of these cures have been proven, in some instances, to be nothing more than water. People will go anywhere if they think they can find a cure for their illness. We should come down heavily on those outside the medical profession. Such measures may not come under the remit of this Bill, but it will give us greater powers to strongly tackle such people.</P>
      <P>The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists is worried about duplication with regard to physical therapists and physiotherapists. Internationally, these titles are synonymous and interchangeable, and the professional qualification requirements are the same. This is recognised in the 92 countries which are members of the world organisation of physiotherapists. Almost every speaker has referred to the matter, and it must be <Col N="1022"/>addressed on Committee or Report Stage. When people visit a physical therapist and then go to claim back money from BUPA or the VHI, they find they are not eligible for reimbursement. This should be dealt with now rather than later. I know the Minister of State, together with the Minister, will look at the situation and come back with amendments to address it.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State and his officials for bringing the Bill to the House. It is long overdue, and we will do everything possible to ensure its passage and to improve it on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the Bill. It is important that a system of statutory registration for health and social professionals is put in place.</P>
      <P>I am happy the emphasis of the Bill is on protecting the public. I received an e-mail from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists which stated it has concerns regarding adequate protection of the public under the terms of the Bill. I hope the Minister of State can allay these fears.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, a survey was carried out of people who had used the health service. Up to 92% were very happy with services at the hospital where they had been patients. An even higher figure of 94% expressed satisfaction with the GP service. That is a good starting point and places in context any criticism I make with regard to people&rsquo;s worries about health services.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins raised the issue of so-called alternative medicines. Some people have preyed on the fears of those with serious illnesses. People have touted a cure for cancer, when there was no basis for their claims. This has been made evident thanks to the media and, in particular, the Joe Duffy show which highlighted the practice. I am glad steps are being taken to ensure people do not prey on the sensitive nature of this illness, when people and their families are at a delicate stage.</P>
      <P>It is amazing there are so many so-called cures for arthritis and back injury, from drinks to acupuncture to operations. The national treatment purchase fund has been successful in allowing people to travel outside their own area for operations, in some cases to Northern Ireland or Great Britain. However, much damage has been done to those who have perhaps undergone the wrong type of treatment for back injury.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few words about the 12 health and social care professions dealt with in the Bill. I look forward to the day when we have similar legislation for medical practitioners and nurses, which I understand will follow. There have been some concerns expressed about the situation of the professions listed. I am glad that whether one is in the public or private sector one is covered under the designation. I am also glad the Bill has, on the whole, been welcomed. It has given an assurance to the public that there will be some accountability in the area. That is stressed in the first page of the Minister&rsquo;s speech. The issue of <Col N="1023"/>registration being legally necessary is also dealt with as it is no longer good enough to have voluntary registration. We now want a mechanism for prosecuting offenders, which is very much part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Under the new legislation it will be an offence for an unregistered practitioner to use a protected title or to falsely represent himself or herself as a registered practitioner. That too is very welcome because we have had indications that such misrepresentation was taking place in the health system.</P>
      <P>The main emphasis of the Bill is on protecting the public. That emphasis comes from the Minister and the Department, as well as from the professionals, and it is welcome. I hope the Bill can be passed quickly and that the necessary registration will take place. There are other health issues which I am not allowed to discuss today. The opportunity may arise when the legislation dealing with medical practitioners and nurses is introduced. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I fully support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and support all that has been said on both sides of the House. One aspect of registration is very welcome. As the Leas-Chathaoirleach may well know, we have what are termed &ldquo;gifted persons&rdquo; or &ldquo;quacks&rdquo;, or the seventh sons of seventh sons, all of whom reputedly have the ability to cure pain or to heal, or whom people believe to have such ability. When all conventional professionals have failed to ease a problem, some people resort to that group of people, who according to many people have given them relief. That group of practitioners is not on the list included in the Bill. Does section 90 provide for this &ldquo;gifted group&rdquo;, for want of a better term, to be included, provided its members stand up to scrutiny by some professional body which examines their qualifications?</P>
      <P>It is important that the gifted group would be given the opportunity to be included by the council in the registration and that the group would then fulfil all the requirements with which the other professional groups must comply. I know that many people have referred to &ldquo;rogues&rdquo;. I am not referring to people who operate on a profiteering basis. Those of whom I speak are genuinely committed in their own right to relief of pain and are traditionally successful, in many people&rsquo;s minds, with regard to the treatments they provide. There are such people, bone-setters being one example. Traditionally in Ireland they have had great success. They are not called on so much now because one can go to an accident and emergency unit and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Where they wait 16 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. The bone-setter was on duty 24 hours per day, round the clock in the traditional way, and was always accessible. I do <Col N="1024"/>not know if there are any bone-setters currently practising but in the past they provided an important service to many people in rural, isolated parts of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am also referring to those practitioners bordering on physiotherapy. How they do their work is best know to themselves, but they provide relief for many people with back aches and all sorts of sports injuries which would not necessitate formal referral through the usual hospital route. Many of these practitioners never charge any fee and leave it to the discretion of a person making a return visit to make a financial contribution or offer a gift. Does section 90 of the Bill allow for some of those people outside the listed bodies to be included?</P>
      <P>There is a crisis in Ireland with regard to many of the listed professional groups, particularly speech and language therapists. There is a great need for those people, especially given the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act. Many parents face great frustration in trying to access the professional care badly needed by their children. There is a very slow throughput of professional persons in this area in particular and we see its consequences. The delays experienced are one of the greatest factors preventing any improvement in school children with special needs. It is a cause of great concern that so many people are denied the appropriate help. We should do whatever can be done to accelerate the throughput in that professional area.</P>
      <P>The same applies to psychologists. How many national school principals have, over the years, seen school years pass by before getting the psychological services recommended for pupils? Senator O&rsquo;Toole will verify the facts in this area to a greater extent than me. It is vital that we see a much greater throughput of people qualifying in speech and language therapy and psychology.</P>
      <P>We have a standardisation and acceptance of qualifications within the EU. However, in the west there are people from outside the EU, not necessarily the United States but from Australia, who come to Ireland and present their credentials and qualifications. I am not sure if those people reach the professional standards of those who have qualified in Ireland. I am not opposed to these people, but some people have been disappointed with their level of professionalism and the treatments offered. There have been instances of people who got through the net, who presented themselves as qualified medical practitioners and who were not detected until something went wrong. At that stage, they were nowhere to be found. Do adequate methods exist to scrutinise the bona fides of those who present themselves as professionals under the headings listed in the Bill?</P>
      <P>A sizeable portion of the legislation is dedicated to monitoring the continuing suitability of education and training programmes. What is the position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the ongoing training of people in the professions covered by the Bill? There <Col N="1025"/>should be a new mandatory examination process for professionals who come from countries other than Britain or North America in order that they will meet the standards we have set for their Irish counterparts. This matter must be addressed because not all the rogue professionals operating here are Irish. It is time we standardised the entire process in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill which has been in gestation for a long period. I speak as a psychologist and psychology is the only one of the 12 professions in which I am interested. However, I am sure the others are just as important.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in the profession for 30 years and I have a number of concerns. Psychologists have their own professional body, namely, the Psychological Society of Ireland. For many years, we have had the ranks of fellow and associate fellow of the Psychological Society of Ireland. In recent times, a registration process was introduced. When one, as a psychologist, is accepted as having attained a certain level of professional competence, one becomes a fellow or associate fellow and this entitles one to append the postnomial letters FPSI or AFPSI, as appropriate. On registration, one may append the further letters Reg. Psychol. A similar system operates in the United Kingdom, with the exception that one would be a chartered as opposed to a registered psychologist.</P>
      <P>These letters after one&rsquo;s name are a symbol or signal of professional competence to patients, clients or members of the general public that the person they are attending has attained a certain level of competence. However, there is nothing in law to prevent anyone calling himself or herself a psychologist. A person with a diploma in hypnosis or someone who had attended a two-day course in some form of esoteric psychotherapy could call himself or herself a psychotherapist. Someone with no qualifications at all can still call himself or herself a psychologist. One of the reasons the Bill will prove extremely valuable is that, under its provisions, the situation I have outlined will no longer obtain. That is a laudable development and it is one of the main reasons I support the Bill.</P>
      <P>While the Psychological Society of Ireland could impose sanctions on those members who violate its professional code of ethics, there is nothing to oblige a psychologist &mdash; even one working in the health service, a hospital or whatever &mdash; to become a member of the PSI. One can, therefore, operate as a psychologist and hold all the degrees in the world but one is not obliged to be a member of the society. In that context, the controls and regulations contained in the Bill are needed and will prove useful.</P>
      <P>There is one further problem which I do not believe has been tackled, although I understand many negotiations took place between psychologists, the Department, etc., in respect thereof. There are many different kinds of psychologists, namely, clinical psychologists, educational psy<Col N="1026"/>chologists, military psychologists, forensic psychologists, neuropsychologists, comparative psychologists &mdash; who deal only with animals &mdash; and occupational psychologists. Does the Bill apply to them or does it only apply to those psychologists working in the area of health or in social care situations? This is an important point. Would, for example, a person with a degree in occupational psychology who works in the Irish Management Institute be entitled to call himself or herself a psychologists? I do not raise this matter, which has been debated by psychologists for many years, for spurious or contentious purposes.</P>
      <P>When one becomes a psychologist one can, in theory, work in the various fields. In practice, however, one must specialise for many years in the field one chooses in order to become competent therein. However, there would be nothing to prevent me from working in occupational psychology or any other field of psychology. In doing so, could I call myself a psychologist and then return to clinical psychology? Does the Bill address this point? It does not arise in respect of most of the other professions because one is either an occupational therapist or one is not. However, it arises in the profession of which I am a member. For many years, there was a debate within the Psychological Society of Ireland regarding whether only clinical psychologists should be registered. Perhaps the Minister will consider the matter and see if an amendment is required.</P>
      <P>In essence, I support the Bill. It has been a long time coming and it will provide good safeguards for the public in respect of all of the professions it covers. Senator Kitt said that another Bill will be introduced in respect of medical practitioners and nurses. That would be no harm. When one operates in the areas of health or social care, one is in some way influencing people&rsquo;s lives. One must be competent, serious about one&rsquo;s work, registered and consider the care of one&rsquo;s patients or clients paramount at all times. If the Bill helps to achieve these ends, it is laudable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this progressive and necessary legislation. Other Members have referred to the difficulties that have arisen in many different parts of the country in recent times as a result of people putting themselves forward as being medically qualified in certain areas.</P>
      <P>I should have done so already but I welcome the Minister of State. This is my first engagement with him since his promotion. Following many years of engagement with him in the bar lobby, I am glad we will be able to deal with him in more superior lobbies in the future. I congratulate him and wish him good luck with his work.</P>
      <P>I compliment those who drafted the Bill on their up-front attempt to protect the various titles of the professions. Titles are crucially important and in the past we failed to protect them on a number of occasions. There was a Bill before the House last week which changed the title of &ldquo;veterinary surgeon&rdquo; but also protected it. However, <Col N="1027"/>we failed to pass a Bill to protect the title &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; on a previous occasion. Given his background, the Minister of State may snigger at what I am going to say. The accountants could not get that legislation through because there was a danger people might confuse chartered accountants with turf accountants. I must admit that I do not see any great difference between the two.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of those who practise alternative medicine. Senator Ulick Burke referred to a number of such people. He spoke, in particular, about bone-setters, of whom there are still a number operating throughout the country. There are also acupuncturists, whose activities must be quite well regulated throughout the world and who operate to a strict set of rules.</P>
      <P>The list contained in the Bill does not refer to psychotherapists. There must be some good reason they are not in the list. I assume that as they are fully functioning and qualified and are part of the system they should also be included. I note that Oireachtas Members are not precluded from membership of any of the boards and that is a welcome recognition that Oireachtas Members can be trusted to sit on boards. I note, however, that Oireachtas Members may not be employed by a board. I regard that provision as being in breach of equality legislation. I wish the drafters of the Bill to know that I find it highly offensive that this legislation discriminates against Members of the Oireachtas and debars them from applying to work for these boards. I await a reasoned, logical and rational explanation why this provision is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I know people hate politicians and think they cannot be trusted to go anywhere or do anything at any time. I regard it as offensive when the only group in the whole country who are precluded from doing a particular job are Oireachtas Members. I promise that before I leave Leinster House I will take an equality case on that issue to prove that it is both illegal and unconstitutional. It is invidious discrimination and I believe it is illegal under the equality and equal status legislation. Members of the Oireachtas, whether Deputies or Senators, are of no lesser status in society than other citizens. I ask the Minister of State to bear that point in mind when dealing with this legislation. I know the drafters will be keen to indulge me on this matter and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      <P>I can find no reference in the legislation to the issue of the mutual recognition of qualifications. I read carefully the references to education and the need for agreeing qualifications, with which I agree. I would like to see that provision fleshed out. On the question of the recognition of various qualifications in different member states of the EU, the directive on the mutual recognition of third-level professional qualifications was passed 20 years ago but it still has not been implemented.</P><Col N="1028"/>
      <P>Senator Lydon referred to the case of psychologists. He explained that psychologists are divided into psychologists and registered psychologists. I understand him to refer to professionally recognised people as the registered psychologists, those whose qualification in psychology is a qualification which is recognised as a fitness to practise qualification. To put it in educational terms, one could have a BA in education which is a qualification but one would not be a qualified teacher. One could also have a doctorate in psychology but one would not be a psychologist, as the Acting Chairman, Dr. Henry, will be aware.</P>
      <P>The question of registration is dealt with once a person is recognised on the list. I would like to hear Senator Lydon develop his references further. He spoke about the Psychological Society of Ireland and the British Psychological Society. The British Psychological Society refers to chartered psychologists and the Irish society refers to registered psychologists. However, the interesting point is that the British Psychological Society does not recognise the same people as are recognised by the Irish psychological society. That is where the system is wrong. In terms of mutual recognition of qualification, this makes life very difficult. On this small island, people North and South are recognised by different bodies. If a person comes to this State, having qualified in Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast, which has a highly regarded school of psychology and is recognised professionally by the British Psychological Society, would the Minister of State envisage that person to be automatically recognised in this State? I do not mean any automatic recognition in the sense of merely pressing a button. The councils in this State should have a relationship with their equivalent council in the UK for a start but also in all of Europe.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement had both a North-South and an east-west dimension. Every time legislation such as this is passed, division is being sowed. It is only a matter of taking a decision in principle and allowing the new council to ensure it works. I do not envisage a problem because there is no great difference. The only problem is the internal politics of the different registration councils. This is not to say that the qualification from Queen&rsquo;s University is better or worse than a qualification from any other university or third-level institution on either island. There should be an agreement to do this.</P>
      <P>Some groups, such as accountants, do so already. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland is at this moment making a presentation to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. It recognises chartered accountants from England and Wales. I would like to see that happen in the case of psychologists. I ask the Minister of State to address that point in his reply.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of complaints. The complaints procedure outlined in the Bill is probably the best I have seen. It is far more extensive and far closer to the tenets of natural justice than <Col N="1029"/>that in the legislation dealing with veterinary surgeons which the House dealt with last week. In fairness, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has informed me she has taken on board the problems I have raised and she intends to change that provision.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to a number of items which are regularly missing from legislation. I compliment the Department of Health and Children on its correct drafting. Section 52(3) refers to the preliminary stages of a complaint. The preliminary proceedings committee shall notify the registrant, the person about whom the complaint is made, of the complaint, of its nature and the name of the person making the complaint. That is a provision for natural justice which should be in every complaints procedure. I applaud the drafters of the Bill for including it. I think this is the first occasion I have seen it in a Bill, unless it was in the Bill dealing with complaints about accountants. </P>
      <P>Section 56 contains a small niggling item. When the complaint is being processed details of the nature and the matter that is to be the subject of the inquiry, including the particulars of any evidence, are made available to the person being complained about. It is not good enough nor is it judicially sound for the person to be given the particulars of the evidence; they should be given access to all the evidence against them. The use of the word "particulars" seems to imply it is qualified in some way; it cannot be qualified. If someone makes a complaint against me, I am entitled to see all the evidence.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the hearing is missing, namely, the right of the person about whom the complaint is being made to cross-examine and to examine and test the evidence. I know people will not like that but unfortunately the principles of natural justice will allow for that to happen. If a complaint were made against me and were to go through all the processes and I did not agree with the complainant, I would want the opportunity to question that person and to test the evidence. If that opportunity were not afforded me and I were to challenge it on that point of law to the High Court, I believe it would be sustained. That should be included in the provision just as any kind of domestic procedure or redress allows for this, albeit that it is very cumbersome, not very attractive and very legalistic.</P>
      <P>I compliment those who drafted the Bill on their anticipation of that point by inserting into the complaints procedure at a very early stage the importance of bringing in a mediation or other informal process. It shows great thinking on the Department&rsquo;s part. An informal mediation followed by a preliminary hearing and then a complaint procedure is precisely the way it should be done. I hope the few points I have made are not regarded as narky or niggly but rather as improvement to the Bill. I ask the Minister of State to consider them. This is fine legislation. I will support the Bill and I look forward to Com<Col N="1030"/>mittee Stage where I hope the issues raised will be taken on board.</P>

	<P>I had not intended speaking on this Bill but I felt obliged to say a few words having listened to the debate. We are all aware of people working in the area of therapy against whom complaints have been made. It is important to have a statutory establishment of a professional council. The registration boards would give a curriculum vitae of their professional qualifications, education and training and if complaints are made, they will be on the register. That is welcome.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In my own area, that of psychology, the word &ldquo;counsellor&rdquo; can vary in meaning. We have financial counsellors, beauty counsellors and so on but we do not know how the word &ldquo;counsel&rdquo; became associated with my profession. I would prefer to drop the word and use &ldquo;adviser&rdquo; instead. We guide people or whatever, but we do not counsel them in the sense of the word I interpret. Perhaps that could be incorporated in the details of the compilation of the registration.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about the complaints system. It is necessary to have a method in place to deal with the procedures but in cases involving a clinical or an educational psychologist, with the variation in the definition of each type of psychologist, if a complaint is made it does not necessarily mean that the psychologist was not qualified to do the job. It may just mean that the personality of the person concerned did not work in respect of the case in question. We need to be careful, therefore, how we process complaints made. I would like that noted on Committee Stage so that the professionals will be reassured in respect of complaints that will come forward. There will always be somebody who does not like them and they will question their adequacy to be professional. The types of complaint made and the personality of the person making the complaint should be taken into account under the complaints procedure. I can only speak from experience in my own area.</P>
      <P>This legislation is welcome and long overdue. We have had many experiences in the professions, particularly in the therapy area, of people who are not suitably qualified setting themselves up as therapists. Putting in place the registration board and the other boards &mdash; there is a list of approximately 12 &mdash; might lend itself to the other professionals as well. I endorse the Bill and I hope the points made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole will be taken into account, as well as my own view on the type of complaints that will be made.</P>

	<P>I have enjoyed listening to a number of the contributions. Senator Ulick Burke mentioned bone-setters. I am not sure what the opposite of a bone-setter is but in footballing terms we would always consider the Meath footballers in that category.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole was very concerned about the exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas from the council. That is something we will have to examine. We will revert to him on it. It reminds me of a former colleague of mine who retired some years ago. He was looking back and acknowledging the changes that had taken place since he became a Member of the House. He said that when he was first elected, if the position of a postman became vacant in one&rsquo;s area it was only a matter of nominating his replacement. That is the way he put it; I do not want Members to take me up the wrong way. He said that things have changed so much now that if the position became vacant and 100 people applied for it, the only way one could guarantee one&rsquo;s person would get the job would be to recommend the other 99. Members of the Oireachtas have been excluded from this aspect of the legislation. It appears to be a regular provision in a number of legislative measures recently. It reflects poorly on Members and it is something we will examine and come back to at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their participation in the debate. I note the broad support for the introduction of this legislation, the need for which has been identified for some time, not least by the professionals themselves. The point was made by several Senators that the Bill supports patients and clients in taking greater control and responsibility for their own treatment and becoming empowered in terms of their own health status.</P>
      <P>As emphasised by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, the Bill is a milestone in the updating of regulatory structures for health and social professionals generally, as identified in the health strategy, including medical practitioners and the nursing profession. Several Senators alluded to the fact that the professionals themselves fully realise the limitations of self-regulation in certain circumstances and that voluntary codes of practice and professional ethics have no legal force. As referred to by Senator Ryan, in establishing any new regulatory structures it is important to get the balance right in terms of competing objectives and interests and the overall benefits and costs.</P><Col N="1032"/>
      <P>I would like to respond to some of the points raised by Senators. The issue of protection of additional titles is an important one raised by Senator Henry in respect of chiropodists and podiatrists. It is not envisaged that additional titles will be protected in the primary legislation, rather the Minister is empowered under the Bill to protect additional titles by regulation. It is believed this is the most flexible mechanism for addressing that issue.</P>
      <P>In this context, a number of Senators raised the question of the protection of the title of physical therapist. This is a complex issue, given such factors as the inter-changeability of the title internationally, the scope for confusion among the public and the significant number of practitioners currently earning a livelihood as physical therapists and competition aspects. It will require a practical solution that respects the rights of both parties in the best interests of the public.</P>
      <P>The operation of grandparenting provisions will be critical to the effective establishment of the system of statutory registration. It is envisaged that registration boards will adopt an inclusive approach to bring practitioners under the supervision of a registration board. An assessment of basic professional competence ensuring safety will be required. If a registered practitioner does not demonstrate the standard of proficiency, competence and professional conduct expected of registered professionals, this will be grounds for a complaint and investigated under fitness to practise procedures.</P>
      <P>Senators Browne, Ryan and Cummins emphasised the need for the Bill to promote appropriate competition. The level of lay representation on both the council and the individual registration boards is intended to ensure effective oversight and scrutiny of the work of the council and boards of any practices that might restrict competition, such as barriers to entry. In addition, each registration board is obliged to register every practitioner who meets its criteria for registration, including recognition of qualifications obtained within or outside the European Union, as raised by Senators Brian and Maurice Hayes, Burke and O&rsquo;Toole. The issue is addressed under section 37.</P>
      <P>Both Senators Henry and Ryan raised the level of lay representation on boards and the council. The proposed level of public interest representation should be regarded as underpinning the authority, credibility and public acceptability of decisions and recommendations made by the regulatory structure. It safeguards against any perception that the regulatory system is putting the interests of registrants ahead of the public as a whole.</P>
      <P>The restriction contained in section 14 relating to Members of the Oireachtas is, I understand, a standard provision. In view of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments, we will review the legal basis for that inclusion. My own view is that it reflects poorly on Members.</P>
      <P>In considering the extension of the Bill to additional professions, the key guiding principle <Col N="1033"/>will be risk to the public and that legal regulation is proportionate to the risk posed. A set of criteria is included in section 4 to inform the inclusion of additional professions under the council by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that registration boards should develop criteria for restoration to the register. The updating and maintenance of skills and knowledge required for registration would be expected to be included in such criteria. This should allay the concerns raised by both Senators Henry and Feeney regarding those practitioners who may remove themselves from a register for a period of time.</P>
      <P>As emphasised by several Senators, the accountability of the council is critical to its success and will be secured in several ways. For example, the Minister is empowered to direct the council or a board to perform its functions. In addition, the council must submit an annual report to the Minister within three months of the end of its financial year and the Minister is obliged to lay this report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>As several Senators remarked, the Bill embodies a contemporary and, in important respects, flexible fitness to practise system. As far as the investigation of complaints is concerned, it will be a priority for the council that fitness to practise investigations be processed thoroughly, efficiently and in a timely fashion, while fully respecting the requirements of due process. This requirement will be a standard demand by the High Court in confirming decisions by the council.</P>
      <P>Several Senators highlighted the provision of alternative medical treatment for serious and life-threatening illnesses. As Senator Henry stated, it is difficulty to prevent the public from availing of such services, particularly in circumstances in which conventional treatments have not succeeded and where they are regarded as a last resort. The strengthening of the regulatory environment by such measures as the establishment of a health and social care professionals council will place the public in a better position to determine whether a practitioner is suitably qualified.</P>
      <P>The broader issue can be addressed by better communication of public information, such as the Medical Council&rsquo;s recent warning concerning cosmetic surgery clinics which do not have recognised surgeons in residence, and strengthening an appropriate expansion of the regulatory system. As regards the contribution of the Bill to this issue, it will prevent unqualified occupational therapists, social workers, etc., from using professional titles and will open registered practitioners to investigation if they contravene their code of professional ethics. Contraventions would be expected to include agreeing on the scope of the practice in which a professional is trained and qualified.</P>
      <P>A national working group on the regulation of complementary therapists was established in May last year to advise on appropriate regulation of <Col N="1034"/>complementary therapists. The working group is expected to submit its report by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their interesting contributions. I look forward to the further Stages of the Bill, during which the views expressed in this debate can be considered in greater detail. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <?oasys [is1p4]?>&mdash;<?oasys [is0p6]?><?oasys [ix?>commends the Government for the completion in the reduction of the standard rate of corporation tax to 12.5% in 2003; and</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys [is1p4]?>&mdash;<?oasys [is0p6]?><?oasys [ix?>notes, in particular, that the major reductions in corporation tax were achieved while still increasing our corporation tax base and this has yielded over &euro;5 billion in revenue, up from &euro;2 billion when the rate was 36% in 1997.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister to the House. There is no doubt the reduction in taxes in the late 1990s prolonged and intensified the period of the Celtic tiger economy. It is also the case that there were minimal tax reductions under the previous Government which cut the standard rate of tax by 1%. It is a striking statistic that since the late 1980s, 13 out of 14 points of income tax reduction were made under Fianna F&aacute;il and all 14 points of income tax reduction at the top rate were made under Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>This side of the House does not want low tax revenues and a distinction must be drawn between tax rates and tax revenues. Since 1997, with the exception of one year, the increases in revenue have been in double figures, which is a healthy state of affairs. There is no doubt tax reductions have led to vast increases in tax revenue. I remember the debate in the 1980s as to how one would increase capital and corporate taxes. In 1986, some &pound;34 million was collected in capital taxes whereas in 2004, &euro;1.159 billion was collected, an increase of at least 2,000%. The same applies in regard to corporation tax which was at 50% in 1986 when &pound;258 million was collected whereas &euro;6.32 billion is due to be collected this year. We have had similar experiences in more recent times. Since 1997, corporation tax was reduced from 36% to 12.5% and capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.</P>
      <P>All this has led to more activity and more employment. It will not be many more years until employment will have doubled from just over 1 million in the mid-1980s. We know from the Exchequer returns that we are probably expecting an extra &euro;1.5 billion, some of this admittedly coming from special investigations. There is little doubt we are raising the extra revenues needed to meet infrastructural and social <Col N="1036"/>spending. However, beyond a certain point it would not be wise to attempt to increase spending because we must consider the dangerous effect of inflation, which we had experience of in the context of construction inflation in the late 1990s.</P>
      <P>There is a broad consensus in this regard among the main political parties, or I have not detected otherwise. I am not aware of the Labour Party or Fine Gael explicitly committing themselves to increasing any of the main taxes. I am of course aware that the Green Party proposes or insists that there be a carbon tax as the price of entry to Government and that Sinn F&eacute;in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which is unlikely to be part of a Government, proposes as policy an increase in all sorts of taxes. However, there is a large measure of consensus that we are pursuing the correct policies.</P>
      <P>It is entirely misleading to suggest that 50% or more of taxpayers pay at the high rate because those who are exempt from tax are of course excluded from the figures. The budget booklet last year stated that approximately 669,000 people were exempt from tax, or 35%, a further 31% paid tax at the standard rate and approximately 632,000, or 33%, paid at the higher rate. While these figures may alter at year end, it will not be by much.</P>
      <P>It is desirable, and it is the policy of the Government parties, that the proportion of those on the higher rate of tax should be reduced. However, we faced some potential financial difficulties over the past couple of years and the tax rates and bands took some of the strain. We should not apologise for this. The alternatives were that we would borrow or raise the headline rates of tax. Again, I have not heard other parties explicitly put forward alternatives in this regard.</P>
      <P>The debate is not confined to parties in this or the other House. For example, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions issued a document suggesting that corporation tax should be significantly raised. Part of its argument was based on the fact that Great Britain attracts significant investment. My answer to this is to point to the case of Northern Ireland, which does not get much investment. Account must be taken of population, geography, etc.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a peripheral part of Europe. While the greater London area may well get inward investment with a corporation tax rate of 30%, it does not follow that Ireland would have the same result or experience. In a recent interview, Ireland&rsquo;s largest inward investor, Intel, made clear how much importance it attaches to maintaining the 12.5% corporation tax rate. Any future Government would be wise to pay attention to that fact. I note the leader of the Labour Party said that it is not his party&rsquo;s intention to change that tax rate.</P>
      <P>There has been much media coverage and debate, even on the Order of Business, about var<Col N="1037"/>ious tax reliefs and incentives. These fall into three categories. There are ones where many people benefit such as exemptions from capital gains tax for one&rsquo;s home, tax on child benefit, SSIAs and so on. The second category covers high risk incentives including reliefs for business expansion schemes, artists, the film industry and stallions. There are also construction industry related incentives, due to be phased out by 1 July 2006.</P>
      <P>Concerns about the tax system are often expressed on the Order of Business. At today&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Frank Daly, made many illuminating and clarifying points on the tax system. He informed the committee that there are no indications at this time that Irish domiciled persons who claim non-residence are unable to demonstrate they were outside the State for the requisite 183 days. He continued that awareness of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; general interest and audit programme in this area, together with the financial consequences of non-compliance, motivates these individuals to keep their residence patterns within the rules.</P>
      <P>Regarding the case of the 11 individuals with gross incomes exceeding &euro;1 million but who had no net tax liability, Mr. Daly pointed out that they pay no tax due primarily through extensive use of property-based capital allowances. Members will agree that there should be no change in the situation where those are phased out. We now have a buoyant and booming construction sector. However, Mr. Daly pointed out that section 23 relief was introduced in 1981 when the construction industry was in great difficulty. Mr. Daly also pointed to the increase in the effective tax rate of higher earners since 1994.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the Fine Gael Party&rsquo;s amendment. One only has to look at the taxation tables to see how the tax burden for people at all income levels has been reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House. I apologise that I have not read the amendment to the motion so I will not comment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is a wise man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is well to be up-front about it.</P>
      <P>As Senator Mansergh stated, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the concept of a low-tax economy, not to reduce revenue, but because it is the right way to achieve better quality public services and social inclusion. The irrefutable evidence to support such an approach is set out in the motion. When discussing low taxation, we are discussing one element of economic management. Prudent increases in public spending is another, while social partnership acts as the cohesive force that helps the other elements to work together in harmony.</P>
      <P>It is not just the merits of the approach that are important but its results. The primary objective is to bring about a radical improvement in quality of life for all sections of society and ensure their sustainability. The Government&rsquo;s approach has been based on a low-tax regime. Those who promote higher taxes to increase public spending might do well to reflect on the unenviable record of past Governments in that regard.</P>
      <P>The evidence, nationally and internationally, of how people&rsquo;s welfare has improved over the past seven years is overwhelming. The recent ESRI overview of the economy confirmed this is one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world. A recent OECD study confirmed that Irish living standards have increased significantly over the past decade. In its recent annual review of the world&rsquo;s top 50 business nations, <i>Forbes</i> noted that, apart from Cyprus, Ireland has the lowest overall tax burden for business, consumers, employers and employees in the EU.</P>
      <P>Happy that such a solid foundation has been built over the past seven years, we must now ensure its sustainability. The improvements have spanned every area of public services. I also welcome that every area has a detailed programme set out for the future. These programmes are a recognition by the Government of its long-term responsibilities to the people. It is building on the successful approach of the past seven years. The many initiatives that have already taken place will prove to be of great benefit to the next generation.</P>
      <P>A decision to lower taxes has resulted in large increases in Government revenue. As pointed out by Senator Mansergh, it is not low tax for the sake of low revenue. The decision on low taxes <Col N="1039"/>has been beneficial in substantially increasing revenue generation. There has been a massive reduction of the national debt. Record amounts of investment have been made to address our infrastructure deficit. The national pensions reserve fund has been established. All these measures are aimed at the future and will significantly reduce the burden to be carried by the next generation of taxpayers. Commenting in its recent 2004 review of the economy, the International Monetary Fund considered Ireland well placed to deal with the impact of population ageing through its sound fiscal position and the high degree of pension funding. That is a very significant comment.</P>
      <P>The fruits of prudent management of the economy and public finances are evident in the everyday lives of ordinary people. Since 1997, in excess of 300,000 new jobs have been created and unemployment has been reduced from over 10% to a historically low level of 4.4.%, one of the lowest levels in Europe. Long-term unemployment has been cut by 80%.</P>
      <P>Economic growth has averaged nearly 10% per annum over that period. The rate will be approximately 5% in the near future but the average of 10% since 1997 is quite spectacular. Our public finances are acknowledged as among the strongest in Europe. Despite that we have lower tax rates, higher social welfare benefits and an expanded public service. Some would say we should not have that but we do. The Exchequer balance results show the Government is well on course and in surplus to meet its budgetary targets this year.</P>
      <P>There are several hallmarks of the Government&rsquo;s successful management including a hands-off approach, for want of better words, and social partnership. They encapsulate much that has been done and is predicted to continue, and are responsible for our success. Local and international commentators acknowledge this fact. Needs are identified, stated and targeted. Significantly, the Government has consistently refused to take the easy but blinkered option to target the funding of these needs through uncontrolled borrowing. We have learned from our own past as well as that of other governments that this approach was a disaster and inevitably led to the boom and bust cycle. Uncontrolled spending almost without exception means more taxes, more borrowing, more dole queues and more hardship for ordinary people. It is a vicious, self-perpetuating circle.</P>
      <P>One of the guiding principles underpinning the Government&rsquo;s approach to economic management has been that we must generate resources before we can spend them. That is a fundamental principle and has had extraordinarily beneficial effects because it has encouraged and generated prosperity in every sector of the economy. It has promoted investment and has created and sustained employment.</P><Col N="1040"/>
      <P>The social partnership model has harnessed the key human resources comprising workers, employers, the unemployed, farmers and Government to work together in harmony and for the common good. Although there are anomalies in the taxation system, the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor and the Government in the past seven years have made significant progress and introduced significant reforms. One of the independent conclusions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is that Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the European Union for the average single worker. Overall the record of significant achievement in that period speaks loudly for itself and provides a solid foundation for the future.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I acknowledge Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s statement that he had not read the amendment. His colleague, Senator Mansergh, commented on the amendment but obviously did not read the motion because his remarks scarcely referred to the items contained in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Corporation tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator mentioned stallions and tax avoidance measures across the board but said very little about anything contained in the Government&rsquo;s motion. It is a pity we did not hear remarks from the Senator about the contents of the motion.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to propose the amendment. When I read the motion I could not believe it. While it is in the nature of Private Members&rsquo; time for the Government to slap itself on the back and the Opposition to attack, this back-slapping goes beyond the bounds of anything I have seen here. The level of back-slapping in this particular motion is bizarre. I do not know how to put this in politically correct terms but the Leas-Chathaoirleach is of a different generation to mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this have something to do with the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It does. My mother often said self praise is no praise, and I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s mother said it to him too. There is no praise in this motion for the Government or from the Government&rsquo;s point of view. We can all cite numerous examples of broken promises from this Government since it took office two years ago. In the programme for Government it promised to &ldquo;keep down personal and business taxes in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy.&rdquo; Today we debated competitiveness within the economy. We are all familiar with the recent report showing that Ireland&rsquo;s position in the international competitiveness league had dropped from fourth to 30th within a year or two. This is another example <Col N="1042"/>of the Government breaking a promise made in the programme for Government in 2002.</P>
      <P>This Government has also introduced stealth taxes and new charges. The burden of tax has been transferred to other areas of charges introduced and increased by the Government. I see the Minister for Finance coming into the House and I welcome him on one of his first visits here since his appointment. These stealth charges are starting to hit home. Last year&rsquo;s budget added &euro;600 to the tax bill of every household. That came on top of &euro;1,200 in the previous year which makes a total of &euro;1,800 directly added to the tax bill of every household since this Government took office. It changed the emphasis and the method of tax collecting but did not reduce the overall burden on the PAYE taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I have a list of 31 different charges increased significantly in the past two years, including, motor tax, the drugs refund scheme, Voluntary Health Insurance charges and television licences. Rather than preside over a decrease in PAYE in that time, the Government has presided over an increase, primarily by not adjusting the tax bands in the past two budgets. This is a very sneaky way to get money.</P>
      <P>It was obvious to anyone observing from outside that in the run-up to the last election there was a massive splurge of cash to buy votes from the electorate. In the aftermath, the Government had to get the money back and the most obvious, easy but underhand way to do that was not to adjust the tax bands and therefore charge people at much higher rates than it should have done and than it committed to charging before and in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The failure to widen the tax band is the ultimate form of stealth tax. Half of all income earners will pay at the higher rate in 2004. In its 2002 programme, the Government committed to reducing the figure from 28% to 20%. It made that commitment in the programme for Government two years ago but as with many commitments it made then, it has since reneged on it. The Minister is accelerating away from achieving the commitment given in the programme for Government. If corporation tax is excluded, the total tax take has doubled since 1996. That can be explained by the fact that more people are working now than in 1996&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>And earning more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the doubling of the tax take cannot be explained. The reason that figure has changed so much is because new charges and taxes have been introduced that do not immediately come to public attention. One of those is the increase in VAT, which happened a couple of years ago. We have much more income coming into the coffers, but where are we getting the value for money? We are all familiar with the health service and the disaster that exists therein. The new Minister for Health and Children is not really a new Minister as she has been in Cabinet <Col N="1043"/>for seven years and she shares an element of collective responsibility for what has gone on before. However, I am prepared to wait and see if she has new ideas and I hope that she does.</P>
      <P>In the seven years of this Government, the chance of someone of my age buying a house has completely disappeared. The Government has not only just stood by, it has also imposed extra charges on people who want to buy their own home. It increased VAT by 1%, which had a knock-on effect on everything, including houses. It got rid of the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant and we now have development charges emerging. In some cases that may be even more than &euro;10,000, while in other cases it is a &euro;10,000 change in the affordability of houses for people who are trying to provide for themselves. The Government is directly responsible for this and it is doing nothing to resolve it.</P>
      <P>We are also familiar with the idea of rip-off Ireland. This morning, Senator Leyden tried to adopt the approach that we should stick our heads in the sand and say nothing about it, and then it might not exist. The fact is that it does exist and the Government has a responsibility to act to get rid of rip-off Ireland. Recent Exchequer figures show that the average tax contribution per household looks set to increase in 2004 by &euro;2,800. The cost of living in Ireland is by far the highest in the EU. An average basket of food that costs &euro;100 in Ireland, costs the equivalent of &euro;82 in the UK. Between 2001 and 2002, Ireland overtook the UK and Sweden to become the third most expensive country in the EU for consumer goods and services. By 2003, Ireland was almost on a par with Finland as the most expensive country in the euro zone. We are all familiar with the fact that Dublin has become very expensive and it is now the fourth most expensive capital in the EU.</P>
      <P>I have already spoken about the erosion of competitiveness and the drop from fourth to 13th place in the global competitive league compiled by the World Economic Forum. We had this discussion in the House earlier and I do not want to repeat the figures mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has done it twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment made a number of interesting comments in her time at that Department. In September 2000, she stated that taxation of work was still too high, and that in an environment where we had 20% capital gains tax and 12.5% tax on corporation profits, we could not have the situation where the only people who paid tax at 40% and 20% were those who worked. She also stated that those on low to medium incomes, meaning those who earned below the minimum wage, should not have to pay tax. That situation is still not resolved, although she has been at Cabinet with her colleagues for the past four years. She now finds herself in a new position, but that has still not been resolved. The <Col N="1044"/>people were given a commitment then and that commitment should be honoured by Government.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a comment Senator Mansergh made on the 41 people earning more than &euro;500,000 who were recently exposed for not having paid any tax. How can the Government justify this motion and tell the ordinary PAYE worker what a great job it is doing on tax, while those people continue to pay no tax? The actual figure over the past few years has risen rather than decreased. It is completely unjustifiable and I have great pleasure in proposing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to second the amendment and I welcome the Minister to the House. A columnist has recently called the Minister &ldquo;Boomtime Brian&rdquo;. I do not know if that will stick like the nickname of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor who was christened &ldquo;Champagne Charlie&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no champagne in Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is worth bearing in mind what the Minister has inherited. We all know what happened to the economy in 2001. We all know the person who was hailed as the all-conquering hero. If the situation was analysed and we reflected over his seven years in office, we could seriously question his achievements. When it comes to the budget, the projections are carried out by the Department as well as the type of evaluation and proper planning on spending. The projections this year are that the Minister will have a &euro;2 billion surplus, which was not anticipated when the budget was moved last year.</P>
      <P>There is a buoyancy in the economy, with a massive increase in tax take as well as a buoyancy in the construction industry where 80,000 units will be built this year, fuelling a big increase in revenue through stamp duty and other taxes. However, it is worth bearing in mind the prediction of the Construction Industry Federation for the next two years, which states that housing output will decrease to 53,000 units each year. That same revenue base will not be there for successive years. It goes back to how the budget is subsequently planned. I wonder whether the Department of Finance is planning budgets and projecting for the year ahead as it always deliberately underestimates the situation. In that case, when the subsequent figures emerge for income tax take, VAT take and the take on other charges, it can be perceived as if the Department has earned credibility as it achieved much more than it projected. That is a deliberate mechanism for the budget, as it always makes the situation look better afterwards. Despite a budgetary policy over many years, we do not seem to have achieved the proper planning and evaluation of spending.</P>
      <P>When we reflect on the budget of 2001, we have to remember that there was an election in 2002. Much of the spending was earmarked in <Col N="1045"/>that direction. From 2002 until the departure of the former Minister of Finance to Brussels, the Government adopted the mantle of Ray MacSharry, and the former Minister could have been christened &ldquo;Mac the Knife&rdquo;. The Government rowed back with harsh cuts, which was probably reflected in the recent local and European elections, where the Government parties got a hammering. That resulted from the austere changes introduced by the former Minister for Finance. He claimed it was to stabilise the situation, but it was an economic situation which he himself helped to create in the first place.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the budget, the current Minister is probably faced with people pulling in every direction who are trying to get hold of the surplus. With such competing demands, the Minister has to evaluate where the funding goes. Many people refer to the time when Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in office from 1995 to 1997, yet that Government left the economy running at a rate 10% higher than when it came into office. The economy was in good hands at that time. From a political point of view, if the then Government had spent more in the run-up to the 1997 election, things might have worked out differently.</P>
      <P>They took it on a responsible basis and we have to accept that they handed over the economy in good condition. The Celtic tiger purred over the following years as we benefited from international trends. The Government may have shown some prudence in its initial years, but that went out the door subsequently.</P>
      <P>The public believed the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, when he said before the last general election that no cuts were planned, secretly or otherwise, but we know what happened thereafter. I do not want to speak about what happened in the past two years as if I were giving a history lesson, because the Minister has inherited new circumstances and has to work from there. The taxpayers who fuelled this country&rsquo;s bonanza anticipated the indexation of tax bands, but that did not happen during the first two years of this Administration, despite a commitment that it would. There is a feeling that an increase has been given in an environment in which people find it difficult to meet escalating employment costs. Many of those who sought an increase are paying much more tax as they move into the 42% tax category. It is anticipated that the Government will do something for such taxpayers and I hope it will.</P>
      <P>The Government took a retrograde step in last year&rsquo;s budget when it cut the budgets of job creation agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards. The organisations&rsquo; budgets are sufficiently restricted and I hope they will not be confronted with similar decreases this year.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that this debate is following the debate earlier today on competitiveness. Although I did not participate in the debate, I <Col N="1046"/>followed it on the monitor and found it interesting. I will not cite many figures or give classic examples. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, said at a tourism conference in recent days that the use of emotive phrases like &ldquo;rip-off Ireland&rdquo; is projecting the wrong image of this country. Industry players at a big tourism exhibition in London have said they feel that Ireland is becoming more expensive to visit. We all know this country has become far more expensive and that people are encountering difficulties as a result. One might not like that message, which was followed up by the Minister, Deputy Martin, last night. He said that the use of phrases like &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; and &ldquo;high-cost&rdquo; gives the wrong image of Ireland.</P>
      <P>We cannot ignore what is happening in the marketplace. The increase in costs is fuelling the expectations of those whom the Minister will have to placate when he announces the budget shortly. It behoves everyone, including members of Opposition parties, to remind themselves of the problems about which Senator Leyden spoke on the Order of Business this morning. During the debate on competitiveness, he seemed to blame Fine Gael for saying that consumer costs are increasing. He was critical of increased costs some time ago, however, when he advocated the establishment of a &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; inventory. I do not know what happened to that idea. Senator Leyden has acknowledged in the past that we have a problem in this regard, but he seems to have changed his mind because an Opposition party, Fine Gael, has highlighted price increases as wrong, unpopular and something that should not happen.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister for Finance well. It is not easy to allocate resources among the organisations which are competing for funding. The motion moved by Senator Mansergh is an exercise in back-slapping. It is selective in the points it raises, although I appreciate that the same could be said of the Fine Gael amendment. I would not like the Minister to pursue the policies advocated by his predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, as he meets his responsibilities. The decisions the former Minister took over the past two years contradicted what he did for the two years preceding the election. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Cowen, will take a responsible approach to his new position and I ask him to ensure that his decisions facilitate economic stability. I wish him well in what he is about to do. I support the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it funny that some Opposition Senators have said that the motion moved by Senator Mansergh is an exercise in back-slapping or self-praise. The motion &ldquo;urges the Minister for Finance to continue to support a low tax regime&rdquo;. It is obvious that our economy has grown, developed and boomed in recent years because of the low-tax regime. Irish workers, particularly <Col N="1047"/>PAYE workers, are taking home more money on a daily and weekly basis than ever before. Those who have created indigenous employment by investing their entrepreneurial efforts in businesses are benefiting from a corporation tax rate of 12.5%, which used to be available only to multinational companies investing in Ireland. The lowering of that bar has helped small Irish service and manufacturing companies to create wealth and employment. It has facilitated the development of an economy that does not depend on globalisation and decisions taken at global headquarters in many parts of the world.</P>
      <P>The decision to reduce the level of corporation tax from 50% to 12.5%, or to 10% for manufacturing enterprises, was an effective one. It has provided an interesting model which is being copied throughout Europe. It has been suggested that the Minister should examine those rates, but I do not think he should make any changes. A tax rate of 12.5% for all companies operating in Ireland is a fair one. Small businesses are happy to make profits and to pay their employees and the Government their dues. We are all happy to pay our fair share of taxes.</P>
      <P>The motion also &ldquo;notes that since 1997 the average tax rate for nearly all PAYE workers has fallen every year including the last two years &mdash; in no case has it increased.&rdquo; Does the Opposition disagree with that? Does it not want the Government to even out the tax burden? Does it not want the average tax rate to continue to fall? I prefer to pay a lower rate of tax on all my money than to pay a higher rate of tax. If I choose to buy an expensive bottle of wine or to have an expensive meal in a restaurant, I prefer to pay more tax on my disposable income than to pay it as PAYE. I should be allowed to make some decisions in this regard. We need to examine the entire area of taxation. It is not fair if nobody pays equitably &mdash; we need to have equity in the tax system.</P>
      <P>Opposition Senators have spoken this evening about value for money, for example in respect of education. Would they like the Government to employ fewer special needs assistants? Would they like the additional teachers who have been employed in schools to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to be made unemployed? Which of the changes in the education system which have resulted from increased public spending would the Opposition like to overturn? Why do Opposition Senators not consider such changes to be value for money?</P>
      <P>There are many problems in the health service and many improvements need to be made. Does the Opposition know that state-of-the-art treatment is available in regional centres for people with cardiac problems and cancer?</P>

	<P>We certainly have regional specialties such as chemotherapy in the two centres with which I am familiar, in the west of Ireland and Cork. Cancer liaison teams are operating effectively in such centres. Radiotherapy will come on stream in the new year, or possibly beforehand. We are seeing an improvement in the health services in many areas. It is not enough, however, and I do not claim that all our problems have been solved. Where do people wish to see money saved to achieve such value for money? Do they wish to see nurses&rsquo; wages reduced again? It was this Government that resolved the issue by implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. It also addressed the issue of junior hospital doctors. Do they want to see that reversed? If they are going to talk about value for money, they should be clear about where cutbacks will be made.</P>
      <P>I have a message for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, whom I am delighted to see here. We are approaching the budget, and I would like to make one or two points, particularly concerning VAT rates. I urge him to follow the British Government in what it is doing regarding VAT receipts from the Live Aid CD so that we might see some of the 21% VAT on this going back to the charity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said that today in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>It is to be hoped he will ensure this happens. It would really be something for the money to go back to charity. I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that many charities in this country pay the full 21% rate of non-reclaimable VAT when buying services. For many organisations, that is a substantial additional cost. We must investigate whether there is any other way of proceeding. The Minister may be aware of this from his days in the Department of Health and Children. If one purchases incontinence wear for older people in a pharmacy, one pays the full 21% rate of VAT. If one buys aids or appliances for people to use at home &mdash; saving the State money, since one is not looking to the health board to provide them &mdash; one also pays the 21% rate of non-refundable VAT.</P>
      <P>There is a case in certain areas for people being able to reclaim VAT. With services provided to hospitals, many of which use agency nurses as is happening all over this city to fill immediate vac<Col N="1049"/>ancies as a result of sickness, staff shortages and so on, the agency employs the nurse, pays the wage, the employer&rsquo;s PRSI, and then charges that plus 21% VAT to the hospital, which must pay up. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, gets his take out of it and we go around in a circle. It does not make a great deal of sense to see that level of taxation on top of income tax and PRSI on wages. Perhaps the Minister might examine that in association with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I am proud of the Government and of our fiscal policies over the past five or seven years. It is not a matter of back-slapping but of acknowledging that our policies and economy are the envy of most of Europe and of many other countries. I commend the Minister on his new role and look forward to the initiatives he might present in the next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I support neither the motion nor the amendment, but that will surprise no one. I recently looked at a few figures issued by the Department of Finance. It calculated that it would cost approximately &euro;650 per annum to extend medical card free GP services, perhaps not including pharmaceuticals, to everyone. If one increased our current ODA contribution to the 0.7% requirement in one go, from &euro;450 million to &euro;750 million, it would cost us approximately &euro;300 million a year. To abolish the carers&rsquo; means test, depending on whose figures one accepts, would cost somewhere between &euro;150 million and &euro;300 million a year. I mention those numbers because I read an article last weekend by Robbie Kelleher, the stockbroker and former Dublin player, as I am sure others did. He wrote that he expected that the Government would have about &euro;850 million to &ldquo;give away&rdquo; in tax cuts this year.</P>
      <P>It is a remarkable commentary on the state of debate in Ireland that matters are expressed in these terms. We take in more than expected in recurring tax &mdash; in excess of &euro;850 million &mdash; and the view is that we should give it back. No one considers the possibility of doing away with the carers&rsquo; means test. We do not look at providing a free GP service to everyone or making a dramatic increase in our ODA. One could give another dozen examples of what we could do with that money, but the argument centres on our having to give it back in income tax cuts.</P>
      <P>Those of us who argue for an alternative have more or less failed. We have lost the argument, since people do not see this as an opportunity to do big things in social provision. They see it as another opportunity to give people another &euro;10 in their back pocket so that they might put it into private consumption. That is a terrible pity. After the American election last week, it seems the Democrats are a long way towards losing the argument on how they do things there. Unfortunately, the left in Ireland is a long way towards losing the argument without really making it, and that is also a terrible shame.</P><Col N="1050"/>
      <P>As the Minister and Senator Mansergh will certainly know, for a long time since 1994, which is the year from which one can really date the start of the boom, there was general consensus in this country on what had brought it about in the first place. It has almost become a mantra: FDI, partnership, low corporation tax rates and demographic changes throughout the 1980s leading to a lower dependency rate and so on. Most of us agreed that that was genuinely the case and that a matrix of factors had come together to cause the boom. It is interesting that people who in many cases should, and in some cases do, know better are trying to retro-fit another argument. They are now trying to say that lower direct taxes, principally on income, brought about and sustained the boom. That simply does not stand up. I concede that they made a contribution, but it is simply not fair or reasonable to say that low direct income tax rates in the early 1990s brought about the boom, which one can date to 1993 or 1994. It is a simple matter of fact that that was before direct tax rates had started to come down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It started in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The boom fed our capacity to reduce income tax. It did not happen the other way around; lower income tax did not cause the boom. That is a simple matter of fact, and it is interesting to speculate why people are suggesting it was lower taxes. The argument principally comes from the stockbroking community, if I might refer to it as such, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell. This evening&rsquo;s motion is the first example I have seen of that appearing strictly under the name of Fianna F&aacute;il, which seems to be suggesting that lower taxes were the boom&rsquo;s primary driver.</P>
      <P>It is a more interesting and complicated argument to examine whether they sustained the boom through the 1990s and into the early part of this decade, and I agree that one can clearly make the case that increased consumer spending by people with more money in their back pockets added to demand, which added to growth. However, this evening&rsquo;s motion and some of the rhetoric I have heard recently talk it up far too much.</P>
      <P>We all know what factors have sustained the boom and where employment has come &mdash; in what they call &ldquo;the modern sector&rdquo;, including ICT, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the multinationally owned sector of the economy. More recently it has come in the domestic sector, financial services and construction. Income tax rates do not impact one way or another on most of those sectors, which by and large have highly paid jobs. Income tax rates have made very little difference. Of course, one can argue that people having more money impacts on services, but they have not by any means been the primary cause of our sustaining our high rates of economic growth <Col N="1051"/>through the 1990s and into this decade. It has been the result rather than the cause.</P>
      <P>We must treat the argument repeated in this evening&rsquo;s motion with considerable care. Incidentally, it is interesting to consider what the major influences will be on sustaining the boom in future. Fiscal policy impacts only to this extent. We have to have what the Department calls prudent economic policies, for example, ensuring that we do not have current budget deficits. However, I am not sure that income tax policy makes a damn bit of difference, unless we are to do something really fairly radical, and I do not think anyone is suggesting that. Senator Mansergh is partly right to say that there is something of a consensus on corporation taxes. This measure was originally proposed by the rainbow Government and subsequently implemented by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government in its first term. I would have argued for a rate of 15% or 17.5%, as that would be sustainable over a long period of time.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The rate of 12.5%, which represents an increase for many of those paying corporation tax, would be extremely difficult to reverse. This is especially the case since many recently acceded eastern European countries have lower rates. Competitive advantage is gained from a lower rate, but we must look at how to sustain it for even a short period of time. I do not think we will be able to do so indefinitely. The best way to sustain it, even for the next ten to 15 years, is to agree to a measure of tax harmonisation. This argument may seem counter-intuitive, and may not have held true ten years ago. However, it would be the case now. Corporation tax is perhaps making a greater contribution now than it did ten or 15 years ago in terms of being sustainable.</P>
      <P>We must ask ourselves the fundamental question of why we tax. We tax to provide public services and infrastructure, which is a greater need in this country than in most. We tax in order to redistribute wealth and opportunity within the economy and society. We also make various targeted interventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Senator he has one minute remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only warming up. I had a great deal more to say. There are choices with regard to public services. They can be paid for largely out of direct taxes, or out of user charges, by making people pay for the services when they use them. They can be provided by the private sector which can afford it, and this is a variation of the previous option, or they cannot be provided at all.</P>
      <P>I have a problem with the Fine Gael motion. It is not realistic to say direct and indirect taxes are too high and should come down, or that we do not like stealth taxes, which is code for user charges, but we still need reform. That argument <Col N="1052"/>is inadequate and does not stack up. I have no problem with certain user chargers, for example, tolls on motorways. However, I have a serious problem with charges at points of use in the health service, including GP charges, and with charges in education. I would have a problem if we tried to privatise security or the way we deal with crime. We should look at it on an issue-by-issue basis.</P>
      <P>The State should provide certain services free to all the population at the best level we can afford. I disagree with those who say we should provide medical cards to those who cannot afford access otherwise. We should provide the best possible service to everybody, paid for through the taxation system. However, I have no difficulty tolling the motorway through the Minister&rsquo;s constituency. That is discretionary use by an individual who will be asked to pay for the service at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Provided there is an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to acknowledge that redistribution is part of the reason we tax. Certain people do not benefit from a booming economy, such as old age pensioners, those who are sick and lone parents who find it difficult to connect with the labour market. These people&rsquo;s boats will not be raised by the tide. If we accept they are not going to get into the labour market, the only way to assist them is to use the taxation system as a redistributive measure. Does that mean I want to raise taxes to give more money to old age pensioners? At this time, we do not have to do that. However, if it was necessary, I would say yes. That is fundamental to the political philosophy myself and my party represent.</P>
      <P>This is a complex issue, but fundamental to our politics and the choices we offer. Most important, we must offer choice, even if it is only in terms of the priorities we articulate. The priorities I would like my party to articulate are not particularly well represented in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak this evening and address the motion before the House. This Government has a record second to none on taxation in both reducing the burden and making the system work more fairly.</P>
      <P>On income tax over the past seven years, we have reduced the standard and higher rates of tax by six percentage points each; introduced a fairer system of tax credits and increased the value of those credits substantially so that no one in the PAYE system pays tax on less than &euro;246 per week; significantly widened the standard band; reduced the average tax burden for all taxpayers; and put in place a regime where, in 2004, a third of all income earners are outside the tax net as compared with a little over a quarter in 1997.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan stated that half of income earners are paying at the higher rate, but that is not true. Of 1.8 million people in the work<Col N="1053"/>force, 622,000 people are exempted from the tax net. That is basic maths. This Government has also more than doubled the tax exemption limits to &euro;15,500 for single people, and &euro;31,000 for married people and those aged 65 or over.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the contributions of the Fine Gael Senators. The average single industrial worker earns almost &euro;10,000 more now than in 1997. He or she still pays over &euro;250 less in taxes and levies. If people think what we are trying to achieve is unfair, the facts are not on their side, particularly with regard to taxation.</P>
      <P>In an international context, the most recent data from the OECD shows that in 2003 Ireland had the lowest tax wedge in the EU and one of the lowest in the OECD for a single person on the average production wage. That is an important advance in terms of the progressiveness of the tax system. I am in no doubt that the Government&rsquo;s tax policies, endorsed by the electorate, have been right for the economy, business and individual citizens. Low direct tax rates are also appropriate going forward in the context of an increasingly competitive international environment where an open economy such as ours must be able to attract and retain investment and skills in order to underpin our economic development.</P>
      <P>However, it has not all been about tax bonuses. I do not question Senator McDowell&rsquo;s position. As Labour Party spokesman on finance, he has held a consistent position in both Houses, even if it was not always in line with some of his colleague&rsquo;s comments. That is the nature of any business.</P>
      <P>By not having an informed debate on tax in this country, those in favour of a lower taxation regime are portrayed as less committed to public services. That is not the case. It is not an either-or argument. Between 1997 and 2004, economic growth generated an extra &euro;29 billion in annual resources for the State. That is &euro;29 billion more for resources such as social welfare and the provision of public services. This Government put in place a lower tax regime. Of the &euro;29 billion generated, &euro;19 billion, or two thirds, has been used to fund extra spending on services. We have used the increased resources brought about by greater buoyancy and economic activity. Two thirds of it is going towards the provision of public services.</P>
      <P>It is phoney to suggest people should vote for a party because it is prepared to tax at a higher rate to ensure better services while the Government is not. Our economic model has generated unprecedented additional annual resources, two thirds of which is going into the provision of public services. A total of &euro;4 billion went towards substantially higher public investment. This was much needed in terms of the social and economic infrastructure deficit. Approximately &euro;6 billion went towards tax reductions. The remainder went to build up the national pensions reserve fund. It was noted in the 2002 budget that of the &euro;4.8 billion in tax cuts up to then, 43% went on increasing personal tax credits, which are of more <Col N="1054"/>benefit to the lower paid, again showing a progressive equity in the distribution of the tax reliefs towards such people. Some 16% of the &euro;4.8 billion went on cutting the lower rate of income tax, 22% went on widening the standard band and just 11% went towards cutting the top rate of tax. The equivalent 2004 figure for the amount of tax relief given on personal credits is now nearly 50%. Again that shows a progressive improvement for those on lower wages, in terms of how the tax relief system is working.</P>
      <P>Much has been made in recent weeks of the fact that a very small number of higher earners have managed to pay little or no tax through the use of legitimate tax shelters introduced by Governments of all complexions. There are legitimate and reasonable reasons for tax reliefs as a general principle. We know about them. Governments of all complexions have introduced them to regenerate inner cities, improve tourism prospects in areas where the potential was not being realised and so on. Let us not throw the baby out with the bath water and suggest we should not have tax reliefs as a general principle. As we often hear in this and the lower House, they are needed in areas where the Celtic tiger has not roared as loudly as in parts of this city or parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The portrayal of these tax reliefs in today&rsquo;s newspapers and commentaries is quite distorted. The top ten reliefs cover pension contributions, stamp duty and capital gains tax exemptions on one&rsquo;s home, mortgage interest relief, non-taxation of child benefit, medical insurance relief and the special savings accounts. These come to over &euro;5 billion and I do not think anyone is suggesting they are tax shelters for the rich. They are for ordinary people trying to make a living and rear their families, ordinary members of the public trying to do the best they can for themselves and their families. These are not tax reliefs for the rich despite what some ill-advised Opposition press releases say. Those who put out such releases are very much in opposition to members of the constituencies which they claim to represent.</P>
      <P>I am conscious nonetheless of the need and desire for greater equity in the tax system. Since 1998, we have made 29 separate and effective moves to close off loopholes, limit reliefs, re-focus allowances and ensure that a proper balance is struck. We will keep all these reliefs and incentives under regular review to ensure that they are fulfilling the purpose for which they were intended and to modify or abolish them as appropriate as we move forward. The Opposition did precious little to limit reliefs when last in power. One has to place the rhetoric beside the reality when the opportunity arises. Those are the people who had the responsibility which I am now privileged to possess.</P>
      <P>The measures we took are having an effect. The most recent projections from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the present tax year indicate that the top 1.5% of income earners will <Col N="1055"/>contribute over a quarter, some 26%, of all income tax attributable to 2004. I welcome that. At the same time, those earning the average industrial wage or less are expected to contribute no more than about 6.5% of the income tax for 2004, down from over 14% when this Government came to power in 1997. That is another solid example of greater tax equity for those who can most expect it and who are entitled to have it.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the present Government parties have brought about a position where the proportion of those exempt from tax, taken out of the tax net altogether, has increased from over a quarter to about a third of all income earners. The latest estimates indicate that there are about 622,000 earners exempt from tax this year compared with 380,000 when we came into office. These policies are often berated as being against the interests of ordinary people, but an extra 240,000 people, almost a quarter of a million, who were paying tax when this Government took over from the previous administration, no longer pay tax. That is against a background of huge growth in numbers in employment &mdash; an increase of about 400,000 since 1997 &mdash; a substantial growth in <i>per capita</i> incomes over the period and the introduction of a statutory minimum wage.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to remind everyone that it was the present Government parties which introduced the minimum wage in 2000. In that year, around 64% of the minimum wage annualised was free of tax, yet in the past two years or so the Government has ensured that 90% of minimum wage has been kept outside the tax net. In assessing whether that is a reasonably good performance to date, with more to be done, we must also note two increases in the minimum wage value since 2002.</P>
      <P>The present Government parties are committed in the agreed programme for Government to exempt the minimum wage from the tax net over our current term of office and it is our clear intention to meet that commitment in the context of a responsible approach to fiscal policy which is also part of the Government programme. That is not often mentioned when people talk about commitments. Every commitment in any credible programme is based on an overall budgetary framework, as we have also outlined in our manifesto commitments.</P>
      <P>One media article last week complained about the alleged inequity of taxes, not on income, but on expenditure, VAT and excise. These, it was claimed, bear more heavily on the poor, but the facts suggest a different picture. Our VAT rates are zero, 13.5% and 21%. The zero rate applies to many essential purchases for those on low incomes, especially food and children&rsquo;s clothing and footwear, the lower rate applies to labour intensive services and the top rate applies to remaining items, many of which, such as cars, are obviously purchased more by the better off. This is a socially progressive tax structure which I am sure all sides of the House can and should readily <Col N="1056"/>support, based as it is on a social partnership network which seeks to ensure that all stakeholders in society have a real stake in the policy formation by Government.</P>
      <P>When workers or their representatives are making their contributions to society that is not just about their relationship with management, nor simply about wages, but about access to education for their children, proper health services and the room for improvement which we can discuss and acknowledge in many of these areas. Let us also acknowledge the substantial improvement in relative terms that has been achieved because of that approach, instigated by the party which I represent, and to which we are fully committed as a fundamental aim of our organisation.</P>
      <P>As for excise, 41% of excise revenue in the first ten months of 2004 came from duties on petrol and diesel and 22% from VRT on cars. Neither of these can be said to bear most heavily on the poorest of the poor. Some 20% of revenue came from alcohol and 16% from tobacco. If any excise impacts more on the lower income groups, it is these two. However, no Government since 1994 has increased excise duty on the plain person&rsquo;s pint of beer and the trade itself can take the honours for running up prices there. In the case of tobacco, increases in excise have been made for social policy reasons supported by all in this House tonight.</P>
      <P>Some people say we have gone too far in cutting tax and should move up to EU levels. We are not as far below these levels as usually portrayed if we use GNP as the measure, since that is the relevant measure. Even so, why should we want to reach EU tax levels? Do we want the 10% unemployment and 1% growth rates that go with it? Is this what some of those in Opposition want?</P>
      <P>If the Opposition informed itself of what is happening in Europe, it would see that France, Germany and others are desperately trying to reduce their tax and spend rates of 50% or so of national income. These rates are not sustainable, especially in the light of the mounting costs of supporting a quickly ageing population in Europe. As we found in the past, high rates of tax and spend leave us with little room for manoeuvre when a downturn comes, along with the inevitable dislocation of services which results, and the great difficulty we have in retrieving that existing level of service before we can again build sustainable improvement into the future. Why should we go back to that sort of stop-start approach? That is the approach I saw in the first ten or 12 years of my political career and I do not want to return to it.</P>
      <P>Those EU member states I mentioned are frantically trying to pull back from the cliff edge. Some in this country on the other hand seem to want to head in that direction by insisting we should increase our tax take to overall EU levels. It is a fallacy to suggest that the commitment to improve public services is dependent on one&rsquo;s commitment to higher tax rates. That is not true <Col N="1057"/>and the evidence is otherwise with regard to the model of this economy and how we have worked here for the past ten years.</P>
      <P>Let me turn now to business taxation. Low business tax rates have a long history in Ireland. Export sales relief which exempted exports of manufactured goods from tax was introduced as far back as 1956. From 1980, for European Union reasons, we replaced it with a 10% rate of corporation tax for all the manufacturing sector, both Irish and foreign-owned. According to the latest IDA Ireland data, in 2003 there were over 1,000 IDA supported foreign-owned companies located here which employed almost 130,000 persons. This is due, in some measure, to our tax policies. In addition to the 10% corporation tax rate for manufacturing, the 10% rate for the IFSC has also been an outstanding success.</P>
      <P>In combination with other important factors, this low rate of tax has led to the creation of approximately 11,000 jobs directly associated with the IFSC itself. The financial services and computer software sectors would see the tax wedge on labour and management tax rates as a key issue in attracting business and investment dependent on skilled labour. It is not the case that people are agnostic in respect of that matter. They are not. Those involved in the sector make that point clearly to the Government and through various avenues when there is any indication that the position might change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The corporation tax yield from all IFSC companies in 2003 was over &euro;600 million or approximately one eighth of the total corporation tax yield for that year. We must see it in terms of the contribution it is making. It is making a contribution of 12.5% of total corporation tax yield which itself has hugely increased since 1997, during which period the rates were progressively reduced. We must acknowledge that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give way briefly because I am interested in ascertaining his view? Does he accept their argument that the tax rate on their employees is important in terms of determining whether they come here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is certainly a factor but it may not be the determining one. It should not be ignored, particularly when one considers where some of these firms may go if we do not maintain our competitiveness across all of the criteria they consider. There are countries in other parts of the world which are looking to what we have achieved and which are prepared, if possible, to outdo us in many of these areas. Luckily, however, we have a track record that is keeping pace with developments. We must continually monitor developments in that sector and ensure we have the necessary legislative and regulatory <Col N="1058"/>framework in place to enable the continuation of that sort of investment here.</P>
      <P>The major growth in our economy in recent years has been accompanied by a rise in corporate profits due to booming export and home markets. This has resulted in a big increase in our corporation tax receipts despite the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 36% when we entered office in 1997 to 12.5% in 2003. The yield from corporation tax in 1997 was &euro;2.16 billion. This increased to approximately &euro;4.8 billion in 2002 and approximately &euro;5.16 billion in 2003. The 2004 budget estimate is for it to increase to approximately &euro;5.35 billion. I have only been Minister for Finance for a short period but I am aware that this is significant revenue, particularly if I want to be able to discuss with other Ministers how to build in sustained social improvements in other areas in which we have social priorities. That revenue is vital and I do not know where we would be without it.</P>
      <P>Those who suggest increasing our corporation tax &mdash; I note that no one in this House has done so &mdash; should think long and hard about what this would do to employment and tax revenue in the economy. The Government is committed to maintaining the 12.5% rate, which has been a successful element in delivering a strong economy that provides jobs here in Ireland where we need them. That is another issue that arises in respect of our commitment to low rates of tax. There is a facile argument that we are looking after the rich. However, all of the progressive changes we have introduced have been geared towards the lower paid.</P>
      <P>Another issue that arises is the fact that the corporation tax rate is great in terms of the number of jobs it helps to create. We need to ensure that we continue to create jobs. We sometimes look at this as a monetary issue or consider it a cash cow designed to provide for the provision of services. We have to keep the engine of the economy driving forward if we are to be able to meet the legitimate expectations of many of our people, particularly as they can see that the possibilities which exist are much better than any they could see on the horizon in the past.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty debating tax policy in this House. I am quite open about it. I want to see an informed economic debate take place in this country because there is not sufficient such debate here. There are, however, a great many facile arguments put forward. I want to see a competition of ideas in order that people might discover what are the options. We must devise a model which, on one hand, will maximise job creation and increase the tax take, on the other. I am a pragmatist. I favour low tax rates for a simple reason, namely, they help me to procure more tax revenue in order that I can finance the initiatives I want to take in the social areas. I have seen the damage high taxes did to the social infrastructure in this country and the missed economic opportunities to which they led.</P><Col N="1059"/>
      <P>Generations of people were, for too long, obliged to leave the country in order to make a living because of the existence of such high tax rates. We now have a chance to create a virtuous circle rather than a vicious cycle. The alternative being forward to this circle we have created is a return to the vicious cycle. We would be foolish to contemplate such a return. In the meantime, let us engage in a debate about the type of model which will maximise what we want, namely, maintain quality jobs, improve the health and education systems, etc. Let us debate that model but let us not suggest that there is a viable alternative because one does not exist. I accept that the latter is not Senator McDowell&rsquo;s intention. I want such a debate to take place because it would be better for everyone if we engaged in it.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of tax information is provided by me, in response to various parliamentary questions, and by my Department on tax issues. A large number of tax strategy group papers have been published on the web. Detailed tax ready reckoners on tax changes are regularly supplied to Opposition spokespersons and others. Surveys of tax paid by high earners have been published on two occasions. The basis is there for an informed and balanced discussion on tax issues.</P>
      <P>A well informed debate would be healthy. Reasoned argument is always welcome and well worked out positions contribute to good policy formation. I would like it if the debate on tax policy could be elevated to that level and not done through the issuing of poorly researched press releases. That would be a benefit to everyone.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s view is that low personal and business taxation have been good for economic growth. They are a key part of part of our overall economic policies, which only last week were endorsed by the IMF. That organisation indicated that the continued impressive performance of Ireland&rsquo;s economy, which is based on sound economic policies, provides useful lessons for other countries.</P>
      <P>I hope Senators have found the points I have made useful and I look forward to their contribution to the public debate on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. I was about to criticise the fatuousness of debating a motion of this sort because Government motions are often used as platforms for self-congratulation and the Opposition merely goes through the motions in opposing them. That the Government has produced a motion of this sort and that it has been seriously addressed by the Minister for Finance is a welcome development. I thank him for coming to the House to listen to this two hour debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this matter. The Minister&rsquo;s contribution was extremely enlightening. I hope we can continue to engage in this kind of thing on an annual basis. It is something of a <Col N="1060"/>privilege for us to have the Minister here. It is particularly good that he is here, in the pre-budget period, to explain his philosophy. I am glad to say that it is a philosophy which, to some extent, was not altogether expected by some of us.</P>
      <P>It is a tough time to be in opposition and it is difficult for the Opposition to be confronted with a motion of this sort because there is really no response to it. When the Government chooses the economy and the public finances as its ground and says &ldquo;We are standing on this platform of fiscal rectitude and prosperity, contest it with us&rdquo;, the Opposition really ought to go home. This has been a period of extraordinary wealth, prosperity and great success, not only for the Government but also for the rainbow coalition when it was in power for a short period.</P>
      <P>The amended motion is facile and silly and represents mere nit-picking at something which is undoubtedly a great success. Even though it is a tough time to be in opposition, we could have had somewhat of a more constructive debate, offered congratulations and given credit where it is due.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell in his speech quite rightly pointed out that the beginning of the Celtic tiger was some time around 1993. There are different theories for the origin of the Celtic tiger. Most political parties manage somehow to claim it for themselves, which is difficult to do because most of them were not in power for most of that period. The most unpalatable reason is possibly the most truthful one, that it is led by external factors. It is led by multinationals who came to this country because they found it attractive. The enormous growth in wealth is almost certainly multinational-led and is almost certainly &mdash; which is even more unpalatable in the present climate &mdash; US-led. I do not find that particularly comfortable to say but I think it is the truth of the matter. That could not have happened if the economic conditions in Ireland were not suitable for multinationals.</P>
      <P>The Government and Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s predecessor deserve credit for creating the conditions which welcomed multinationals and kept them here so that they became an anchor and an integrated part of the Irish economy. These guys come here for one reason only, not for love of Ireland, not to give employment, not to help the Irish Government, but rather to make money. If they can make money and they can bring us wealth at the same time, what is wrong with that? It is only some sort of prehistoric xenophobia which makes us fear people from outside coming in and helping us to get rich. What this Government is doing now &mdash; and what the Minister said is very encouraging &mdash; and what the last Government did, was say to the multinationals, not in terms which I am using because it is politically harder for the Government, &ldquo;Come on in, the water is warm and we will make it warmer for you.&rdquo; What the Minister said today was a form of code which is easy to understand. He said, &ldquo;The water will stay warm.&rdquo; What he said was not the <Col N="1061"/>sort of happy-clappy economics which Fianna F&aacute;il had to put up with in Inchydoney. He said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator is getting stuck in the sand.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>It always flies in his direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dardis was not there and no doubt he would have been extremely uncomfortable there, as were many of the people who were.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the tax system we have had, which was somehow a revelation to Fianna F&aacute;il and everybody else in 1993-94, is working. I am open to contradiction but he said that low taxes give jobs and create prosperity. He said it himself, which I thought was very brave, that low taxes mean more tax revenue. Of course he is correct and the figures prove it. The figures he gave for corporation tax were staggering. Ireland has one of the lowest corporation tax rates in Europe and &euro;5 billion is coming in every year. As the tax goes down, the revenue goes up.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear what Senator McDowell had to say about corporation tax because, if I am not mistaken, he has shifted his ground a little. I listened to him in the past being critical of the low rate and today he said we may have to live with 12.5%. That statement is very welcome. If this is working, even the Labour Party will have to acknowledge that it works, creates more revenue and gives more money to the Minister to spend on those causes which the party genuinely espouses and champions. That is what we all want and it is only a means to an end.</P>
      <P>What is so extraordinary is the statement a few weeks ago by the leader of ICTU, Mr. David Begg, that he wants corporate taxes to increase to 20%. He wants less tax to come in so that he can give less money to those underprivileged people whom he claims to champion and wants to see having a better life. I wonder what is going on. For the first time, and it is a very welcome development, I have seen Ministers pooh-poohing the head of the ICTU. They do not express it in those terms. They say such an idea is not a particularly good idea, without saying where the idea came from. They never say that David Begg is talking absolute nonsense because they are scared stiff of him. They would prefer to say that to the Taoiseach. There are some people of a traditional ideological conviction who still mouth the rhetoric of yesterday when the facts indicate otherwise.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s coming to the House and stating that these are the facts. I do not believe he is not going to balance that statement. The budget will contain a great deal of rhetoric which will presumably give some high profile grants to very deserving causes. That is tremendous, in my view. If the Minister has the opportunity to give away &euro;1.5 billion in the budget, we should not scream that he is buying votes or buying his way to the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il. We <Col N="1062"/>should say that is wonderful because he has done it through a new policy which has only been discovered in the last ten years and he has done it successfully. He is beginning to prove that the days of high taxation, high borrowing, high expenditure and bankruptcy are beginning to come to an end. Those philosophies are finished and it is actually much easier than we thought.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell and his party may come over to this point of view. It looks like they are moving so fast that it will make for very boring politics in this country for the next 15 years because everybody will be in agreement. There will be a Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour coalition the day after the next general election. I assure Senator McDowell we can all live with that; we lived with it before and we will live with it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if we can all live with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I think Senator Dardis can live with it too. He is showing great art of compromise in this area. I wish to sound a note of warning of a dark cloud on the horizon &mdash; the issue of the public sector and public sector pay. Not long ago the public service rolled all over the Government and achieved benchmarking which caused some controversy in this House. It cost a lot of money and I think Senator Mansergh and I disagreed about that. Senator Mansergh no doubt would say again in retrospect that it was not a lot of money. The spectre of further benchmarking is coming in 2007, which is a huge sop to the same trade unions. The problem is that the Minister may have the money in 2007 &mdash; and I hope he does &mdash; to give away to the public service in an orgy of spending to keep them happy and stop them going on to the streets. What we have not seen in that period, and which is not contestable, is any meaningful reform in the public service. I have examined this in some detail and it is absolutely undeniable that those promised reforms in return for benchmarking have not been delivered. They were a fiction with which the Government was happy to go along in order to get over the hump and hope it could pay for it. I hope we are not about to see the same fantasy, the same farce, the same quarrels with the teachers about things they ought to have done years ago, the same fudges going on about the public service, the same nonsensical verification committees sitting and saying all is being done when it has not, and giving the nod. They were acting like stuffed dummies and nodding through the money for the public service.</P>
      <P>While I hope and believe the Minister will be immensely successful in his post &mdash; today he has given us great encouragement in that regard &mdash; we must ensure that if there is to be another benchmarking round it is not done without a <i>quid pro quo</i>.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to the House for this debate. I appreciate his attendance here as the senior Minister and I commend him for his presentation, particularly because it contained so many facts. We have had all the rhetoric, and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> can bluster as much as anybody without facts, but the facts have been spelled out for us clearly and they are a cause for great celebration.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that all we are interested in doing is producing the extra revenue to allow us give to our people the services they require. The political debate is on the way we allocate those moneys. All of us are agreed that the most disadvantaged in our society must be cared for first and that everything else is secondary to that. If we examine the figures from previous budgets, and particularly those from last year&rsquo;s budget, it is significant that the proportion of money spent on the health service, education and the essential services our people need is much higher, relatively, to that in other areas. In other words, if Government spending has increased by 8%, 12% has gone to health and 9% to education in terms of the increase in spending, not the allocation of the moneys.</P>
      <P>Do we remember what it was like in the past? I was elected to this House in 1989 at a time when the unemployment rate was 14%. We had no growth. People were leaving the country on boats and aeroplanes. Do we realise how bad it was and is that something to which we want to return? If one advocated reduced taxation at that time there was a universal outcry that it would lead to reduced revenue, that all the services in terms of education, health and so on would be cut and the country would not be able to survive. We see the effect of that in Germany and on the Continent generally where there is a growth rate of 1%. Those countries cannot fund what they are doing and they have got into trouble with the Stability and Growth Pact. We had a minor blip and the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was more or less carpeted by the European Union. The big guys can do it, and it does not seem to matter, but it has an effect on what we are doing if that discipline is not exercised across the Community, and not just in this country.</P>
      <P>Objective observers both inside and outside the country have stated repeatedly that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was one of the best ever Ministers. There has been a consistent pattern, over an extended period, of ensuring that capital, income and corporation taxes are reduced and that spending is kept under control; the two go hand in hand. Senator McDowell is right that this is not exclusively about income tax but it is a big factor.</P><Col N="1064"/>
      <P>The Minister made the point, which the T&aacute;naiste also made, that the best measure to combat poverty is a job.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>We have created the jobs within the economy by having a prudent approach to our economic governance and ensuring that taxes were reduced to the extent that the revenue has increased exponentially. I will not repeat the figures the Minister gave &mdash; they are on the record &mdash; but the significant aspect is that the figure increased so much in the face of limited inflation. We could accept those figures increasing enormously if inflation was increasing to the same extent but inflation, in general, has been kept under control and the figures continue to rise exponentially. That is extremely significant. The burden has decreased and the proportion of people entering the tax net, given the huge increase in employment, has been reduced. That is a spectacular achievement and we should celebrate our achievements more often.</P>
      <P>Many groups come into these Houses to try to understand what we have done and the reason we have been so successful in the hope that they can transfer that experience to their own domestic economics and emulate some of our achievements. It has conferred on us far more than economic benefits. It has conferred on us a self-confidence and a realisation of our place in the world.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross on the inward investment by the multinational companies. They were attracted by the level of taxation here but they were also attracted by the fact that we are a stable democracy, and there are not many of them in the world, we are English speaking, we have good contract law and a sophisticated and well-educated labour force. There was much more to it than just simple economics, although that was at the heart of it. That is something we should celebrate.</P>
      <P>I had the experience of meeting a senior executive from a computer company while I was on holiday in the west. I asked him why he came to Ireland and not to the Far East or one of the economies where labour costs are so low. He said it is very simple; the productivity here is much higher. That comes back to the debate this afternoon about competitiveness. We have been successful in becoming competitive internationally.</P>
      <P>We talk ourselves down in terms of the high wage costs. Are our people not entitled to high wages? The trick is to ensure the companies that have to pay those high wages are given the competitive edge, through taxation and other Government measures, that make it attractive for them to come here and be competitive internationally.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross was wrong on one aspect. If he was as dramatically in favour of the multinational inward investment as he said, we would have GDP that was a factor of 3% or 4% above GNP, and we do not. We have achieved quite a lot our<Col N="1065"/>selves. It is not just a question of the inward multinationals coming here. I agree with the Minister on the point he repeated, and it bears repeating, that the objective of any Government should be to provide the extra resources to give people the health and education services they need and that we can be proud of internationally. That is what has been done and must continue to do.</P>
      <P>In that context, I wish the Minister, Deputy Cowen, every success in his portfolio and I wish him well in the onerous task of framing a budget within the next month. In his hands that budget will deliver more of the benefits we have achieved and we will continue to experience the growth we have returned to and from which our people will benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not an economist but if I were to become Minister for Finance tomorrow morning, or even in two years time, I imagine I would be told that the main task of the Minister for Finance is to control spending. Ultimately, Ministers for Finance have some role in bringing in revenue but they cannot control it. They can bring about conditions to ensure revenue will come in every month but the one area over which the Minister for Finance has direct control is spending. He must ensure that any money allocated is spent and that it the money allocated is not overspent. This Government has a terrible record in that area. Every quarter we see George Lee on the television telling us that revenue receipts are up but that the Government has underspent. That should be good news but it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It never will be with George; that is for sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good news if the revenue is up. The Government can take some credit for that but not all the credit. That is a reflection on the general economy. When we hear that road projects, for example, have gone &euro;9 billion over budget, that the Government has underspent in general but overspent in specific areas, that demonstrates that it is mismanaging our finances.</P>
      <P>It is dreadful that the Government is underspending when certain sectors are crying out for extra funding. A school group from Carlow, which visited the Houses today at my invitation, is seeking funding for a new building because the current building is unsafe. Students cannot use the gymnasium. I received a letter from another school this morning, in which it was pointed out that students are being taught in a storeroom with no windows or ventilation. It is criminal that such conditions persist, particularly when sufficient <Col N="1066"/>money is available but is not being properly managed. The Government should not clap itself on the back when it underspends every month but ask why it is underspending when the costs of major capital and infrastructural projects are significantly exceeding their budgets. Something major has gone wrong.</P>
      <P>As regards taxation, I will concentrate on the issues people must face in everyday life, for example, the purchase of a house. Young Fine Gael had a successful campaign this year which revealed that tax accounts for 45% of the cost of a house. When the Government refers to low personal taxation, it ignores this fact.</P>
      <P>At a meeting in Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel yesterday, SIMI noted the high cost of cars. Taxation, including VAT and vehicle registration tax, accounts for nearly 50% of the cost of an average car. Contrary to what the Minister appeared to hint, cars are basic items rather than luxuries.</P>
      <P>VAT is a significant tax which impacts on people&rsquo;s lives. The changes to benefits-in-kind announced in the previous budget have had a negative impact on employees and employers. The bands for stamp duty on houses must be widened in the budget. We are discouraging people from purchasing second-hand houses which contributes to an artificial housing market. We should reduce stamp duty on second-hand houses and raise thresholds, some of which are unrealistic and result in those buying modest houses paying the top rate of stamp duty.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to complaints by the Opposition parties about certain tax reliefs. While I am proud that Fine Gael introduced the urban renewal initiative, it was appropriate in a different era. The party now favours abolishing these tax reliefs in light of the substantial change in the economy since then and their contribution to artificially high prices of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Browne for sharing time. As only a short time is left to me, I will confine my remarks to pensions, particularly the position of members of private occupational pension schemes. Many of those who retired in recent years have found that the pension schemes into which they and their employers paid for many years are underfunded and do not deliver the type of pension to which they aspired or from which they expected to benefit in their old age. The Government is not doing anything, particularly through the Pensions Board, to protect private pensions.</P>
      <P>The only people who can safely expect to retire on a good pension are civil servants. Those engaged in the private sector, particularly PAYE workers, pay into pension schemes throughout their working lives. These schemes are being destroyed by the pensions industry. One needs only to turn on one&rsquo;s television or radio any evening to see or hear large numbers of advertisements encouraging people to take out pensions. We do not hear the Pensions Board, the Minister for Finance or any of the Departments involved <Col N="1067"/>in maintaining pensions indicating that pensions should be protected. What is being done?</P>
      <P>People are paying into pension schemes in the belief that their money is being well spent and protected. This is not the case. Most people, if asked what their pensions will be worth when they retire, would not have a clue. They are placing their money in the hands of the pensions industry which is not protecting it on their behalf. It is time the Government examined the matter.</P>
      <P>The pensions industry has finally answered a number of questions I have been putting to it for many years. I asked, for example, how many pension schemes are underfunded. The industry has admitted the number is sizeable. We hear of many companies which have informed their employees that the company&rsquo;s pension fund is not sufficient to deliver the anticipated level of pension. In many cases, the companies which were supposed to protect their employees&rsquo; investments are asking staff to top up their pensions with exorbitant sums of money. It is now compulsory for many employees to join a pension scheme. While it has always been obligatory for employers to establish a pension scheme, employees should not be obliged to join it.</P>
      <P>It is time the Government took action to look after those who have worked for many years by providing a decent standard of living for them in retirement. Instead, we hear the Insurance Federation of Ireland requesting the Minister for Finance to encourage people to put the moneys in their special savings investment accounts into pension funds when they mature in a couple of years. Why should people do this? Why can the Government not encourage them to save their money by providing an incentive under the SSIA scheme? This would not necessarily require the level of returns people receive under the SSIAs. The Government should examine the scheme to find ways to encourage holders of SSIAs to continue to save. People will do so when they know the money they save is secure. It is time we woke up and looked after the many elderly people who have been robbed of their pensions.</P>

      <?oasys [cl10.5]?>
      <P>I will address some points which arose during the debate. While there are many competitiveness indexes, I cited the Bertelsmann index, a German index for economic development and economic policy. It divides countries into three zones: the danger free zone, which Ireland tops, the warning zone, which contains a number of countries, and an alarm zone, which includes France and Germany. We are still close to the top, at least on some indexes.</P>
      <P>On the adjustment of tax bands, we are only referring to the one third of income earners on higher incomes. That the tax bands have not been adjusted does not affect the tax situation of the two thirds of taxpayers on lower incomes. To address other points, an increase in VAT is not a stealth tax but an overt tax and taxation on work and PRSI is practically the lowest in the EU. Most of the construction incentives are to be abolished by July 2006 which, on the evidence of the Revenue Commissioners to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service today, will deal with the millionaires who are not paying tax at present.</P>
      <P>The policies of 2001 and 2002, whatever motives may be attributed to them, had a counter-cyclical effect which was acknowledged last year by the IMF and the OECD and which means they were beneficial in counteracting tendencies towards depression. Such a slowdown in spending as occurred in 2003 bears no comparison to what had to be done in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>With regard to the UK, I do not agree with Senator McDowell&rsquo;s point that an increase in income tax would not have any effect on our com<Col N="1070"/>petitiveness. We are in competition with the UK and labour is very mobile. Even in the UK of Gordon Brown, the top rate of tax is 40% and there is an introductory rate of tax lower than 20%, which cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>I agree up to a point with Senator Ross when he stresses the importance of US multinational-led investment. Unfortunately, he can never bring himself to acknowledge the role of social partnership in the recovery since 1987. An IMF document states that, while not the only factor, social partnership contributed significantly to the increase in the employment rate since the early 1990s, which averaged 2.1% per annum during the second half of the 1990s. The IMF also favours a further benchmarking exercise as an alternative to past practice, which involved special pay claims and relativity.</P>
      <P>It was not clear from Senator Browne&rsquo;s remarks or the amendment to the motion whether we are being criticised for underspending or overspending.</P>

	<P>Senator McDowell said all that needed to be said about the coherence of the amendment. There is a great degree of consensus, which was evident in the debate, that the economy is the on the right road and needs to be kept there. There is real debate on what should be done with revenue and the fruits of economic growth and what are the priorities. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, for attending the House to deal with this matter which I have tried to raise on the Adjournment over the past several weeks. It calls for the practical introduction of by-laws to allow telephone and electricity poles to be moved when roads are widened or bad bends are removed. It was not a difficulty to have such poles removed 15 or 20 years ago. However, that was at the time of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and when semi-State bodies were not as commercially-orientated as they are now. It now costs approximately &euro;2,000 to move one of these poles. There is need for co-operation between local authorities and the semi-State bodies on this issue. Failing this, by-laws should be introduced. There are examples of successful community involvement schemes where a 50% contribution to costs has been made by communities, whether through land or tractors and trailers removing clay. On many regional roads, unsightly poles remain where the road has been widened or a bad bend removed, posing a danger to road users.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will introduce by-laws or engage with the local authorities and the semi-State bodies to ensure that these high charges to move a pole will not be imposed on communities. This has been highlighted in Galway County Council where all the councillors elected last June have raised this issue. I hope the Minister can find some way to remove these poles without imposing the expense on communities.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Kitt for raising this issue. The Roads Act 1993 is now the overall responsibility of the Minister for Transport. Under section 13 of the Act, road authorities are responsible for the maintenance and construction of non-national roads. Section 70 of the Act obliges the owner of any structure to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the structure, or use of the structure, is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road and that it does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use, or the maintenance, of a public road. Where the <Col N="1072"/>use of a structure presents such a hazard or potential hazard, or where it obstructs or interferes with the safe use, or maintenance, of a public road, a road authority may serve a notice in writing on the owner of the structure to remove, modify or carry out specified works in relation to it within the period stated in the notice.</P>
      <P>A person on whom such a notice has been served may, within 14 days of the date of service, appeal against the notice to the District Court on the grounds that she or he is not the owner of the structure, that the structure is not a hazard or potential hazard, or does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use, or maintenance, of a public road, that compliance with the requirements of the notice would involve unreasonable expense or that the notice specified an unreasonably short time for complying with its requirements or any of them. Notice of the appeal must be given to the road authority who is entitled to appear, be heard and adduce evidence on the hearing of the appeal.</P>
      <P>On the hearing of the appeal, the court may either confirm the notice unconditionally, confirm it subject to such modifications, alterations or additions as it thinks reasonable or annul the notice. Where the court confirms the notice subject to modifications, alterations or additions, the notice has effect subject to such modifications, alterations or additions. A notice served by a local authority does not have effect until the expiration of 14 days from the date of service or if an appeal is taken and the notice is confirmed, with or without modifications, the date on which the decision of the court is given or the date on which the order of the court is expressed to take effect, whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>The owner of a structure who fails to comply with a notice issued by a local authority is guilty of an offence under the Act. In such a case, the road authority may take the action specified in the notice or such other action as it thinks fit and may recover any reasonable costs incurred by it from the owner as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction. Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 also provides that where a road authority considers that a structure presents an immediate and serious hazard to persons using a public road it may take immediate action to reduce or remove the hazard. Where it takes such action, it may recover any reasonable costs incurred by it from the owner as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I hope the Senator will appreciate that I have set out the legislative position in regard to structures which may present a hazard or obstacle to road safety. However, I wish to emphasise that while road safety is an issue of concern for all of us, primary responsibility under law for all road safety matters rests with my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I welcome the Minister for Education and Science to the House. Perseverance pays off because this is the fourth time I have submitted this matter over recent weeks and I am delighted it is being taken tonight. I hope the Minister has a good reply to it.</P>
      <P>Seldom since I became a public representative, either on my local authority or in the Seanad, have I seen such a daunting report on special educational needs, produced with very little resources by the staff and the principal of the Sacred Heart national school, Huntstown, Dublin 15. If this was a consultant&rsquo;s report it would have found its way to a public relations agency which would lobby us to ensure it reached the Minister&rsquo;s ear. The school in question is located in a rapidly growing area. The report is daunting for the background information it sets out on the school&rsquo;s present direction and the type of children attending it.</P>
      <P>The report opens with the following statement:</P>
      <P LI="1">[The school] has a diverse international pupil population that has grown significantly over the past four years. The first international children were enrolled in the school over six years ago. At present almost a quarter (24.2%) of the children attending the school are international children.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That represents 246 children out of a total pupil intake of 930. Some of these children present with significant non-language based difficulties. The report goes on to state:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Board of Management and the Staff of the school are very concerned by reported incidents and allegations (by children to teachers) of physical abuse of some children. . . . Many parents are expressing the view that time spent by teachers dealing with persistent poor behaviour of some international children erodes teaching time and discriminates against national and international children who are co-operative and willing to learn. . . . In 2002 the Department of Education and Science allocated 4 Special Needs Assistants to work with 9 named international children. These posts were <Col N="1074"/>revoked in June 2003 and 2004, at a time when the number of international children within the school continued to increase. . . . No sooner has a teacher begun to come to terms with one international child than another child arrives, sometimes with what appears to be even greater needs.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The report gives a class profile for the whole school, for example, there are 120 junior infants, 46 of whom are international children. One has no English; five have little English; three have not yet started to communicate with their teacher or peers; ten children have expressive language skills but poor comprehension skills; while 20 are described as having challenging behaviour. In first class one child has no English while two have very little and one of those had never attended school prior to last September. In second class three children have little English; in fourth class 12 children have little or no English; in sixth class one child from Kosovo has no English and two others have little English.</P>
      <P>The report concludes:</P>
      <P LI="1">Currently there does not appear to be any provision by the Department of Education and Science to assist the school in supporting the inclusion of these children in their mainstream classes. . . . The resources allocated to the school by the Department of Education and Science are inadequate to deal with these children&rsquo;s complex needs. . . . The frustration felt by the teachers and parents by what they see as a lack of understanding on the part of the Department of Education and Science of what is happening on the ground is likely to increase if adequate resources are not provided.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The school is asking simply that the Department allocate two additional resource teachers to the school and restore the special needs assistants revoked in 2003 and 2004. This school is storing up major social and educational problems. If we do not address this now the problems will persist into secondary school. People will drop out and we will pay a high price for that in other ways.</P>
      <P>The Government must deal with this issue. We have passed a constitutional amendment on immigration and must deal pragmatically with the numbers of people immigrating here and how they access our State services. I suggest that some kind of intensive language course must be given to these children before they attend a mainstream school. This is not fair to the children who are in the school and have attended pre-school, nor to the child who then has to compete with those children in that classroom or the teacher who has to deal with that problem behind the closed door. I beseech the Minister to examine this situation. This is not the only school in the country that has experienced this problem. This report that merits consideration by the Department. I know that every school is looking for special needs assistance. This problem will grow and grow and it must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1075"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank her for her attention on this issue. I agree with Senator Morrissey. We have discussed this issue on a few occasions over the past few weeks. The headmaster and his staff have put together an impressive report. I know Mr. John Lynch and his staff and it is a highly committed school. The work they have done in producing this report is something which would make the Minister proud as a teacher. They are purely motivated by what is best for those children. There is no other way they can do the job without this level of support. This is a problem of a new Ireland, of an Ireland where we will need immigrants in the future. We all understand this. We also know from looking at other countries that the children of these immigrants will drive our economy and pay our pensions in the future. That is from a purely selfish point of view. However, on the basis of our recognition of the importance of allowing a child to develop, that which this school is asking for should be seen in an open and unselfish manner.</P>
      <P>We might wonder whether teachers might be daunted by the task of teaching these pupils with such language difficulties. Nonetheless, they have come back with a solution which shows that they want to do their best to give these children a chance and make them proud of the new Ireland. I appeal to the Minister to respond positively and to give some hope to these children, to the school&rsquo;s board of management and to the pupils. It really is important and I ask the Minister for her best and most positive response. I think it is her first Adjournment issue in the House and maybe it is time to make a grand gesture and do something which would make us proud of a fellow teacher. I thank Senator Morrissey for sharing his time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for raising this issue. It sounds like a very compelling case, given that a school with 930 students has so many students with language difficulties. The Department is aware of the report mentioned and I want to commend those who were involved in its compilation. I know it was motivated by people who want to do the best for their students. This is a challenge that has only faced educators and the Department in the past couple of years. Our approach to how we can meet the educational needs of these children is still developing. There is a scheme in place for non-national pupils with <Col N="1076"/>significant English language deficits and there are various supports available to them. Even though I outlined them, it appears that 225 students sounds like a extraordinary large ratio of students with language difficulties.</P>
      <P>If a school has 14 or more non-English speaking non-nationals, then it is automatically entitled to a full-time temporary language support teacher for a period of two years, or two teachers if the school has 28 students with such difficulties. In the past year, the Department paid for 220 language support teacher posts at primary school level for these children. On top of that, there is a grant system where if a school has between three and eight pupils with such difficulties, the school gets a grant assistance to take measures to help improve the standard of English of the pupils. That amounted to &euro;6,348 as well as &euro;9,523 for schools with between nine and 13 such pupils. This is also for a maximum of two years to allow people to source a person who could provide language tuition. Schools like this one, which have 28 or more such pupils, are entitled to two full-time temporary language support teachers. This school has three such teachers so it is already going over and above the number that would be the norm as the maximum in any one school.</P>
      <P>As the Senators will know, particularly Senator O&rsquo;Toole who may have drawn up half of the schemes for the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I can see it now. It will be my fault the school does not get a teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Once a scheme is drawn up, there is very little scope for exceptional measures within that scheme. Expanding it would have to include everyone on a phased basis. I accept what the Senators are saying; it is a very large number. I will consider the matter and see if there are any imaginative ways in which we can facilitate the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister come back to Senator Morrissey and myself after examining this issue? It would be helpful to know of an entitlement, even if they were not to get it right now, so that it could give them some hope.</P>
