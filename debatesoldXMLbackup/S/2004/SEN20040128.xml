	<P>Before I call the Leader on the Order of Business, I would like to remind Senators that electronic voting will be introduced in the Chamber next week. To that end, I have arranged that a mock vote will take place immediately after the conclusion of Private Members' business this evening. The vote will enable Members to familiarise themselves with the new system. I advise all Senators to attend as it is important that they do so. A letter will be sent to all Members later today to explain the details of the electronic voting system.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill 2003 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, statements on the need for continuing awareness of and actions required to improve services for victims of domestic violence, to be taken at 2 p.m.; and Private Members' business will be No. 15, motion No. 9.</P>
    <P>The debate on No. 1, An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill 2003, will be interrupted at<?_jy?>1 p.m. The contributions of spokespersons will not exceed 15 minutes, the contributions of other Senators will not exceed ten minutes and Members may share time. The House is not compelled to finish Second Stage of the Bill at 1 p.m., as the departmental officials have indicated a willingness to return to the House at a later date for a resumption of the debate. Many Senators are interested in matters relating to food, which are encompassed in this Bill. I would not like Members to think there is a rush or a compulsion to finish the Bill at 1 p.m., as that is not the objective. It is an important Bill and one that should be considered by the House. I am keen to stress that there is no need to aim to conclude Second Stage of the Bill at 1 p.m.</P>
    <P>The debate on No. 2, statements on the need for continuing awareness of and actions required to improve services for victims of domestic <Col N="174"/>violence, will conclude at 5 p.m. The contributions of spokespersons on No. 2 will not exceed 15 minutes, the contributions of other speakers will not exceed ten minutes and Members may share time. The Minister will be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements.</P>
    <P>Private Members' business, No. 15, motion No. 9, will be taken between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcome the fact that the long saga of the proposed development of the stadium at Lansdowne Road was brought to an end yesterday. William Shakespeare once said that procrastination is the thief of time and this saga, which has gone on for about five years, is a classic example of that. In that period of time, the proposed Eircom Park was scuttled and the Government influenced a GAA decision by intervening at a vital time to offer the association £60 million. It is remarkable that it took so long to make this decision, especially as the HighPoint-Rendell report, which was prepared before the last election, scuttled the idea of building a stadium at Abbotstown because of the infrastructural deficit in the area. Now that the decision has been made, one has to welcome it. I hope the proposal is given a fair hearing in the Lansdowne Road area and that it will not be held up by any further impediments such as planning objections.</P>
    <P>The Football Association of Ireland will be pleased that a direction has been set for the future of soccer in this country, especially because it needs to satisfy the requirements of the international ruling body. I welcome the fact that the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road will provide not only for soccer and rugby, but also for Gaelic games. This matter has gone on for a long time and I am glad that it has come to finality. One is lucky to have a partner when one is in Government. The Progressive Democrats have been in favour of the development of Lansdowne Road for a long time. It seems at this stage that it has been effective in this area as a rudder of the main Government party.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the House that a prisoner was killed in Mountjoy Prison yesterday. I do not usually raise the issue of prison deaths, but it behoves all of us to keep a close eye on the prison service in the context of the current discussion on its future. The prisoner in question was being kept in the B wing of Mountjoy, which has traditionally been for a different type of prisoner, namely those who are serving sentences of much longer than nine months. I am aware that many changes have taken place in Mountjoy to create space for prisoners from other institutions that have been closed down. I would like the Leader to request that the Minister come to the House and explain why a prisoner with a nine month sentence was in B wing, where he would not traditionally have been placed. I seek <Col N="175"/>reassurance that his being in that part of the prison had nothing whatever to do with the various rows that are going on, the transfer of prisoners and the closing of institutions. We have discussed this many times before. What is going on? Why was a man with a nine month sentence not safe in prison?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to No. 2 on the Order Paper and express the thanks of the Labour Party group to the Leader for arranging this debate. Senator O'Meara, in particular, has been seeking such a debate for some time. It is timely and appropriate that we acknowledge the Leader's endeavours in this regard.</P>
    <P>I concur with the remarks of the leader of the Fine Gael group. Yesterday's developments in the matter of the national stadium were welcome. The redevelopment of Lansdowne Road was always the common-sense approach. The whole saga went on for some time. The petty squabbling and different points of view associated with the project have been a lesson to us. If a decision such as this is to be made, it is not right that it is dragged on for such a length of time, allowing petty squabbling to prevail. The FAI and the IRFU deserve to be congratulated on the manner in which they conducted themselves throughout. Yesterday was an important day not only for them but for sports fans and the entire country. I wonder what would have happened to the &euro;38 million in funding that was withheld from the GAA in 2001. It was obviously a carrot-and-stick approach at a time when the whole idea was still up in the air. It would be interesting to know the Government's intentions for that sum of money.</P>
    <P>Yesterday my colleague, Senator Tuffy, raised the issue of parasuicide. In 2002 alone, 8,500 people were admitted to accident and emergency units suffering from injuries sustained while attempting to take their own lives. This is a frightening statistic. The issue deserves closer analysis and debate. I ask the Leader to use her offices to organise a debate on this serious issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming yesterday's announcement about the proposed stadium at Lansdowne Road. Perhaps the Leader could organise for the Minister to come to the House at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss the proposals so that we may compliment him on achieving a compromise among many different groups. More important, we must look to the future and consider the development of Abbotstown as a sports campus, as originally envisaged, although the current proposal for the stadium deals with this in the short term. As sport is so much a part of our culture and life, it is important that we recognise that ultimately another stadium will be needed. I would like to hear the Minister's views on this. Perhaps this House can help to inform the Minister in the matter of the ongoing development of Abbotstown.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="176"/>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator never gives up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>For the third day in a row I wish to raise the issue of the national stadium on the Order of Business. I find the previous contribution somewhat remarkable. Everybody has agreed for the past five years that a national stadium was needed. The Government appeared to make a decision yesterday, but it has made decisions twice or three times in the past which have not been carried out. I hope it sticks to its guns on this occasion. Fine Gael has always adopted a policy that the upgrading of Lansdowne Road was the best option. I ask, in conjunction with Senator Dooley, that the Minister is invited to the House next week so that we may ask him the whereabouts of the estimated &euro;200 million that has already been spent in Abbotstown. We have an aquatic centre, which is a state-of-the-art facility and is estimated to have cost more than &euro;60 million, but a vast amount of money, spent on reports by different consultants and bodies has disappeared. If that money had been put into Lansdowne Road or other sporting facilities around the country we would be in a better position than we are. The Government cannot pat itself on the back for having wasted five years, because that is effectively what has happened.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EddieBohan"><NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government what he intends to do about the farce in Carrickmines, where a pile of stones has held up construction of the M50 and has inconvenienced tens of thousands of people for the past number of years. A gentleman living hundreds of miles away in Kerry has been able to hold up work for years through the Supreme Court. The structure in question was built many years ago by an occupying force to keep the people of Ireland out of Dublin. I do not see why the taxpayers of this country should be further inconvenienced by something that has already cost tens of millions of euro. I ask the Minister to consider introducing legislation that can bypass objections such as this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will bypass the bypass.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O'Toole in his call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and explain his new policy on the mix of prisoners in our prisons. The governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan, apologised yesterday to the family of the man who was murdered in the prison. However, we should all be apologising. When people are put in prison they are supposed to be in a safe place. The mother of the murdered prisoner said that she thought at least he was safe in prison. There are some violent, dangerous men in our prisons and petty criminals should not be in the same area as these people. I am sure the <Col N="177"/>prison governor is not pleased to have this sort of mix.</P>
    <P>While the Leader is talking to the Minister, perhaps she would ask him whether the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 could be brought back to the House for Committee Stage. The anniversary of Second Stage of the Bill in this House will fall on 19 February. Prison authorities, psychiatrists and people in the Judiciary are asking what has happened to this important Bill. I tabled more than 100 amendments to it, but if we put our heads down we could get something done. It is not a party political matter. We should try to straighten out the Bill so that we have some proper, modern legislation to deal with people who are psychiatrically ill and become involved in criminal activities.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children whether he has prepared legislation dealing with the EU clinical trials directive? Legislation in this area is supposed to be introduced in all member states before the beginning of May. Irish research workers will be seriously disadvantaged if there is no proper legislation in place. In view of our current EU Presidency, surely we should be trying to keep up with directives, especially with all the money we are putting into Science Foundation Ireland and other areas. This matter requires urgent consideration by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming the Government's decision on the national stadium yesterday. I emphasise that this was a Government decision and the right decision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not have to justify it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>He should not be gloating.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>People have referred to the waste of time over the past number of years, but I remind them that during that time we have seen the development of Croke Park and major investment in the infrastructure of sport throughout local communities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was major investment in Abbotstown, but that has gone down the Swanee.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;through grants from this Government. The right decision was made yesterday. Rather than trying to find flaws in the decision we should move forward and welcome it, as will the public and the various sporting bodies.</P>

	<P>It should have happened five years ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise the issue of juveniles who get into serious trouble. Yesterday a number of people mentioned the dreadful rape case in County Clare, in which a number of young boys were involved. These boys already had a history of criminal activities. Where are the support mechanisms for these young people? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform needs to outline to the House his policy on juvenile crime. There is a new unit in St. Patrick's Institution which cost up to &euro;12.5 million, but it remains unoccupied. This is a disgrace at a time when young boys are perpetrating serious crimes against our citizens. However, they are being released to make way for other young people. The system is in chaos and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a duty to outline to the House how he will address this serious problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the satisfactory resolution of the sports stadium issue. Like many important decisions that cost a great deal of money, one needs to examine the different options to get the right mix. Sometimes those projects proceed, like the Luas, by trial and error. We should not make any apology&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Trial and error.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>He means error more than trial.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for that. We have the most sports-friendly Government ever. The amount of money being spent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>What kind of sports?</P>

	<P>It is appreciated by those in Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Senator Bohan's contribution on Carrickmines Castle, I find it significant that there is no reference to it in Peter Harbison's <i>Guide to the National Monuments in the Republic of Ireland</i>. There is not even a reference to it in John O'Donovan's collection <i>Ordnance Survey Letters</i> of the 19th century. There are hundreds of castles and abbeys in this country that would greatly benefit from the money that has been lost in the delay at Carrickmines Castle. We should put our money where it makes a difference.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Fianna F&aacute;il now the party of conservation?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="179"/>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse Senators O'Toole and Henry's comments on the issue of the prisoner killed in Mountjoy Prison. It is a matter that should be of enormous concern to us. However, I suspect it is not really a priority on the Government's list. It is a serious problem which we are failing to acknowledge. Senator Henry quite rightly said that the prison governor, Mr. Lonergan, apologised and he did so with great dignity.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with prison visiting committees which was raised by Fine Gael Senators in a motion recently. As long as these committees include people who are politically appointed and have no interest in prisoners, the prisons will not be supervised properly. All Members know that this is a political abuse where people in different parts of the country are put on prison visiting committees simply to get travel allowances. The result is that people who are not qualified are supervising the administration of prisoners. Their only interest is collecting the expenses involved and the result is that prisoners and prison staff suffer. If there is any lesson from yesterday's incident, it is that the prison visiting committees issue should be tackled honestly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>As someone who has taken a slight interest in the stadium proposal that was announced yesterday, I congratulate the Government on the decision that has been taken at long last. More importantly, congratulations should go to the FAI and the IRFU on their far-reaching agreement on the management of the stadium. These two large sporting organisations, seen as competitors, are now united in managing that function. I hope they have given the green light to every sporting organisation to ensure that facilities are shared and managed between them. In Dublin, new sports clubs are being set up, but facilities are not available due to the cost of land. We are not short of stadia, but there should be greater use of them by our sporting organisations coming together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?_ah?><Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>As the preparations for the State examinations come around again, students, parents and teachers are concerned that the Department of Education and Science does not have sufficient examiners to conduct the oral Irish examinations. The shortfall in numbers has never been as great as this year. This is a consequence of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey's, continuous confrontational attitude towards the teaching profession since he took <?_ch?>office. It behoves the Minister to issue some <?_ch?>supportive comments regarding the teaching profession so that proper oral examinations can be put in place in time. It is a serious situation because uncertainty is creeping in again directly as a result of the Minister's actions.</P>
   <?_xh?></Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with previous speakers' concerns regarding the spate of crime committed by young people, some as young as 12 years of <Col N="180"/>age. I recently watched a television programme that contained interviews with parents of some of these young people. The parents had no clue where their children were on the day. Children are running wild when they should be in school until 16 years of age. If these parents were not paid child benefit if their children were not at school, it would place some onus on them to ensure their children went to school. If they are at school until 16 years of age, they will be wise enough not to get into the trouble they are getting into now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last session, there was a good debate on the report compiled by Senator O'Meara on the BCI and the issuing of radio broadcasting licences. However, counties Carlow and Kilkenny face the prospect of having no local radio station from now until May or June. It is outrageous that there will be no local radio station for people to vent views that are important in the run-up to the local elections. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come to the House to discuss radio broadcast licensing and to examine how the BCI can perform better in ensuring the smooth transition of broadcasting licences. It is important that such a fiasco as experienced in counties Carlow and Kilkenny never happens again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that Senator Ross chose to introduce the issue of travel allowances for prison visiting committees when addressing the terrible tragedy that occurred in Mountjoy Prison yesterday. There is a deep problem in social engineering that has now surfaced in the prisons. There are also problems in prison management that need to be addressed. I regret that Senator Ross sought to drag in the issue of travel allowances. I regard it is a red herring in terms of what happened yesterday. There are much more fundamental questions involved.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Ulick Burke that the Minister for Education and Science is deeply committed to the welfare of teachers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>He is also deeply committed to the provision of services and back-up facilities. I invite Members to read the programme he launched for Ireland's term of the EU Presidency with its emphasis on teachers' professionalism and welfare.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senator Fitzgerald of a statement from his party leader that we will not get anywhere if we sit here throwing red herrings and white elephants at each other.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <?_ah?><Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat my request that we should continue to monitor the situation in Iraq, particularly after the news programmes which make it look very much as if the British Government is again putting a spin on this matter, leaking information in the Hutton report to the <i>Sun</i>, underlining once again Tony Blair's indecent relationship with the Rupert Murdoch empire. It would be useful if we continued to monitor the situation in Iraq in light of whatever emerges at 12.30 p.m. from the <?_ch?>Hutton inquiry.</P>
   <?_xh?></Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House to outline whether his Department is one of cutbacks, given that recently members of the various health boards called to hospitals and told loyal and committed staff that their jobs may be lost due to bringing in people from various external departments. Is this a negotiation tactic or a proposal from Government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane, the acting Leader of the Opposition, spoke about the procrastination in his view regarding the announcement of the national stadium, but he wished it fair wind for which I thank him. Senator Minihan answered the accusation Senator Finucane laid at the door of the PDs, but I am sure there will be more about that anon.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o'clock</TimeSt><P>Senator O'Toole raised the matter of the recent prison death and why the prisoner in question was on B wing. There is a general consensus that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come into the House to address this matter. We have requested his presence and I hope he can come to the House shortly.</P>
    <?oasys _ic20-?><P>I thank Senator McCarthy for his kind words about arranging a debate. We should congratulate him on being our style guru and on being far better than the D&aacute;il gurus in that regard. He raised the matter of the national stadium in regard to which the IRFU and the FAI wholeheartedly supported the decision yesterday. The Senator called for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to come into the House to explain the position regarding the finance that was allocated. We have asked<?oasys _jy?> the Minister to come here and we hope he<?oasys _jy?>will be able to do so next week now that the decision has been announced and his report released.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
    <P>The Senator's party colleague, Senator Tuffy, requested a debate on the incidence of self-injury which leads in many cases to suicide.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley raised a fair point regarding yesterday's report, namely, that ongoing development will take place at Abbotstown, <Col N="182"/>which will lead to greater development there in time. As more sports are played and more professionalism enters sport, there is a need for development at Abbotstown and such development was announced by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, yesterday. That point is worth noting.</P>
    <P>Senator John Paul Phelan raised the matter of the national stadium and the money involved. He said we wasted five years discussing it, but I do not agree.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We did.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Eircom Park could have been built.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to Senator Mansergh's point that we need to consider these matters in great detail. Fine Gael has kept to its brief in this regard. Deputy Deenihan has spoken about this matter for some years and put forward his viewpoint and I give the party credit for that.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan raised the matter of the farce at Carrickmines and called on the Minister to introduce legislation in this area. I understand a type of fast-track legislation has been mooted designed to get around these infrastructural, farcical delays. Everyone wants people to have their say in a proper way, but the latest developments at Carrickmines, about which I read this morning, make fools of us all.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the governor of Mountjoy Prison, John Lonergan, and the mother of the man who was murdered. The mother's statement that she thought her son was safe in prison was poignant. One would think prison was a safe place. That death lies at our door, so to speak, because people are sent to prison in our name to ensure there is justice and reform.</P>
    <P>I almost give up on the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill. While we had a full debate on the Bill on 19 and 20 February last, I am not sure whether the will has gone out of the Department or the civil servants and political heads dealing with it because every time I ask about it I hear there are 400 or 500 amendments to it. It would be as well to prepare a new Bill given the extent of the changes proposed. Nevertheless, I will keep a check on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also asked about the EU clinical trials Bill. I am due to meet the Minister later today on another matter and I will ask him about that Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan said the decision on the national stadium was a Government one &mdash; good for him &mdash; and sport is the winner. That was spoken like a good PD and I say that in admiration.</P>
    <P>On a serious note, Senator Terry asked that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outline his policy on juvenile crime, given that a unit that cost a great deal of money lies idle. That is the position because care staff to man the unit cannot be found. A focused debate on juvenile <Col N="183"/>crime in light of recent events and plans would be useful, and I will request that.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh raised the point that the money wasted at Carrickmines could have been usefully put towards preserving hundreds of castles and monuments around the country. That is a matter on which we should concentrate. He also mentioned that while it may seem that a long time is spent on projects, such time is well spent if one is considering a major project such as the national stadium.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross raised the matter of prison visiting committees. It is not right to lay the blame for a prison death at the door of a visiting committee. That is a far-fetched connection and does an injustice to the members of a visiting committee. Such members may be politically appointed, but I decry the notion that anyone who is politically appointed is somehow not able to do anything or not capable of any sense of care or justice. It is an odd connection to make and one I do not believe.</P>
    <P>Senator Morrissey wryly said that he had more than a passing interest in the stadium and he inquired about legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke was a teacher, as was I, and he has the good of teachers at heart when he speaks. There is an amazing article in one of this morning's newspapers on the number of schools that closed early for Christmas. I understand it was some 179. I refer to that because the Senator raised the matter of how he thought the Minister was mealy-mouthed about the schools. A fair number of schools closed early. I hope examiners for the oral Irish examinations come forward. Oral Irish is a feature of second level education. There are some three or four weeks remaining and I hope examiners will come forward to fill those positions.</P>
    <P>Senator Scanlon requested that child benefit payments should be stopped in respect of youths who do not attend school. I would not agree with that proposal. Such payments are intended for the upkeep of the children concerned. That is my view but it may not be shared by others. The point was made some years ago that it would not be correct in a social setting to refuse child benefit payments. However, there must be more parental control.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne raised the matter that people of his area will be without the service provided by the Carlow-Kilkenny radio station for some months. That would be a good motion to raise on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Fitzgerald's sense of great regret at the remarks made about prison visiting committees. Senator Norris raised the matter of the situation in Iraq and the leaking of the Hutton report.</P>
    <P>I did not quite get the point Senator Feighan raised concerning health board staff being told that their jobs are at stake. I imagine the staff are a bit edgy in light of the forthcoming changes. Perhaps that is giving rise to some tremors.</P><Col N="184"/>

   <Title>An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill 2003: Second Stage.</Title>
<P el="5">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have great pleasure in introducing this Bill to amend the An Bord Bia Acts 1994 to 1996. The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the amalgamation of An Bord Glas with Bord Bia. It is almost a decade since I introduced the Bill to set up Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board, and at that time greater focus was needed as regards promotion and market development of food and food products. We have undergone many changes in the past decade. Ireland has moved into a world league and expectations of success are higher, competition is tougher and capital and markets are more global and mobile. We must pool our resources effectively to promote Ireland as the food island of the world and exploit our strong environmental image for the benefit of our amenity sector at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>The agri-food industry continues to play a pivotal role in our economy. We have a food industry which has undergone considerable modernisation and reorientation to meet the demands of consumers at home and abroad. Ireland is now the fourth largest food exporting nation in the EU and our reputation as the food island is well deserved given the range and diversity of foodstuffs produced here. The agri-food and drink sector accounts for more than 8% of Ireland's GDP, 7.1% of Irish exports and almost 10% of total employment. When one takes the net value of exports or earnings, because of the low import content, the sector accounts for almost 25% of our net export earnings. Our markets are balanced between the United Kingdom, once our only significant market, the euro zone and third country markets beyond the EU. That breaks down as 40% for the UK, 30% for the rest of the EU and 30% for markets outside the EU. I am confident that the outlook for the entire food industry is positive as well as challenging.</P>
    <P>The horticulture industry is an important indigenous industry which contributes <Col N="185"/>significantly to employment, exports and output. The farm gate value of the industry was valued at &euro;400 million in 2003. In terms of gross agricultural output, horticulture is third after beef and milk. This diverse and well-developed sector comprises two main areas, the production of amenity products, such as trees, shrubs and flowers, and the edible or food sector, which produces a range of edible fruit and vegetable products. The industry has a good geographical spread with over 18,500 people employed across the food and non-food areas countrywide.</P>
    <P>Overall, the horticultural market was valued at &euro;2.3 billion in 2002, with the edible food sector accounting for almost &euro;2 billion and the amenity sector valued at &euro;431 million. Industry performance in 2003 was strong, with exports of edible horticulture, primarily mushrooms, valued at &euro;180 million. My Department recognises the importance of the horticulture industry and has supported its development by providing grant-in-aid funding for capital projects and through the provision of plant health services. On the amenity side, grant-in-aid funding has been made available under the scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector. State agencies have also provided a range of support services through market research, quality programmes, research and development and the provision of expert advice. These initiatives have led to improvements in the quality and presentation of Irish produce over the past decade.</P>
    <P>The horticulture industry operates in a dynamic environment characterised by rapid evolution in both demand and supply. Changing consumer trends provide challenges and opportunities. Supply chains are at the same time being reorganised and restructured to shorten the route from field to shelf. The top three supermarket groups in Ireland have half the Irish retail market and the situation is similar throughout Europe. As markets become more open, demanding and competitive, continued and innovative investment at producer and pre-packer level is required to upgrade production, packing and storage facilities to ensure product is sold in prime condition. The accession of ten new member states, all of which have considerable horticulture production, will present further challenges and opportunities. There will also be an additional 100 million consumers, bringing the total home and domestic market of 500 million consumers in the new EU.</P>
    <P>This challenging environment blurs distinctions between local and global and highlights the need to focus on efficiencies, competitiveness and market orientation. My aim is to assist the industry in addressing these challenges. Against this background, I recognise the need to adopt a more cohesive approach to the delivery of services by State agencies in the horticulture sector rather than having separate bodies responsible for promoting home and export markets.</P><Col N="186"/>
    <P>It is worth recalling the rationale behind the establishment of Bord Bia in 1994. It was established following the recommendation of the expert group on the food industry for a single food promotion agency. That group took account of an earlier finding and recommendation by the Culliton group that existing arrangements for food promotion and market development were fragmented and that there should be greater integration and co-ordination in the marketing of Irish food abroad. Food and amenity horticulture are readily identifiable with their place of origin, a factor which enables a country or region with a good environmental image to exploit such a reputation.</P>
    <P>The report of the independent estimates review committee to the Minister for Finance in 2002 also considered there was a need for closer co-operation between the agencies responsible for promotion and marketing of Irish exports. The advantage of a single food promotion agency was reinforced by the expenditure review of Bord Bia carried out in 1998, which recommended the retention of Bord Bia as a separate entity in view of the unique nature and economic importance of the food industry. A review of An Bord Glas carried out at the same time considered that a proposal to amalgamate An Bord Glas with Bord Bia should be reviewed within five years. Those five years have now elapsed and given the economic importance of the food and horticulture industries to the economy and having regard to increased trade liberalisation and the prevailing situation relating to public expenditure in general, the time has come to amalgamate An Bord Glas with Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>The combined expertise of the amalgamated body will bring together the synergies necessary to promote and market the entire food and horticultural industries at home and abroad. In addition, the horticultural industry will have access to the broader profile of Bord Bia's existing international network, with the possibility of establishing a complementary international branding for the amenity sector. In other words, Bord Bia already has existing offices in most EU countries, which will be of considerable assistance to An Bord Glas and future exports of horticultural products.</P>
    <P>The Bill consists of three parts. Part 1 deals with preliminary and general matters, Part 2 deals with the dissolution of An Bord Glas and Part 3 deals with the amendment of the principal Acts, the An Bord Bia Acts 1994 to 1996. Parts 1 and 2 contain the usual provisions regarding legal interpretation, transfer of staff, property, liabilities and preparation of final accounts. Part 2 also provides that An Bord Glas will be dissolved as and from a transfer day, to be made by order, from which day the staff and functions will be transferred to Bord Bia. The main features of Part 3 include the transfer of the current functions of An Bord Glas in their entirety to Bord Bia. This in essence means that the current function in relation to assisting <Col N="187"/>production of horticulture remains. A comprehensive definition of &ldquo;horticulture&rdquo; to include amenity horticulture is provided. Bord Bia already has the marketing function for edible horticulture on overseas markets.</P>
    <P>I propose that not less than two persons with knowledge or experience of horticulture will be appointed as ordinary members of the new board. No increase in numbers is proposed. I also propose to update the nominating function of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to suppress for the time being the nominating function of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as seafood marketing has not to date transferred to Bord Bia. However, the facility to effect such a transfer under section 9(2) of the Act remains in place.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Bill my Department consulted with the chief executives of the two organisations and with the board of An Bord Glas. In addition, a total of 34 organisations representative of the horticulture sector were asked to submit their views.</P>
    <P>The main areas of concern that were expressed related to representation on the new board, the establishment of a dedicated horticulture subsidiary board and the inclusion of the amenity sector. All these points have been covered in the Bill. Having regard to the outcome of the consultation process, I provided in the Bill for a horticulture sub-board, comprising 12 ordinary members and a chair who will be a member of the main board. The horticulture sub-board will have a legal identity under the Act in the same way as the meat and livestock sub-board has at present.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for powers by way of regulation to modernise the system of levy payment on live exports from the current pre-paid stamps system, which has become outdated. Any regulation proposed under this provision would be laid before the Houses in the normal way under the existing provisions. Provision is also made for the establishment of subsidiary companies by Bord Bia for the purposes of complying with legal requirements for internationally recognised quality assurance schemes.</P>
    <P>The legislation is relatively simple. The interests of concerned stakeholders, staff and the horticulture sector, including amenity horticulture, are adequately safeguarded and strengthened in the proposed new organisation. Aside from the positive aspects of transferring to a somewhat larger organisation, the transferring staff will not lose out on conditions of service, including superannuation, as this is safeguarded in the Act. The Bill will ensure that promotion actions at home and abroad are synchronised to achieve the best possible service for the producer and taxpayer alike. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="188"/>
   <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am pleased to have an opportunity to debate the Bill, although I do not support its broad tenet, the amalgamation of An Bord Glas with Bord Bia. An Bord Glas is involved in a distinctive niche area of food development and I am concerned that this important work will lose its effectiveness if it is subsumed within the broader remit of the larger Bord Bia. The Government has approved the amalgamation of Bord Bia and An Bord Glas. It is intended that An Bord Glas will be dissolved and its functions will be transferred to Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>It is fitting to begin this debate on the legislation by setting out the ever-increasing importance of the horticulture sector to the economy. The Minister stated that in 2002 the value of the horticultural market to the economy was &euro;2.3 billion, of which the fresh produce market accounted for &euro;1.9 billion. This is recognised as a dynamic and growing market and its success is to be commended.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment almost ten years ago, the work of An Bord Glas in developing and promoting the horticulture industry has been successful. It has played an important role in predicting future trends facing the horticulture sector in an era of rapid industrial and consumer changes. This is a critical aspect of the work of An Bord Glas. In its recent annual report, An Bord Glas pinpointed the tremendous changes which face horticulture in the coming decade. Such trends include the tendency of Irish people to eat out more and also to order more take-away food. Increasing competition faces traditional elements of the staple Irish diet, particularly potatoes and vegetables as non-traditional foodstuffs such as rice and pasta become more popular. The demand for pre-prepared organic produce has increased due to growing concerns and awareness among people of food-related health issues and food safety. The avian flu epidemic in Thailand is a current cause of concern.</P>
    <P>These changes present a monumental challenge to the horticulture sector. Producers and wholesalers alike need advice and assistance to meet these challenges. To date, the sector has risen to the challenge of new market demands. In 2002 growth in the sales of prepared, chilled horticulture produce increased by 20%. An Bord Glas has done Trojan work to assist and develop this new growth sector. An Bord Glas has done an excellent job in providing the necessary back-up and support services to the horticulture sector and I am concerned that this support system continues and develops in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The founding principle of An Bord Glas was to maximise the contribution of horticulture to the economy, the environment and to the health and well-being of our citizens by ensuring quality produce and services from the horticulture sector. The work of An Bord Glas includes developing, promoting, encouraging, co-ordinating and assisting the production, marketing and <Col N="189"/>consumption of domestic fruit and vegetables. An Bord Glas has already played an important role in gathering and distributing crucial market information for the benefit of horticulture producers. This has taken the form of a variety of duties, from carrying out surveys, doing market research and undertaking publicity and promotional campaigns to advance the horticulture sector.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas has closely co-ordinated its work programme to co-operate with other State organisations, in particular with Teagasc. This has resulted in the establishment and enforcement of highly successful, grading and quality standards for horticultural produce and the formulation and enactment of policy to inform and direct State investment in horticulture. A further key aspect of the work carried out by An Bord Glas has been in the area of the educational curriculum and programmes of higher education. In 2002 significant links were established with many third level institutions, particularly UCD.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that no significant financial implications arise from the Bill. However, in order to understand the rationale for this amalgamation, will he indicate what financial savings will result from the amalgamation? The amalgamation is part of a wider trend of cutbacks and reductions in funding for State bodies which provide crucial support services to the agriculture and horticulture sectors. In this context I refer, in particular, to the State advisory body, Teagasc. In budget 2003, funding for Teagasc was cut by &euro;15 million; in budget 2004, its funding was again cut by &euro;5 million and several advisory offices throughout the State face closure. All aspects of the agriculture sector face tremendous changes. Well-founded fears exist among the farming community that their livelihoods are in danger and that many will have to get out of farming and horticulture. The Government is responding to the concerns of farmers by making cuts and reducing services.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas is in danger of losing its distinctive role and focus once it is merged with the wider entity of Bord Bia. An Bord Glas can currently stand alone, gain greater attention for its niche area of concern and push for necessary funding, which it views as essential to support, develop and promote the horticulture sector in Ireland. This Bill does not give the necessary guarantees that An Bord Glas will not lose its relevance and the impact it makes on behalf of the horticulture sector once it is amalgamated into Bord Bia. It is a pity to see An Bord Glas being subsumed and merged into the superbody.</P>
    <P>I note the Bill contains guarantees for the staff currently employed by An Bord Glas, which is to be welcomed. The Bill contains a proposal to appoint a subsidiary board and I hope it will contain a balanced membership who shall represent the industry in its entirety, and that they are knowledgeable of the industry and not merely political fodder.</P><Col N="190"/>
    <P>A strong identity for Irish horticulture is required to percolate into the marketplace and the continuation of the excellent endeavours of An Bord Glas in terms of quality and standard enhancement is of vital importance. The section that refers to the constitution of the board calls for &ldquo;persons having knowledge or experience of (a) the food industry or horticulture; (b) consumer requirements&rdquo;. I am worried about the term &ldquo;food industry&rdquo;  in case members would be drawn from non-horticulture disciplines and not give the horticulture industry its rightful voice. Could a member of a food giant, with no knowledge or sensitivity to the industry, be appointed to the board?</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the dismantling of An Bord Glas and integrating it into Bord Bia; it is a retrograde step and the loss of a dedicated body for a growing industry must be both condemned and regretted. The track record of An Bord Glas and its staff has been excellent and their dedication and professionalism must be commended. If and when the amalgamation proceeds, I hope a strong and clearly identified voice shall exist on the board to speak strongly for the future of the horticulture industry and that it is not subsumed into non-horticulture duties within a larger and more diverse board.</P>
    <P>I am far from convinced of the necessity of this amalgamation. If the funding and staffing levels are to remain the same, I do not see the logic for this decision. I am convinced of the good work An Bord Glas has carried out on behalf of the horticulture sector, a view shared by those I have spoken to in the horticulture sector. To continue these good efforts, An Bord Glas must continue to operate as a stand-alone entity. I do not support this amalgamation. Why fix it if it is not broken?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Walsh, to the House. I wish him well in chairing the Agriculture Council of the EU, and various subsidiary bodies, in the coming months. The Minister has an important national and international role to fulfil and it is appropriate that Members wish him well in this.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation is not a criticism of the operations or staff of An Bord Glas. It compliments them as it gives them an expanded role through Bord Bia, a body that has a substantial budget and access throughout Europe. We should welcome the amalgamation of An Bord Glas and Bord Bia. The food and drinks industry has been the cornerstone of the economy for many years. The industry has successfully developed and reorganised itself with the guidance and support of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, for many years. The great success stories of Irish manufacturing and exports are to be found in the food and drinks sector. Its success abroad is testament to its capacity to produce the right product at the right time and to successfully read consumers' needs. Of course, it is also testament to the high quality raw material that <Col N="191"/>farmers have provided to the food industry over the years. Employing 47,000 people and with an output worth &euro;15 billion, of which almost &euro;7 billion is exported, the importance of this industry to our economic well-being is clear. Of course, the industry must continue to rationalise and reorganise to meet ever-increasing competition.</P>
    <P>The difficulty we face is that not enough of the industry, particularly its food element, has emulated the leaders. We need more market penetration, especially within the EU. The dairy industry has been disappointingly slow to re-orient itself in the direction of the marketplace and away from intervention. It is clear that the days of market intervention at EU level are numbered. Only for the negotiating success of the Minister in the mid-term review, intervention would already be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Minister to amalgamate Bord Bia with An Bord Glas is a natural and logical step in the direction of having a single body responsible for the promotion and development of the entire food industry. I urge the Government to take the final step of amalgamating Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the new Bord Bia at an early date. Bord Bia has contacts throughout Europe and has built up a sophisticated marketing system which any Irish product would benefit from being associated with.</P>
    <P>By establishing the new Bord Bia, the Minister is giving the horticulture and food industry a lead and provides the new body with the opportunity to promote and develop these industries in a united organisation that has clear goals. The timing of the unification could not be better as we prepare at farm level to transfer to the single EU support payment for farmers.</P>
    <?_ah?><P>The outcome of the negotiations on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy has enabled the Minister to introduce the simplified single payment system that will reshape the CAP fundamentally. We cannot overstate the <?_ch?>Minister's success at the negotiations. His <?_ch?>decision to immediately adopt the single payment shows how well he has organised his Department, and contrasts with the difficulties most of his EU counterparts are facing with phased transfers. The decoupling of direct payments from production is a fundamental change to the CAP that will have major beneficial effects on farmers. Irish farmers will now be free to produce product for the market. They will get their single EU income support payment irrespective of the farm enterprise they pursue. I have no doubt that the <?_ch?>Minister has chosen the model best suited to Irish requirements from the perspective of maximising efficiency, competitiveness and protecting the <?_ch?>rural economy. Neither do I doubt that the new arrangements he will put in place from 2005 <?_ch?>onwards will minimise the bureaucracy that has <?_ch?>plagued farmers in recent years.</P><Col N="192"/> <?_xh?>
    <P>The change the Minister is proposing is a desirable and welcome complementary measure to his CAP reform arrangement for a single payment, enabling farmers to improve quality production. Everyone's priority must be to manage the transition from the old to the new regime so as to ensure a smooth transfer and enable Irish farmers and our high quality food industry to exploit the new opportunities to the full in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas has made a considerable and fruitful contribution to the development and promotion of the horticultural sector since its creation in 1990. It is a small but effective operation, consisting of 11 board members and 12 staff members. An Bord Glas has been instrumental in the promotion and development of horticulture in Ireland. For example, its quality assurance schemes have improved production standards and consumer confidence in our produce. It has played a major role in the development of the amenity sector where promising export potential exists. According to the Irish Exporters' Association, the value of Ireland's edible horticultural output for 2002 was &euro;223 million and rose to &euro;400 million last year. The independent estimates review committee recommended the merger of Bord Bia and An Bord Glas as some of their efforts are being duplicated. Bord Bia has responsibility for exports, including horticultural products, whereas An Bord Glas has responsibility for the development of the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>The avian flu was mentioned in the Seanad yesterday and it may be raised again today. I will ask the Minister to clear it up because there is some confusion about it.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU organic farming sector has been developing during the past 20 years but in particular during the 1990s. In the 15 states of the EU, farmers in 150,000 holdings are farming organically. The figures for 2000 show that 3.8 million hectares are in organic production, which represents approximately 3% of the total utilised agricultural land. Austria and Italy lead with 8% of agricultural land in organic production. In Ireland fewer than 1,000 are farming approximately 20,00 hectares organically, that is 0.5% of usable agricultural land. A key issue to be addressed in the new action plan being prepared by the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, as chairman of the EU Agriculture Ministers, is how organic farming can co-exist with genetically engineered crops. I know the Minister agrees with thresholds and the adventitious presence of GMOs in organic products needs careful consideration. Ireland is ideally suited to organic farming and the time is right to be proactive in developing it. The western commission identified it as an alternative resource and since we are now in the post-Fischler era, creating the maximum <Col N="193"/>benefit for farmers from the utilisation of land, we should examine organic farming.</P>
    <P>I wish An Bord Glas, the staff, the Minister and the Department the best of luck.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, and I join with Senator Callanan in wishing him the best as he chairs the European Council of Ministers for the next six months. The end of that term will tally with a Cabinet reshuffle and I wish him the best of luck with that.</P>
    <P>The food sector has grown greatly in recent years. Generally, people are more aware of healthy eating as part of a healthy lifestyle and this has driven the growth in the economy. The agri-food industry has become such a major sector that there is a case to be made for a separate Department with responsibility solely for food. That is a debate for another day, but it highlights the growth in the food sector.</P>
    <P>The role of Bord Bia is to promote Irish food and drinks and to develop world-wide export markets for our produce. Bord Bia has extensive knowledge and expertise in the area of exports, production controls, health regulations and new developments in the industry generally. The Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, initiated legislation to bring together CBF, the Irish Meat and Livestock Board and the food promotion activities of the Irish Trade Board, which is now part of Enterprise Ireland and also the export promotion of edible horticulture from An Bord Glas which resulted in the Bord Bia Act 1994.</P>
    <P>The other part of the equation, An Bord Glas, the horticultural development board, has responsibility for the development of the horticultural industry. It is divided into two main sectors, amenity horticulture which covers trees, shrubs, flowers and bulbs and the fruit and vegetable sector, including mushrooms, potatoes and glasshouse crops. An Bord Glas promotes the increased consumption of quality horticultural produce, which in turn leads to healthy eating. We need to be cognisant of the role of each, namely, promotion and production.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the agri-food sector is a major force in the economy. It accounts for 9.2% of GDP, 8.5% of total exports and employs 10% of the labour force, which gives a good idea of the importance of the sector. In 2001, the Irish food and drink industry was valued at &euro;16 billion, of which almost &euro;7 billion was exported to more than 130 countries. The Irish agri-food sector involves 144,000 family run farms and 700 companies, employing approximately 47,000 people. Approximately 4.5 million hectares is in agricultural use, of which 80% is devoted to the production of lush grass pastures, pastures being the ideal environment for rearing dairy and beef cattle. Approximately 70% of Irish food and drink exports go to markets in the European Union. Approximately two thirds of Irish lamb produced is exported and meat accounts for 26% of all Irish food and drink exports. More than half <Col N="194"/>of the Irish pigmeat produced is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Europe.</P>
    <P>Long-standing quality assurance schemes have been instrumental in building the image of Irish meat products at home and internationally. We were the first country in Europe to establish a food safety authority. We were ahead of the market, which speaks volumes about the reputation of the industry. It is good to put in requirements at local level instead of waiting for a directive from Brussels. Such initiative builds our image abroad and is a credit to the industry in general.</P>
    <P>We are the leading supplier of Feta cheese in Europe. The Minister will know that is due to the success of Carbery Milk Products in west Cork, a company with innovative ideas in terms of production, management and business planning. This is just one example of the manner in which companies have conformed with the regulations and have been ahead of them. About seven or eight years ago I stayed in Willesden, London and I remember noticing that Dubliner Irish cheese occupied a good deal of shelf space, so there was an obvious demand for it. That was huge kudos for a company that started small and grew large.</P>
    <P>Three of the world's leading infant formula companies have chosen Ireland as a European manufacturing base, which is an indicator of our ability to attract such industry. Ireland is home to some of the world's favourite drink brands, supplying more than 90% of the world's cream liqueur market. Drinks account for 13% of all Irish food and drink exports. The country boasts the world's oldest licensed distillery and the most successful new drinks product launched world-wide in the past 30 years. Last March, there was quite a reaction to the fact that both boards were to be amalgamated. One of the more positive reactions came from the Irish Exporters' Association, which was very much in support of this particular endeavour. The association stated that the merger of An Bord Glas and Bord Bia was overdue. There were endless possibilities for relationship building in the market between the normal Irish food range promoted to the retail multiples by Bord Bia, and the mushroom, potato and glass-house crops in the portfolio of An Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>Some 70% of fresh produce sales now take place through retail multiples, so Bord Bia should be able to show an early impact for Irish companies supplying that sector. The IEA pointed out that there is still much potential for such exports. The association selected one example, the sale of cut flowers in the United Kingdom, which last year had a retail value of &euro;2.1 billion. The Irish output in that sector, however, amounted to only &euro;3.9 million, with just 270 acres in production. The opportunities in the horticultural sector alone for promoting the export of cut flowers are huge.</P>
    <P>The Irish Exporters' Association also mentioned the threat to mushroom production, which is one of our largest export products, from <Col N="195"/>Dutch producers who source their produce in Poland. In 2002, Irish mushroom exports amounted to &euro;117 million &mdash; down from &euro;128 million in 2001. There is a case to be made for being more cognisant of that situation.</P>
    <P>In recent days I consulted Deputy Upton, who is the Labour Party's spokesperson on agriculture and a food scientist by profession, with much expertise in this regard. There are issues that need to be addressed in the Bill, although it will obviously have a safe passage through this House and the Lower House. It will be enacted irrespective of my party's stance, but I have some difficulties as regards the terms of the separation of the promotional and production roles of both boards. I look forward to discussing these matters on Committee Stage next Tuesday and I am sure the Minister will be favourably disposed to taking on board any amendments that might improve the Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the hard work that has clearly gone into the preparation of this legislation. The Bill provides for the amalgamation of Bord Bia and An Bord Glas. This should help to provide a much more improved service and allow those who are currently working under the aegis of either body to benefit from the new body's more rounded focus.</P>
    <P>The role of Bord Bia is to act as a link between Irish food and drink suppliers and existing and potential customers. The board is currently charged with developing markets for Irish food and drink companies. Basically, its job is to help put Irish food and drink on tables throughout the world, thus bringing a taste of Ireland to as many markets as possible. Bord Bia has performed this role well and should be congratulated on the success it has achieved for food and drink companies. Irish food and drink have a reputation throughout the world for quality and while the companies producing those food products should obviously be congratulated for ensuring those high standards, Bord Bia deserves credit for promoting this positive image.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas on the other hand is concerned with the development of the horticultural industry. Horticulture deals with two main areas: first, amenities, such as trees, shrubs, flowers and bulbs; and, second, the food sector, which deals with the cultivation of fruit and vegetables. The board is also charged with promoting increased consumption of quality horticultural produce, which will help to contribute to healthier lifestyles and improve our environment.</P>
    <P>When all these factors are taken into consideration, the need for such an amalgamation is obvious. We need to examine the production of Irish produce in a coherent manner. The best possible overall framework is required in order to promote the growth of Irish fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the world food market is developing makes this amalgamation all the more <Col N="196"/>essential. If all aspects of the Irish food sector are to continue to enjoy success then there is no question but that we must have such an overall strategy. We must ensure that all aspects of the food and drink industry are working towards the same goal. We cannot allow a situation to develop where one company is promoting the growth of certain fruit and vegetables to the detriment of the best interests both of the economy and society generally. If we were to do that, a situation could conceivably develop whereby both bodies would be operating at cross purposes. That would be a nightmare scenario, which could have wide-ranging effects on all aspects of the Irish food and drink industries.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation provided for in the Bill will prevent such a scenario from coming about. It is a natural step that will allow us to make the best use of our resources. Senator Callanan referred to the benefits this move will bring and he also called for the further amalgamation of the new body with Bord Iascaigh Mhara. I agree with that proposal. Further benefits would accrue to the industry if the Minister were to introduce such a measure. As Senator Callanan pointed out, it is the obvious next step but that is a debate for another occasion.</P>
    <P>Once the Bill has been enacted, the food and drink industries will go from strength to strength. We will encourage the production of crops that will be best suited to the food and drinks we are producing. In addition, we will be producing food and drink products that make best use of the crops we can grow. Like most of the best arguments, it is a simple one and surely everyone can see its merit. It will help us to make the best use of the limited land available. As a small country it is important to concentrate on the areas that will provide the best return but that will not necessarily happen unless we are all reading from the same script. The various sectors of the food and drink industry &mdash; from the growing of raw materials to the manufacturing and marketing sectors &mdash; must work from one blueprint towards the same goal of economic success. Such a strategy will ensure that we get the most from what we have and should help the food and drink sectors to make an even bigger impact on the world market. That, in itself, will be a fantastic development.</P>
    <P>The Bill is good news for everyone involved, including farmers, food processors and breweries. It is good, also, for those involved in the marketing and sale of Irish food and drink products. The amalgamation of Bord Bia and An Bord Glas, under the terms of the Bill, will bring about a significant synergy of all aspects of the industries involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>While normally I have no problem in welcoming most Government legislation that comes before the House, I have some doubts about this Bill. On most occasions, I can support the Minister's ideas but that does not prevent me from questioning some aspects. I am not <Col N="197"/>convinced that the proposed amalgamation of Bord Bia and An Bord Glas is necessarily a good thing. Part of my reluctance about the proposal stems from my own background in business. Despite the fact that such mergers occur often, they sometimes have a bad reputation among business people for good reason. Most mergers fail to produce the promises made when they occur. In particular, they fail to produce such promises for smaller companies. That happens and it can give rise to problems that continue for a long time afterwards. I can see a great deal of logic in mergers particularly, given my business experience, in the case of purchasing. For example, if a small company tags on to a larger one and manages to maintain its own culture and independence, it will gain the benefits of joint purchasing. Some mergers have worked well but often those mergers are recommended not necessarily by people in the business but by merchant bankers and speculators who talk about the synergies of bringing bodies together in order to maximise benefits. In this respect, merchant bankers and speculators in the business world can gain, while the losers are very often the businesses themselves &mdash; the people who work in them, the customers and the culture of the organisations concerned. Rarely is there a genuine business case for making mergers succeed and the usual push to a merger comes from factors external to the business. We are debating the merging of two State bodies and therefore the dark forces of the financial world are not in play. A parallel appears when we consider from where the idea of a merger came. The Minister says quite openly that the idea did not arise from within either of the two bodies involved but from an outside force. The idea came from the three wise men, those three men drafted in by the Government in 2002 to dream up spending cuts for the budget. They produced some sensible ideas along with some short-sighted ones. One of their more ridiculous suggestions was the recommendation to abolish the Irish Film Board, a suggestion which I am glad to say the Government had the good sense to throw into the waste paper basket.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o'clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The idea of a merger of these two boards survived and we have this Bill before us as a result. It is driven by short-term cost considerations rather than by the synergies about which we sometimes hear. Looking at the two boards from the outside with the eyes of an accountant, there appears to be some duplication and an overlap of functions. Therefore, it seemed a sensible course to remove the duplication by merging the two bodies. There are other considerations we should bear in mind along with the rush to save the few euro we think we shall save.</P>
    <P>People who argue for mergers often forget that business entities, whether private companies or State agencies, have a culture inescapably tied up with their individual identity. A successful identity develops into a team with a driving <Col N="198"/>motivation and collective loyalty of its own. I know that An Bord Glas has an energy and enthusiasm centred and focused on what it is trying to do. I know too that the Minister has agreed that it will have seats on the board. However, I express a word of caution. I fear that An Bord Glas will not be able to maintain that focus. The main reason some mergers are not successful is that they destroy the essential energy in an organisation. The promised benefits and the expected financial savings do not always result either. We must tread carefully in order to retain the energy, enthusiasm and culture we have seen previously in small organisations.</P>
    <P>I ask for a convincing business argument in favour of this merger to justify the change. In the absence of a compelling argument, my instinct is to leave matters as they are even if that means putting up with a situation which from the outside appears untidy. I am reminded of the old joke people used to tell about McKinsey consultancy reports. The story was that if a group called in McKinsey consultants to examine an organisation, they would make one of two recommendations. If it was a single organisation, McKinsey would recommend it should be broken into several component and separate units but if that had already been done, McKinsey would recommend that all the separate units should be amalgamated to gain all the benefits. I would not say the same about the three wise men. However, no matter how a company was organised, McKinsey could always dream up plausible ways for organising it the other way.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that is what is happening here. However, arguments are sometimes turned on their head in order to justify whatever change is sought. Whether it is a merger or a shake-up, the resulting shake-up of an organisation rarely produces the results envisaged. The costs of making the change always come up to expectations, and often exceed them, and the companies involved in making the recommendation usually get paid.</P>
    <P>There is sometimes a fashion in seeking to change how a company is organised. For example, if we look at the public service as a whole, it is somehow ironic that we are debating the merger of two State bodies, as proposed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, at a time when another Minister is hell bent on breaking up two other State bodies, CIE and Aer Rianta. The situation resembles the McKinsey course; it almost seems as if we must be seen to do something.</P>
    <P>I have not heard much by way of a convincing business argument in any of these cases for making any of the changes proposed. Rather than going through what may turn out to be an artificial exercise in merging Bord Bia and An Bord Glas, we would be better examining the marketplace and putting our energy into ensuring that both bodies are fully responsive to it. It will not surprise anybody to hear that I believe Bord Bia has done an excellent job and has had many <Col N="199"/>successes over the past decade. Nevertheless, in terms of organisation, it is seriously flawed. That is not Bord Bia's fault. The fault is demonstrated by the fact that the board's sponsoring Department is the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The Minister may throw his eyes to heaven and think he has heard this before. He has spoken about the expert group, in which I had the honour to participate, which was involved ten years ago in setting up Bord Bia. I had the dubious responsibility of producing a minority report in which I agreed with everything proposed with one exception &mdash; that Bord Bia should not fall under the remit of the Department of Agriculture and Food. My reasoning was that the Department represents the interests of producers and that if Bord Bia were included in an organisation representing producers it would always be affected by that balance. I argued that rather than being a food board it would more likely become an agricultural produce board. I did not win the argument.</P>
    <P>This is not just a question of semantics. We invariably think in agricultural terms and fail to see the potential of a fully developed food industry. I spoke about this ten years ago. It is interesting in looking at some of the figures now that I spoke about a potential chicken business at that stage. It is interesting too that Thailand and Brazil now export a huge amount of chickens.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose somebody came to Bord Bia in 1994 and said he or she wanted to set up a chicken business and make Ireland its centre. If that person explained his or her concept of bringing in chickens from Denmark or France because they had the required flavour and texture and were at the right price, and explained that he or she required the board's help and support in setting up a factory, the Department would have asked him or her to think about producing the chickens in Ireland. The Department would have insisted the business be producer led. It is understandable that the people concerned with agriculture would say that but food people would have said they wanted to create a food business &mdash; a chicken eating business rather than a chicken producing business. The potential factory owner would have decided to go elsewhere because the Department or board was unenthusiastic for the project and spent their time trying to get him or her to produce the product here.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas and Bord Bia would be better located almost anywhere other than the Department of Agriculture and Food. Over the past 30 years we have had remarkable success in importing industrial ideas from elsewhere and building a solid position in the global marketplace. We have new high-tech industries in which we had no particular skills or traditions. We succeeded in that area but at the same time largely ignored the potential opportunity waiting on our doorstep &mdash; the opportunity to become a world player in the modern food business.</P><Col N="200"/>
    <P>That initiative has been taken by Thailand and Brazil in one sector alone. In that project, our agricultural heritage could have served as a springboard but because our vision was lacking, it became a millstone around our necks. It is certainly true that there have been some fine successes in the Irish food business and in the agricultural industry. I wish all power to the companies which have grasped opportunities and to Bord Bia for accomplishing what it has with one hand tied behind its back. However, what has been achieved is nothing compared to what we could do if we stopped regarding food simply as an outlet for our farmers' produce. We should start instead to look at food as a massive new industrial opportunity this country is adequately positioned to exploit.</P>
    <P>While I wish the new body well in its endeavours, I cannot help feeling this energy is in danger of being misdirected. I have a couple of queries. The Minister touched on a point mentioned already today and I am not quite sure I understand the matter. In the supermarket we have been surprised by the recent development of non-food products. I am thinking here of cut flowers, shrubs and garden centre products, which represent a significant business in Ireland worth &euro;500 million a year. I am not sure where that business fits in the context of the proposal before us. Clearly, it is not part of the food industry. In our business we did not always regard cut flowers as part of the food industry, but one finds them in a modern supermarket. I was in a supermarket yesterday where I saw one in four customers buying cut flowers as they walked through the checkout. That is a significant business given that it was fairly minimal ten years ago. It has been helped to a great extent by the energy, enthusiasm and efforts of An Bord Glas. I hope garden centres and businesses which do not involve food and do not quite fit into Bord Bia's remit are not given second class status.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation will go ahead and I wish it well. I hope it achieves what is set out in the thinking behind it. However, I caution that where one merges a large and a small body, sometimes the benefits and the culture of each organisation can be lost. I wish the Minister well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and wish him extremely well during the Presidency of the EU. At this stage, he is a Minister with vast experience. Apart from a two year interval, he has been at Agriculture House for the past 17 years. While there have been little ups and downs with farm organisations now and again, I am glad there is harmony once again. I compliment the Minister on the establishment of the group to examine where agriculture will be in ten years. I was sitting opposite Mr. Alan Dukes, the excellent chairman the Minister has appointed, at dinner recently. It is to be encouraged that where the best person comes from a background in an Opposition party a Government should not hesitate to appoint him or her. I congratulate the <Col N="201"/>Minister for doing so in this case. Mr. Dukes was telling me that he was training himself to say &ldquo;this Government&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;this bloody awful Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of Bord Bia and An Bord Glas is probably the right thing to do. I have a slight sentimental attachment to An Bord Glas. I remember well being involved in the research office of Fianna F&aacute;il circa 1986 when we produced a well received policy document on the development of horticulture, which led to the establishment of An Bord Glas. Certainly at that time there was a need to place a particular focus on the development of horticulture. Despite all the development which has occurred, there is still a great deal of unexploited potential which I will discuss later. I did not realise until I listened to the Minister's speech that horticulture was the third most important sector in agriculture. That is an astonishing achievement as it was not the case back in 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was a diplomat in Germany that there were many different offices. There was a separate office for CBF and another for dairy products. There is a case for rationalising and bringing bodies together. By the way, I must declare a small interest in that a relative of mine by marriage works for Bord Bia in an office abroad. In any case, the board is already responsible for the marketing of produce. Senator Quinn is correct to say that not all mergers lead to added value. One can think in the political field of the amalgamation of Labour and Democratic Left.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Or Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is far from clear what the added value is for Labour. Obviously, I can see the added value from the point of view of the people from Democratic Left who carried out the reverse take-over, but not for the organisation as a whole. The separate interests of agriculture are adequately taken care of by the provision of two members of the board and the maintenance of a separate identity in the terms of a subsidiary board.</P>
    <P>The industry is important from many points of view. Tipperary Mushrooms which operates in the leading export sector in horticulture is based in my home town. I understand that our particular climate with relatively mild winters and minimal disparity between summer and winter temperatures gives us a certain advantage in terms of costs. It is probably as well for exports that the euro is not rising against sterling, whatever about the dollar. Ongoing flexibility is needed in the employment and work permit area as many of those who work in this industry come from places like Romania and Belarus. While there have not been grave problems so far, a little flexibility may be needed. I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the industry will <Col N="202"/>co-operate with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on that issue.</P>
    <P>The way in which the amenities sector has developed over the past 15 years has been wonderful. People have put a great deal of effort into their gardens and local authorities have done much to beautify public places. The type of town or village which wins the Tidy Towns competition has hanging baskets at every window. It is an alternative area of enterprise although I am not sure we have fully exploited it. Many products grow extremely well here including potatoes, beans and various types of soft fruit. I have a particular interest in soft fruit and once took a short soft fruit growing course for family rather than commercial reasons. One regret I have is that in days gone by, most farmers or people with a small plot would have grown potatoes, cabbages and carrots but the practice has gone out to a certain extent. If one is in Brittany or northern France and travels by train from somewhere like Roscoff, one will see people growing vegetables right up to the tracks. Every little corner is filled. Climate is, of course, changing and one wonders about the sort of summer France had last year. Many crops have difficulty surviving the heat. We have a very favourable climate. I remember Mr. Charlie Haughey once saying that this was a slightly de Valeraesque idea but I believe people should be encouraged to grow their own produce. To my mind, and this is a very personal view, people spend a lot of money cycling furiously in gyms and such like. I have found all my life that something like gardening gives one good exercise but in a way that is productive and fulfilling at the same time.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn expressed the view that this is financially driven. Over the years there has been a tendency to create State bodies and agencies to promote various objectives and they need to be rationalised from time to time to avoid a proliferation of the overheads. If this measure works properly, the horticultural sector, which is proceeding reasonably well, will have the clout of a larger body behind it. I do not see any reason its identity as a sector in its own right need somehow be suppressed or submerged. On balance, despite my sentimental attachment to An Bord Glas but having been involved a little in its foundation, this is probably the correct measure. I wish everyone involved in this important sector well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very interested in Senator Mansergh's comments. The Minister for Health and Children spoke about the introduction of taxes on fatty foods as a means of reducing obesity among young and old and Senator Mansergh is recommending the introduction of mandatory gardening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Not mandatory.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps not mandatory gardening but gardening as a means of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="203"/>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;compulsory tillage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, compulsory tillage as a means of making people fitter. I welcome the Minister and I am pleased he has stayed in the House for the debate. Senator Quinn has outlined what I wished to say about the Bill and I echo his sentiments. I have listened to the contributions of the Minister and the Government Senators and I am not convinced of any genuine, strong argument contained therein which would suggest there would be a benefit in the merging of Bord Bia and An Bord Glas. The current situation is more desirable than anything that has been proposed today in the House.</P>
    <P>Farming is at a difficult juncture at present. There is also a crisis of confidence among consumers about the products on sale. Agriculture is experiencing difficulties. I fail to see how this proposed merger will tackle any of those issues. My colleague, Senator Coonan, spoke about the funding of Teagasc. I raised this issue on a number of occasions in the House. The funding for Teagasc was cut in last year's budget by &euro;17 million and it was cut again this year by a smaller amount. This will cause the closure of Teagasc offices and there is an effective death sentence hanging over Teagasc advisory centres throughout the country. The Government would be well advised to invest more money in helping farmers to make the right decisions at this vital time for agriculture as we face into the new CAP reform and the Fischler proposals, which will soon be a reality. It is very wrong that funding in this vital area has been cut over the past couple of budgets.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have spoken about consumer confidence in products. We are all aware of the bird flu currently in the Far East. A large volume of poultry meat from the Far East ends up being processed in Ireland. I am aware the EU has taken action to ensure that will cease while the infection continues in the Far East but this situation has highlighted the problems which exist here in the labelling of products. An animal or meat product of any sort can be produced anywhere in the world, be brought to Ireland, processed in some form and then sold as an Irish product. I have a particular interest in the potato sector. Potatoes can be produced in Cyprus, washed in this country and then sold as &ldquo;Irish washed potatoes&rdquo;. It is true they have been washed in Ireland but it is a very misleading label. The issue of labelling and the display of the country of origin of produce is very important and is a matter on which the Department of Agriculture and Food and the new board need to focus attention.</P>
    <P>From the arguments put forward by the Minister and the Government Senators I do not see any coherent reason this Bill should be supported. Other areas in agriculture and the food industry need to be examined and supported. The proposed merger of Bord Bia and <Col N="204"/>An Bord Glas is not an issue which deserves the priority it has been given.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. Apart from the reservations expressed in the House there are many other organisations involved in food production that have reservations about this Bill. Any time there is talk of a review or rationalisation, this effectively means cutbacks. I would prefer to call this an abolition of An Bord Glas rather than an amalgamation and that is a very regrettable situation. The autonomy of An Bord Glas will be lost in this new set-up.</P>
    <P>No research, innovation, trials or development are operative in the agricultural sector. The closure of the Teagasc research centre at Clonroche was the first indication that all was not well and that the Minister and his Department were overseeing rationalisation and cuts. It is regrettable that one of the best centres for trials and development under the auspices of Teagasc has been closed and sold. The rapidity and speed with which that was done was unbelievable. Teagasc was established to take over from the old advisory services of the Department of Agriculture and Food. These services were progressive forces in agriculture and gave a new impetus from the early 1970s. They advised on investment in agriculture but now they are all gone and the Minister has presided over their effective abolition. The Minister has spent a decade in his ministry and has made very important and worthwhile changes. The sad thing about it is that the only function of Teagasc that we see on the ground is to prepare for the exit of many farmers from the industry. I ask the Minister, who is presiding over it, if that is good enough and if he is happy with it. I certainly do not feel happy with it. It is regrettable that Teagasc is taking on board the role of catering for part-time farmers and the eventual exit of many people from agriculture.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight a matter of shame which I would like the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address as a matter of urgency. Representatives of Bord Bia and the Department can enter a high class restaurant and ask its proprietor if he or she wants Bord Bia certification to be displayed on the premises. If the restaurateur agrees to display the certification, which is a major advantage, he or she is asked to sign a contract for the purchase of beef from a particular wholesaler in this country. In a case with which I am familiar, however, the proprietor was not willing to sign such a contract. The man in question produces top quality Galway beef, which is free from hormones and drugs, from his fields which adjoin his restaurant. He was astounded to be told that he could not receive certification for his beef and that the beef on sale in his restaurant had to be channelled through a specific wholesaler. He decided not to participate in the certification scheme.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that a producer of beef could not receive certification for his own quality <Col N="205"/>product from the body which certifies Irish beef and other quality products which are available in his restaurant and many others throughout the country. When he inquired into the status of the wholesale company with which he was asked to sign an agreement, he found that much of the beef it was distributing for the catering industry was sourced in South America. It is important that the Minister should investigate this matter immediately so that this rot can be stopped. Ireland contributed to EU beef mountains on various occasions over the years. The prices received by the farmers of Ireland decreased as a consequence. If we are to promote a quality Irish product, which is a suitable description of all Irish beef, we should ensure that we do not lose out on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>I call into question the provisions of this Bill on the basis of the matters I have outlined. The Minister proposes to give Bord Bia the power to promote Irish goods and products as quality products, despite the fact that we are aware that it is engaging in practices such as I have described. I am aware that some Irish exporters of beef fiddled the books in the past. They introduced an inferior quality of product to the global export market. It was regrettable that it took a long time to revive the quality image of Irish products. I hope the damage done then has long since passed and that we can promote such products again.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister guarantee that this amalgamation, or the subsuming of An Bord Glas into Bord Bia, will maintain support for the vegetables and other horticultural products that he mentioned in his address? Will he guarantee that such products will be supported? I do not want them to lose their identity when they are part of a bigger area of responsibility within Bord Bia. If there is a loss of identity, it will not be a surprise if one finds imported products of a lesser quality when one goes to the vegetable shop. Many Senators on both sides have mentioned that imported products do not have the same quality as the Irish product. It is regrettable that the major retail chains have to search outside this country, in Europe or elsewhere, for a continuity of supply. If a level playing pitch is put in place and the large monopoly chains try to find the cheapest possible product, we will have the potential and the capacity to produce such a supply in this country.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that a free 10 kg. bag of potatoes is being offered with every &euro;30 of purchases. While such practices are allowed to thrive, we cannot say that we are in any way determined to support vegetable producers, horticultural production and many other aspects of Bord Bia's remit. Can the Minister state whether Bord Bia has sourced any new market for Irish products? I refer to a new breakthrough market in any part of the world. The Minister's global statement that we are breaking into new markets for various products every day, every week and every year is too all-embracing. I appreciate that it is difficult to provide details off <Col N="206"/>the cuff, but I would like him to name the specific new markets of a worthwhile nature that have been accessed and will continue to be accessed with a degree of continuity as a result of the initiatives of Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>If we are to restore confidence to agriculture, it is important that the Minister can give some hope to this intensive area. Agriculture is becoming an exit industry. Industries such as vegetable production, horticulture and dairying are directly related to great agricultural intensity. The changes being proposed by the Minister in this Bill will be worthwhile if he can offer a ray of hope. Is there a possibility of guaranteeing top class prices to farmers for top class products that are presented well? If there is no such guarantee, everybody will become suspicious and demoralised by the demise of agriculture.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions. This well-balanced Bill will ensure the continued development of the Irish food and horticulture sectors, in terms of both development and promotion. The Bill provides for a subsidiary board with separate legal status and representation on the new main board. We are ensuring that horticulture will not be swamped or set aside in any way. It will be strengthened considerably in the new organisation.</P>
    <P>The current budget for An Bord Glas, which has done superb work, is less than &euro;3 million. This is a relatively small budget, by any standards, for a national organisation with potential for further exports. Bord Bia has a budget of &euro;25 million, meaning that the new organisation will have a total budget of &euro;28 million. An Bord Glas and Bord Bia are involved in the promotion of Irish food. An Bord Glas, which has a total staff of 12, will be in a much stronger position in a unified organisation with access to a budget of &euro;28 million compared to its existing budget of less than &euro;3 million. It will also have access to Bord Bia's network of offices in many EU countries. Bord Bia's promotions involve individual logos, but An Bord Glas has separate logos. Rather than confusing consumers, we should have a rational identity for Irish food. That will become possible with the merged body.</P>
    <P>Currently there is a plethora of quality control schemes and agencies to implement them. There is no need for separate quality control schemes for Irish food, whether it is mushrooms or mozzarella cheese for pizzas. It is all food and it must all be of the highest possible standard and produced under the most hygienic conditions. It must be natural, wholesome food. The new body will provide a better chance to implement important measures such as these.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures for the future that promotion actions both at home and abroad are synchronised to achieve the best possible service for the producer, the consumer and the taxpayer. Senators who have visited food promotion <Col N="207"/>activities, whether in the RDS or down the country, will know that at the Bord Bia stand one sees a well laid out stand, with Irish food looking its best, while the An Bord Glas stand, which is also well done and exceptionally professional, is set up in another area. It is all Irish food and it would make much more sense if it was promoted in a more unified way. The combined expertise of both bodies will be important in the new organisation. Both bodies, with relatively small budgets, have done an excellent job. This performance is due in no small measure to the calibre of the staff involved. They have a particular culture and there is an effervescence to their work. They like their job and are good at promotion, doing much good for Irish food.</P>
    <P>The interests of concerned stakeholders will be well served by the amalgamation. These include the staff of the entire horticulture sector, including amenity horticulture. I was glad to hear Senator Quinn and others mention cut flowers. The Dutch are great traders and promoters. When it comes to tulips from Amsterdam, among other things, they really put us in the shade. Senator Mansergh spoke about the fine Irish soil and the good weather we have for producing these items. We should be doing better. At weddings one can see the number of cut flowers being imported into Ireland. The slogan of Fianna F&aacute;il in the last election was &ldquo;A lot done, more to do.&rdquo; There is a bit more to do.</P>

	<P>As I said in my opening remarks, Ireland has established an international reputation as a food island. We have some world brand leaders in this area, most notably Bailey's cream liqueurs. We can build on that work. The new organisation will be sufficiently imaginative to exploit this, especially in the amenity horticulture sector, where there are great opportunities.</P>
    <P>Senator Coonan acknowledged the success of both organisations. Bord Bia has a strong track record, particularly in Europe. From 1 May this year Europe will have 500 million consumers. This is a great opportunity. There will be emerging sectors, such as consumer foods. Senator McCarthy talked about a relatively small industry in west Cork, Carbery Milk Products, which did not manufacture cheese of any description until a few years ago, when it commenced the manufacture of mozzarella cheese for pizza toppings, and is now doing a superb job. These are speciality and artisan foods. Bord Bia is giving special attention to artisan foods, which links into Senator Ulick Burke's concern about the supply of Irish-based food to local restaurants. I am not aware of the specific matter he raised, but I will follow it up.</P><Col N="208"/>
    <P>One of the unique things about Ireland is that not alone would a person know his local butcher and abattoir, whose family have probably been in the business for generations, but he would probably know the cattle as well. This is something we should seek to preserve not only for Irish consumers, but also for visitors. They do not want to eat plastic, international food while they are here; they want a unique culinary experience. If they go to Galway or west Cork they want the uniqueness of the area to be transmitted through the food. We have a soil and climate in parts of Ireland conducive to producing excellent food, whether it is Connemara lamb, Bantry salmon or our famous black pudding. We must enhance our efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators said this development was about saving money and reducing costs. It is not so much about the price of something but the value we obtain from it. The savings will be modest. There will be some administrative savings because there will be a single structure instead of fragmented structures, but the greater value for money will be the important thing. If Bord Bia is doing market research in an area, why not include mushrooms or another horticulture or amenity product? This is a sensible thing to do and it will work well. During our consultations with Bord Bia and An Bord Glas the organisations expressed concerns, especially about the amenity horticulture area. I hope I allayed those concerns. Bord Bia has 80 staff and An Bord Glas has 12. They are not large organisations by any means. It makes a great deal of sense to merge them. There was concern about the developmental role of An Bord Glas, which has done great work in the potato sector in packing and storage and distributing decent grant aid under the national development plan. This will continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh made an interesting suggestion that people should get out of the gym and into the garden, and I agree. One can get great exercise in the garden and it is wonderful, after a long week in the Seanad, to do some work there. It is good for the mind and the body. Senator Quinn is a renowned retailer and initiated many useful developments long before people raised concerns in those areas. Senator Phelan mentioned labelling and traceability. I remember years ago seeing that the beef in Senator Quinn's retail establishment was from a producer in County Donegal. I thought this was great because not only did people know it was Irish beef, but they also knew the supplier, the breed of cattle and so on. We have developed constructively along that route, but we need to do better. That is what Bord Bia is doing through the F&eacute;ile Bia programme. Traceability is not as good, unfortunately, in the catering industry as in the retail industry. People are entitled to know what they are eating and from where it has come. The origin of what one eats is important. Good work has been done in this area.</P><Col N="209"/>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke of business management criteria. We should consider the size of both organisations and the value for money we can obtain by merging market research, logos, quality assurance schemes and promotional operations at various exhibitions throughout the country and Europe. The Senator was very hard on the Department of Agriculture and Food. Its remit does cover food. However, if one is setting up a poultry or other industry in the natural resource area, it is not to the Department of Agriculture and Food one goes, but to Enterprise Ireland which has responsibility for that area of activity. In fairness to Enterprise Ireland, it has done well and there are good industries in food production, such as the infant formula and consumer foods sectors.</P>
    <P>Senator John Phelan raised the matter of labelling which is an area where an exceptional job has been done. However, there is a weakness in the catering sector that needs to be addressed. This is a role for the Commission. However, it is not Commissioner Byrne's area but Commissioner Fischler's. I have raised the issue with him a number of times, particularly at times of food health scares. I have also established a food liaison group which does worthwhile research and recently produced a report on its findings. I sent a copy of the report to Commissioner Fischler's office because I want full traceability right through the food chain, including the catering sector. I take the Senator's point on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke asked if Bord Bia had any success in opening up new export markets. The greatest success of all not alone for Bord Bia, but for the industry, was to get back on European retail shelves following one of the greatest food scares in recent history, BSE or mad cow disease. That scare was followed by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Irish food exports, beef in particular, were excluded from European markets and even the live exports trade was stopped. In 2003, the Irish beef industry returned to the UK market with exports of up to 265,000 tonnes &mdash; 50% of our entire exports &mdash; mostly to retail outlets. Up to 150,000 tonnes were exported to mainland Europe. Irish food exports had been excluded from Germany, France, Netherlands, Italy and Spain. There have been many instances where certain foods and beverages have been hit with a minor health scare and the market has never recovered. However, in the relatively short time of two years, Irish food exports have returned to the market. We owe a debt of gratitude to Bord Bia for this development. The reputation of Irish beef is at an all-time high, so much so that we only need one more third country for beef exports, Russia. Russia took 85,000 tonnes of beef exports in 2003 and it is a valuable market which creates competition.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware of the long saga of the Egyptian market where it was open politically, but commercially no Irish beef could be exported there.</P>

Thankfully, there is no great need for the Egyptian market because we are doing so well in the commercial markets in the UK and Europe, which have high returns. Much work was done by Ambassador Richard O'Brien in Cairo and the Department of Agriculture and Food to resolve the issue, but it was mainly driven by Bord Bia.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to update the House on what is happening on this important issue.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o'clock</TimeSt><P>Most Members of the House will be aware that domestic violence is a serious problem and a complex social issue. Most Senators will also be aware that this is not confined to our country, but is a feature of most societies. There are many definitions of domestic violence, but it has been best described as an expression of power and control in a relationship. Anybody who knows anything about it will tell one that it is systematic and aimed at achieving compliance by domination of the other partner in the relationship, mainly through fear and diminished self-esteem.</P>
    <P>Senators will be all too well aware that domestic violence is not an isolated or sporadic event. It happens all around the country. It affects people of all ages, all social classes and is present in urban and rural communities. Domestic violence can take many forms. It can involve not only physical abuse but other forms of abuse, including emotional abuse, sexual abuse, isolation from family and friends, control over access to money and threats to others, including children.</P>
    <P>We know that a large number of the victims require medical treatment as a result of domestic violence. We also know that some victims of domestic violence die. We can say with some certainty and great regret that most of those affected by domestic violence will suffer from its <Col N="211"/>effects for the rest of their lives. It is important for us to remember that domestic violence is a crime. It must be seen by society as such and be treated by us all as a criminal matter.</P>
    <P>International experience tells us that one in five women experience violence in an intimate relationship at some stage of their lives. The position in Ireland is no different. The recently published Garda statistics for 2002 show that 10,248 incidents of domestic violence were reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that year. In addition to this, I am aware that the various non-governmental organisations working to help victims of domestic violence also receive a large number of calls for help. While I recognise that men can also be victims of domestic violence, Garda statistics show that in 92% of the cases reported in 2002, the victim was female.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on our society that some women live in fear of violent attack on a daily basis. The fact that this violence occurs in a family home, a place which should offer security and love, makes the crime even more devastating for the victim. We must recognise this fact and not think that because the perpetrator and the victim live together, this should be considered a mitigating factor. In my view, the opposite should be the case.</P>
    <P>It is also a sad fact that many people know of women who are living with this fear, yet they choose to turn a blind eye and treat it as a private matter. However, domestic violence is not a private matter. It is a matter which should be of concern to all members of society and one which everyone can play a role in bringing to an end. The secrecy that surrounds domestic violence only allows it to continue. We all have a responsibility to stop it. Anybody who has had any experience of domestic violence will tell one of the horror and anguish it causes. As a society, we must do all we can to help the victims of domestic violence and to ensure their safety. Awareness raising is one of the keys to achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we in Government, public representatives and those working in the public service have a primary responsibility to take action in regard to domestic violence. The Government, for its part, has established a national steering committee on violence against women. Senators will be aware that I act as chairperson of that national steering committee. The aim of the committee is to foster inter-agency co-operation, raise awareness about the issue, conduct research into the various aspects of violence against women and follow up on progress on the recommendations made in the report of the task force on violence against women. All relevant Departments, statutory agencies, voluntary bodies and the Garda are represented on this committee. Eight regional committees on violence against women, one in each health board area, have also been established.</P><Col N="212"/>
    <P>A number of Departments have responsibilities in regard to the issue of domestic violence. The Department of Health and Children is responsible for the provision of care services to victims of violence, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault, through the health boards. In the main, these services are provided by non-governmental organisations such as Women's Aid, Rape Crisis Centres, women's refuges, etc, who receive funding in this regard from the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>It is important that the non-governmental organisations working to provide services to women experiencing violence are adequately funded. I can inform the House that the funding for this purpose has increased dramatically from &euro;3.8 million in 1997 to approximately &euro;12 million in 2004. It is my intention to discuss the issue of funding with the Minister for Health and Children again prior to the finalisation of next year's Estimates campaign.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government assists in the provision of crisis accommodation. This includes refuge accommodation for people who are forced to leave their homes as a result of domestic violence. The Department of Education and Science is responsible for educating our children in regard to this issue in the schools. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs funds community development programmes and grant aids local groups dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its associated agencies have a number of important roles to play in regard to domestic violence. One of these roles is the enactment of legislation. It is well known that we have strong legislation on domestic violence. It is regarded as among the best in Europe, but we must not be complacent.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the main area of legislation in this regard is the Domestic Violence Act 1996. This legislation offers a number of civil remedies to victims of domestic violence in terms of safety orders, protection orders and barring orders. Breaches of any orders granted by the courts are defined as criminal offences. An important factor is that the use of violence, for whatever purpose, is also a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that the lack of reporting of trends in family law cases has led to a lack of public information about these issues. I am pleased to say that legislation to amend the <i>in camera</i> rule will be included in the Civil Liability and Courts Bill which is due to be published in the next week or so. An essential feature of the proposal will be to allow for the preparation and publication of reports and decisions in proceedings in family law cases while protecting the identity of the parties or any child to whom the proceedings relate. Other recommendations, including those made by non-governmental organisations working in the area of domestic violence, will be considered by my Department's civil law division as part of a review of family law.</P><Col N="213"/>
    <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a written policy on domestic violence intervention. The policy is clear, unambiguous and non-gender specific. It dictates that any incidents of domestic violence reported to the Garda must be fully investigated. In responding to reported incidents of domestic violence, the Garda is in the front line and has an important role to play in deciding whether there is evidence that any crime has been committed.</P>
    <P>Access to justice is also an important issue. In civil cases the Legal Aid Board offers legal aid and advice to people who satisfy the requirements of the Act. This includes people seeking protection from domestic violence by way of safety orders and barring orders. The board is conscious of the urgency of certain types of cases and operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded to certain categories of cases over others, including domestic violence. In these cases the application is dealt with immediately and not placed on a waiting list. I understand also that, in recent years, approximately 65% of the legal aid certificates issued involved domestic violence. I am also aware that there was confusion in regard to the operation of this priority system recently, but officials of my Department have received an assurance from the Legal Aid Board that the priority system for domestic violence remedies is still in operation.</P>
    <P>Domestic violence offenders are dealt with through the criminal justice system and my Department also supports the establishment of programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence through the probation and welfare service. My Department also sponsors research into domestic violence and other forms of violence against women.</P>
    <P>In terms of improving the lives and safety of victims, I believe that, where possible, prevention is always better than cure. This is why I was delighted that last year my Department was able to provide funding for the establishment of a domestic violence intervention project on a one year pilot basis in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Bray area. The project is based on similar domestic violence intervention projects in other jurisdictions which have proved very successful in reducing incidents of domestic violence and domestic murder. One aim of the intervention project is the increased accountability of perpetrators of domestic violence for the crimes they commit. It is important that any intervention is designed to protect the victim and bring the violence to an end. The project also aims, through the sharing of information between agencies dealing with the offender and the victim, to ensure the continuing safety of the victim and to measure the degree to which the offender is amending their use of violence in the relationship. The project should be a very useful source of information for the Judiciary in this regard. The D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Bray pilot project is currently being evaluated and we hope this evaluation will provide us with information about our success in this regard.</P><Col N="214"/>
    <P>The Department is also looking at other programmes being run to deal with perpetrators and is evaluating their effectiveness. It is intended that this evaluation will underline best practice in this area and that improvements will follow this exercise. We can learn from the experience and response of other jurisdictions in their approach to combating domestic violence. For that reason my Department is represented on an intergovernmental group with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales which shares information and best practice on victim care and combating and preventing domestic violence.</P>
    <P>Children have a right to live in safety and without fear. They have the right to a safe place to grow up, develop, learn and understand, which is what we all want for our children. Unfortunately, some children do not experience these basic rights and needs. International research has shown that in over 80% of domestic violence incidents, children are present, either in the same room or the next room. The impact of witnessing these crimes should not be underestimated. Children who witness violence in the home are seeing, hearing and learning about violence. They learn that the people they love most, and the people they should be able to trust, may hurt them. They learn that living in fear is a normal feeling and that violence is an acceptable method of resolving conflicts. It is important that children are taught that violence is not the answer and that living in fear is not normal. We have got to create an ethos where the perpetration of violent acts on women and children is no longer an acceptable practice in our society.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge there is still work to be done to improve services for victims of domestic violence and there is also a need to continue raising awareness of the issue. As I said, this is one of the aims of the national steering committee and we will continue our work in that regard. The committee is also working on a number of other issues which should lead to an improvement in the situation for all victims. The committee is currently beginning the process of developing a strategic plan for the next five years which will identify and prioritise areas for action. The committee has also commissioned research and is identifying further areas of research that need to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that the National Crime Council is also conducting a national study into domestic violence and I understand the findings of its study will be available in the summer. This research should provide us with very important information in relation to the prevalence of domestic violence in Ireland. The issue of violence against women is an important part of the Government's programme during Ireland's Presidency of the EU and my Department will be hosting a conference on violence against women at Dublin Castle in May. This conference will focus on all forms of domestic violence against women and will allow us to share our experiences with other EU member states.</P><Col N="215"/>
    <P>I pay tribute to the many non-governmental organisations which have been providing services and support to victims of domestic violence over the years, mainly Women's Aid, the National Network of Refuges and Support Services and the National Women's Council of Ireland. Their work is greatly appreciated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to this important debate, which is long overdue. Domestic violence is a matter that concerns me greatly. Violence in any form against women is a reprehensible act. It is a hidden crime &mdash; we do not read about it in the newspapers or hear about it on television that much &mdash; but, sadly, we all know it happens far too often. The 2002 statistics reveal an average of 22 incidents of domestic violence every day, which is frightening. Many victims of domestic violence feel helpless and are unable, for their own reasons, to report those crimes. They suffer silently, day in day out. Many voluntary groups such as women's refuges, outreach programmes and Women's Aid work tirelessly in reaching out to the victims of domestic violence and the Minister of State recognised their wonderful work. They need more State support to carry out that work.</P>
    <P>Women are the primary victims of domestic violence, although it is not exclusively a women's issue. Domestic violence touches the lives of a small percentage of men also, who were affected by 9% of incidents in 2002, and it is important to be mindful of that aspect. Nevertheless, this is primarily but not exclusively a women's issue.</P>
    <P>Sadly, all too many children have been traumatised by and experienced the revulsion of domestic violence. A recent campaign on television highlighted the lasting impact incidents such as this can have on children, capturing that impact very well in the phrase &ldquo;Every childhood lasts a lifetime&rdquo;. It is clear that domestic violence is an issue that can touch the lives of women, men and children in a lasting and damaging way.</P>
    <P>The most recent Garda annual report reveals that fewer than one in ten incidents of domestic violence resulted in a conviction in 2002. There were 651 convictions for domestic violence in 2002 compared to 1,286 in 2001. That is a drop of 49%, with the level of convictions being halved despite a rise in the number of reported incidents, up from 9,983 in 2001 to 10,248 in 2002. Is the incidence of domestic violence in terminal decline or is it more likely that it is as prevalent as before but is not being reported? Irish crime statistics make up only half the picture, with a high level of unreported crime appearing to have become the norm. A conviction rate of one in ten will do nothing to encourage vulnerable women to report these crimes. If women do not see it as being worth their while to take cases to court, why should they put themselves through the trauma of a court case?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has told us that he wants garda&iacute; to be <Col N="216"/>equipped with video cameras to film people coming out of pubs drunk. He would be doing society a much greater service if he were to equip the garda&iacute; with cameras to take to the scene of domestic violence crimes, as is the case in England. This would enable them to record injuries and gather evidence at that early stage. Very often women who report domestic violence crimes subsequently withdraw their statements under pressure from the offenders. Some studies have put the level of retraction as high as 46%. The use of cameras would mean that even where the complainant retracts a statement, the prosecution would have substantial evidence with which to proceed.</P>
    <P>Domestic violence is a sensitive and difficult issue that needs to be treated in a very particular way and, by and large, the handling of domestic violence cases by the Judiciary is excellent. The Judicial Studies Institute was established by the Chief Justice as a body to train the Judiciary. However, it is only a starting point. What is needed is formal structured training on specific issues, such as domestic violence, and the Judicial Studies Institute does not appear to be fulfilling this need in its current form. If judges were given specialised training in domestic violence and the issues associated with it, they would have a greater understanding of the context, victim's fears and of the necessary penalty or rehabilitation suitable for the offender. All professionals in the area would benefit from the provision of specialised training and I hope the Minister will take this point on board.</P>
    <P>The legal aid system has done a great service for many people. Its staff deserve credit for their commitment. However, to a great extent, their hands are tied by the Department of Finance which holds the purse strings. Within the legal aid system, domestic violence cases are given a certain level of priority. The allocation of priority is an effective remedy where few require it &mdash; but there are so many domestic violence cases that the allocation of priority has become meaningless. Legal aid sources admit off the record that the system is in chaos. The present state of the legal aid system epitomises the attitude of the Government to the vulnerable in society. The Progressive Democrats drive behind the Government does not care about the needy and vulnerable and makes no apologies for that.</P>
    <P>We must do all we can to ensure that the needs of women, who are already in a vulnerable position because of poverty, disability, immigration status and ethnicity, can have confidence in the system that will help them escape situations of domestic violence. We must do all we can to ensure that women do not suffer at the hands of offenders and that crimes are reported at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>The private practitioners scheme, established by the Legal Aid Board in 1993, was a model of efficiency and provided a great deal of help to victims of domestic violence. It comprised a panel of 30 private solicitors who were available to the <Col N="217"/>victims of domestic violence. However, as with all matters beneficial to the public, the Government terminated the service in November 2003.</P>
    <P>The growing waiting lists for legal aid are a cause for concern. In Dublin, for example, the waiting time in the North Brunswick Street branch is eight months, it is seven months in Finglas and almost 12 months in Gardiner Street. This is in stark contrast to the position in regard to criminal legal aid, where no such delays exist; in such cases legal aid is available immediately.</P>
    <P>The delays victims of domestic violence experience in procuring legal aid is far more serious than simply a matter of inconvenience. The unavailability of legal aid puts the safety of women at risk. When cases come before the courts, women are often forced to ask judges to adjourn cases until a solicitor becomes available or, in more desperate situations, the victim may have no option but to represent herself.</P>
    <P>Access to justice is a fundamental right and, as such, is enshrined in Article 40 of the Constitution. It is also a central feature of the European Convention on Human Rights that was incorporated into Irish law last December. It is clear that citizens are being denied fundamental rights and that it will take a court challenge before the Government will discharge its obligations in this regard. This gives rise to serious concerns and leads one to question the Government's commitment to dealing with the issue. I call on the Government to reinstate the private practitioners scheme as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The contribution of voluntary organisations, which are on the front line in reaching out to victims of domestic violence, cannot be overstated. However, if they are to be in a position to continue to fulfil this vital role, the least they need is adequate funding. Funding for Women's Aid remains at the 2002 level, despite a 12% increase in calls received. Taking inflationary factors into account, this marks an actual decrease in funding, year on year. The picture is a bleak one to which the Government needs to wake up.</P>
    <P>Custody and access rights to children are inextricably linked to domestic violence. Women's Aid published a detailed and comprehensive report on this matter last December and the Minister's time would be well spent in reading it. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, acknowledged receipt of the report and said he would take it into account in bringing forward legislation on the matter. I hope the Minister brings forward such a Bill as quickly as possible. Actions speak louder than words.</P>
    <P>The report found that women and children are victimised by abusive men who use their court-conferred access rights to inflict more hurt and pain. We need to look at the issue of domestic violence in the context of access and custody rights. Evidence also suggests that men who are violent in the home are rarely denied access to <Col N="218"/>their children, even where barring orders have been issued against them.</P>
    <P>Among other issues, the report highlighted areas where the system is deficient. For example, no link exists between the criminal and civil system in determining custody and access in the context of domestic violence. The probation and welfare system is not consulted. A basic exchange of information is lacking. A multi-dimensional approach is required on domestic violence in order that associated issues can also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The report calls on the Minister to establish a legal working group to examine the issue of child custody and access, specifically in the context of domestic violence. I support this call and urge the Minister to give a commitment to the House that he will implement this recommendation.</P>
    <P>If we are to tackle the incidence of domestic violence, it is imperative that we have the full picture. It is not good enough to merely be concerned about reported cases. We must delve deeper and examine the reasons cases go unreported. One reason is the inadequate remedies and protections available to women and the courts have a role to play in this regard. Only one in ten cases results in a conviction. What kind of signal does this send to the victims of domestic violence? The abuser has a 90% chance of getting off scot free.</P>
    <P>A leading expert in family law matters, Michael Freeman, once described the remedies available for domestic violence as being &ldquo;of little more value than sticking plaster is to a broken leg&rdquo;. That adage is equally applicable in Ireland today. The Government has not developed any reasoned plan for stemming the incidence of domestic violence, nor does it have a coherent plan for dealing effectively with its consequences. No attempt has been made to tackle the causes of domestic violence. The Government's approach to dealing with this issue has been purely reactionary. Tackling the symptoms is just a sticking plaster approach. We need to delve deeper and deal with the roots of the problem.</P>
    <P>In highlighting the need to tackle the causes of domestic violence, I acknowledge the heavy reliance we, as a society, place on our legal system. The enactment of the Domestic Violence Act 1996 went a long way towards improving the protections available for victims of domestic violence. However, the Minister has two recent reports available to him which highlight the need for the law to be improved. Under present legislation, remedies are only available to particular parties. A couple with a child who do not reside together are not eligible for protection. This is just one example of the flaws in the existing system. In December 2002, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, gave a commitment to the D&aacute;il that he would bring forward a family law reform Bill within a year. I ask the Minister of State to live by this promise and not break it again.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate the Leader for adding this important issue to the cl&aacute;r. While I do not recall this issue being discussed in the House in the past, it is an issue that will occupy significant debate time in the future.</P>
    <P>I compliment the voluntary organisations working at the coalface in this area. The helping hand they give to the unfortunate people who suffer from domestic violence is unquantifiable in terms of benefit and assistance. Unfortunately, the work is done in a vacuum and is carried out on a basic needs level rather than a co-ordinated effort, for which there are probably a number of reasons. Those of us who have not experienced domestic violence or do not know anyone who has, can only begin to imagine how difficult and lonely a place it must be. Since 1996, 81 women have been murdered in this State, of whom 53 were murdered in their own homes. Research in this area has found that one in five Irish women has reported experiencing mental, physical or sexual abuse from either current or previous partners.</P>
    <P>One can only begin to understand how difficult it is for women to leave a violent relationship. Research tells us that on leaving a relationship, a woman is in more danger than if she had stayed in it. It is imperative that we ensure all the necessary support, help and assistance is available in the event of taking the onerous decision &mdash; even though it should not be &mdash; of leaving a violent relationship. Victims often leave their family homes with nothing but the clothes on their backs and their children, if there are children involved. This must be a devastating physical and emotional process. As well as leaving the home, they also have the apprehension of reprisal from the partner they are leaving, the emotional distress as to what they are going to do with the rest of their lives and worries about the future for any children involved. We know that mothers will always protect their children, even putting a child's safety ahead of their own.</P>
    <P>There is no question that refuge centres do a great job. While such centres provide some assistance, this is a short-term rather than long-term solution. We are told that 22% of homeless households cite domestic violence as the reason for the homelessness. Of those households, 97% were headed by a female. These are outlandish statistics and must command our attention. It must be disconcerting for people not to be able to move home and to have to stay longer in a refuge centre than they would otherwise want to owing to a lack of alternative accommodation. This must be particularly disconcerting for school going children. Children's playgrounds can be cruel places and children can be unintentionally cruel. Comments can be passed about the absence of fathers. This must be devastating for the self-esteem and self worth of children and may have an everlasting effect on a child unless he or she receives early counselling or other necessary benefits.</P><Col N="220"/>
    <P>These households end up in overpriced accommodation in many cases. I worked and served in Dublin Corporation for more than 16 years. I recall the difficulty we had in trying to house people who found themselves in these unfortunate circumstances and the waiting time ranged from six months to two years. A report showed that 88% of women interviewed stated the reason for staying in a bad relationship was that they had nowhere else to go. Two out of three women who sought refuge were<?_jy?>refused. Only 609 of 1,800 applicants were accommodated. This is a staggering statistic and we must pay serious attention to it. I can only imagine the mindset of women, particularly those with children, who find themselves in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Domestic violence, rape and sexual assault are heinous crimes; this can never be said loudly enough or often enough. The crimes can happen to people of any age or gender and can impact on any family. Not alone do they impact on the individual against whom the crime is perpetrated, they also impact on their families. Children view the family home as a place of love and security and when the violence occurs therein, the impact is more dreadful. In 80% of the recorded domestic violence incidents, the child is either in the room or next door. <i>Making an Impact</i> is a book that discusses the impact of domestic violence on children. It states that children have difficulty in adjusting to particular circumstances; they become withdrawn, secretive and silent, are bitter and have self-blame in some instances. They also run away, have difficulties in school and are emotionally confused about their parents. Such children also suffer from sleep disturbances, have trouble eating, inflict self-harm and are affected by sadness and depression. There is a litany of problems. When one looks at the problems domestic violence causes, one realises that it must be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>I am certain everyone in this Chamber knows someone who has suffered at the hands of a violent partner. There is a horrible silence associated with this. I imagine most women are too terrified, and in some instances too ashamed, to report this. We are told that, on average, a woman will be assaulted 35 times before she tells anybody. Strong protections are now in place for women who suffer abuse; perhaps there are not enough protections. Current laws and Government policy recognise that women are entitled to the full protection of the law in this regard. The Domestic Violence (Amendment) Act 2002 amended the 1996 Act that had been found unconstitutional, owing to the interim barring order <i>ex parte</i> element. The Government, with assistance from the Opposition, moved swiftly to deal with this. This is an indication of how the Government, and politicians in general, feel about this issue; we try to deal with it swiftly and with as many resources as possible.</P>
    <P>When he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue posed a <Col N="221"/>question that struck a chord with me. He wondered what the response would be if the media carried a story that a new risk had been discovered that would affect 10% of the population, a large number of those affected would be hospitalised, some of those affected would die while others would suffer for the rest of their lives and children would be seriously affected in many cases. He also asked what would be the response a year later if nothing was done about it. It amazes me that this issue has not been debated much more. There would and should be a public outcry about it. Statistics relate that between 10% and 20% of families are affected by domestic violence. The risk to which Deputy O'Donoghue referred is already with us, yet when one watches &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; or listens to any debate, one will seldom hear domestic violence being discussed but will hear other less important issues being raised. As someone who grew up in the country, I wonder how much unreported domestic violence crime occurred. I cannot imagine in a million years that my mother would go out and tell the public at large that my father was beating her up. Family pride and the shame that would bring on the family would be such that it could not happen. I wonder how many wives took such pain to the grave. Each member of the family would be equally shamed. One would probably hear the old-fashioned statement that was the order of the day in times past, that she must have done something to deserve it. The situation has changed and people are now not prepared to put up with the nonsense they put up with years ago.</P>
    <P>We need to create an environment that makes it easier for people affected by this crime to come out and state it loudly and clearly, with the knowledge that protections are there for them. They need to know that if they report such a crime that they will be looked after effectively. We need to ensure that education and awareness programmes highlight the many forms that this horrible crime may take. It may be sexual, psychological or physical, or even a combination of all three. Sometimes I think the name &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo; given to this crime is inadequate because it should be seen for what it is, a cowardly vicious attack on people.</P>
    <P>Research shows that it is based on the abuse of power and those who perpetrate it generally carry out the depravity on someone who is <?_jy?>weaker because basically he is a coward. We in the public arena should no longer be prepared to tolerate it. We must speak out and act. A survey carried out in Ireland indicates that 97% of people know about the issue of violence and 80% of those interviewed actually believed it was commonplace. With such numbers, one wonders why the public at large is not creating hell about what is being done about it.</P>
    <P>This violence must stop. It is a fundamental violation of a person's human rights and dignity. It is also a violation of the right to liberty, security and personal mental and physical integrity. As <Col N="222"/>the Minister stated, a number of initiatives have been put in place by the Government and resources have been increased from &euro;3.8 million to more than &euro;12 million. Last year Ms Emily Rogan was appointed as Ombudsman for Children and information officers were appointed to the various health boards. We must act as a community and stand up and say that domestic violence is no longer acceptable or tolerated in this country. When people come forward to explain the case, we must believe her and do all in our power to assist her to live a free and fearless life. Domestic violence is not just a family matter; it is a matter for all of us and we in this House have a responsibility to do all in our power to deal with it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and I am glad that he recognises the work being done by Women's Aid, the National Network of Refuges and the National Women's Council for women who experience domestic violence. I welcome the presence of members of some of these organisations in the Visitors Gallery. I thank Women's Aid for the excellent briefing document for this debate.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Minister will introduce the Civil Liability and Courts Bill within the week. I ask the Minister to present it in this House and the same Members will deal with it in no time. This is a most important Bill. For far too long, the public, and indeed all of us, have not understood the seriousness of the cases that come before the family law courts. Such cases are held <i>in camera</i> and the previous Attorney General interpreted the <i>in camera </i>rule very strictly. The barrister who had been appointed to report on the family law courts was unable to do so. It is essential that this legislation is debated in the House as rapidly as possible so that, with the permission of the family and on an anonymous basis, we can get some idea of the seriousness of the cases that come before the family courts. I look forward to that legislation being published next week. Senator Terry referred to the Minister's statement in the D&aacute;il in December 2002 that a Domestic Violence Bill would be published within a year. It is a little more than a year so perhaps that very important Bill could be introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There is a better understanding among the Judiciary of family disputes and the serious effects of violence, physically, mentally and emotionally on women and on children, as Senator Kett pointed out so effectively. The days are gone when a judge advised a man who had been beating his wife to go out with her to dinner and, after a couple of good steaks, a bottle of wine and a few roses, it would all be settled. What an innocent sort of life the man was leading. The courts have a much better idea of life as it is lived. On the other hand, the District Court badly needs resources for back-up staff for the Judiciary. What has happened since the members of the probationary and welfare service withdrew from <Col N="223"/>the family law courts due to the fact they had so much work in other areas? Judges do not have the benefit of reports from them and we are also aware of the shortage of clinical psychologists as matters stand.</P>
    <P>Judges have to operate in a most appalling vacuum without a proper idea of the problems in these cases, aside from concern about the solutions. For example, refuges are packed all the time, so we desperately need more temporary accommodation around the country. County councils and corporations do not seem to have a policy on what they should do with people who have to leave their homes. Once a person is homeless, she is supposed to be rehoused. This appears to be a particularly serious problem for women from rural areas. When women who have been seriously injured are asked why they did not leave their homes, the answer in the majority of cases is that they had nowhere to go. They are frequently financially dependent on the person beating or abusing them.</P>
    <P>At present there is a campaign that violence is gender neutral and that violence against men by women is as prevalent as violence against women by men. I think that is not true and this is borne out in international surveys. The larger person is in a better position and usually the man is bigger than the woman. We must take account of the fact that not only male-female violence exists but that the elderly and people who are vulnerable because of mental or physical weakness experience considerable violence. These people should not be forgotten. My colleague, Dr. Margo Wrigley, wrote about violence against the elderly, particularly if they had a psychiatric illness such as Alzheimer's disease. It can be very difficult dealing with such people and carers may become abusive.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to read reports in British newspapers about the suggestion that Professor Stephen Hawking's wife has been abusing him for many years. As Members will know, the distinguished physicist has suffered from motor neurone disease for approximately 40 years. He has been admitted repeatedly to hospital with injuries as serious as a broken wrist, yet he persists in saying that he is not being injured by anyone, despite the fact that his nurses and other carers have stated that he is. It is a very difficult situation when a person who is frequently being abused denies it because of his or her dependence on the abuser.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with such cases has already been mentioned and it is a difficult situation for its members. As Senator Terry pointed out, the garda&iacute; frequently take statements arising from a dramatic incident in a house. I like the Senator's suggestion that the Garda should have cameras for such work but such evidence might not be admissible in court. The Danish equivalent of our health boards can act in cases where they believe a serious issue has arisen. Perhaps we should <Col N="224"/>consider doing that in the same way as when we consider that children are being sexually abused.</P>
    <P>In 1996, when the House debated the Domestic Violence Bill, I suggested the creation of a Garda surveillance team to supervise people who had engaged in domestic violence, if the woman involved was not going to press charges. It would have operated somewhat like the juvenile liaison scheme but I gather that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not too enthusiastic about the idea and felt it should be done by the probation and welfare service. We have an extraordinarily limited number of people working in the probation service who could become involved in such a scheme. However, there should be some method of surveillance. The juvenile liaison scheme has worked very well and I wish something similar could happen with regard to domestic violence, even if it has to be done through the probation service, which should be expanded.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention the role of the medical profession, as well as nurses and social workers, which is important in these situations. Surveys have been carried out in accident and emergency units and in general practice, which show that a considerable number of women report with injuries but do not admit they were due to domestic violence. Some years ago, for example, Dr. Cheasty did a survey in the accident and emergency unit in James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown. The survey found that women who presented with injuries the hospital staff felt might be due to domestic violence, were more likely to admit who had inflicted their injuries if they could discuss the matter privately with a female doctor or nurse. It was worrying that some women who had serious injuries had waited as long as a week before coming to the accident and emergency department. Those responsible for inflicting the injuries were not always husbands or partners, but sons also. Age, class and pregnancy did not seem to be deterrents.</P>
    <P>The late Dr. Fiona Bradley, together with her colleagues Mary Smith, Jean Long, and Tom O'Dowd, professor of general medical practice in Trinity College, carried out a survey on the frequency of domestic violence in women attending general practice. They interviewed a total of 1,871 women. Of 1,692 of these women who had ever had a sexual relationship, 39% had experienced violent behaviour by a partner. Some 46% of the women had been injured, of whom 12% reported that their doctor had asked about domestic violence. Some 77% were in favour of routine inquiry into domestic violence by their usual general practitioner. Some 69% reported controlling behaviour by their partner, while 28% reported feeling afraid of their previous or current partners. The average age of the women was 36.6 years. Their injuries were sometimes quite serious: 22% had cuts or bruises to the face; 10% had cuts on the body; 30% had bruises on the body; 2% had burns on the body; 2% had a broken arm, leg or ribs; 3.6% had experienced a <Col N="225"/>miscarriage; black eye 15%; lost or broken tooth 8%; sickness or vomiting 15%; bleeding on face, body or limbs 10%; broken jaw, nose or cheekbone 3%; and burst eardrums 2.5%. These are really serious injuries and they were the ones coming to general practice.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that a high percentage of people felt doctors should ask how people had sustained their injuries. I am sure that if the Minister asked the Irish College of General Practitioners to make the treatment of victims of domestic violence a priority in its training programmes it would do so. The college already undertakes such training but its importance should be stressed by the Minister. He could also write to accident and emergency departments asking them to take note of our concerns about women not reporting the true reasons for their injuries.</P>
    <P>The perpetrators of domestic violence must be considered, as well. The organisation, Men Overcoming Violence, is apparently doing very good work in trying to change people's attitude towards women, which is one of the main reasons some people feel they can beat up another human being. I was speaking on this issue at a meeting where there were some people in the audience from other countries, including refugees. A doctor who had lived in Afghanistan was sharing the platform with me. When a girl aged about 12 in the audience asked why men beat women, the Afghan doctor, who had just escaped from the Taliban, replied it was due to religion. It was a very depressing answer.</P>
    <P>While there are different cultural attitudes, we should explain that no domestic violence can be tolerated here. This is the case even if women are considered by other members of their family not to be following, as strictly as they should, the religious and cultural practices of the country from which they have come. Extra protection may be needed in such cases.</P>
    <P>I support all those who said that legal aid must be restored for cases involving domestic violence. Coming from Cork myself, I am delighted to see that a Cork woman has taken the initiative in this respect because she had been denied legal aid for so long in seeking financial assistance from her husband. She has now taken the case to the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Women's Aid on its work and I hope the promised legislation will come before the House as rapidly as possible. I also hope extra finance will be given so that women's refuges will have the necessary resources.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KateWalsh"><NameTxt>Ms K. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to welcome our guests in the Gallery. In any discussion concerning domestic abuse, one of the first issues to be mindful of is that domestic violence knows no class. It is not confined to any one socio-economic group and is as likely to happen in Dublin as in any other part of the country. Educated, literate, wealthy women are just as likely to be victims of domestic abuse as the most <Col N="226"/>socially deprived and economically vulnerable in our society.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o'clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Any discussion on domestic violence or possible courses of action must always be guided by the knowledge that domestic violence is a classless crime perpetrated on females. I use the word &ldquo;females&rdquo; deliberately because domestic violence is predominantly suffered by women. It happens in working class homes, middle class suburbia and among the rich.</P>
    <P>Another important point is that domestic violence is widespread in Ireland. Associations working on the ground, such as Women's Aid, estimate that one in five Irish women will experience abusive behaviour from a partner at some stage in her life. I came across this incredible statistic while preparing for this debate and I had to read it again and again because it is so difficult to believe that one fifth or 20% of the female population will experience abuse. On a personal level, this means that every person in this Chamber knows someone who has been a victim of domestic violence. They may not have told us about it, we may not be aware of it and would be very shocked to hear of it, but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>This leads to another important element of the problem &mdash; the silence that surrounds domestic abuse. Much domestic violence stays underground. Many victims keep quiet, suffer the abuse and do not take action. Many women who suffer abuse are afraid to seek help for a number of reasons. First and foremost, they are afraid of encouraging another bout of violence. Many of them believe that the violence is their own fault or that they did something to encourage it. It is almost as if they deserved it. They feel that to report it to the Garda would only result in another beating.</P>
    <P>The stigma associated with domestic abuse encourages this shroud of silence. Some victims are afraid to seek help for fear that they will be ridiculed by society, pitied or scorned. This is the reason awareness is so important and the reason we must engage in public debate on the matter. We must constantly reinforce the message that it is the abuser and not the victim who is to blame. We must ensure that when victims seek help, they are treated with respect and sympathy, given adequate and appropriate protection, their case is dealt with quickly and efficiently and any children involved are given all the support and help necessary to rebuild their lives. Some victims are reluctant to come forward because they lack faith in the help on offer, whether from the Garda, the courts or social services. We must ensure that all the necessary support is available and that victims know that help is available.</P>
    <P>Leaving an abusive relationship is even more difficult for women who have children. They have fears regarding financial security or the status of the family home. In some cases, despite the abuse, the children have a good bond with their father and the mothers are reluctant to disrupt <Col N="227"/>this, even if it means they must continue to suffer abuse.</P>
    <P>The reluctance of many victims to seek help or go public and the completely misguided notion that domestic abuse only happens to a certain class of woman mean domestic violence does not feature as regularly in the media as it should. It is not always in the headlines. One is more likely to read about outbreaks of flu or bad weather than about a woman suffering abuse in her home. Aside from a few high profile cases or when the abuse goes as far as murder, much domestic violence goes unreported in the press. In a sort of vicious cycle, this lack of publicity encourages the sense of stigma and shame which makes victims reluctant to report abuse.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we continue to make domestic violence an issue. We must continue to create awareness of it and to remind society of its terrible existence. It must remain in the headlines. Abuse and violence must not be mistakenly termed &ldquo;domestic incidents&rdquo; by the media and abusers must not be allowed to explain away their behaviour by pointing to stress, drink or moments of madness.</P>
    <P>The current &ldquo;Unmask the Abuser&rdquo; advertisement campaign which features on bus shelters, in newspapers and on billboards is important. It reminds people of the horror of domestic violence and keeps the issue to the fore. It also reminds people of the classless nature of the abuse and that abusers come from all walks of life.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency to see domestic violence as a lesser crime. Abusers often express regret immediately after the abuse, show remorse and seek forgiveness. However, regret does not lessen the crime. Domestic violence is a crime and must always be regarded and treated as such. Some 92 women were murdered in Ireland over an eight year period and all of these murders were committed by men. Of the 92 women killed, 62 were murdered in their homes. Of the 55 cases that went to court, 40% of those convicted of the murder were the woman's partner, spouse or ex partner. The best way to deal with domestic violence in Ireland is through prevention. We must stop it happening rather than try to deal with the consequences. Cases will always occur, but efforts and resources must be focused on treating the root causes through early intervention.</P>
    <P>Young people in our schools must be educated about domestic violence. Does every school going child know the all important one in five figure? Do they know that violence is always wrong or that abuse is not necessarily physical, but can also be verbal, emotional or sexual? Parents and teachers must take responsibility for getting this message across. Any sign of bullying behaviour by a child must be immediately tackled.</P>
    <P>Early intervention is essential. Women must be encouraged to report, seek help and take action. They must be made to feel that they will be <Col N="228"/>listened to, that there is help and support available and that they will be dealt with sympathetically and fairly by the courts. It is essential that garda&iacute; are given specific training to deal with domestic violence cases and that health care workers are ready to spot the signs. Women who make the first step, be it a telephone call to a helpline, a call to the Garda or telling a family member or friend, should be given every possible support and advice. They must be made aware that there is a better option than staying with an abusive partner. Fears about financial difficulties, alternative accommodation, custody of children or the family home must be allayed. The criminal justice system must be made to appear fair.</P>
    <P>We must do away completely with the &ldquo;brushing under the carpet&rdquo; syndrome. While Irish society has come a long way from our shameful treatment of abuse victims in the past, there is still a degree of looking away when it comes to domestic violence. This brings us back to the issue of awareness. The more we keep the issue to the fore, the less chance there is of cases of abuse being swept under the carpet by society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's launch of the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency on a pilot basis. It aims at preventing domestic violence by integrating the work of the criminal justice system with that of victim support agencies. Based in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Bray District Court areas, the agency will oversee a pilot programme aimed at increasing the safety of victims of domestic violence, making perpetrators more accountable and reducing the rate of<?_jy?>repeat violence. The programme includes an intervention programme for the perpetrators of domestic violence which is modelled on the Cork domestic violence project. Two thirds of those who completed this programme changed their abusive ways. Perpetrators of domestic violence are referred to this programme by the District Courts in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Bray, following a prosecution by garda&iacute;. Their progress is monitored by the probation and welfare service and overseen by the courts. Failure to comply with a court order to participate in such a programme results in other sanctions, including prison.</P>
    <P>The new agency will focus on both the victim and the perpetrator and will co-ordinate the work of the support services. It will, therefore, reduce the necessity for the victim to approach a number of different agencies. Ms Denise Charleton, director of Women's Aid, has said that women often withdraw complaints from fear but that studies have shown that if women are supported through the legal process they stay with it.</P>
    <P>The approach of the NDVIA is based on a US model which has been extensively used elsewhere. Where it has been introduced, the model has been found to reduce the number of domestic violence murders by at least half and sometimes more. The programme brings the perpetrator into the judicial system and offers a graded level of sanctions including the <Col N="229"/>perpetrator intervention programme which reports to the court regularly. I would like to see this programme, which was launched last year, extended and continued when the pilot stage is completed in May.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue in the Chamber. Any opportunity to highlight the issue of domestic abuse is important as we can only hope to tackle the problem by increasing awareness.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this very important debate. I acknowledge the co-operation of the Leader of the House and the Minister who has come to the House for this debate at my request. I also acknowledge the support of all Members. I have been asked to have this debate to ensure that legislators in the Seanad continue to be aware of and speak about this important and urgent matter. If we do not hear about domestic violence, it does not mean it has gone away. As other speakers have pointed out, the opposite appears to be the case. Domestic violence against women is a serious issue in our community. While assaults on individuals on the streets are reported and written about in newspapers, we do not hear as much about the equally serious assaults on women which take place behind their front doors. Until we, as a community, take full responsibility for this particular behaviour by a number of our members, we cannot hope to advance a solution.</P>
    <P>We should not speak about domestic violence as somebody else's problem or as just the problem of the women affected. It is everyone's problem because it comes out of the community. It does not just happen. It is indicative of particular kinds of attitude, culture and tolerance. Somehow our thinking is that it is up to the women themselves to get their acts together and to get out. We ask why someone would put up with a situation in which a man was beating her up, particularly where she had children. Of course, that attitude fails to recognise the reality of the life of a woman faced with domestic violence who lives in an atmosphere of fear and abuse. Fear grips a person and prevents him or her from acting. It runs a person's life. Fear of violence, abuse or the potential involvement of children can, unsurprisingly, prevent a person from acting. For that reason, we must send out the very strong message to women in such circumstances that they are not alone.</P>
    <P>If they have the courage to move out and take action, the necessary resources and services must be in place. There must be people there for these women to help them get on their feet and to protect them. Those resources must include a legal framework and the Garda as well as safe, secure refuges and advice centres for women. They must be provided, if necessary, with the resources to obtain barring orders. We must ask ourselves if we are supplying these resources.</P>
    <P>Are we sending the message loudly and clearly to women that what is happening to them is not acceptable in our society? I am not sure we are. <Col N="230"/>We must ask ourselves if we take the attitude that there is somehow a distinction to be made between a domestic and a non-domestic assault. Certainly, that seems to be the case in the media. There have been a few incidents in which women have come to me in circumstances of severe abuse in their homes. The vast majority of garda&iacute; one meets in this regard are totally supportive and wish to do everything they can, but on occasion one hears from them complaints that while a woman might make a statement now, she will change her mind tomorrow and go back to the man in question the following week. They ask if one is sure the woman will go forward with the case. The attitude is that somehow a domestic assault is not the same as a criminal assault. Assault is assault and violence is always unacceptable and intolerable. We must declare zero tolerance of domestic violence once and for all. As a society, we must stop saying this is someone else's problem and acknowledge that it is everybody's responsibility.</P>
    <P>In particular, we must insist that the supports women and families need to break the cycle of violence are put in place where and when they are required, and not next month or in ten years but now. As other speakers have pointed out, the cuts in the civil legal aid scheme are very disappointing and are having a very serious and deleterious effect. We must ensure that the legal resources are available to women in these circumstances. The schemes which have worked in the past, including the private practitioner scheme, must not be allowed to disappear. The funding which was made available through the Legal Aid Board to locate a family law solicitor in the Family Court building in Dublin meant that women could access legal aid on the spot. They could make an appointment for a legal aid application on the same day as their application for a barring order in the same building. That hugely beneficial facility unfortunately no longer exists due to funding cuts.</P>
    <P>I recall attending court with a woman who wished to obtain a barring order. She needed moral support but she was afraid to ask anybody in her family to come with her as she did not feel there was anybody she could particularly rely on or trust. It is a harrowing and difficult experience. The atmosphere is not very supportive and I found it quite difficult myself to negotiate the system. For somebody who lives in fear and for whom it has taken all her courage to attend the court on the day, the atmosphere is not particularly supportive. Clearly, we are not doing enough.</P>
    <P>We are not doing enough about our attitudes either. The media reflects the attitudes of society at large and I was quite disturbed at a number of articles I read in recent weeks and months. They concerned what was described as the &ldquo;letting off&rdquo; of women for the manslaughter of their partners in circumstances of domestic violence. The explicit message of these articles was that women were somehow being treated leniently and <Col N="231"/>receiving an easier day in court than men would in similar circumstances. I hope that would never be the case. However, I was very disturbed by the message that women were receiving special treatment. I do not for one minute advocate returning violence in a violent situation, but we cannot imagine what it is like to be abused and assaulted and to have one's children put in danger. I am concerned that the messages coming from the media do not create an atmosphere in which the wider community will take full responsibility for this problem.</P>
    <P>Many good projects are in place around the country. The issues which lead to violence in the home, violent relationships and a violent family should be examined. One would have huge concerns for children in those homes. When children see their mother being abused, unfortunately a learning situation is caused which undoubtedly leads to difficulties. It is not a normal situation and it must cause children to be angry, fearful and have issues they need to resolve in the future. Supports should be put in place for children in those situations.</P>
    <P>There are projects in my health board area aimed at helping men to overcome violence. Violence cannot be seen as a normal way of expressing one's feelings or emotions. The question of why violence occurs must be raised rather than a purely legal response which is obviously very important in terms of how society views the crime. It is important that resources are put into examining ways of helping men to come to terms with their anger so that they can deal with their violent tendencies.</P>
    <P>Wider society must question the reason men believe it is acceptable to beat a woman. We all live in communities where we know that some women are in difficulty. What would men say to a man whom they know is violent towards women? Would they say violence is unacceptable and intolerable or would they say nothing, ignore it and hope it goes away and never arrives on their doorstep where they would have to deal with it? Do we tolerate violence and do nothing about it? These are the questions that must be asked.</P>
    <P>Very important points have been raised in the debate. I hope the Minister will take notice that there is a significant need for more resources such as refuges to deal with the immediate effects on and needs of women in situations of domestic violence. In some cases women may have to travel more than 50 or 60 miles to reach a refuge. This raises the issue of children being taken out of their own community and school environment. Resources should be available to ensure that refuge places are relatively easily accessible so that if women have the courage to leave home the message from society is that their situation is not normal or acceptable and that resources are available in refuges to help them deal with a major issue. They must be helped to deal with a major problem in their lives to ensure their children can grow up in a peaceful, normal family <Col N="232"/>environment. The crime of violence against them should not be tolerated and should be addressed to the fullest extent.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in welcoming the Minister of State and I welcome representatives of Women's Aid and the national network of women's refuges. I commend them on their excellent work, which is achieved with very limited resources. I welcome the opportunity to speak about the need for continuing awareness and action to improve services for victims of domestic violence. Violence perpetrated against any person in a domestic environment is an urgent criminal and public health problem with devastating consequences for women, children and families. Domestic violence is the intentional and persistent physical, emotional and psychological abuse of anyone in the home in a way that causes pain, distress or injury. It is imperative that Members work together in a constructive and proactive manner to seek remedies to this pressing matter.</P>
    <P>Although there are no typical victims of domestic abuse, abusive relationships share similar characteristics. In all cases, the abuser aims to have power and control over his victim. Domestic violence is not about anger but is more about trying to instil fear and a desire to exercise power and control over the relationship. This fear festers into inhibition about looking for help and advice from support services designed for victims of domestic abuse. We must therefore devise a system which is accessible to and protective of those who need it. This responsibility rests on all our shoulders; as citizens and as legislators, we must protect the most vulnerable members of our society.</P>
    <P>The effects of abuse stretch past the abused. Young people are affected not only by directly witnessing abuse but also living in an environment where someone &mdash; usually the main caregiver &mdash; is being repeatedly victimised. Young people in a home where someone is being abused are at a greater risk of being abused themselves or being used to control either of their parents. Abusers who use children as pawns will accuse their target of being a bad parent and threaten to take their children away, use children to relay messages and threaten to report the abused to children's protective services. Due to their own lack of self-worth, the abusive partner feels the need to control those to whom they consider themselves to be superior. Unfortunately, in a family this includes children.</P>
    <P>Domestic abuse is part of a repetitive pattern which is very difficult to break and we must endeavour to make breaking this pattern easier. The pattern includes striking the injured party using words or actions, begging forgiveness, offering gifts or promising to change, becoming tense, angry or depressed and repeating their abusive behaviour following an undertaking to stop.</P><Col N="233"/>
    <P>The abuse worsens each time it occurs and the cycle shortens. Breaking this pattern of violence alone and without help, is difficult. People living in an environment of chaos, stress and fear, doubts themselves and their ability to take care of themselves. Abuse can unravel their sense of reality and self-esteem. We must raise awareness that the abused may not be in a position to resolve the situation on their own and that it is permissible for them to seek outside help. As legislators, we must adopt a proactive approach to show that without help and appropriate support structures, the abuse will most likely continue. Leaving the abusive relationship may be the only way to break the cycle.</P>
    <P>In seeking to address the plight of those who are subjected to this repetitive abuse, we must be aware of the large numbers of women affected by domestic violence. National research indicates that almost one in five women has borne the brunt of violent outbursts. Women's Aid received more than 11,000 calls in 2002 and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre received approximately the same volume. Worrying trends demonstrate that there is an annual increase of 12.5% in calls recorded by the help lines. This signifies that domestic violence is out of control in Ireland. We must address this problem at its root. We must combat the social and personality problems which cause a person to inflict domestic abuse but it is imperative that we address the issues of awareness and actions required to improve services for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>We must examine ways to deal legislatively with the issue and look at this problem from a different perspective. Domestic violence comes in different forms and we must ensure that all of them are seen as completely unacceptable. Domestic violence is not just violence committed by a man against a women; it can be inflicted by a woman against a man, by children against their parents or by parents against a child. We must ensure that the first point of contact to which the abused turns, normally their GP, recognises the signs and symptoms of domestic abuse, no matter what form it takes. I suggest that clear policies be established for health practitioners to deal with the victims of domestic violence. Very few health agencies have written protocols on domestic violence, although people experiencing violence tend to be over-represented in GPs' surgeries, accident and emergency departments and mental health services. It is vital to ensure that hospitals, nurses and family doctors are taking advantage of their unique position to identify those who are experiencing abuse, and that they intervene to support and protect them. I propose that hospitals establish working parties to enable staff to be trained and informed about the issues surrounding domestic violence. We should encourage hospitals to keep records of accidental injuries if necessary so that they may be used in subsequent court cases.</P>
    <P>Proper resources should be in place for the victims of domestic abuse if we are to support and <Col N="234"/>protect them. Initiatives such as emergency safe accommodation, support and outreach services and supported transitional housing are crucial. Research shows that the biggest reason women do not leave their violent partners is that they have nowhere to go. This is due to a number of factors including astronomic rent and house prices. Such costs inhibit people from moving away from abusers. If victims decide to move to one of the 15 refuges in this country, they will find that there is no room as they are constantly full. What does this tell the abused? It may send the message that it would be better for them and their families to stay where they are rather than face the unknown, possibly including life on the streets. We must provide an effective support structure, in the form of safe housing, for those who have the courage to leave an abusive home.</P>
    <P>The message being sent out is that we do not provide adequate facilities for victims of domestic abuse. We must become more proactive. We should remedy the shortfall of transitional housing, which simply does not meet the demand of the domestically abused. I cannot endorse a system in which two out of three women who sought refuge accommodation in the eastern region in 1999 were refused this facility as a consequence of overcrowding. We should increase the number of refuges across Ireland. We must help those who have the courage to choose to leave an abusive environment.</P>
    <P>The profile of those who frequently resort to violence in the home should be examined. Perpetrators of domestic abuse often demonstrate alcoholic tendencies. Figures show that in cases of intimate partner violence, 45% of men had been drinking. Women had been drinking in about 20% of cases. We must make public the possible behavioural changes linked with alcohol abuse which may manifest themselves in the form of violence towards an intimate partner. A study shows that the unemployment, drug use or alcohol use of a male partner are associated with an increased risk of physical, sexual and-or emotional abuse.</P>
    <P>We heard earlier that abuse relates to all socio-economic groups. Some people associate it with poorer groups only, but that is because adequately resourced support and backup services are not available to them. Richer or professional people are more likely to change jobs or to get help from their families. Regardless of the background of perpetrators, we must endeavour to ensure that the appropriate support structures are in place. Perpetrators of domestic violence may lack social skills, such as communication ability, particularly in the context of problematic situations with intimate partners. Many of those who inflict violence in the home report higher levels of depression, lower self-esteem and more aggression than non-violent people. Evidence indicates that personality disorders such as schizoid borderline personality, anti-social or narcissistic behaviours, dependency and attachment problems are features of an <Col N="235"/>abusive partner. By illustrating the personality profile of a person who may engage in domestic abuse, we can make potential victims more aware of the type of person that is likely to inflict violence in a domestic environment.</P>
    <P>We must try to flush out the perpetrators of domestic violence. We must show that abusers have a problem and that there are alternatives to staying in a violent environment. Silence and embarrassment, which are common features of domestic injury cases, must be replaced by vocalising and advertising that victims are not alone. One in five Irish women has experienced domestic violence. We need to have a uniform no tolerance policy, rather than ignoring this real problem. The fact that it takes place behind closed doors does not mean that it is not happening. As legislators and citizens of Ireland, we should introduce proper and adequately resourced support structures to increase awareness and, eventually, to remove the attitude which has led to the shocking statistics that have been reported. By highlighting this problem, I hope we can encourage the initiatives which have been suggested by many Senators today. Our efforts can help to ensure that domestic abuse becomes a much less frequent feature of Irish society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to contribute to this debate. I appreciate the Government's decision to give time for a discussion on this issue. Previous speakers have referred in great detail to the proposals and views outlined in the Women's Aid report. I fully and thoroughly support what Women's Aid has to say. I will not go through the issues again, but I will deal with some of the matters arising from them. I would like to reiterate that I am very supportive of the case made by Women's Aid.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that we have created a very macho society since we started to develop from cave men and women. Many problems arise from the fact that this is a very macho world in terms of how we organise our society. There is a lack of understanding of how we should organise society and interact with each other. It is appalling, in this day and age, that sophisticated people who are part of a civilised society should take court cases on the matter of whether women should be allowed to join golf clubs. That is where it starts. The time of the courts is being wasted on this nonsense. Some of the male leaders of our society feel that it is important to take a stand to prevent women from joining golf clubs. This tells one all one needs to know about Irish society at that level. Many men feel embarrassed by such behaviour.</P>
    <P>There are similar problems in restaurants. If I walk into a restaurant at lunch time I can tell immediately by counting the suits whether it is a male restaurant or a real restaurant. One can feel utterly claustrophobic when one walks into many restaurants around this area, only to see many <Col N="236"/>large men in large suits without any women in sight. This is what is coming from our society.</P>
    <P>I notice that an alarm bell has started to ring in the Chamber.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It started after the Senator made his inflammatory remarks about large men in suits.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The alarm bell is not in the Chamber. We are attempting to establish its cause. I apologise for the disturbance that is being caused.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.</P>
    <P>The existence of a male-dominated society creates an unfortunate image. It was worrying last weekend to watch the news reports of two rape cases, both involving 14 year olds. It should be pointed out that one of the cases involved the rape of a man, but that is not the point. Are we teaching society anything? Are we learning anything from our previous experience? Where are we going? In terms of the victims of society&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the noise from the alarm does not seem to be abating, I suggest that the House suspends for a few minutes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we should suspend for five minutes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Somebody should kick the alarm off the wall.</P>

	<P>Is it agreed to suspend for five minutes? Agreed.</P>
   <?_el5-?><P Italics="Y">Sitting suspended at 3.40 p.m. and resumed at 3.45 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We will resume with statements on the need for continuing awareness and actions required to improve services for victims of domestic violence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We have managed to create a very macho world, in which value is placed on being macho. I mentioned some examples that we see in everyday life. I find it appalling and embarrassing at this stage of sophistication in our society that there are still men who are prepared to spend large amounts of money on legal fees in order to prevent women from becoming members of a golf club. This reflects an unacceptable attitude in society. Obviously people must have access to the courts in a democracy, but it seems an extraordinary waste of the courts' time that we should be trivialising their business in this way. It gives credence to the idea of inequality. I thought the equality debate was long over and the issue we were talking about today was to do with violence, on the basis that everybody is equal. However, there is still much inequality and discrimination towards women in Irish society. It <Col N="237"/>must reflect in men who hold those attitudes a lack of personal self-confidence as well as of education. It is certainly indicative of a lack of sophistication and civilisation in society.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the kind of violence being perpetrated in our society is becoming worse. That two 14 year olds in different parts of the country were involved in brutal rape cases over the last week leads us to wonder where we are going as a society and what is happening to us. A change in attitudes is required. Normally this follows legal change, but in this case we have changed the law without changing people's attitudes. That is one of the difficulties faced by our society today.</P>
    <P>The points outlined by previous speakers as to the levels of support that should be available to victims of domestic violence go without saying. We should certainly be supportive of such provision. It is interesting how victims of violence respond in a particular way to violence which I do not believe is rooted in gender. At the weekend, I read how Stephen Hawking was clearly the victim of domestic violence. However, he has reacted in a way that we associate with other victims, mainly women. People do not want to share their particular problem. The reason for this is dealt with in the Women's Aid literature. People, although they are the victims, feel in some way that society holds them responsible. This is due to society's attitudes which create a vicious circle because we are back to the age of the cave man at that point. No words appropriately reflect the disdain and contempt we should have towards the perpetrators of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate has centred around the victims of domestic violence, as it should. However, we should focus on the perpetrators too. If we do not deal with the perpetrators we will never solve the problem. Dealing with the perpetrators requires us to make changes to the laws, such as making counselling and related activities compulsory for those found guilty of domestic violence. They should be forced to confront the consequences of their actions and be submitted to proper areas of rehabilitation. This should be part of the outcome in any of these cases. It is not good enough for them to only pay the price to society and continue on with such attitudes. The perpetrators must recognise what they are doing is wrong and be prepared not just to be contrite but to change their attitudes. There should also be a follow-up in such cases.</P>
    <P>The question of child custody also arises in this debate. Everyone agrees that it should be focused on the child and, in this case, the victim. In child custody cases in the courts we have failed to address the issue that the child's home should always be the fulcrum of the decision. The idea of shared parenting, guardianship or access to a child is fine in theory. However, I have always maintained that it should not be the children who are moved out for the weekend to meet their father or mother, but the parent who should leave to allow the other parent in and the child to stay. <Col N="238"/>This idea of playing musical chairs with children because of parents splitting up is unacceptable. The courts should take a stronger view on those issues. I know how difficult such a scheme may be for parents but that is the way it should be done.</P>
    <P>I am not for one moment suggesting that perpetrators of domestic violence should be allowed free access to the family home. I wanted to introduce the general question of child custody. However, somebody who has committed violence against his or her partner should not have genuine or open access to the family home.</P>
    <P>There are two issues with barring orders. First, they are not implemented half the time. Time and again we see cases of people being in breach of a barring order 100 times, yet they are still freely walking around. This brings the entire process into disrepute. I have heard it said that the way people can gain barring orders is not properly investigated either. Barring orders are there in law but are not being implemented in the way we want them to be. They should be available to people under threat. The minute they are put in place, people who are supposed to be protected by them should be so protected. Anyone who breaches a barring order should go straight to jail, no two ways about it.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we are discussing these issues in the House. I appreciate the opportunity to have participated despite my breakdown under all the noise from the fire alarms.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O'Meara for bringing this matter and the report to my attention and allowing me to bring it to the floor of the House. I also thank her for providing the briefing paper on domestic violence from Women's Aid which is most helpful to all Members who wish to speak on this topic. I am pleased to be able to contribute to this important debate.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, the issue of domestic violence first came into the public arena, although it has always existed. As I mentioned to my party's spokesperson on these issues, Senator Kett, we only learn of some cases but there are many others which are not brought forward. Senator O'Toole touched on this point of an in-built worry, lack of confidence and fear in a woman who is the victim of domestic violence. Women ask whether they should tell people, go to the Garda, to a refuge or to somebody for advice. Very often they fear they will be got at again or someone will follow them. Being in one's own home provides a nest of security. It provides that feeling to a woman that she is mistress of all she surveys, until the violence begins again.</P>
    <P>When I was a local authority member, many women came to see me about domestic violence. I would tell them to go to the local Garda station, to somebody for advice or to a refuge centre. There was a good centre in Athlone, Esker House, which has been mentioned in the report. My main advice was for them to tear themselves away from the situation.</P><Col N="239"/>
    <P>Late one night 25 years ago, when my late husband, Enda, and I were in bed, a woman called to our door who was very bruised and upset. It was around the time when condoms began to be more readily available. It was a time when we were being brave and out-front. Thankfully, this issue is now a matter of acceptance in everyone's life. The Church can go off and do its own thing, but we know what we want to do. The woman and her husband had six children and the particular beating arose because she did not wish to become pregnant again. It was difficult to obtain condoms and her husband refused to abstain. I advised her that the political magazine <i>Hibernia</i> contained advertisements where one could apply for condoms which were sent under special post. I gave her the advertisement and she was able to get them. The couple were able to come to a satisfactory arrangement and have remained happily married. The sequel to this piquant story was that two weeks later at the voluntary secondary school where I taught I received a visit from a priest who informed me that I had been advising people to use condoms. I explained that I had and asked what was wrong with this. He informed me that the Church did not agree with the use of condoms. I asked him what he would say to that woman who wants to have sex but cannot because she does not want a seventh child. He responded by saying she must abstain. That story is very telling. It happened years ago but it lit in me an interest in such issues, which I never lost. Many women, out of a mistaken sense of shame, do not tell their tale to people who could help them.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o'clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Some people would point out there are cases where women are violent to men, but I note the statistics in this excellent briefing document indicate that in the US it is estimated that between 90% and 95% of violence by intimates is perpetrated by men on women. Also, a major study of police reports on crime surveys in UK, USA and Canada found that between 90% and 97% of perpetrators of violence in intimate relationships are men. While I am genuinely sorry for the men who have been violently attacked by women, in more than 95% of such cases women are the victims of male violence.</P>
    <P>We should encourage confidence in women to speak up. I know of many men on whom barring orders have been served and they have had to leave the home. In many cases the couple come back together and the barring order acted as a good, sharp shock to them and they decide, in the main, to behave themselves. Barring orders should be properly enforced. The catcalling of women by the people on whom barring orders have been served, as well as the enforcement of the barring orders, should be monitored.</P>
    <P>I note also in the briefing document that 76 families were accommodated in the Esker House women's refuge in Athlone, a place I know well and in which I was involved at the start in 2002. <Col N="240"/>On leaving the refuge only eight families moved to safe accommodation, free from abuse, and three returned to the family home, in respect of which a barring order had already been served.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State present is a worthy member of the ministerial team in the Department with responsibility for local government. There is an uneven provision of housing in such situations across local authorities based on how they view women who have fled from violence and brought their children with them. Some local authorities are good at providing housing in such circumstances and give those concerned priority, but some do not rank such cases high on their list. They would be of the view that the tenancy was given jointly to a husband and wife or partners and, therefore, are not interested. I stress to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that it should seek to have an even and just system of allocation of priority housing in such situations.</P>
    <P>Members who spoke in this debate might come together to try to persuade the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which indicated it would implement changes to the Domestic Violence Act 1996, that changes should be made to the legislation. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, promised to work through an amendment to that legislation, but we would like to have sight of such legislation. Much has happened since 1996, which is now almost eight years ago, but what has not changed are some of the matters about which Senator O'Toole spoke. I refer to the attitude of society towards women, which in many cases is at the root of what we see exemplified in domestic violence cases. I am incensed sometimes at the portrayal of women in advertising. Members may say that has nothing to do with this report, which it has not, but down the line such portrayal can lead to a degree of violence. One example is the portrayal of women as sexual sirens to sell goods. We are all used to seeing page three women draped across cars. Have members heard and viewed advertisements which tell listeners and viewers about what a wonderful homebody a woman is, all virtues I extol and think are good? However, it is always women who are portrayed cleaning the oven, recommending how to clean the oven or using a product they are told will ensure their pies will rise higher than those of the woman up the street. All these messages put women in their so-called proper place.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining so she will have to clean up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I could talk forever on this issue. I am not accusing the Leas-Chathaoirleach of anything &mdash; he is a most humane person.</P>
    <P>Such advertisements show little regard for women. It is serious that such an attitude towards women prevails in society. I can talk freely now but 20 years ago I would not have made the <Col N="241"/>comments I have in this or the other Chamber, or in a chamber of the county council. I would not have dreamed of it but I say it now because of what I see around me and with years of wisdom and knowledge behind me. I wish women would be stroppy and confident, that they would talk to people and not be afraid.</P>
    <P>I remember going to my first county council meeting in 1974 or thereabouts and the chairman of our group who was a lovely man &mdash; I was the only woman among the 24 &mdash; told me that my best option was not to speak for about six months, and then I would be all right. Imagine not speaking for six months.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator did not heed the advice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That was wishful thinking. At any rate, I decided I would speak that day and I spoke about housing or some such issue. Sometimes the old-fashioned ideas are very good, but keeping women quiet and making one female member in a group of 24 councillors an object of admiration because she does not speak for six months is a breeding ground for many other problems.</P>
    <P>We are only skirting this issue but if we can get agreement on an amendment to the legislation, that will be worthwhile. On the matter of the lack of funding, I read the part of the report relating to private practitioners. That was of great help to women and they were able to act fairly immediately. This area will have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The women and men who spoke in this debate should come to a loose alliance on these matters and seek to bring about as many changes as we can through the legislative process. That is our remit. The briefing paper and this debate will be of benefit in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Senator McHugh.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators who expressed happiness that we can discuss this issue in the House today. I thank the Leader for arranging the debate and compliment her on the remarks she has just made about the situation in which she found herself. We have had a fairly free discussion on this important issue today. Senator O'Rourke said that when she went to her first council meeting she was told not to speak for six months. When I went to my first council meeting as a 20 year old I was told not to speak for the first year because I needed to learn my way before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would say the Senator also spoke.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did. I did some research on this issue before I came into the House and I note <Col N="242"/>that in recent weeks a fair deal of print media space has been devoted to violence against women in particular. I read a statistic from a 1997 report entitled, The Analysis of Cohort, to the effect that on average a woman who is assaulted by her partner or ex-partner has to be assaulted 35 times before a report is made to the police about such an assault. That is an astonishing statistic and there are more statistics that other people read into the record today.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to express my support for those bodies and agencies helping women who are victims of violence. I was contacted by a number of agencies, including the Rape Crisis Centre in Kilkenny, Women's Aid in Carlow and other agencies in my area which expressed great interest in this debate and were adamant about putting their views forward. Most of them were concerned that in recent years funding for the area of violence against women appears to have remained fairly stagnant. We all know that problems with inflation mean a significant decrease in real terms in funding for these areas. This is one sector which could do with considerably more funding.</P>
    <P>One reason cases are not reported is the lack of avenues available to women in a vulnerable position, a point the Leader raised. Where can women go after making a complaint? Research from 1995 found that the single biggest reason women did not leave violent partners was that they had nowhere to go. This is a matter of fear. While people are in a violent situation they may feel that at least they know that situation and are masters of all they survey. People are afraid that if they leave those circumstances there will be no supports in place for them and, frankly, the supports are inadequate. There are 15 refuges in the State which are constantly full, so clearly they cannot cater for all the women presenting for their facilities. This sector is in dire need of a financial injection rather than cutting back or keeping funding at current levels.</P>
    <P>On average, 22 cases of domestic violence occur every day. That means 22 women will be abused in some way by their partners today, which is a startling statistic. I urge the Minister of State, the Department and the Government to do their utmost to ensure funding for this area is increased in the future.</P>
    <P>I have not heard education mentioned yet but part of the secondary school curriculum could deal specifically with domestic violence, whether it is violence perpetrated by men against women or by women against men. That should also be examined in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and strongly support the weight given by speakers to this important debate. The physical infrastructure to deal with this problem is a necessity and other speakers have highlighted the importance of directing funds towards this. The statistic that one in five Irish women is subject to domestic violence should not be taken lightly and <Col N="243"/>the physical infrastructure to deal with it should be provided as a matter of importance.</P>
    <P>I will allude to my personal experience in dealing with the social or human resource infrastructure necessary to deal with this area. I have seen neighbourhood workers going into houses in certain communities, not to seek out women who suffered domestic violence but to help with parental advice or budgeting, as some households have many needs. I have seen such intervention work successfully and we should put whatever resources we can into that area. Many women's groups lobby constantly to get their projects mainstreamed and to get extra funding but having a refuge centre in every village is not practical. However, networking, going into homes and building up the confidence of women who are subject to domestic violence must be options. Confidence is the key to reporting violence. If the garda&iacute; are intervening in a particular house every Saturday night but the case is not going to the courts, that is an example of a woman lacking the confidence to share her story.</P>
    <P>This area is dealt with by several Departments but we need to look at neighbourhood workers and at how we can support families. Domestic violence is a specific issue but we are coming back to the family unit, and there are so many problems affecting families that we must offer them whatever support or intervention we can. There is an onus on us as representatives and on the State to provide that support.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my support for infrastructural aid. I also concur with other speakers who have read statistics into the record, although I will not go over that ground again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank the Leader for facilitating the debate, which is welcome and necessary. I thank the various organisations which made such valuable briefing documents available to us. Those documents contain some frightening statistics and I particularly endorse the views of Women's Aid in its 2003 report. The debate highlights one of the great tragedies in society, a tragedy that is reinforced when one sees the statistics.</P>
    <P>The Leader referred to the many silent cases which remain behind those statistics &mdash; people who are unwilling to come forward because of various fears and concerns. It is even more tragic that such people do not have the confidence to seek help, take corrective action or get out of the situation.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the statistics on domestic violence but it would be remiss of us to focus on any one group. We must face the realities in both the debate and in any actions taken as a result of it. One reality is that all sections of society are the victims of domestic violence. It is not restricted or confined to any particular demographic or social grouping. Violence against women has been highlighted and takes many forms, physical, sexual and psychological. Equally, there is <Col N="244"/>domestic violence against men which is both physical and, in many cases, psychological. Children deal with the direct consequences of domestic violence, either as direct victims or as ancillary victims who witness what happens between their parents.</P>
    <P>I have also received reports of violence towards elderly people who may be abused by young people or adults at home. We should not lose sight of that. There are also concerns as a result of recent court statistics which show a huge increase in demand for barring orders, not just between spouses but also by married couples against adult children living at home. Such couples are subjected to violence, sometimes because that child is abusing alcohol or drugs, and they feel it necessary to get a barring order against their own child. Domestic violence encompasses different aspects of society. Statistics may point in certain directions, but if we really want to address the matter, we must deal with different aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>The difficulties with psychological violence are proving that torment and having the confidence to go through the system in place to make one's case. Unfortunately, while physical violence leaves visible marks and scars, the psychological pressure one party can inflict on another is the really evil form of violence.</P>
    <P>Our societal problem with alcohol abuse is a contributory factor, as are financial matters and the social pressures in the changing society in which we live. These factors contribute to a greater vulnerability to domestic violence.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have to ask where we go from here and what we need to do to meet these challenges. We have a responsibility to legislate, but society also has a responsibility to face up to the problem. We must acknowledge the support of voluntary groups to the victims of domestic violence. In acknowledging that support, we have to learn from it and to work on the basis of the information they make available. The way forward is to draw up a proper policy based on the experiences of these groups as well as the State agencies involved in this area.</P>
    <P>I accept the points made on the need for legal reform. I also accept the call for more refuge centres. However, a huge contribution can be made through the education of society. In doing this, we may be able to succeed in giving confidence to the victims of domestic violence to seek help at an early stage. Equally, society has a responsibility to support victims and not say it is a matter for the couple involved or the family. We need to educate people to have the confidence to support victims of domestic violence so that they will take the necessary action to seek help and assistance themselves. Following this debate, I hope we can move forward with the necessary legislative changes outlined by previous speakers. More important, I hope we can create awareness among the broader community of everyone's responsibility, at all levels.</P><Col N="245"/>
    <P>I wish to digress in response to comments made earlier in the debate by Senator Terry which struck a raw nerve in me. If she were here I would reply to her. I was taken aback at her reference to my party, the Progressive Democrats, to the effect that we are an uncaring party. She said that the Progressive Democrats do not care about the needy or the vulnerable in society. I refute this remark categorically. I object to it personally and on behalf of my party. I do not accept that I fall into that category, as should be clear from my record since I first became involved in public life. My party brought forward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>A great deal of sense has been talked in the course of the debate and I hope it will be translated into action. Not a great deal is left for me to say as I yielded earlier to my <Col N="246"/>colleague, Senator O'Toole, who had an urgent requirement to go elsewhere and run the country.</P>
    <P>I regret that little bit of sharpness entering the debate at the end. In the earlier part of the debate, this issue was marked by a genuine consensus and that is the way we should proceed because it is far too serious a matter to be turned into a political football by any side.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>While I did not hear it, I accept that an unfortunate remark may have been made, which is a pity. The issue of domestic violence, principally against women, although not exclusively, is a highly important one and I welcome the consensus that has been evident. I also welcome the indications from the Minister that the civil liability Bill will be introduced, that there will be other legislative changes and that funding will be provided. I am confident the House will live up to its duty to monitor these promises and ensure they are carried out.</P>
    <P>A societal change has taken place during my lifetime. I remember when domestic violence was something in which the State would not get involved. When police were called to scenes of considerable domestic violence, they would go away saying it was a family matter, as if the fact that it took place within the family permitted this kind of gross abuse and violence. I welcome the fact that society has changed and that we do not regard it as permissible to violate family members simply because they are within the family. The statistics are perfectly clear. The vast majority of this kind of offence takes place within the family and are perpetrated by close family members. I welcome the fact that the Garda is prepared to intervene and that, in certain circumstances, legal aid is available.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the psychological impact of such events on victims. I looked at media reporting of the re-opened case of Sophie Toscan du Plantier. I do not think I am trespassing on any dangerous legal ground by saying he admitted battering his partner on a number of occasions, yet she went back to him and defended him in court.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting phenomenon which I have come across in the area of social work where young people were battered to a considerable extent by older people in relationships. There is almost an addiction to the violence by the victim. This is an extraordinary issue which I have come across time and again. Why do victims go back? One of my colleagues referred to the fact that, on average, it takes 35 attacks before somebody will report an offence. I have never quite understood that. Very often the victims are people of low personal self-esteem and, pathetically, at least they are getting attention &mdash; they are in a strong emotional focus. At least the person who is battering them cares enough about them to batter them. The emotional excitement involved in this almost becomes a drug. It is a dreadful thing to <Col N="247"/>say but I am afraid it is true. This is something that needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>Children are often victims in a number of ways. As has been said, they are witnesses to the violence. It is a dreadful thing for a cowering child to watch his or her parents, who should provide that arch of security, instead attack each other and sometimes turn on their children. An extraordinary degree of cross-over exists between adults who abuse their spouses and also abuse their children and this needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan's point, that the violence is not exclusively against women, is valid. Undoubtedly, there are cases of violence against men. I do not think the incidence is at the same level, but this hardly matters that much. If a human is battered, humiliated, degraded, frightened or injured, he or she has a right to be protected. It does not matter a damn to me whether the victim is a man or a woman.</P>
    <P>We ought to examine this. There have been some worrying judgments on both sides. I think of a recent case where a woman who stabbed her husband was given the benefit of the Probation Act; both parties were drunk and had a row in a pub. I do not think this is acceptable and it raises questions.</P>
    <P>There is also the recent case of a rape committed upon a male. I am preparing a domestic partnership Bill because the gay community is not currently protected. It is not possible for a partner in a gay relationship to get a barring order. That is not right; they have a right to be protected by the State. This is worrying and I ask the Minister of State to relay this to the Minister. The absence of proper recognition of these relationships is one of the things that militates against the existence of barring orders. If anyone thinks such orders are not necessary, or that this is just my view, he or she should read the report by a non-gay person, Finbar Murphy, in a book entitled <i>Coming Out</i>. Mr. Murphy is the excellent Garda liaison officer with the gay community. He does not simply deal with queer bashing; he also deals with serious incidents of violence inside relationships.</P><?_cl11.5-?>
    <P>It is appropriate that we should have the debate at this time as I have been saving the material from the &ldquo;16 facts for 16 days&rdquo; campaign by Women's Aid which arrived on our desks on a daily basis, the affect of which was cumulative. It is interesting to put the short, brief facts together as one gets a composite picture. Of the 83 women murdered in Ireland since the end of 1995, 54 were murdered in their own homes. That tells a story about Irish family life. Of these 83 murders, 45 cases have been resolved and of these, 37 were killed by men they knew &mdash; 12 were murdered by their husbands or partners and six by ex-partners. This indicates the possessiveness of the average male. Women are in particular difficulty and danger at the moment of separation as the &ldquo;property&rdquo; is seen to be <Col N="248"/>sliding away. Men want to grab and smash them as they feel that no one will have &ldquo;it&rdquo; if they cannot have &ldquo;it&rdquo;. Regrettably, women are seen as &ldquo;it&rdquo; in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Many Members have spoken about the excellent briefing paper distributed by<?_jy?>Women's Aid, which contains a number of recommendations for action. The organisation suggests that &ldquo;civil legal aid should be properly resourced and the private practitioner's scheme re-instated to ensure that victims of domestic violence have access to legal advice and representation&rdquo;. I think there would be all-party support for this. Further recommendations include &ldquo;proper resources must be allocated to service provision for victims of domestic violence, including emergency safe accommodation; support and outreach services; and supported transitional housing.&rdquo; Behind this lies the human aspect where battered women who approach agencies have nowhere to go and must go back to the place where they were battered, perhaps to suffer further violence. This is a significant failure of the State which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation seeks to &ldquo;ensure that all victims of domestic violence can access protection through the courts, the Government must honour its commitment to amend the Domestic Violence Act 1996.&rdquo; I think this commitment has been given. Couples with children that do not live together are not covered by this legislation and this gap must be addressed.</P>
   <P>The recommendations continue:</P>
    <P LI="1">4. The family law system should be adequately resourced to allow the timely processing of cases involving domestic violence.</P>
    <P LI="1">5. The national steering committee on violence against women and the RPCs should be resourced to implement the recommendations of the task force on violence against women and to further its strategic plan.</P>
    <P LI="1">6. Initiatives such as the national domestic violence intervention agency, NDVIA, which are attempting to link the various elements of the legal system in order to increase victim safety, should be resourced and evaluated.</P>
    <P LI="1">7. A legal working group to examine the issue of child custody and access in relation to domestic violence should be established to ensure that the safety of women and children is central to all responses and decisions.</P>
    <P FLI="0">All these recommendations should be considered and implemented. The briefing paper also<?oasys _jy?>states:</P>
    <P LI="1">It is essential that the additional needs of women who face further structural barriers and discrimination because of poverty, disability, immigration status, ethnicity, sexual orientation [I think I am the first Member of <Col N="249"/>the House to have raised this issue] educational disadvantage or behaviour that is viewed as non-conforming, are incorporated in all responses to women experiencing male violence.</P>

    <P>I regard myself as a supporter of the ideas propounded by John Waters. I accept all the statistics that have been raised today. However, the points Mr. Waters is currently making will come more to the surface in years to come. Men, as well as women, are abused in relationships and this must be remembered.</P>
<P>We are talking to ourselves unless this debate is reported in the media. We are talking to the converted as I believe the people in this Chamber are not abusers and do not have connections with domestic violence. I ask the media to report the content and general consensus of this debate. This will inform people that Members are aware of what is going on. If, as a result of this debate, the incidence of domestic violence can be reduced, even by only 1% or 2%, then people will be better off.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann</P>
    <P LI="1">&mdash; acknowledging the work undertaken by community groups, throughout the country with the assistance of the F&Aacute;S Community Employment Schemes, and the deteriorating economic climate for people who are displaced from community employment schemes who fail to gain access to other work</P>
    <P LI="1">&mdash; recognising the deep concern of community, health and sporting organisations about the future of these schemes and the continuation of important local projects</P>
    <P LI="1">&mdash; accepting the contribution that these schemes make to the self-esteem of the participants, and the support provided to groups involved in parish, sporting and voluntary activities</P>
    <P LI="1">&mdash; aware of the difficulties encountered by people over 50 years of age in sourcing alternative employment, calls on the T&aacute;naiste <Col N="250"/>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) to suspend the reduction of 5,000 places in community employment schemes at this time of economic downturn and lack of job opportunities in the open market</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) to ensure that people in long-term unemployment will continue to have the opportunity to do valuable work through community employment schemes and</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) to establish a new social employment scheme for the older age group who are long-term unemployed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I am pleased to move this motion on behalf of my colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, and that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, is present as he crusaded on the issue in late 2003 and voiced his strong concerns at the proposed cuts. He was backed by 40 Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers and I understand that at a parliamentary party meeting approximately 30 members supported his call for the community employment schemes to be retained. He stated at the time that the attitude of the party to the community employment schemes would be an acid test as to how it would be assessed by the voters. I have long been a great exponent of community employment schemes because they have transformed towns and villages in rural Ireland. I know that without the input of community employment schemes many of our towns and villages would not look as well and would not be as successful in the Tidy Towns competition.</P>
    <P>Community employment schemes also give people the dignity of work. Many people on community employment schemes are in the over 50s group and would find it difficult to get jobs in the market place but are extremely content to work on these scheme. I think it is a retrograde step that a person who is on an unemployment scheme has to return to unemployment assistance. It degrades the dignity which sustained him in a job to that time. It is false economy. The extra cost to the Exchequer in retaining a person on a F&Aacute;S scheme as opposed to unemployment assistance is &euro;28.</P>
    <P>Community employment schemes play a very useful role and provide benefits across a wide range of activities from cr&egrave;ches to people with disabilities. I accept the Government will state the counter argument that the number of long-term unemployed has decreased, and that is so, however, people who work on community employment schemes would find it difficult to get jobs in the open market. We all know that for those over 55 it may be difficult to get a job. It is extremely important that people work in that type of employment.</P><Col N="251"/>
    <P>In 1998, more than 40,000 people were on community employment schemes, a figure which has now halved to 20,000. The proposed reduction of 5,000 places caused a great deal of concern. My colleague in Limerick West, Deputy John Cregan, was on the plinth of Leinster House crusading for the retention of places on the community employment scheme. Irish politics is different from British politics where 70 Labour MPs voted yesterday against the Labour Party's changes in education. We have loyalty to the Whip and Government Deputies, having stated their position on the steps of Leinster House, when called on to vote on a Labour Party motion, voted in support of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, would like to get the numbers on community employment schemes down to zero. If we continue to reduce the number of places on community employment schemes, the good work that has been done in communities will be eroded, unless the level of funding to local authorities is increased. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Coughlan, has introduced changes that will have an insidious impact on people in community employment schemes by virtue of cutting the number of hours in which they can participate, and in many cases making it uneconomic to work on them.</P> <?_cl11.4-?>
    <P>The media are not focusing on this issue in recent times, but I get deputations from people involved in community employment schemes because the numbers are reducing or schemes are being amalgamated in different areas and the numbers participating are dropping considerably. The problem has not gone away and this is still a live issue. The supervisors who have worked on such schemes for many years fight for their retention, which is understandable because they can see the benefits. In 2003 there were 17% fewer on community employment schemes and I presume we will see further cuts in the future. If there are, some substitute should be put in place. Some people may ask whether they provide a meaningful role and I believe they do. I have already spelled out the beneficial effects for the participants. Many people in my area of Newcastle West probably would not have jobs if they were not participating in community employment schemes. I would be interested to hear whatever enlightenment the Minister of State can provide with regard to changes to the scheme, which might be beneficial. By tabling this motion, we are at least giving him a chance to respond. Perhaps there are some positive aspects on which the Minister of State can elaborate, but people who have spoken to me see only the negative side of many of the changes to the scheme. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="252"/>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute. I thank Senator Finucane for his comments. It is appropriate that the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Fahey, is present because following the initial outcry some months ago about the possibility of large-scale cutbacks in the scheme, he was the first to use a megaphone to announce what he and his parliamentary party colleagues would do to stem the tide. Many of the Minister of State's colleagues made strong pronouncements regarding the need to reverse the proposed cutbacks in the community employment schemes. They all spoke loudly on the plinth of Leinster House but those strong words descended into the silence of the lambs when the reality became apparent. The cutbacks we feared would be made now appear to have been put in place. It certainly seems that the number of people who will benefit from social employment schemes nationally this year will be much less than what is required.</P>
    <P>Social employment schemes need to be examined from the viewpoint of what they have achieved for communities, including, in particular, the people who worked on them. Social employment work provides a double advantage for participants. First, it can represent a step up for people who previously were among the long-term unemployed, perhaps those in their early 20s or 30s who never had a proper job. In some instances, CE schemes have provided such people with a passport to the workplace. Second, and at the other end of the age spectrum, people who became redundant in their 50s and who may have had no possibility of any future income, apart from a contributory old age pension, were able to work in their own communities for sporting clubs, charitable organisations and community groups. The CE schemes provided a fine way for such people to wind down their working years as they were able to participate fully in their local communities, while giving an extraordinarily good return for the moneys expended.</P>
    <P>If every Department involved in social spending looked at the euros being spent from a value for money perspective &mdash; to be fair, in this day and age, we must talk about value for money &mdash; it would be apparent that the value obtained from the social employment schemes is unsurpassed. The schemes comprise both an employment and a social content. They represent a social contract between the State and its citizens. I am sure that, given the Cathaoirleach's involvement in the Gaelic Athletic Association, he could cite cases involving GAA clubs, community halls and other facilities that would not have remained open but for the availability of labour provided under community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>Of all the social schemes that have been put in place over the past ten or 15 years, the <Col N="253"/>community employment schemes have stood the test of time. They are as relevant and appropriate today as they were during the darker economic years of the late 1980s and early 1990s. From time to time, I have heard the T&aacute;naiste argue that when social employment schemes were introduced, there was a much higher unemployment rate and jobs were genuinely difficult, if not impossible, to find. Her argument would appear to be that as economic circumstances have changed, so should the schemes and, therefore, cutbacks should be made. However, the test of necessity for the scheme is that if one has 20, 30 or 50 CE places available, be they in Mallow, Kilmallock or Newcastle West, invariably they will be filled.</P>
    <P>There are no vacancies in social employment schemes because the need is still there to find suitable employment and training opportunities for many people across a broad spectrum of age and qualifications. If any proposed cutbacks are implemented, unfortunately, instead of participating in a social employment scheme and thereby helping to develop their own personal skills and the community at large, people will simply return to the lengthening dole queues. They will be in receipt of social welfare and offer nothing in return.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme is a win-win formula. It represents a win for the State, which gets value for social expenditure, as well as being a win for local communities that benefit directly from the work being undertaken. In addition to sporting and community groups, organisations looking after the elderly, the ill and the handicapped are also involved. Without their access to labour under the social employment schemes, many such groups would have to close down. That would represent a tremendous loss to rural and urban areas, but above all to the people who benefit from the work being done under such schemes. On a value for money basis, every euro of taxpayers' money spent on social employment schemes produces a magnificent return for the State. If cutbacks in these schemes are implemented it would represent a huge net loss to society.</P>
    <P>It would be marvellous if everybody had qualifications of such standing that they could be guaranteed highly paid employment, but that never was the case and it never will be. There will always be a need for social schemes to provide openings, help and encouragement to people who do not have all the advantages that life may offer to others. Social employment schemes have worked wonders for thousands of people over the past ten or 15 years. We should recognise what they have achieved and also recognise that they can keep doing the same type of valuable work in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has a strong personal commitment to the schemes but he alone cannot make the decision to retain the full numbers <Col N="254"/>participating in them. I ask him to put his political muscle behind this project to ensure that his ethos regarding the social employment schemes will win the battle at Cabinet level, rather than the ethos of the Progressive Democrats. The Progressive Democrats may have won the battle over the national stadium &mdash; a fight I was happy to see them win &mdash; but I would prefer it if they lost the battle over social employment schemes.</P>

    <P FLI="0">We are fortunate to have such a competent Minister of State as Deputy Fahey and I welcome him to the House. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak about community employment schemes. Since our previous discussion on this topic in November, some significant developments have taken place which have gone some way towards allaying fears expressed in both Houses of the Oireachtas and around the country that community employment schemes were to be axed. CE schemes were established to help the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups obtain gainful employment. For a variety of reasons, the schemes have broadened their focus to include the development and resourcing of community services. CE schemes have made a valuable contribution in carrying out both these roles. They are of real social value to those who participate in them, not least older, semi-skilled workers, and many worthwhile, non-commercial community activities depend on them. Even in an era of full employment, there are people who do not wish to work outside of their community. For that reason, there will always be a need to provide this type of scheme to ensure that people work in the community for its benefit. As a result of the upturn in economies here and around the world, some people have argued there is less need for community employment schemes. This view fails to take into account the human and social benefits these schemes deliver. I have seen the wonderful work resulting from these schemes in my community in Tipperary and I am sure all of us can bear witness to the benefit of CE schemes in our local areas.</P>
    <P>The Government has recognised the tremendous work those on CE schemes have provided to local communities across the country. Therefore, it has decided, in the context of the 2004 Estimates, that the combined participation levels on community employment schemes, the job initiative, and social economy programmes will be maintained at the 2003 level. No further reductions in numbers are envisaged in 2004.</P>
    <P>The total allocation of funding for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at &euro;351 million. This will support up to 25,000 places across the three schemes. F&Aacute;S will be given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services. These guarantees allow both F&Aacute;S and scheme sponsors at local level to have greater certainty when planning what services should be supported. The commitment to fund a pool of up to 25,000 places <Col N="256"/>amounts to a significant level of activity at a time when some 47,500 work permits have been issued to employers in 2003 in respect of generally low skilled or unskilled personnel from overseas.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that people working in areas such as the health services, child care etc. would lose out on this change. As the Minister has said, all health service related CE projects, including those providing services for people with disabilities, have been ring-fenced against any reductions. Other services ring-fenced against reductions include drug task force activity and child care service provision.</P>
    <P>Our economy has a strength it never had before. The maintenance of near full employment in a more difficult environment is a remarkable achievement. Some years ago the conventional wisdom was that long-term unemployment reduction could never be achieved and that the State would have to cater for large numbers of permanently long-term unemployed people. This Government has, over recent years had a fair degree of success in its work to generate jobs for all unemployed people. Nothing provides dignity better than a job. The Government has provided an additional 400,000 jobs since 1997. Long-term unemployment, one of the greatest causes of poverty, is down from over 5% in 1997 to approximately 1.5% today.</P>
    <P>I would like to highlight the creation of a new rural employment scheme last month. This scheme focuses on providing help where it is truly needed and will provide secure community related employment opportunities for persons in families eligible for the farm assist scheme. It is designed to provide up to 2,500 places and will tackle the twin problems of low income and lack of services in rural communities. The relative decline in farm incomes has caused hardship to families dependent on that income. However, rural communities possess a wide range of skills and talents which are often under utilised. All current participants of CE schemes who have a herd number will automatically transfer to the rural employment scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, emphasised that the institution of the rural employment scheme will help to free up places on community employment schemes which will then be allocated to new participants in both rural and urban areas. A number of reviews of community employment schemes are ongoing. I look forward to studying their recommendations. I hope these reviews will re-focus community employment schemes so that those most in need will continue to benefit from them. While the three year cap on participation has been amended to allow those who are particularly disadvantaged to remain on the schemes, I hope those carrying out the review process will see fit to examine the merits of letting the majority of participants continue to benefit their communities past the three year cap. <Col N="257"/>I will endeavour to influence Government policy constructively on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate in the sense that it gives everybody an opportunity to demonstrate their support of the various schemes promoted in their communities. It also gives them the opportunity to be on the side of virtue, to be uncritical and to maintain that community employment schemes are of benefit to their constituents. It also gives them the opportunity to make speeches directed more towards the local rather than national newspapers, a device which is used in the House and with which I sympathise as it is not unknown for me to use it on occasion.</P>
    <P>This motion, however, begs some more profound questions, particularly with regard to the role of F&Aacute;S. As the promoter of these schemes, F&Aacute;S should be the subject of far greater examination. However, it is never subject to examinations in this House because it would be a dangerous matter for politicians to criticise State agencies or bodies which bring nothing but good, in terms of money and resources, to their communities.</P>
    <P>The reality is that F&Aacute;S is a sort of slush fund to provide grants for employment creation. It rarely comes under any serious examination because politicians welcome those grants to their communities. F&Aacute;S is a large, top-heavy organisation which must find something to do with the large amount of money it is given. Traditionally, and under its articles of association, it was created by the State with the worthy objective of reducing long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>A peculiar feature of F&Aacute;S is, as Senator Hanafin pointed out, that whereas long-term unemployment has been reduced over a short period of years from 5% to 1.5%, the size of F&Aacute;S and the numbers employed by it have increased. It is now an empire. It produces good for many small communities and nobody can quarrel with that. It also does wonderful work in promoting jobs and activities for people with disabilities. However, it has a budget of &euro;859 million per annum. Much could be done with that amount of money.</P>
    <P>I have read the annual report but I can find no detail of where all this money goes. I can see from time to time the great virtue of the individual schemes &mdash; which everybody in this House will talk about because they affect their area &mdash; but they do not add up to anything worth &euro;859 million, or anywhere near that. Incidentally, the 2002 annual report was only lodged in the House several months after the year end last year and we have not yet received the 2003 report. It is difficult to find out what the organisation is doing from reading the report.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this organisation has completely lost its way. I do not wish to detract from the good things it does but it does not merit this kind of budget. If one reads the <Col N="258"/>statement of the chairman, Mr. Brian Geoghegan, one will find it almost entirely aspirational. There is no detail therein. It does not explain what the organisation will do but states it will review strategy. F&Aacute;S has been reviewing its strategy since kingdom come because it does not have one. It has money, the support of politicians and communities that want its assistance. It is there to resolve the problem of the long-term unemployed but that problem is to a large extent resolved. The empire, however, continues to grow. Politicians are unhappy about tackling this problem because if they did they would be vulnerable to charges that they are attacking community employment in their own areas, which is nonsense. F&Aacute;S should be subject to a very rigid examination of where it is spending its money and what return it is getting from &euro;859 million. F&Aacute;S is responsible for the creation of virtually no jobs except the increasing number it gives to its own staff as the empire gets bigger. It is responsible for a certain amount of training, often in respect of jobs in the wrong sectors for the wrong people, and for a certain amount of research. I quote the chairman, Mr. Brian Geoghegan:</P>
    <P LI="1">The first year of the new F&Aacute;S Strategy 2002-2005 brought many internal changes with an increased focus on planning, innovation and greater responses to the needs of our clients.</P>
    <P FLI="0">&ldquo;Focus&rdquo; is one of those broad words used when we mean we are doing nothing. Mr. Geoghegan continues:</P>
    <P LI="1">F&Aacute;S, through its management and employees, embraced a new partnership approach to organisational development involving national and local structures.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is rhubarb. The chairman does not know what this agency does. I do not know what it does, nor does anybody else, but it has a great deal of money. The chairman also states:</P>
  <P LI="1">This approach aims to harness the knowledge and commitment of staff in providing better services to our customers.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is clich&eacute;d nonsense because F&Aacute;S has a very limited role, if it has one at all any more.</P>
    <P>F&Aacute;S decided last year to prioritise its objectives once again. I thought this meant it would have a single priority, but it has eight. Everything is a priority because the agency is utterly directionless. How can F&Aacute;S, which has so much money, run an income and expenditure deficit of &euro;22 million? It seems to me extraordinary given its &euro;859 million budget and an unemployment rate which is down to 1.5% that the State agency still overspends by this amount. It is quite staggering that it should be allowed to do so. Why are its staff numbers increasing while the rate of unemployment is being reduced so quickly? Why does it have eight priorities when it is prioritising expenditure?</P><Col N="259"/>
    <P>The board of F&Aacute;S is full of people who are in the social partnership junkies net.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Senator like to join them?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an amazing achievement of political parties to continually place identifiably sympathetic people on the boards of State agencies. Their loyalties and interests can be undeniably traced back to the social partners but not to the job creators. Where are the representatives of enterprise on the board of F&Aacute;S? Enterprise is where real job creation exists. Instead of political hacks, we should have those who can put commercial pressure on this &euro;859 million.</P>

	<P>I thank Fine Gael for tabling this motion and the Members who have contributed to the debate. Certainly, the contribution of Senator Ross was very different to that of everyone else. I will come to the issues he raised in a few moments.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised to find that the essence of what is proposed in the Fine Gael motion is entirely wrong. It calls on the T&aacute;naiste to suspend the reduction of 5,000 places on community employment schemes at this time of economic downturn in which there is a lack of job opportunity on the open market.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, does the Minister of State have a script to circulate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not using a script.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be a reason for that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no reduction in the numbers on community employment schemes this year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>For the first two or three weeks.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>We ended last year with 25,000 places on community employment schemes in addition to 5,000 places in community employment and social economy. We start this year with 25,000 places. In addition, the budget makes provision for another 2,500 places through the Department of my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for people in the farming sector.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he tell the Minister of State about that before he launched it?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="260"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be allowed to speak without interruption. The Senator will have his opportunity to contribute.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>That means there will be an additional 2,500 community employment places this year, which will bring the total to 32,500. That is a very considerable number of people given that four years ago, when we had the highest level of unemployment, the number was only 39,000.</P>
    <P>In reference to the political points made by Senators, a fight was put up by members of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party, including me, to prevent reductions in community employment schemes and to secure increases. That battle was won. In the budget, the Minister for Finance provided for the 2,500 places and did not cut community employment funding despite cuts in quite a number of areas. I am quite surprised Fine Gael cannot even get its facts right. I reject any suggestion that there are cuts in community employment this year. Rather, there will be increases in the numbers employed along the lines I have described.</P>
    <P>However, there have been areas of community employment in which there is a need to change policy. That policy change is now being implemented. As I have said, we will provide for people over 55 years and those with disabilities. In addition to the provision being made under community employment for people with disabilities, we are allocating considerable amounts of money to a range of programmes and organisations through F&Aacute;S and some non-governmental organisations to provide increased supports to help people with disabilities to go back to employment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Only if they plead with the Minister of State personally.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to say we have had considerable success in this area. We will launch initiatives to help people with disabilities to get back into the workplace in the current year.</P>
    <P>The extra 2,500 places which have been made available to people under farm assist programmes will be subject to a different set of conditions. These will be announced by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. The extra places will allow small farmers who are not unemployed but have a certain amount of work to do on their farms to become involved in community employment work. Some 1,300 such farmers are already on community employment schemes and they will transfer to the new scheme and enjoy the flexibility that goes with it. The other 1,200 or so places will be taken up by people who have been trying to access community employment places. These people will be made available for community employment. I will concentrate the extra places in towns and cities.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="261"/>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is claiming the places as is Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister of State to continue without interruption.</P>

	<P>I am not claiming them. I am simply saying they displace&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is a rural social scheme, how can the places be in towns and cities?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senators would listen, what I am saying is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not what the Minister of State is saying, it is what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true and it is a very good thing. The extra 2,500 places being provided under the rural farm assist scheme will enable 1,300 people already on CE schemes to be transferred to that scheme. A further 1,200 who would otherwise be accessing CE will now be in the new farm scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is playing around with the figures.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>These are an extra 2,500 places in addition to the 30,000 already there. I am acutely conscious that quite a number of people have been on CE schemes on a continual basis. Under this new programme there will be a much greater focus on training and extra funding is being invested therein. There will be greater emphasis on training as opposed to the work experience element of community employment. That will apply in particular to people who will be chosen from the total numbers on CE schemes and who are deemed to be capable of progression. They will be given intensive training followed by a high-support programme to ensure they find employment. For those who cannot find a job and for those with disabilities or those over 55, a new approach will be announced shortly to give them extra opportunities to participate in CE.</P>
    <P>In respect of community services, I agree with the sentiments expressed in the House that CE has provided a significant range of community services across the spectrum. I am anxious to ensure that those services continue on a better structured basis. The numbers of people on the scheme will ensure they will continue. The CE schemes are being re-organised. One of the aspects of the re-organisation caused a lot of trouble in east Galway but I am pleased to hear that most people are happy with the outcome&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Burke, that is not relevant to the debate.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>It certainly is, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to desist from interrupting or I will be forced to take some other action.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>In the unlikely event that were to happen, I am sure Senator Burke would wish me well or perhaps it is wishful thinking on his part.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State on the motion, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important to ensure that volunteerism, which has been the bedrock of <Col N="263"/>rural communities in particular, is not replaced. It was beginning to be replaced because CE programmes were simply providing for services that people formerly provided themselves. The new approach will be to help communities who want to help themselves. Where there is a good culture of volunteerism, we will give new and extra schemes to people who are prepared to do the work themselves but require some support from community employment and other schemes.</P>
    <P>The points made by Senator Ross are a little unfair to F&Aacute;S. I acknowledge that F&Aacute;S receives &euro;859 million each year. He suggested that F&Aacute;S is responsible for reducing the numbers of long-term unemployed and that this work is not done. That is a small part of the work of F&Aacute;S. The organisation has been undergoing change and it has responded well to the changes in society regarding employment. Aside from the specific challenge of long-term unemployment and providing opportunities for training and work experience, F&Aacute;S is involved in upskilling, retraining and lifelong learning. Change in the workplace means there must be adaptability to the global economic conditions and this is the big challenge for the Irish workplace. F&Aacute;S has responded in a positive and proactive way to those challenges. There have been very hurtful job losses in particular locations where indigenous industry has closed up and moved to lower wage economies. F&Aacute;S has established successful training and re-employment initiatives in those locations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>They were promised but there was a failure to deliver.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures will prove they have been successful. Job creation is being achieved in job black spots as a result of retraining, upskilling and further education. There is ample evidence that as a result of retraining and upskilling, people who formerly worked in menial jobs in companies which did not pay well, are now in new, better paid jobs. I acknowledge there is still a major problem in terms of numbers of closures and jobs lost. The increasing challenge faced by F&Aacute;S and the Department to which I am attached is to continue to work to bring about training and upskilling and provide new job opportunities. I remind Senators that 28,000 new industrial jobs have been created as well as thousands of jobs in the service sector. They are all quite well paid and satisfying jobs. We should not underestimate the contribution made by the service sector to job creation.</P>
    <P>I will make a final point which is political in nature. A debate was held before Christmas and a battle was fought. As far as I am concerned that battle was won. Senator Finucane referred to the Labour Party motion which was tabled in the <Col N="264"/>other House. To be frank, the Labour Party motion was a political stunt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State came out badly as a result. It was in the middle of his turmoil.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>It remains to be seen who came out badly. I assure Senator Burke that since I entered this Department I have worked very hard to build on the good work being done in community employment schemes around the country. We make them more effective and ensure that those on community employment schemes emerge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I had intended to make a constructive contribution by addressing the issues outlined in the motion before the House. As the Minister of State has invited me to do something entirely different, however, I will do so. It is a bit rich of the Minister of State to accuse the Labour Party of engaging in a political stunt before the D&aacute;il debate last December. He knows well that the debate at that time arose directly from his own comments. As the Minister of State responsible for the implementation of community employment schemes, he went onto the plinth to announce to the public on the radio that he was opposed to the policy he is in charge of implementing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="265"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Not only did the Minister of State make such a statement, but he exhorted his colleagues on the backbenches to overturn the policy, which he is responsible for defending and implementing, at a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting. He came in here today to claim that we are engaged in a political stunt. The Minister's actions represented the most remarkable political stunt I have seen in these Houses for quite some time. We can return to the substantive issue of whether the Minister of State won the argument at that time, but the cheap political point he made at the tail end of his speech does him no credit and does not do our debate any good.</P>
    <P>I think all speakers, including the Minister of State, agree that the essential difficulty with community employment is that it tries to do two things which are complementary but which pull in opposite directions from time to time. Community employment was initially designed as a labour market intervention and has been reasonably successful in that regard. I read again this afternoon the report prepared by Deloitte &amp; Touche for the Minister of State's Department some years ago. The report was an examination of the success rates, in terms of progression into full-time employment, of those who participated in community employment schemes. The numbers increased throughout the 1990s, until they reached approximately 40% in the last year covered by the survey, 1997-98. This means that approximately 40% of participants in community employment schemes could expect to be in employment some 18 months later. That is a decent level of progression and success, by any reasonable standards.</P>
    <P>The report, which was quite comprehensive, asked participants in community employment schemes whether they thought the schemes were helpful in terms of training, upskilling and, ultimately, finding a job. Some 40% said they were very useful and approximately the same percentage of people said they were quite useful. Only 20% of people felt they were not useful at all. Community employment can be said to have been quite successful over the years if one measures its success as a labour market intervention. It has been particularly successful with particular groups. It has been successful recently in terms of giving useful work and training to lone parents. As long-term unemployment has decreased nationally, the number of lone parents participating in community employment schemes has increased quite considerably.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of community employment, on which we quite understandably tend to focus in these Houses, is to support communities. All of us are aware of communities in our local areas which depend on CE schemes. The parochial hall in Donnycarney, in my local area, will be reopened in the next few weeks by <Col N="266"/>the President, Mrs. McAleese, after its recent redevelopment. This substantial facility consists of a large hall and 20 ancillary rooms. I understand that with the exception of the full-time manager, the facility, which cost several million euro, will depend for its operation largely on community employment schemes or on voluntary work.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned volunteers in his contribution. He is right in principle to say that we do not want to supplant volunteerism, but the truth is somewhat bleaker than that, unfortunately. In some parts of this city, volunteerism is dying on its feet. This is partly because people do not have time, partly because people working with children feel under pressure in a way they did not 20 years ago and partly because people are working to a greater extent than once was the case. The level of female participation in the workforce is much higher than it was before. It is sad that volunteerism is very much diminished. We need community employment not only to support volunteerism, as the Minister of State suggested, but also to replace it. We have to confront this inevitable fact.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the Minister of State's contribution to last December's D&aacute;il debate, which was initiated by the Labour Party. I do not intend to comment on the more controversial aspects of the discussion. In the course of the debate, the Minister of State referred to a presentation he made to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion about how he would like to see community employment reformed and restructured. He has repeated some of his points this evening. I will not repeat everything he said because we agree on it, generally speaking. He said that labour market intervention measures will be restructured to place greater emphasis on training matters and that he will try to structure community support measures in a way that is sustainable, rather than stop-start, and that ensures that communities can rely on community employment on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, did not take his ideas further in his unscripted contribution this evening. When he spoke on this matter in the D&aacute;il in December, it was clear that the presentation he made to the Cabinet sub-committee had not been progressed to the point where he could make an announcement. The Minister of State should tell us whether the restructuring of community employment, which he has proposed, has been agreed. When he spoke in the D&aacute;il in early December, he made it quite clear that the Minister for Finance did not agree with him. He patted himself on the back by saying it is important on occasions to take a stand by standing up to the Minister for Finance.</P><Col N="267"/>
    <P>We need to know whether the Minister of State has resolved his problems with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the T&aacute;naiste. If he has not dealt with these difficulties, much of what he has said this evening is simply guff and aspiration. I hope the Minister of State wins his battle, if that is what it is, with the Minister for Finance. We need to structure the supports for community employment schemes so that communities know what is happening from year to year. They need to know that they will have people to run services such as meals on wheels, support for persons with disabilities or cr&egrave;ches. They need to be sure that they will be able to continue to provide such structures in communities.</P>
    <P>It is important that I state that I support the Minister of State's point, made in the D&aacute;il in December, that community employment incurs very limited additional costs. The difference between sustaining somebody on social assistance or unemployment assistance, and sustaining somebody on community employment, is &euro;24 or &euro;25 per week. In that light, we are entitled to ask why the Minister of State or some of his colleagues are seeking to reduce the numbers of participants on CE schemes. One has to come to the conclusion that the decision is ideologically driven, essentially, by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is the leader of the Progressive Democrats Party, and her soul mate in the Department of Finance. This makes no practical or political sense to me nor, I suspect, to many Members on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State a fair wind if he is still fighting the battle. If he has lost the battle, which I suspect may be the case, he should have the courage to put his hands up and say &ldquo;I fought the battle, I lost and I am off now&rdquo;.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One way or the other, the essential point is that communities that depend on these services deserve certainty into the future. This is also true of individuals who have gained dignity through participation in the labour market by means of community employment schemes.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the House will not be divided on the Government's amendment. It is possible that, on reflection, the Opposition will decide to support the amendment proposed by this side, which &ldquo;notes that the number of places being supported under the Community Employment (CE) Programme in 2004 is being maintained at 2003 levels and that the total allocation for employment programmes has been fixed at &euro;351 million which will support up to 25,000 places across the CE, job initiative and social economy schemes&rdquo;. This is quite an achievement in difficult times. The amendment also states that Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;commends the Government on the introduction of a new rural social programme which will create up to 2,500 additional community-related employment places&rdquo;. I will return to this as it is an excellent initiative. It also states that Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P><?_cl11.4-?>
    <P LI="1">recognises the important contribution that community employment and other programmes such as job initiative and social economy have made to the provision of services for local community groups and organisations over the past number of years and the clear commitment given by the Government to the ongoing support of such services.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That commitment is very much part of the Government programme. The amendment goes on to state that Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;notes the Government's success to date in dramatically reducing the numbers of persons in long-term unemployment &mdash; a key target group of active labour market interventions&rdquo;. Members should note that the percentage of people on unemployment benefit has been dramatically reduced, which is an enormous achievement. No Government has achieved more in this regard.</P>
    <P>The amendment further states that Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
    <P LI="1">notes the Government's continuing commitment to persons facing the prospect of <Col N="269"/>becoming long-term unemployed through the full roll-out of the employment action plan preventative strategy and also the recent introduction of a high supports process for persons likely to experience severe employability barriers.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It continues that Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
    <P LI="1">recognises the flexibility which already exists for older persons on CE. In the case of people aged over 50 years, the three year cap on participation has been removed where people in this age group, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment; and</P>
    <P LI="1">notes the considerable time and resources devoted by Government to the review of community employment and other active labour market programmes to allow appropriate and timely responses to the changing labour market and changing needs of vulnerable groups.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is our amendment to the Fine Gael Party's motion. I am not sure if the Labour Party is supporting the motion, although I have my doubts. I added my name to the motion which went before the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party last December, in which the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, was much involved. It is a feature of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party that we can put forward different motions at party level on the fifth floor, which is a place many people would love to be. Having been out of it for nine years, I was delighted to be back in the parliamentary party offices.</P>

	<P>We encourage a Minister of State to put forward his or her concerns to the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister for Finance and to the Taoiseach. The matter is worked out within the party so that we come out united in our approach and united in the best interests of the electorate. That is what has been achieved in this matter. It has been an enormous achievement. Late last year, great concerns were expressed up and down the country about community employment schemes and others of this type.</P>

	<P>What will happen at the parliamentary party meeting next week?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The rural social scheme was mentioned in the 2004 budget. The focus of this scheme, which will consist of approximately 2,500 places, is to provide ongoing income and employment support to small farmers who can no longer make a viable living on the land. At the same time, the scheme will ensure the provision, at a reasonable cost to the Exchequer, of sustainable, top class services in rural areas. This is a major initiative by the Government, in which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been very much involved. In his Department, since he brought in initiatives such as CL&Aacute;R&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator has one minute left.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator were over here he would believe it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Late last year I received some representations from people who had problems in this area, but not to the extent that has been put forward by the Fine Gael Party. Perhaps its members tried to stir up difficulties in certain areas. However, there have been some achievements, one of the most important of which is in the area of personal carers for people with disabilities. The position of carers is to be mainstreamed in the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. These people are permanent personal assistants. This is an area that must be considered carefully.</P>
    <P>This is a wonderful achievement for the Government which has taken place in difficult circumstances. The Opposition should be <Col N="271"/>delighted with the progress made in this regard. Unemployment is currently at its lowest level for some time. Approximately 400,000 jobs have been created since 1997.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was not around then.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Long-term unemployment, one of the greatest causes of poverty, is down from over 5% in 1997 to approximately 1.5% today. This is an enormous achievement by the Government. I sympathise with the Fine Gael Party for being in Opposition. People ask what is the difference between one party and another. The answer is that one is in Government and one is out. The Fine Gael Party is out and we are in, and we intend to stay in for a long time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator sure his party is fully in Government? There have been times when matters were strained.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>In the interests of the country, the people's party is in charge &mdash; that is Fianna F&aacute;il. We respond to the needs of the people when it comes to any scheme. I know it is difficult being in Opposition at this time. Members are grasping at straws, hoping for some sort of banana skin that the Government will slip on. It will not happen. We are in and we intend to stay in. We will fight the European elections and the local elections and we will win.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator intend to run for election?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House. She missed the extraordinary contribution of her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, earlier. In my 18 months here, that contribution ranks as the most nonsensical and idiotic response I have heard to a motion from any Minister. It was further marred by an abusive personal attack at the end, which he should have withdrawn. However, he did not, and I hope the point he made will be highlighted because it shows what a petty and vindictive nature he must have. What he said was beneath contempt.</P>
    <P>The Minister clearly had not read the Fine Gael motion because he launched into a tirade about how there will be more places on the F&Aacute;S community employment scheme under the new rural social scheme. The rural social scheme has nothing to do with the F&Aacute;S community employment scheme. It is being run by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and is a completely separate scheme. The Minister of State did not know this; obviously, he had no idea what he was talking about.</P><Col N="272"/>
    <P>He then launched into another spiel about how this new scheme will be a great success. Senator Leyden and other Government Senators also spoke about how great the scheme would be. We were told on the day of the budget that there would be 2,000 places, which has since been increased to 2,500. Perhaps there will be this many places. However, I must point out that there are at least 2,500 farmers in Kilkenny alone, and I am sure there are many more in other parts of the country, who would be eligible for the scheme. It is certain, with the way agriculture is going at the moment, that many more farmers will become eligible in the future. People should not jump up and down about the fact that there will be 2,500 places for small farmers. It is a drop in the ocean. This scheme is not a triumph &mdash; it is nothing about which to scream and shout.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell made some pertinent points about the structure of the CE scheme. When it was set up it was intended to be a labour market intervention mechanism at a time when there were record levels of unemployment. These levels have now dropped significantly. However, the number of places on CE schemes has also dropped significantly over the past few years. An example from my area is the scheme in Mooncoin, County Kilkenny. Fifteen years ago when the scheme was set up, there were almost 40 people on it but now there are only nine. Unemployment in Mooncoin, or in any other part of the country, has not dropped that much. The Government is fooling itself if it believes this is the case. I do not know where Senator Leyden lives because he claims he did not receive much representation on this issue. However, I have never received more representation on any issue since I became involved in politics. I have not seen such emotion expressed on any other subject. Senator Leyden should get into the real world if he claims he has not received any representations on this issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ross's comments that the structure of F&Aacute;S is top-heavy. It is ironic and wrong that when last year's numbers on the community employment schemes were being cut, there were increases in F&Aacute;S directors' salaries. It was shocking and badly managed. It was utterly wrong that, at a time when the scheme was being dramatically reduced, the directors were landing themselves increased salaries. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, speaking off-the-cuff, informed the House that there have been no cuts in the community employment schemes this year. However, we are only a couple of working weeks into the new year. Does the Minister of State want a pat on the back for saying that x number of people were on the schemes on 31 December 2003 and the same number are on them on 1 January 2004? That is a foregone conclusion. The Fine Gael Party is pointing out that over the past number of years, there have <Col N="273"/>been significant decreases in the numbers involved in the community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell pointed to the relatively small additional costs involved in keeping someone on a community employment scheme, as opposed to the live register. It is significant that it is such a small amount of money. For that small amount, so much can be done in different communities where these schemes provide valuable services.</P>
    <P>We all are interested to know from Senator Leyden what goes on behind the closed doors of a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting. The Senator may be interested to note that the predicament of Irish immigrants was brought up by the Fine Gael Party in this House last year. The Government did and said nothing about the issue at the time. Maybe the Government should wake up to what others are saying. Just because the Fianna F&aacute;il Party decides to have a discussion on a matter, does not mean it invented it. This has been a serious issue for a long time and I hope we will have a Private Members' motion on the plight of Irish immigrants, who through no fault of their own, are working overseas.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the matter of volunteering. Again, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, was out of step. Most Members involved in local communities will know how difficult it is to get people involved in community groups of one sort or another. The Minister of State stated how he was going to do x, y and z to promote volunteering. However, this will not be easily done. In most families, both parents tend to be working and they do not have the time or the energy after work to commit themselves to voluntary work. The community employment schemes fulfil an important role in both urban and rural communities in helping to offset the decreasing number of people becoming involved in volunteer work. The Government should not stick its head in the sand, claiming that this problem can be reversed easily.</P>
    <P>I am surprised to see, as in Senator Leyden's remarks, an adoption by the Government of a thorough Progressive Democrat ethos. The Progressive Democrats won the battle on the development of Lansdowne Road, a battle Fine Gael has been saying for the past five years should have been won. The Taoiseach's aspirations for his pet project in Abbotstown were shot down yesterday, not before time and after losing much valuable time for Irish sport. In a recent article on the Progressive Democrats, they were described as the prophets of doom. I would hate to think that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

   </Speaker><Col N="274"/>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera. She is a welcome change to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey. I found him to be a source of provocation throughout his address because of the contempt and disregard with which he treated the House by delivering an off-the-cuff address that did not deal with the substance of the motion.</P>

	<P>Senator Ulick Burke was the one who was being provocative.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?_ah?><Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will admit to that because I had my reasons. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has been clearly defeated on this issue. Prior to Christmas, he made valid pronouncements as to his intentions for the schemes. He got the support of 40 Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, yet at the last moment, was beaten into submission. He has now obviously thrown in the towel on retaining the community employment schemes.</P><?_xh?>
    <P>There are cuts throughout the country. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, admitted there were problems in County Galway. The problems manifest themselves through the loss of 1,500 places in community employment schemes. He referred to the situation in Mountbellew. However, I wish to outline the personal profiles of nine people from Mountbellew who have been out of work because of the suspension of the community employment scheme. Michael, in his early 60s, a widower, living alone who was on his first scheme, is 12 months out of the scheme. Mary, a widow in her late 50s living alone, on her first scheme, is 12 months out of the scheme. Oliver, in his late 30s, single, living alone with special needs, is 12 months out of the scheme. Michael, late 30s and living alone, is out of the scheme for 12 months. Gerry, single with medical conditions and unable to obtain full-time work, is out of the scheme for 12 months. Martina, single, living in community housing and receiving mental health support is 12 months out of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are others in this situation to whom the Minister of State referred. This is what he is <Col N="275"/>leaving behind when he says there are no cuts. In my county, 1,500 people are affected. In the specific case to which he referred, the record stands at 12 months out of work. Throughout the day I tried to contact every Department in some way connected with the proposal by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for 2,500 additional places in the rural social schemes. When the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, made the announcement in that regard he said it was at the back of his mind since 2002, but from what I gather today it is still at the back of his mind. There is no trace of information in any Department about how a potential applicant can make an application in this regard or to which Department he or she can do so. There is no evidence that such a scheme is up and running or otherwise. I was horrified to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, say, whether in error or otherwise, that people would be transferred from the current social employment schemes to this new scheme, maintaining there would be no cuts. We were told there would be 2,500 additional places on the new schemes for people essentially engaged in farming. An applicant must have a herd number. However, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has said he will transfer some participants on community employment schemes to this new scheme &mdash; the record will show that. There is confusion in that regard. Tension has existed in the background between the senior Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the junior Minister, Deputy Fahey, since 2002, which manifested itself in the run-up to the budget at the end of last year and now there is confusion because even though they share a constituency one of them does not know what the other is doing. That is evident from the Minister's reference today to such a scheme being in the back of his mind. It must still be an idea in the back of his mind because there is no evidence of such a scheme being in place. If there is, I will gladly accept the point and be pleased to hear where we can direct people, in need of a new position, to apply for it.</P>
    <P>One county has suffered 1,500 job losses under such schemes in the past 12 months and I want to know what is going on. There is obviously a game going on. I reject much of what Senator Ross said. He does not have an understanding of the benefit to participants of CE schemes and of what F&Aacute;S has done for the many people who have participated in its schemes, received valuable training and secured gainful employment. That is all many people want.</P>
    <P>F&Aacute;S schemes are affected most in areas where people have the least opportunity of securing alternative employment. People with the profile I outlined, whether they come from Galway, Donegal or Kerry, would have little chance of securing employment. The Government ring-fenced funding for the schemes and will not make <Col N="276"/>further funding available, therefore, no additional places can be provided.</P>
    <P>We were guaranteed by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey &mdash; if he was present I would challenge him on this &mdash; that places and funding for schemes in RAPID areas would be ring-fenced. If participants on schemes raise their position with a particular Minister, principally the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, they are advised that the Minister may consider it. The promise given regarding ring-fencing has been broken. There is no continuation of places on such schemes in RAPID areas, which is a devastating blow to many people not necessarily only in terms of social employment but in terms of schemes which provided valuable support to people with special needs. Those people are the worst hit. Why has the Government, which can afford to spend a great deal of money in other areas which are not necessarily a priority relative to these schemes, decided it will not allocate any further funding to these schemes and that the ring-fencing promised cannot be guaranteed? It is a crime and a shame and that is why the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, ran from the reality of what faced him in this regard. He has thrown in the towel. He may have pastures green in sight for the future and, if he has, he must accept he has failed in terms of his involvement in community employment schemes. Perhaps it would be good if the electorate sent him elsewhere in the near future.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this subject being put down for discussion because community employment schemes are of great value. On Monday, the last day I was in Tipperary, two people raised this issue with me, one being a man over the age of 50 who drives a bus for disabled people. He got an extension of a further six months to his position after three years, but was concerned about still having a job next May. In all probability, I believe his place will be rolled over. I also visited a sports pitch in the county and the point was made that it was maintained by F&Aacute;S community employment schemes. Such schemes are important for the people participating on the them, especially older people, and for communities.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government did not act, despite some expert advice which it was suggested, at least in the newspapers, was offered to it that community employment schemes should be slashed. The reason there was such concern in the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party in this regard, which was not well understood by the media, is that there was a leak of a report of an expert group last September recommending severe cutbacks in the community employment schemes. The Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party was not in favour of that and made that clear. It was not clear to me at any stage that the Government had <Col N="277"/>taken that view on board, but people were concerned about the advice that was offered.</P>
    <P>As a trade union official in Tipperary said to me during the week, one cannot always say that a scheme employing 20 people could not be equally effective employing 19. It must always be open to Government to make slight adjustments in accordance with overall conditions. One of the factors that has worked reasonably favourably in the past year is that the unemployment position has hardly deteriorated, certainly not to the extent that many people feared given the downturn in the economy. That does not alter the fact of the great social importance of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The importance attached by members of the Government parties to maintaining schemes is well understood throughout Government because there are gaps in provision. There are many activities covered by such schemes which are not, by any stretch of the imagination, commercial but, nonetheless, have a community value. In some cases over time they will be converted into permanent jobs and that is fine, but a gap exists and, in that respect, community employment schemes are vital. While accepting there continues to be concerns in the community and among constituents, most of those concerns are not so much about people being let go but uncertainty about what their positions will be in a few months' time. I hope that will clarify itself for the vast majority of participants in a benign way. I am glad the Government decided to maintain community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>There is a little restructuring for the rural social programme but the scheme is broadly as is. There is no basis for claiming some kind of doomsday scenario with the schemes are being slashed and so on. Broadly speaking there is stability, which is good, and on that basis I am happy to support the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion although Dr. Mansergh has spoken eloquently on the amendment. Senator Ross had many criticisms of F&Aacute;S but he was criticising the chiefs running the programme rather than the Indians doing the work. The community employment schemes have been of great value to various organisations I have been involved with in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>One of the best aspects of the scheme is the fact that people can help community organisations by getting involved in the scheme. Those organisations would not be able to employ people were it not for the scheme, which has been extremely valuable. People should not think their work was not of value. Some people may feel that they had made-up jobs because the scheme has been removed from their areas or organisations, but that was never the case. They all did very valuable work.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government takes notice of the motion, as I do not believe it is trying to do <Col N="278"/>people down. People should continue to feel of value because they are of value and the majority of people in these jobs have done very good work, while criticism should be considered as being directed at the overall plans of F&Aacute;S. I will be supporting the motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I support the motion. Dr. Mansergh said employment is not rising but he would find the most recent figures from the CSO dreary reading. Every employment exchange in my constituency of Carlow, in Tullow, Bagenalstown and Carlow, has shown marked increases in numbers of clients. There are only 200 extra people in the Carlow exchange but that is a big percentage of the population of Carlow and unfortunately there will be 60 more in March when a factory in the area closes and relocates in Germany.</P>
    <P>The CSO figures on relative incomes also make for startling reading. Carlow is now the poorest county in the country outside the BMW region, which was a wake-up call for me. We can all get caught up in our lives and think everyone is wealthy, with everything they need, but these figures can bring us back to earth. The figures also indicated that relative income in Dublin was very high, which might suggest there is no poverty in Dublin, but I accept that that is not the case. These CSO figures bring home problems in a concrete way.</P>
    <P>The community employment schemes are a way to deal with these problems. They have been so successful that we may have taken them for granted. I refer to the schemes in country areas in particular, as rural areas are most affected by these cutbacks. The cutbacks were announced in 2002 and it is baffling that the Government congratulated itself on maintaining the number of CE scheme places at the 2003 level when it did not admit that it reduced numbers in 2002. In addition, many community employment schemes in the health area were ring-fenced and could not be touched, which meant that schemes involving sports, amenity trusts and tidy towns suffered cutbacks. I have personal experience of schemes being amalgamated, which resulted in supervisors losing their jobs and worker numbers being halved overnight. That is the reality and I am not being political.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that community employment schemes have given a new lease of life to certain people who were not as lucky as many of us with educational opportunities. Some of them did not finish primary school and perhaps got married young, having families at an early age. They found at 45 or 50 they were able to get the necessary training and go back into the workforce. They then felt they were a valuable part of society. I cannot understand why the Government is keen to put those people back in the dole queues. There is very little monetary difference between the salary of a CE scheme and <Col N="279"/>unemployment benefit. It makes no sense to return these people to the dole queue when one considers the benefit to such people of having a job which makes them feel good. Our motion refers to the boost to self-esteem for people involved in community employment schemes and such considerations show that it makes no sense whatsoever to discontinue schemes or cut them back.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that cuts in the community employment schemes have been felt in rural areas particularly and it is time the Government addressed this. I look forward to hearing more details of the so-called additional 2,500 community-related employment places and the rural social programme. I look forward to seeing how that is to be implemented but unfortunately the Government's credibility in this area is very low.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I support the motion, which is worthy of the good debate we have had. Social employment schemes have done tremendous work throughout the country. County councils have done great work through F&Aacute;S schemes for many years, building stone walls, widening corners, removing ditches and so forth. Trades have come back to communities, such as the art of building with stone, and that has been done by F&Aacute;S. Local authorities have done great work with the community employment schemes and with the involvement of local communities, particularly in rural areas. It is a shame to see 5,000 places being cut so drastically.</P>
    <P>Many community employment schemes have provided caretakers for small schools and have helped to look after GAA, soccer and rugby pitches and clubs. Sporting facilities all over the country are being looked after by those on community employment schemes. It is an absolute disgrace that 5,000 CE places can be just wiped away. The Minister said the new rural social programme will create 2,500 new places. I do not see the point of replacing one scheme with another. Community employment schemes have been tried and tested over the years. Those communities that put in the greatest effort got the greatest value from them and this has been proven across the country. Inner city schemes have done great work for the underprivileged. The creation of a new rural employment scheme with a total of 2,500 places is codology.</P>
    <P>In most homes both parents have to work to keep the house going, pay for their children's education, keep their car on the road and ensure bills are paid. Voluntary effort in communities has eroded over the years. People do not have as much free time as they work more and travelling to work takes longer. In many areas, community employment schemes have replaced voluntary <Col N="280"/>effort in respect of looking after schools or GAA and soccer pitches.</P> <?_cl10.5-?>
    <P>The reduction in these schemes will place a great burden on rural sporting organisations. From where will the voluntary effort come? The Government's move to reduce these schemes for the sake of a few million euro is short-sighted. People are waiting in the long grass for Government representatives to knock on the door next summer because they know the value of community employment schemes to their areas. People want schemes to continue to look after the local school, football pitch or whatever else. I give my full backing to the motion before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my weight to the debate. I endorse the motion and record my support for community employment schemes in general. I accept that some schemes have shortcomings and may be of questionable value. At one time so many schemes were in existence that some of them may have been of dubious merit.</P>
    <P>From my experience of community employment schemes in County Donegal, their contribution to their communities has been significant and substantial. I do not refer simply to keeping graveyards, siocs and grass verges clean, I speak of the empowerment process whereby people, who might not otherwise have been able to access it, received training on these schemes. Single mothers and men out of work for ten or 15 years have benefited from the schemes. They provided an opportunity for people who did not have the confidence to go back to full-time education and for those who left school early.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross was highly critical of the bureaucratic structures of F&Aacute;S. I commend F&Aacute;S for its foresight in regard to community employment schemes. It was the first organisation to address the issue of lifelong learning. It was also the first to accept that people fall through the loop and leave school early. The schemes provided such people with confidence and the money to get driving lessons, do a course in assertiveness, knitting or craftwork. It also succeeded in getting them out of the house. This is an aspect of the schemes we need to address.</P>
    <P>Supervisors of community employment schemes have been trodden on. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will agree with me from his contact with supervisors in his constituency. These supervisors have never been made permanent; they worked on year to year contracts. I know supervisors who have been in charge of schemes for up to ten years. Without permanency, such people had no opportunity to progress their career path. They have had little recognition for their work. Even though F&Aacute;S provided the mechanism for the courses, it was the supervisors who gave direction to the schemes.</P>
    <P>Many seasonal tourism projects require F&Aacute;S participants for four to five months in the summer time. It will never be economically viable for the Flight of the Earls heritage centre in Rathmullan to employ someone for 12 months of the year. <Col N="281"/>This is a seasonal project and it is necessary that the work carried out heretofore by F&Aacute;S employees continues. If the centre is to be viable, staff are needed to welcome visitors, provide entertainment, conduct interpretative tours and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, referred to the rural social schemes announced by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, under the recent budget. This will be a good scheme for farmers who are being driven off the land, those who will find themselves sitting idly at home. However, only 2,500 places are being provided and, as Senator John Phelan indicated, there are probably 2,500 farmers in Kilkenny alone who could avail of that scheme, not to mention the other counties. In practical terms, is it feasible for a farmer in the Rathmullan area in Donegal to provide interpretative tours in the Flight of the Earls centre? Perhaps, in time, they will have the confidence to do this.</P>
    <P>I listened to the earlier stages of the debate on the monitor. At one stage it was like watching the &ldquo;The Oprah Winfrey Show&rdquo; with the shouting of abuse and hurling of criticism in an emotive manner. This is not necessary in the House and does not add any weight to its credibility. We should be practical rather than emotional on this matter and carry out some evaluation of the schemes. I recall that F&Aacute;S carried out annual evaluations where each participant and supervisor was asked about the benefits of the scheme, its impact on job opportunities, educational status and self-esteem. We should carry out similar investigations rather than conducting a slagging match in the House.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister of State to follow his heart. He stood up for this issue and is aware that community employment schemes have been successful. They have contributed to the socio-economic life of communities in rural and urban areas. I urge him to use his influence at parliamentary party meetings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions which I followed closely on the monitor. I sought a copy of the Minister of State's speech as I wanted to analyse it in more detail. I do not think he had a speech, which is unusual, as most Ministers come in armed with information. Has he lost interest in this issue? Is he not as concerned about the matter as he was prior to Christmas? This may be an incorrect reading of the situation.</P>
  </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, I have not used a speech in either House since I began speaking about community employment schemes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State's heart must be in it then.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very much in the right place.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister of State could convince the Minister for Finance. In 1998, there were 40,000 participants on the scheme. <Col N="282"/>AnCO and F&Aacute;S were the forerunners of this scheme. As a result of the schemes, there was a great growth of community centres in rural areas. Another pattern then followed and many of the schemes became involved in practical activities in towns and villages.</P>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><P>My concern is that the scheme probably will be further reduced at the end of the year and the long-term objective is to get rid of it entirely. If this is done, a vacuum will remain unless alternative finance is put in place. The alternative finance will have to be met by the local authorities as they probably will have to employ additional staff to carry out the work currently carried out under community employment schemes.</P>
    <?oasys _dc0-?><P>Senator Mansergh referred to GAA clubs. Many GAA clubs, and others sports clubs, rely on people participating in the community employment scheme. The Minister of State spoke of encouraging volunteerism. There has been a change in society as regards volunteerism. People are under pressure through work and financial commitments. Much research has been carried out on the lack of volunteerism in the United States of America; the book <i>Bowling Alone</i> deals with the American experience. While the Minster of State's encouragement of voluntary activity is laudable, I am unsure how successful it will be.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o'clock</TimeSt><P>The rural social programme is correct and I am prepared to give it a chance. It may give a chance to farming smallholders who need a top-up income. I wonder where it dovetails into place. Does it replace or extend the farm assist that is currently paid<?oasys _dc20	-?>by the Department of Social and Family Affairs? Although this was announced in the budget, we have seen no concrete proof of it. Senator Ulick Burke has tried in vain to find details of the programme and how people can participate in it. I hope those details will be forthcoming soon. I am sure the 2,500 additional places will be taken up.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>I respect what was said about F&Aacute;S; it has done excellent work over the years. I worked with AnCO for ten years. When I joined AnCO it had approximately 200 employees. F&Aacute;S subsumed AnCO and the National Manpower Service and became a large organisation. I accept that at certain times in the cycle of such a body, its functions must be re-appraised. I am sure this is currently being examined within F&Aacute;S.</P>
   <P>We are glad to have tabled this motion. Community employment schemes are often raised with Members in their constituencies. Public meetings are often held when schemes are amalgamated and concerns are expressed about reductions in numbers. Members are often asked to seek flexibility from local F&Aacute;S representatives. This issue has become more contentious in recent times as there are concerns about the reduction in the number of places.</P>
    <P>I will not talk about what took place earlier. The trading of insults reminded me of the &ldquo;Oprah Winfrey Show&rdquo;. I suppose this is part of the normal political banter.</P><P><?oasys _el10-?><?_is0p10-?>Amendment put.</P>
