   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 6 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, Members may share time and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; and No. 2, Finance Bill 2004 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 6 p.m. and to conclude not later than 8.30 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes,  those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, Members may share time and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not opposing the Order of Business, although we are resolutely opposed to the cutbacks being introduced in the Social Welfare Bill. We will make this clear in the House today and tomorrow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the debate.</P></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I warn the House of our resolute opposition to the attack on widows brought about by this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be a matter for the debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We will continue to highlight that in the House.</P>
    <P>On a separate matter, a little like St. Paul on the road to Damascus, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is now moving in the direction outlined by Deputy Richard Bruton some years ago in a document he produced regarding evaluation within schools. I support and welcome the initiative by the Minister who is now talking about introducing a <Col N="1842"/>formal evaluation of schools and ensuring that parents have greater accountability within the school system in terms of examination results and evaluation within the school. Too many children are losing out because of poor school performance and poor performance within the school system. Up to 20% of children are being lost in the education system. I support the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to introduce greater evaluation in the education system. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister on this issue. Fine Gael outlined its support for this measure three years ago and was castigated at the time by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government. Fianna F&aacute;il is now adopting the position outlined by my party. We welcome the U-turn by Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue.</P>
    <P>Regarding the ongoing postal dispute, the Leader has considerable experience as a former Cabinet Minister and will understand the dilemma now faced by the country if the postal service is disrupted for some days. The labour Act of 1991 introduced a code of practice for essential services. I am not aware of any public utility company running essential services which has negotiated such a code between management and unions and that should be introduced. It is wrong that the entire country can be held to ransom in respect of an industrial dispute of this nature. The Government and the Minister responsible have taken their eye off the ball. I ask for a debate on the issue to bring about some reason and to ensure that posted letters will be delivered as soon as possible. One cannot have a proper, functioning, modern economy where the postal service is in dispute. I ask the Government to examine the 1991 legislation and find a means of introducing a code of practice that both management and unions can agree to.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing gives a clearer reflection on how our society has deteriorated as much as the decision which will effectively rob widows of a mere &euro;12 million.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time when the Government will make the case that there are bureaucratic reasons for bringing us in line with the rest of Europe, I ask that we do not become involved in those issues in this House. I am simply asking that whatever the arrangements and the double payments, that the &euro;12 million should be given back and then whatever needs to be done can be done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter can be raised when the House is dealing with the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Cathaoirleach was allowed to have a view he would share my view. It is not about the structure or about the double payment, <Col N="1843"/>but about taking &euro;12 million from people who can least afford it and it should be given back.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is more relevant to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept your ruling, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There was also a Supreme Court ruling on that issue which stated that it was immoral and wrong.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris, please desist and do not interrupt Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and I appreciate his support and protection from the Senator.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to refer to the extraordinary, iconic vision of two bits of a wheelchair and a blob of blood on a Palestinian street as a recognition of how we have entered a new dimension of extra-judicial executions with targets now including political and religious leaders. It seems there is no end to this and we have opened up something to which there is no limit. Whatever the reasons for it, we can not justify internationally the killing of somebody who is a religious leader, no matter how radical or unacceptable he is &mdash; what he says is utterly unacceptable to me. We must believe in the rule of law in a democracy.</P>
    <P>On a minor matter, we were treated to the Minister for Transport opening a brand new railway station and platforms in Dublin. It seems all trains will run better and faster with no delays. I draw to the attention of the House that the Kerry train was ten minutes late again this morning, despite ten new platforms, the spending of &euro;117 million and the assurances given by the Minister for Transport. Maybe he has something against the people of Kerry or the Kerry trains but it is not working. We should not accept a delay of ten minutes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea that the second richest country in the world would descend into controversy over the fact that a Government exists which thinks it is all right to take money away from widows is a commentary on the quality of this country and the values that ten years of this Government have given it. This is so unthinkable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be more relevant to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a debate about the fundamental values of this country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be appropriate to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1844"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not about social welfare. The social welfare changes are a symptom of the collapse of the values of solidarity that the Fianna F&aacute;il in which I grew up, stood for and spent most of my childhood and early adult life struggling to create has now torn apart by insulting the widows by telling them they are an anomaly. The widows of Ireland are victims of cruel injustice in their lives, coupled with a cruel injustice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about sandbags&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is not just that element, but what has happened to what used to be fundamental values here. We can subsidise stallions while we impoverish widows. It is common&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, have we started Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill on the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Social welfare is not the issue here, but the values for which we stand.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of social welfare and I have ruled on that already.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect, Fianna F&aacute;il would love to squeeze this into a social welfare box.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can squeeze to his heart&rsquo;s content on the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a social welfare issue. This is about what we stand for.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should deal with the Order of Business. We are not discussing Fianna F&aacute;il issues or the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about Government values.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, please, Senator Ryan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On values, I reiterate what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said. Something horrible and brutal happened yesterday and, as he said very eloquently, it will be an icon for the future. We need to take a leadership role in this regard, to have the international democratic community say that any society which claims to be democratic but reserves to itself the right to execute anybody it does not like is no longer fit to be classified in the company of democratic societies. Unless the democratic world says that, we are giving a rationale to terrorism for which all democratic societies will pay a price. We have to realise that democracy is based on the rule of law; it is not mob rule. I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on the fundamental issue of what we mean by democratic states and democratic society because <Col N="1845"/>what happened yesterday was an affront to every democratic value.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ensure it is on record that this side is just as condemnatory in its denunciation of what took place yesterday with regard to the murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. Terrorism from whatever quarter has been always condemned in this House. Terrorism from the state is no less terrorism than terrorism from any private army, irrespective, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, of the views held by the sheikh and the possibility that people were sent out as suicide bombers by him. Nevertheless, if the rule of law is subverted, we are on a slippery slope. We know that from our own experience here where, against all the odds, we upheld the rule of law. I am glad the European Union condemned the assassination also in strong terms. One would have expected the United States to be more condemnatory in what it had to say.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Fat chance. They are responsible for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose there is always a temptation to have soundbites on the Order of Business. However, the appropriate time to discuss social welfare matters is on Second Stage of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill. To be fair to Senator Brian Hayes, while he expressed his strong opposition to the Bill, he waited and will, I am sure, be able to make his remarks in the debate. I assume that those who denounce the Bill will be equally strong when it comes to the debate on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>While none of us supports the actions of Hamas, one must deplore what happened yesterday. The Taoiseach, in his capacity as President of the European Union, should call in the Israeli ambassador to ask him what is going on out there. Surely, in making decisions such as this, Mr. Sharon knows the monster he is creating. The tit-for-tat situation which exists in Israel and Palestine is deplorable. The Taoiseach is a respected figure in Europe at this stage and should call in the Israeli ambassador to ask him direct questions about what is happening.</P>
    <P>Representatives of An Post recently came before the relevant Oireachtas committee to present its survival plan. One has to be realistic and recognise that it is in a critical financial situation, and that the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission may be required. While a dispute will cause irreparable financial harm to An Post, I am not sure there is awareness of the critical situation in the company at present.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the views of both sides of the House regarding yesterday&rsquo;s events in Palestine. Ireland has always adopted an even-handed approach to the Middle East problem. We would always support the right of Israel to <Col N="1846"/>exist and to defend its borders, while, at the same time, supporting Palestinian self-determination. However, the ironic aspect of yesterday&rsquo;s events is that Sheikh Yassin was in Israeli custody and was released after two Mossad agents entered Jordan to poison one of his henchmen. King Abdullah of Jordan in a telephone call insisted that the two Mossad agents would be tried in Jordan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was King Hussein.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Due to the fears this caused, the Israeli Government, under Benyamin Netanyahu, released the sheikh and now it has killed him. One has to question where Israeli policy will lead. I am fearful not only for events in the Middle East but for the impact on the towns and cities of Europe, given what happened in Madrid. A heavy burden of responsibility rests on the shoulders of Prime Minister Sharon and his cabinet which, as we all know, is dominated by hard-line, hawkish elements which do not fully represent the views of the vast majority of the Israeli people &mdash; it is the government they are stuck with.</P>
    <P>All sides of the House will agree that the furore which surrounded the anti-social behaviour on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is a timely reminder of what is happening to our society. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attended the House throughout the debate on the Garda Bill, for which we all applaud him. I think I speak for all sides when I ask the Leader to ask him to return to the House to outline the initiation of some radical policies, similar to the initiative outlined recently in the United Kingdom. We must deal not only with what is happening in Dublin but in every town and village, including my own small town of Drumshanbo, which suffers anti-social behaviour also.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may request a debate on the matter. Other Senators are offering to speak and I have allowed the Senator great latitude.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that. I ask the Leader if she would consider bringing the Minister to the House to outline his policies in this regard. It could be in the form of a motion or there could be an all-party approach to the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the situation concerning health, in particular tuberculosis. I raised this issue some weeks ago in the context of the resurgence of the habit of spitting. This is of particular concern given that there is now a resistant strain of TB and that the only consultant dealing with the disease has been removed from Peamount Hospital. In the circumstances prevailing in the country we need a proper service to cater for tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I join colleagues calling for a debate on the Middle East. Sheikh Yassin was a sinister and <Col N="1847"/>fanatical figure and although I question the degree of his spirituality, he was entitled to due process of law. The man was a paraplegic and it was appalling to see him and seven or eight others targeted in this fashion. There is no question that this will do damage. I think of Patrick Pearse&rsquo;s oration at the grave of O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa: &ldquo;The fools, the fools, they have left us our Fenian dead.&rdquo; A new icon has been created and matters have been stirred up. Sinister domestic political motives are involved. This issue was raised earlier and the US has a heavy responsibility because it did not condemn this. Since President Bush was elected the situation has gone downhill steadily because Mr. Sharon operates in the penumbra of morality created by President Bush.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one thing we can do and I ask the Leader to put it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We can operate the human rights provisions of the external agreement of the European Union. We should not be trading with a rogue state. It grieves me to say that because it is a state I love.</P>
    <P>I seek a debate on President Bush&rsquo;s visit. He is perfectly entitled to come here but the citizens of this country also have rights. As an elected representative, I am horrified to learn that our Government will hand a licence to kill to agents of Mr. &ldquo;Gunslinger&rdquo; Bush. This is being done and they are saying they have diplomatic immunity so they cannot be prosecuted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Rubbish.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not tolerable that that warmonger should come here and bring his troops with a licence to kill decent people who are protesting against what he stands for.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>From time to time different embassies contact us about views we express here on different issues or because they want to brief us. That suggests they take account of what is said in the Chamber and that is why I am supportive of the views expressed about yesterday&rsquo;s atrocity, the assassination of an invalid cleric. What worries me particularly when I listen to statements from those embassies&rsquo; home states is that they can be quite ambiguous. For the United States, in particular, to use a word like &ldquo;uncomfortable&rdquo; about that terrible atrocity is certainly prostituting language as I understand it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>One reason I want a debate on this matter is that we tend to have to <Col N="1848"/>raise issues on the Order of Business and gradually people are being confused &mdash; traumatised, in fact. They are not being given the opportunity to have their views reflected by elected representatives in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>When we had a debate on Iraq I went out on a limb, and I am glad I did so. I made a specific pronouncement which concerned me personally and I see no change in the situation except that the arguments which were coming from the protagonists, particularly from the international coalition, are now gone. Does that mean we just park those and forget them? Do we not revisit and analyse those arguments?</P>
    <P>I call for a debate not just on the Middle East and Iraq but on the hypocrisy coming into international debate. If the Seanad gave leadership on this openly, honestly and with integrity we would prove the reason for a Chamber like this. Also, the majority of people, whose views are not being reflected, would then feel at last they had a voice in this democracy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. Well said.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s decision concerning the need for a motorway or dual carriageway to the south-east and that a clear commitment was given before the last election by Senator Dardis that taxpayers&rsquo; money would not be provided for a motorway, will he do the honourable thing by considering his position within the PDs and resigning? Senator Ryan spoke about values and it is important to restore public confidence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking a debate on values, integrity and honesty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the decision by the Minister for Education and Science to open up a debate on the publication of schools&rsquo; performance tables. A related issue concerns how much information should be made available to parents and students who must make decisions about choosing schools. While the Education Act 1998 banned the publication of performance tables, at the other extreme some people argue that raw data should be made available. There are a number of models to consider and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision that information will be made available on such models to all partners in the education debate. I can assure Senator Brian Hayes that when we have such a debate, which I would welcome, we will be more than delighted to engage with him on the issue of U-turns.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is well versed in them. He is the king of the U-turns.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those issues can be discussed during the debate.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1849"/>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Although his party&rsquo;s sojourn in Government was short, we will find sufficient examples.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by one of the teachers&rsquo; unions to invite the Minister for Education and Science to attend its conference in the near future. I never had any doubt about the union&rsquo;s ability to engage in a meaningful debate with the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that the other two teachers&rsquo; unions did not see fit to do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is the Minister&rsquo;s town crier in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to condemn the killing yesterday of Sheikh Yassin which, apart from endangering the lives of Israeli citizens, maintains the never-ending cycle of violence which leads to loss of life on both sides. Although the House was not sitting at the time, it is important also to condemn the killing of ten people last week by two Palestinian suicide bombers in the city of Ashdod.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about the significance of a religious and political leader but I feel it is even worse when civilians are killed while going about their daily business. The Israeli Government is taking the wrong approach and there is dissent within Sharon&rsquo;s Cabinet. In condemning their latest action, we must be clear also about condemning any threats of revenge through suicide bombings. The Palestinian Authority must do the same.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It has. It is on the record that the condemnation came from President Arafat himself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on President Bush&rsquo;s visit to this country. There has been much misinformation on this in recent days, including the issue of diplomatic immunity. The Government has made it quite clear that that case does not arise and that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will lead any investigations concerning the security of the US President. It is important that the police force of our sovereign State should do so. This will also help to dispel some of the myths surrounding suggestions that President Bush should not visit Ireland. It would be a major mistake to put such views on the record of the House. If we were prepared to abandon a visit by the American President, it would give a strange signal to terrorists around the world. Such a visit would obviously be of benefit to Europe and the Middle East.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the chief terrorists is Bush.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on this issue so that the facts can be put on the record.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>On a number of occasions, I have asked the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House to discuss anti-social behaviour on our streets. Today, Senator Mooney has called for the Minister to attend the House to debate the same issue. The appalling events on our streets on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day brought shame on all of us and on our country in front of the many tourists who were visiting. It was not an isolated incident, however, because such events occur daily, although they are aggravated at weekends. The Minister has not turned up in the House to discuss those issues and we were unable to discuss them during the debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill. This is a societal problem as well as a justice problem which must be addressed, but the Minister has ultimate responsibility for the safety of people on our streets.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The deaths of more than 200 people in the bombing in Madrid was appalling but the number probably would have been greater if the accident and emergency services had not worked so efficiently to deal with the 1,500 casualties in a short time. No country is safe from such a catastrophe. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to address Ireland&rsquo;s plan for major catastrophes not only in Dublin but around the country? The accident and emergency services are in chaos and the pre-hospital emergency services are grossly under-resourced. Will the Leader also ask the Minister to outline what Amercian-owned manufacturing facilities will do if people are injured because they must be likely targets in light of the upcoming visit of President Bush? This is a serious issue. The last rehearsal of a plan to deal with emergencies such as this went badly and I hope the Leader will ask the Minister to address this issue in the House as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The issue of the long delays in the taking of driving tests was raised a few months ago. I call again on the Minister for Transport to come to the House to explain what measures he intends to take to address these long waiting lists. It takes more than 60 weeks to get a driving test in Waterford, which is an absolute disgrace. There is a need for urgent action. Waiting lists are not only confined to the health service.</P>

	<P>There was a fire in a hostel in Dublin last weekend and 12 children were rushed to hospital afterwards. It is a reminder to us of the responsibility we, as a nation, have towards those in our care. It has been reported in the UK that there are no sprinkler systems in any of its prisons, with the exception of one prison ship. I do not know what is the position in Ireland but the State has a responsibility to those in its prisons. Is Ireland in the same position as the UK? If so, will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to outline whether he will take steps in this regard to put our minds at rest?</P>
    <P>Prisoners will only be allowed to smoke in prison cells from next Monday and, as a consequence, accidental fires could take place. A total of 670 malicious fires were started in prisons in Britain last year. I do not know the solution but the installation of sprinkler systems would be a step in the right direction. I hope the State has undertaken its responsibility in this area to avoid future catastrophes.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call regarding the Minister for Transport. He opened lovely new platforms at Heuston Station to much fanfare yesterday. This morning the Kerry train was in sight of those fine platforms when it came to a sudden stop. Senator Finucane and a number of Members of the Lower House can attest to this. An announcement was then made that the train was awaiting platform clearance. There is a parking problem in the station.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a technical problem. The entire set-up is wonderful. I am not saying anything against it but there are problems, which I hope are only teething problems. We have been in sight of the platform on several occasions when we have had to wait for ten to 15 minutes. We need to hear from the Minister for Transport on the proposed programme for rolling stock because the travelling public in the south west region and Kerry in particular are treated as second class citizens. I appeal for at least one extra carriage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I join my colleagues in condemning the assassination Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. State sponsored terrorism is not welcome. As somebody who has spent many years in Israel and has great regard for the Israeli people, this is the wrong approach.</P>
    <P>I also join my colleagues in expressing dismay at the behaviour during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day <Col N="1852"/>celebrations. I had the honour of marching down Fifth Avenue in the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade. On my return, I could not believe the reports of public disorder and riots, fuelled by drink throughout the country. It is creating a very bad impression and sending a serious message to visitors. We have to invite the Minister to respond to Members questions on Garda resources and the deployment of the promised additional 2,000 garda&iacute;. If we do not stamp out this behaviour, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations will be banned because the thugs and louts will have taken over. We cannot allow that to happen.</P>

	<P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, raised the whole school evaluation process, which is completely different from the league tables. This point was echoed by another speaker. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is taking a broad view, which should be welcomed. Parents will have a greater say in the running and accountability of the school. We will seek a debate on that matter.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the postal dispute. Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated clearly that the Labour Relations Commission should get involved as the arm of State in the dispute and I hope that will happen. The 1991 code of practice would have been enacted under the legislation, but I am not aware of any semi-State company that uses it to effect.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of the &euro;12 million due to widows. I have looked into that technical matter and Members may raise it during the debate on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004. I speak as a widow who is at work, but I know many others who need this money.</P>
    <P>All Members were horrified by the assassination Sheikh Yassin. In his report Mr. Robert Fisk wrote that it sure took some courage to kill a man in a wheelchair. That is exactly what happened. A man who could not walk and defend himself was assassinated. It was an atrocious act to gun down a man who could not take cover or hide. However, when we come to the issue raised by Senator Tuffy, we will consider the other side.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also raised the issue of trains travelling from Kerry to Dublin. I think the gremlins might be stronger in Kerry than elsewhere. Certainly everything else is stronger there.</P>

	<P>We will have to invent a moveable platform. Senator Ryan spoke about the unthinkable act of taking money from widows. We will hear what the Minister has to say today, which will be very useful. The issue of terrorism in Palestine was also raised. There was <Col N="1853"/>a debate on the matter on the radio as I travelled to Dublin early this morning. It was mind boggling. It is as if the Israelis are programmed to say the same thing all the time. Senator Dardis referred to the terrible event of the assassination of Sheikh Yassin as well as to Second Stage of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Senator Finucane requested that the Israeli ambassador be invited to the House to account for his country&rsquo;s activities, particularly the latest atrocity. That request will be passed on to the office of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the Middle East question and referred to Mr. Sharon who congratulated himself and his cabinet on what had happened. It is mind numbing. Senator Mooney also spoke about the anti-social behaviour of people on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. No. 12 on the Order Paper deals with over-indulgence in alcohol. While we all express our abhorrence of this behaviour, we must look at ourselves too. I do not refer to Members in particular, but to older, middle-aged people. We are part of society and we cannot simply stand back and condemn a group. We have all contributed to the conditions which have led to circumstances in which it is unsafe to leave one&rsquo;s house at night in certain areas. There is a limit to what a Minister or garda&iacute; can do, no matter how many of the latter are on the street.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris expressed worry about the resurgence of tuberculosis. I understand a consultant has taken a matter to court in this regard. The Senator then referred to President Bush. I saw and heard Commissioner Conroy who said quite clearly yesterday that it would be a matter for the Garda to enforce the law if there was any breach thereof. I am satisfied by that.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comment was highly significant. Like the Senator, I have never diverged from the facts on the Iraq war which some of us here expressed clearly. I am glad that on at least one issue I made up my mind correctly very early on. There is a need for a debate on the manner in which international figures and events are shaped by the people. When there is hypocrisy, why does everybody seem to forget it straight after it has happened? They pass on to other matters as if the hypocrisy did not matter. Daily, we hear that the link it was attempted to forge in the public mind between al-Qaeda and Iraq never existed. That was done to make people feel better about an invasion which was utterly wrong. I will seek to provide for a debate along those lines.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne spoke about the NRA and the dual-carriageway to the south-east. He should take the matter up directly with Senator Dardis as I am tired of listening to the two of them.</P>

Senator Tuffy said it was important to consider suicide bombings and the ten Israelis who were killed last week also. That is true but the horrendous nature of yesterday&rsquo;s killing has felled us all.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley said it is important that the Garda would monitor the entourage of President Bush and said he would welcome a debate on whether the President should come here. Senator Terry spoke about anti-social behaviour and pointed out that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had not come to the House. I checked and found that the Minister had attended the House on more occasions than any of his Cabinet colleagues. While I understand that he has been here to discuss legislation, he is very assiduous about attending both Houses.</P>

    <P>Senator Cummins referred to social welfare. He also spoke about delays of up to 60 weeks experienced by people awaiting driving tests. This is of great disadvantage to people who want to comply with the law.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to a British report on the absence of sprinkler systems in prisons. I understand the Government there has now taken action on foot of this report &mdash; I knew of one of the people who died in the fire &mdash; and has said that every hostel or nursing home should also have sprinklers. I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the position here.</P>

   <Title>Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004: Second Stage.</Title>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm bheith ar ais ar&iacute;s sa Seanad agus an Bille seo &aacute; chur os a chomhair. I am pleased to bring this Bill before the Seanad. As has been the case in previous years, this is the second of two Bills to complete the implementation of the &euro;630 million social welfare package of budget 2004, which brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure this year to over &euro;11.26 billion. This is a 7% increase over and above the allocation for 2003.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that a separate Bill was enacted in December last to give effect to the increases in weekly social welfare payments from the beginning of January. In addition to a range of other measures, this Bill implements a number of key improvements in social welfare schemes, including increases in child benefit; improvements in the carer&rsquo;s respite care grant; increases in death benefit pension payable to recipients aged 80 years and over; and improvements in the payment after death arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that this Bill is yet another step in the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to fostering an inclusive society. Tangible evidence of delivering on this commitment includes a massive increase in spending on social welfare to more than &euro;11.26 billion in 2004. This is almost double that available in 1997. It also provides substantial increases in child benefit resulting in the rates of payment being more than three times that payable in 1997.</P>
    <P>It also includes real increases in social welfare pensions, with old age contributory pensioners now receiving &euro;167.30 per week compared to the equivalent of &euro;99 in 1997, as well as an average real increase, over and above the CPI, across all social welfare schemes of 3.43% since 1997.</P><Col N="1856"/>
    <P>I am providing for significant amendments to the social welfare code and the Pensions Act 1990 in this Bill. These include the introduction of an habitual residence test for certain social welfare assistance schemes and child benefit, the definition of &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo; for administrative schemes and provisions to ensure equal treatment in occupational pensions schemes.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of concerns regarding access to the Irish labour market and the social welfare system following accession on 1 May 2004. Ireland is in favour of enlargement of the European Union. We are champions of enlargement, as we have experienced at first hand the opportunities accession to a greater Europe have presented to our country. I have no doubt that a similar opportunity will present itself to the ten accession countries and, equally, we too will grow economically and socially as the EU horizon stretches further eastwards.</P>
    <P>After 1 May, citizens of the new 25-state European Union will be free to travel anywhere within that union. Workers will be free to travel to any other member state to improve their own social condition, to earn a wage and to contribute to their new country of residence. Ireland is a growth economy, with a need for workers, and those new workers are welcome to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government gave a commitment that EU citizens who want to come and work here from 1 May can do so and we will honour that commitment. However, the Government has decided to take certain prudent measures to ensure that the social welfare system does not become overburdened. The introduction of an habitual residence test will act as an additional condition to be satisfied by a person claiming a social assistance payment or child benefit and is designed to restrict access to such payments for people from other countries who have little or no connection with Ireland.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the social welfare code, the definitions of the words &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; and &ldquo;couple&rdquo; refer to a married couple or to an opposite sex cohabiting couple. These definitions apply both to the statutory schemes, such as weekly social welfare payments, and to the non-statutory schemes such as free travel, free electricity and free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>In general, when entitlement to social welfare benefits, whether statutory or non-statutory, is determined, members of same sex couples are treated as individuals. In other words, entitlement is assessed without any reference to the claimant&rsquo;s partner, which, in the main, is more advantageous to the person concerned. In 2003, however, a case was taken against my Department by the Equality Authority on behalf of a same sex couple, where the claimant was granted a free travel pass in his own right, but had been refused a married-type pass which would include his partner. The basis for the refusal was the definition of a couple contained in the social welfare code, which does not extend <Col N="1857"/>to same sex couples. Legal advice indicated that this refusal amounted to a breach of the Equal Status Act by discriminating against the claimant on the grounds of sexual orientation. It was considered that my Department was according differing treatment between opposite sex and same sex couples in the free travel scheme. In this instance, a married-type travel pass was issued. The net effect, however, is substantially differing treatment of couples, depending on whether the benefit at issue is non-statutory or is provided for in legislation. This position is not sustainable and must be addressed and I am doing so in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also providing in the Bill for amendments to the Pensions Act 1990. In particular. I am providing for an amendment to Part VII of that Act, which deals with equal treatment between men and women in occupational pension schemes. The amendments to this section are intended to meet this State&rsquo;s obligation to implement European Community initiatives provided for under Council Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC adopted under Article 13 of the EC Treaty, in so far as they relate to occupational pensions. Senators will already have debated the Equality Bill, which provides for the transposition of these directives with regard to other employment matters.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 2000/43/EC, the race directive, sets out the framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin in both employment and non-employment areas. Council Directive 2000/78/EC sets out the framework for combating discrimination associated with employment and occupation on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>In addition to these six grounds, and in line with a commitment in the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, it is also proposed to extend Part VII of the Pensions Act to include the marital and family status and the Traveller community grounds. Taken together with the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000, which prohibit discrimination in employment and access to goods and services, the amendment to Part VII of the Pensions Act 1990 ensures a coherent and consistent approach to equality across the legislation.</P>
    <P>I now wish to outline the provisions contained in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004. As Senators will already have considered it in detail, I will focus on the key provisions.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is a universal payment made directly to families and is the most efficient and effective way in which the Government can channel support to children. The rate for the first two children will be increased by &euro;6 per month and for the third and subsequent children will increase by &euro;8 per month. These increases, provided under section 3, will bring the monthly rates to &euro;131.60 and &euro;165.30, respectively. From next month, a family with three children will <Col N="1858"/>receive &euro;428.50 compared to the current payment of &euro;408.50. This marks an increase of &euro;20 per month. These increases will mean that since 2000, child benefit rates will have risen by &euro;77.64 per month for each of the first two children and by &euro;94.20 per month for the third and subsequent children. This measure continues the strategy of reforming income support for children by making child income support more neutral in the context of parental employment and reducing employment disincentives. An estimated 524,000 families with more than one million children will benefit from these increases in 2004.</P>
    <P>Over successive budgets the Government has introduced measures to develop the services and supports which provide practical assistance to carers. An Agreed Programme for Government included commitments to expand the income limits used to determine entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance and to increase the value of the carer&rsquo;s respite care grant. Measures aimed at addressing these commitments were announced in the budget and, accordingly, the amount of income disregarded in the means test will be increased to &euro;250 in the case of a single person and to &euro;500 in the case of a couple. These improvements will be provided for in regulations due to be published next month.</P>
    <P>In section 4, the Government is continuing to honour its commitment to support the valuable work undertaken by carers by increasing the annual respite care grant by &euro;100 from &euro;735 to &euro;835, while carers looking after more than one person will receive a grant of &euro;1,670. This marks an increase of &euro;200 which will take effect from June next. This measure, highly valued by carers, will benefit some 24,300 carers and will cost an additional &euro;2.48 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The six weeks payment after death arrangements were designed to cushion and support the financial transition for the surviving spouse or partner following the death of a recipient of certain social welfare benefits. Currently, payment of the existing rate of benefit or allowance to the spouse or partner of the deceased continues for the six weeks immediately following the death of the recipient. While these arrangements are applicable to the majority of social welfare schemes, there are a small number of exceptions. In these circumstances the surviving spouse or partner may not be in a position to benefit from the scheme. As the final part of my ongoing efforts to reform this scheme, all such anomalies will be removed from the governing legislation. Accordingly, section 5 provides that the six week payment after death will be extended to those benefits and allowances which would heretofore have been excluded from this payment arrangement. This provision will come into effect this June and completes the scheme&rsquo;s restructuring.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an increase in the death benefit pension for recipients aged 80 years and over to &euro;173.70 per week. This increase harmonises the rates of death benefit pension, <Col N="1859"/>widow&rsquo;s contributory pension and widower&rsquo;s contributory pension for pensioners aged over 80 years with effect from this May. Section 7 provides for an increase in the minimum amount of unemployment assistance payable where the claimant&rsquo;s means are derived from parental income. The payment is increased by &euro;8.20 per week, bringing the minimum amount payable from &euro;31.80 to &euro;40.00, provided that the claimant establishes an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance. This measure will come into operation shortly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform established a working group to review and make recommendations on improving maternity protection legislation. On foot of the group&rsquo;s deliberations, the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 was published which provides <i>inter alia</i> for a range of improvements in the maternity leave arrangements. It is my intention that these improvements should be reflected in the social welfare code. Accordingly, the Bill provides for a number of amendments to the maternity benefit scheme operated by my Department, consequential to the amendments to the maternity leave arrangements. Under the proposed new leave arrangements, the minimum period of maternity leave that must be availed of before the expected date of birth of the child will be reduced from four weeks to two weeks.</P>
    <P>The maternity benefit payments are scheduled to coincide with the maternity leave timeframe. Section 8 of the Bill provides that a similarly amended arrangement will apply to maternity benefit payments. The section also provides for the power to make regulations, when an infant is hospitalised, to permit the interruption of the normally continuous period of maternity benefit payment. I plan to bring the measures into force by means of a commencement order, timed to coincide with the implementation of the amended maternity leave arrangements.</P>
    <P>The maximum duration of adoptive leave is linked to the maximum duration of maternity leave excluding the period before the birth of the child. As a consequence of the proposed reduction by two weeks of the minimum period of maternity leave required to be taken prior to the expected date of birth, the maximum duration of adoptive leave will increase by two weeks, from 14 weeks to 16 weeks. Section 9 provides the legislative basis for the consequential increase in the duration of adoptive benefit, which is the income support payment paid by my Department to qualifying adoptive parents. The amendment will be brought into force by means of a commencement order, timed to coincide with the implementation of the amendments in the adoptive leave arrangements.</P>
    <P>A person&rsquo;s entitlement to short-term insurance-based social welfare schemes, such as unemployment or disability benefit, is determined on the basis of social insurance contributions paid during the course of the <Col N="1860"/>&ldquo;contribution year&rdquo;. The contribution year did not coincide with the calendar year before the alignment of the income tax and calendar years, with effect from January 2002. Special arrangements were put in place to secure the continuity of entitlement to short-term benefits following the alignment of the tax and calendar years. Section 10 provides for the continued application of the arrangements for the purposes of the social insurance schemes.</P>
    <P>In An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government agreed to modernise public services to make them more relevant to citizens. We promised to improve access to public services by providing them electronically. The progress of the use of the personal public service number as a public service identifier is a key element of the e-government strategy. In that context, section 11 of the Bill provides for four new agencies to be added to the list of specified bodies that are authorised by legislation to use the PPS number during their customer business transactions. The new agencies are the Companies Registration Office, Enterprise Ireland, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Act 1990 requires employers who do not provide a pension scheme for employees to facilitate access to at least one standard personal retirement savings account for such employees. Section 12 provides that when a social welfare inspector is conducting a PRSI investigation, he or she will also investigate compliance with the requirement to facilitate employee access to a PRSA in accordance with the requirements of section 121 of the Pensions Act 1990. Where necessary, the inspector will report issues relating to non-compliance to the Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>Budget 2003 proposed the application of PRSI to benefits-in-kind granted to employees, with effect from 1 January 2004. The provision is important because it enhances overall equity and improves the coherence between the PAYE and the PRSI systems. Section 13 provides for technical amendments to the definitions of PRSI contained in social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 of the Bill provide for the charging of PRSI in cases when an employer has reached an agreed settlement with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of benefits-in-kind that are irregular in nature and minor in monetary terms. Contributions paid in accordance with that provision will not be reckonable for the purposes of establishing entitlement to benefits under the social welfare code because they will, in general, reflect an underpayment of PRSI for which a contribution has already been recorded.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill provides for a minor technical amendment consequential to the change to the definition of PRSI contained in section 13. As I have already outlined, the provisions of section 17 and Schedule 1 to the Bill are designed to limit access to certain schemes. They will entail the application of a new habitual residency test. <Col N="1861"/>which will become an additional qualifying condition for the purposes of child benefit and certain social assistance payments. Claimants will be required to provide evidence that they have been habitually resident in the State, or within the common travel area of the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, for a substantial continuous period. If they have been present in the State for less than two years, they will be presumed not to be habitually resident and the onus will be on them to prove otherwise. If they have been in the State for more than two years, they will still be required to satisfy the general habitual residence requirement.</P>
    <P>The application of a residence condition is not exceptional in Europe, as most countries implement a form of it. The UK has operated an habitual residence test for some ten years. The European Court of Justice has set down the various factors which would have to be taken into account in assessing habitual residence. In implementing this provision, my Department will consider the applicant&rsquo;s length of residence in the State, continuity of residence in the State, employment prospects, reasons for coming to live in the State, future intentions and centre of interest such as family, home or other connections in the State. Those who claim social assistance payments but do not satisfy the habitual residency test will be assisted to return home and the necessary arrangements will be made in co-operation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>As I outlined, a key objective of the Bill is to remove the difference between the statutory and administrative schemes in the treatment of couples. Sections 18 and 19, which define &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; for the purposes of both scheme types, are designed to restore the position which obtained before the decision in the free travel case I mentioned earlier. I stress that the measure is an interim solution, pending an extensive review of the social welfare code in the context of the principles of the equal status legislation. The purpose of the review will be to ensure that any difference of treatment on any of the discriminatory grounds are justified by a legitimate social policy objective and that the means of achieving that objective are necessary and appropriate. It is expected that the review will take some years to complete, as it will examine complex issues with potential implications for matters outside the scope of the social welfare code. The review will be conducted in consultation with interested parties, including other Departments. The proposed format will be agreed with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 mirror the provisions regarding the assessment of cases where an employer has reached an agreed settlement with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of benefits-in-kind that are irregular in nature, minor in monetary terms or involve non-cash remuneration. The sections in question amend <Col N="1862"/>the Health Contributions Act 1979 and the National Training Fund Act 2000 to facilitate the application of health contributions and training levies to the settlement figure agreed.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill provides for a number of amendments to the Pensions Act 1990. Part VII of the 1990 Act is being extended to apply to eight additional grounds: age, religion, sexual orientation, disability, race, marital status, family status and the Traveller community ground. The extension of the equal treatment provisions is required under two EU directives and on foot of a commitment in Sustaining Progress. Where feasible and appropriate, section 22 implements the directives in a way that applies their provisions consistently in respect of occupational pensions and other conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>Occupational pension issues are different from other conditions of employment, however, and certain practices will continue to be permitted, notwithstanding the prohibition on discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, marital and family status. Occupational pension schemes will continue to have the scope to set the length of service, for example, or the age for admission to the scheme or entitlement to benefits, such as normal retirement age. The schemes will be able to use age in actuarial calculations and to set age or service-based contribution rates in defined contribution schemes. An employer may increase contributions in line with an employee&rsquo;s age, for example. Similarly, the provision will apply to accelerated accrual based on service or age in defined benefit schemes. Occupational pension schemes will have the scope to pay survivor&rsquo;s benefits to the legal spouse only. If a scheme pays to partners of the opposite sex, it must also pay to partners of the same sex. The schemes will be able to pay enhanced benefits to persons retiring early on grounds of disability. The practice of permitting payment only to the legal spouse will be reviewed, <i>inter alia</i>, in light of the outcome of the review of this issue in public sector schemes announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, at the time of the budget in the context of the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, it is important to ensure a coherent and consistent approach to equality both in our legislation and in the way our legislation is administered and enforced. For this reason I have provided in the Bill that pension scheme breaches of the principle of equal pension treatment will be dealt with by the equality tribunal, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, under the procedures and machinery used for dealing with employment matters. This will result in a seamless approach to complaints irrespective of the area of employment to which they relate. However, pensions can be complex and require specialised knowledge. For this reason I have provided that the pensions board will provide technical assistance as required.</P>

	<P>That is not what we are doing.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the matter of redress. Pensions are exceptional in that what we do today affects our future entitlements rather than current or historical ones. Therefore, I have provided in this Bill that where a rule of a scheme is found to be in breach of the equal treatment principle, it will be rendered null and void and the more favourable provisions must be retrospective to December 2003 or July 2003 &mdash; the dates from which the directives apply.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate to have any time limit for initiating a claim while a person is still in the employment to which the claim relates. Therefore, the only time limit I have introduced is six months from the date that employment ends. This is consistent with the provisions of domestic pension law and with law stated by the European Court of Justice.</P>

	<P>If the Senator had been here for my initial comments he would understand what is going on. It might be best if he was careful in his consideration of the complexities of equality on the basis of equal treatment. Many people who thought they were in a particular position changed their points of view when I indicated to them that it may be detrimental to their interests to have the ethos of equality administered. It is on that basis that, as I indicated in my speech, I will be reviewing this issue in its entirety, taking into account its complexities and its relevance not only to the social welfare code but to tax law and many other legislative provisions within the State.</P>
    <P>I am providing in section 23 and Schedule 2 of the Bill for additional amendments to the Pensions Act 1990. These are mainly technical in nature and a number of them are consequential on the equal treatment provisions.</P>
    <P>This Bill builds on the progress made in the area of social inclusion by this Government. It is based on objectives contained in the programme for Government and the commitments made in the social partnership document, Sustaining Progress, and reflects the principles of the revised national anti-poverty strategy. It also contains measures designed to ensure prudent management and robust safeguards for the social <Col N="1864"/>welfare code. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. In November 2003 the Minister announced 16 cutbacks in various social welfare benefits. We on this side of the House highlighted the difficulties that would arise as a result of many of these cuts but she ploughed ahead. Typically of this Government, the Minister targeted the less well-off and marginalised sectors of the community while creating tax breaks for the rich and powerful. This is par for the course for Fianna F&aacute;il and, of course, the PDs, whose members do not even pretend to have a social conscience any longer.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers are often forgotten people in this country. What was the Minister thinking when she slashed &mdash; she may prefer the word &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo; &mdash; the allocation for widows and widowers? This will cause hardship for more than 2,000 people. Working widows who are paying full PRSI contributions should be entitled to full disability or unemployment benefit when they need it. Entitlement for new claimants to the half-rate payment has been discontinued, which is an absolute disgrace. This will result in estimated savings of &euro;5.8 million in 2004 and &euro;12 million in a full year. How can the Minister justify this action when the social insurance fund is &euro;1.3 billion in surplus and when public finances were found to be better off by &euro;500 million a week after the announcement of these cuts?</P>
    <P>Is there any sense of justice or fairness left in this Government? Even at this stage the cutbacks targeting widows and widowers could be reversed. Surely the Minister or her masters in the Department of Finance must recognise that this cutback is not fair. The National Association of Widows in Ireland has vowed to take this issue to Brussels if it does not obtain satisfaction. I appeal to the Minister to have a heart and admit she made a mistake. I understand from today&rsquo;s newspaper that she is meeting the widows&rsquo; association today. Perhaps she could let us know the outcome later. I hope she will reconsider her decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister also withdrew certain social welfare entitlements from same-sex couples recently. The change goes against the High Court ruling which resulted in gay couples winning the same entitlements to non-statutory benefits, such as free travel and free electricity, as married couples. In statutory payments, married couples are also discriminated against. If both partners are in receipt of benefits, one partner receives significantly less than the other for no other reason than that he or she wears a wedding ring. Same-sex couples both receive 100% of statutory benefit payments. It is of little comfort to widows, widowers and lone parents to know they are not alone in being discriminated against by the Government. They are part of a much larger and fast-growing group of forgotten people who are suffering the brunt of the Government&rsquo;s pre-<Col N="1865"/>election spending binge. I implore the Minister to reconsider her decision and reverse these shameful cutbacks, which will inflict much hardship on the poorer sections of our community.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has some very positive aspects which are to be welcomed, although it is my duty as Opposition spokesperson to highlight its inadequacies and raise issues which require greater priority and attention. I particularly welcome the extension of the period in which benefits are paid to a surviving spouse on the death of a person receiving benefits. That income was withdrawn immediately upon the death of a person receiving benefit added to the grief of the surviving spouse and resulted in many cases in economic hardship for the household. In section 8, which deals with maternity benefit, I welcome the reduction of the period of pre-confinement from four weeks to two weeks. The suggestion came from this House during discussion of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill. I am glad the Minister is prepared to listen to the laudable and constructive suggestions made in this House.</P>
    <P>One of the most neglected groups in society, which also suffers the greatest stress, consists of those who care for ill and disabled family members. The financial and social sacrifices they make save the Exchequer billions of euro because without their care, love and hard work, many more people would have to be cared for in Government-funded care facilities. The increase of &euro;100 in the respite grant is welcome, as is the doubling of this figure for a person caring for two people. In some cases people look after three or more people and I ask that they also receive a <i>pro rata</i> increase. It would be extremely unfair if this did not happen. For the amount of people involved, the cost would be negligible.</P>
    <P>The cost of buying a week or fortnight&rsquo;s care in any nursing home is increasing at an alarming rate at a time when the Government is giving generous tax breaks to developers of private nursing homes. While this policy may address the lack of capacity in public hospitals, some mechanism must be found to compel the people who benefit from these tax breaks to cap the amount they can charge for beds in these establishments, especially for relatives of people in receipt of a respite grant who require a badly needed break and at a time of the year when they see fit to take such a break.</P>
    <P>I am firmly of the view that there should be a shift of caring resources towards home care and that a home-based subvention system should be established. It would be far better for sick or disabled people to be looked after in their own home and environment with a proper support system.</P>
    <P>The current system has an in-built bias towards institutional care. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs which produced a report on carers in November last <Col N="1866"/>year. It forcefully recommended the need to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme to maximise support for home care. This recommendation accords with the view of the Government as expressed in the health strategy documents but action rather than words or reports is now required.</P>
    <P>The increases in child benefit amount to approximately 20 cent a day. This Government and the Minister for Finance, in particular, gave a solemn commitment to increase child benefit rates by 2005 to &euro;149.90 for the first and second child and &euro;185.40 for the third and subsequent children. The gap to be filled in budget 2005 is &euro;18.30 and &euro;20.10, respectively, and I hope this promise is honoured and not abandoned like so many other promises made by the Government.</P>
    <P>The real value of the increase in child benefit can be judged after taking into account the effect of inflation which according to the budget will be 2.5%. Looking at the rates for the first and second child, inflation erodes &euro;3.14 of the monthly increase. The real increases for children is therefore only &euro;2.86 a month, which equates to 66 cent a week and 10 cent a day. I ask the Minister if this is a suitable response to Ireland&rsquo;s child poverty problem.</P>
    <P>To quote the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, &ldquo;Despite the availability of resources, Child Benefit was increased less than half of what is required just to keep pace with the commitments made in Sustaining Progress.&rdquo; The negative impact from failing to provide the necessary child income support to meet the 2007 child poverty target is aggravated by the 16 cuts the Minister is implementing and the failure of the Government to meet the commitment contained in the health strategy in 2001 to extend medical card eligibility to a further 200,000 households. There are thousands fewer people eligible for medical cards now compared to when this commitment was given. The Taoiseach gave a commitment prior to the last election that 200,000 extra households would be eligible for medical cards. This is another promise on medical cards which has not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The cuts in supplementary welfare allowances such as rent, cr&egrave;che and diet supplements further compound the income poverty and lack of access to services experienced by many Irish children. The child dependant allowance, which is targeted at children in families in deepest poverty, was frozen for the ninth consecutive year. According to the Combat Poverty Agency, the value of the child dependant allowance has decreased by 25% in real terms since 1994.</P>
    <P>I will not deal in detail with each of the 16 cuts the Minister signed into law in January but each and every one of them is inflicting unnecessary hardship on the weakest members of society. It is the Minister&rsquo;s duty and that of this House to ensure these people are protected. I suggest that the Minister is failing the poor and the marginalised in this instance.</P><Col N="1867"/>
    <P>On the issue of the personal public service number, I welcome the inclusion of the additional agencies outlined in section 11 which are authorised by legislation to use the PPS number as a public service identification. I hope the personal information contained will continue to be confidential and used only by agencies for the purpose for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>As our population ages, successive Governments have been making provision for the increasing numbers in the pension age group over the next 20 years. The PRSA scheme has been put forward as the main solution to the pension problem. While it is early days yet to have any definite news on the uptake, I ask the Minster to indicate the compliance of employers in providing access to PRSAs for their employees.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very comprehensive and very technical in many areas. The sections which affect individuals and families will be those raised at politicians&rsquo; clinics around the country. &ldquo;A lot more to do&rdquo; is certainly an apt slogan where social welfare is concerned.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to dealing with that issue. With respect to some of the issues raised by the Senator, I intend to speak about child benefit later in the debate. In 1996 when the Opposition was in Government, the child benefit increase in that year was £2 on £36.82, which is an increase of &euro;2.54. Unfortunately, I do not have my calculator with me but that amount is a lot less than five or ten cent a day. If the Opposition Members are complaining about what this <Col N="1868"/>Government is introducing, they should leave child benefit alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should stick to the promises it made.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because this was the Government that three years ago brought in the single biggest increase ever in child benefit, a measure of which I am particularly proud. If the Opposition wants an argument, it should argue about other issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We will see if the Government will honour the promises in next year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not argue about issues like child benefit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Cox to continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>This Minister has brought before the House a Bill that deals with the single biggest expenditure on social welfare packages since 1997. Child poverty is being addressed by this Government not just by means of the child benefit payment. The Government is examining a range of measures directed at child poverty. There are issues such as uniform allowance and direct payment for provision of food for children at school. These payments are directed to the family. Child benefit is a family payment, directly focused on the cost of child care. It benefits 524,000 families and approximately 1 million children will benefit from this increase. This is something of which we should be proud. The child benefit payment has been increased and is greater than inflation when calculated on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>We have also examined the carer&rsquo;s respite grant. This Government introduced the carer&rsquo;s allowance and has now introduced the carer&rsquo;s respite grant.</P>
   
    <P>Not only has carer&rsquo;s respite grant been introduced but we have also introduced carer&rsquo;s benefit. We brought in innovative legislation which dealt with the fact that many people, who are in receipt of social welfare payments, choose to take time off from work. With the agreement of the employer, if they have the appropriate number of social welfare contributions, they may apply for carer&rsquo;s leave and maintain all their social welfare, pension and employment rights and, where eligible, be paid carer&rsquo;s benefit. Those who are not working may claim carer&rsquo;s allowance. I wish we lived in a world where all carers could be paid all the money but we do not live in such a world. Every year choices have to be made. We live in a country that is bound by the global economy. Ireland generates its wealth from its economy and we must decide how to spend that wealth.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;15 million on Punchestown.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1869"/>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>We must create an economy that can sustain our commitment to looking after the less well-off, the poor, those with a disability and those on their own. The Minister has increased the carer&rsquo;s respite grant to &euro;835. That grant is one of the most welcome cheques in any household in a year. It is not just a grant that goes directly to the carers of older people, but to the parents of children with a disability. It can sometimes pay for a most needed weekend away. The income disregard has been increased to &euro;250 per week or &euro;500 per couple. That means more people are receiving carer&rsquo;s allowance on a weekly basis. It would be great to get rid of the income disregard and to give carer&rsquo;s allowance to everybody but that is not possible. Every year we chip away at ensuring that more people are eligible to claim carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
    <P>The death benefit pension is being increased to &euro;173 per week. In association with the Department of Health and Children, the Minister has taken on board many innovative projects in the area of home care for the elderly. These are being examined and pilot schemes are taking place in the north west and in the Western Health Board region. These pilot schemes are examining how we can look after our people and make the best use of either subventions paid directly to nursing homes or, instead of being paid to a nursing home, to carers as a way of setting up a system of care where people would not have to go to nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system is about looking after people in most need. That is what this social welfare system does. We provide unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit, child benefit, sick pay benefit and pensions. We have not forgotten promises made. They were not empty promises. We talked about changing maternity leave. Senator Cummins is right that the improvements in maternity leave came from here. That was because Members, and especially the female Members, stood together in the debate with the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and asked him to stand up against what was coming from Europe in terms of improvements in maternity benefit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should stand with the widows now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Senator Terry, and not Senator Cummins, who should take credit for any change in that area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not take credit for it. If the Senator listened he would know I said it came from this House.</P>

	<P>Senator Cox without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare system has seen an improvement of services and reform of the <Col N="1870"/>system. The Department is taking a pro-active role on how to make its information widely available. It contacts people in receipt of benefits to ensure they are receiving the correct benefit or if it is possible to receive a different benefit or allowance that would suit them better. They are invited in to discuss these issues with the Department. I welcome that change.</P>
    <P>The Minister was here a few weeks ago when she brought the Civil Registration Bill before the House. There is an improvement in the delivery of services in the social welfare system. There have been savings of &euro;300 million regarding fraudulent claims in the social welfare system. That money is being put back into the system to improve matters.</P>
    <P>On the issue of widows, I agree with Senator Cummins. One of the difficulties I have had for many years with the social welfare system is the rule whereby a person in receipt of one social welfare payment cannot be in receipt of a second social welfare payment. This is not new. Since I became a Member in 1997 I have been aware of the problem. In the past, if one was in receipt of one payment one could not get a second payment from the Department. There are certain situations where people are discriminated against by virtue of the fact that they are either a widow or widower. I say to the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that this issue needs to be re-examined.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not fair to say we will make this change and that it is justified to save &euro;6 million. It is not justified. The Minister is meeting with the widows&rsquo; association. It is a challenge for us on this side to speak to those involved in this decision to see what can be done to have it reversed. I intend to do my utmost to have that change brought about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Good for the Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the anomalies in the system which mean that those in receipt of social welfare, where they are discriminated against by virtue of the fact that their husband or wife has died, cannot access additional payments. It is important to look at it. I appeal to the Minister to have another look it as I am aware she promised to evaluate the system. Perhaps before Committee Stage we will be able to make those changes.</P>
    <P>A social welfare package of &euro;11.26 billion cannot be scoffed or laughed at. An extra package of &euro;630 million in 2004 or a 7% increase on the 2003 figures, which was agreed in the budgetary framework of 2003, is something of which we should be proud. It is geared towards looking after the less well-off in our communities, the unemployed, child benefit, respite care, respite grant, death grant and so on.</P><Col N="1871"/>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and I am pleased the Bill is before the House. I look forward to the passage of Second Stage this evening and, in the context of the next Stage, the possibility of reversing some of the changes not only in this Bill but in previous Bills.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Henry.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I salute Senator Cox for her brave and honourable contribution here because she did a decent thing when she said she would argue and lobby for certain changes, especially in regard to the most vulnerable and particularly widows. This is necessary. We are disgracing ourselves. I do not ask the House to listen to me or Members of the Opposition but to the Supreme Court because this case was visited in the Supreme Court some years ago. The name of the woman was Susan McHugh. The judges of the Supreme Court found that where this was attempted it was unconstitutional, disgraceful, mean-minded, immoral and unjustifiable. That is the highest court in the land. It is not a partisan attack. I regret that a decent woman, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has been put in this position but she did not get into it by herself. I have been around this place for a long time. She got into it because of pressure from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Finance. It is outrageous to introduce discrimination against some of the most disadvantaged widows and gay people. It is discrimination.</P>
    <P>I was proud on a day some years ago in this House when a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, Mrs. M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, enunciated a principle that should continue to exist in this House, that she would not introduce discriminatory measures unless there were clear, coherent and consistent reasons for doing so &mdash; none had been advanced by the Opposition at that stage. That was a decent line to take.</P>
    <P>The amounts saved in this pettifogging, disgusting exercise are marginal. How can it be justified that approximately &euro;6 million is robbed from widows &mdash; the widows&rsquo; mite &mdash; and a tiny, insignificant amount is taken from gay people? While the Minister said this is done for consistency, I do not believe it.</P>
    <P>Does the Government have a commitment to equality? Why has it appointed to the Equality Authority a gentleman who gave vent to his not very positive feelings about the rights of gay couples on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;? What is the Government at?</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the Minister&rsquo;s speech. I was absent for part of her contribution but left a very important meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to come to the House because I <Col N="1872"/>feel so strongly about this issue. The Minister&rsquo;s explanation was as follows:</P>
    <P LI="1">In general, when entitlement to social welfare benefits, whether statutory or non-statutory, is determined, members of same sex couples are treated as individuals. In other words, entitlement is assessed without any reference to the claimant&rsquo;s partner, which, in the main, is more advantageous to the person concerned.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Fine, but who says it is more advantageous? What about human dignity? Is it all just about money? Is it not about entitlements to equality? I do not believe the Minister is saying that she wants to give some kind of financial advantage to those in gay relationships or that she prefers that situation to marriage and thinks it should be rewarded by the tax structure. That is rubbish and she knows it, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
    <P>Was there consultation with gay groups? I have not heard of any. However, I have been briefed by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and its equality groups, and received a letter from the Equality Authority which included the statement:</P>
    <P LI="1">Niall Crowley, chief executive officer of the Equality Authority, expressed concern at the decision of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to amend the
    Social Welfare Bill. This marks a significant reversal in the work to create a more equal society for gay and lesbian people. The early settlement of the case by the Department of Social and Family Affairs had reflected a valuable recognition for same sex couples. This has now been reversed. The claimant now stands to lose his bus pass.</P>
    <P FLI="0">How mean can one get? The entitlements affected by the cuts represent a catalogue of shame and include the free travel scheme. Does the Government think travel narrows the mind or that people should not be able to get to Dun Laoghaire? They also include the national fuel scheme &mdash; should people be kept cold so that they will be more moral? &mdash; the part-time job incentive scheme, the back to work allowance, the smokeless fuel allowance and the household benefits package. It is outrageous. One would need to be Jonathan Swift to do justice to this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a court judgment, as she did in regard to widows. The equality tribunal was set up and the Minister stated in that regard:</P>
    <P LI="1">...a case was taken against my Department by the Equality Authority on behalf of a same sex couple, where the claimant was granted a free travel pass in his own right, but had been refused a married-type pass which would include his partner. The basis for the refusal was the definition of a couple contained in the social welfare code, which does not extend to same sex couples. Legal advice indicated that this refusal amounted to a breach of the Equal <Col N="1873"/>Status Act by discriminating against the claimant on the grounds of sexual orientation.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Following the passage of this mean amendment, there will still be discrimination but it will be legalised by this House. I am, therefore, ashamed to be in this House today and to be told that the few cent being thrown at gay people will buy them off, which is rubbish. Half the countries of Europe have faced this issue but have not behaved in this way. Israel, which has a stronger religious ethos and from where this discrimination came, has settled a case on this basis and accepts these grounds.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Minister continued:</P>
    <P LI="1">It was considered that my Department was according differing treatment between opposite sex and same sex couples in the free travel scheme. In this instance, a married-type travel pass was issued. The net effect, however, is substantially differing treatment of couples, depending on whether the benefit at issue is non-statutory or is provided for in legislation. This position is not sustainable.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Minister should do something about it. I have almost finished the preparation of a domestic partnership Bill and look to the Government and this House to support it and, if the Government will not support it, to introduce one of its own. The Bill is important and will address issues to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the measures are temporary and will be reviewed. While I accept the Minister is a decent woman, she is under pressure from the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, from where the mean-mindedness comes. It is dreadful and psychologically traumatic to introduce temporary discrimination.</P>
    <P>I wish to record some of the comments made about the Bill. The Equality Coalition states:</P>
    <P LI="1">The amendment to the Social Welfare Bill is discriminatory against gays and lesbians and will affect in particular older couples. The amendment would mean that the Irish government is the only EU country to have introduced deliberately discriminatory legislation.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Government can wriggle as much as it likes but the legislation is discriminatory. It is said that the discrimination is in the interests of those targeted but I do not believe it. This is the first European government in a decade to again begin discriminating and this is to overrule a court judgment. While I will not rehearse the case itself, we are travelling in a totally different direction from the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>A consideration of the case under the European Convention on Human Rights states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Article 8 of the Convention provides that everyone has a right to respect for private and family life. In a seminal case, Karner <i>v</i>. Austria, the European Court of Human Rights ruled <Col N="1874"/>that discrimination suffered by same-sex couples was illegal. Siegmund Karner lived in an apartment in Vienna with his male partner who had started renting the apartment a year earlier. His partner died and left the lease on the apartment to Karner. The landlord tried to terminate his residency and ignore Austria&rsquo;s domestic legislation protecting families renting property, which allows persons living as life partners to leave rental leases to each other. When the case went to the Vienna Regional Court, it decided the legislation in question extended to homosexuals.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favour of the landlord in 1996 and decided not to extend the legislation. However, last year, the case was decided in Strasbourg and the European Court of Human Rights discovered there had been a breach of Article 8. In its judgment, the court stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">For the purposes of Article 14, a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification, that is, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. Furthermore, very weighty reasons [This is the same argument as that made by Mrs. M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn] have to be put forward before the court could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of sex as compatible with the Convention. Just like differences based on sex, differences based on sexual orientation require particularly serious reasons by way of justification.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The British Government just last year, in the Queen&rsquo;s speech, opened up the whole question of same sex relationships, so we are wildly out of sync.</P>
    <P>I am asking, as Senator Cox did in the context of widows&rsquo; entitlements, for this to be re-examined in consultation with the Government&rsquo;s Equality Authority, the decision of which it over-ruled and which it is now trying to over-rule legislatively. I would also like the view of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I am astonished that this should happen. I remember arguing a similar case in this House following one of the budgets of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I instanced a case of two men who had lived together in Cork for 40 years. One was 80 years of age and the other was 70. The 80 year old got Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and, being a caring spouse, partner or whatever one calls him, he put the house in the name of the younger man, who then got cancer and died. The older man was left with a bill of £350,000 for continuing to live in the house in which he was born. On that occasion the Minister understood the human dimension of the discrimination and I am glad to say, with the support of the House, ameliorated that situation.</P><Col N="1875"/>
    <P>I find this a very insulting element of a Bill which otherwise does some good things, like increasing social welfare payments. While I do not know whether decent people on the Government side can vote against the measure, they could lobby to reverse the measure and to support the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department against the mean-minded begrudgery of the Departments of Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They have shamed themselves and the country and they have made me ashamed to be in the Chamber today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time.</P>
    <P>Something that concerns me about the presentation of the Bill is that it seems to be taken as though it is in isolation and does not affect people in any respect other than through increases which are definitely being given. I am most concerned with the appalling decline in the number of people who now have medical cards, and as a pharmacist the Minister of State will know this very well.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago 35% of the population was covered by medical cards and now we are down to 29%, despite the fact that everyone over 70 years is now included as a medical card holder. When the Department of Health and Children was calculating how many people would be entitled to cards it decided it would be between 30,000 and 40,000, though as the Minister knows it was nearer 70,000 people. Despite this huge increase in numbers we still have a drastic fall in the numbers entitled to free medical treatment and the Minister of State will know that is hitting people very hard.</P>
    <P>Married couples earning just over &euro;206.50 per week have to pay &euro;40 to attend a general practitioner and some of them simply do not go because they cannot afford to. There are still people on low pay in the country who would have been covered some years ago, but despite the increases a section of the population is worse off now for health cover than ten years ago. For example, even people with medical cards must pay to see a chiropodist. As the Minister of State knows, it is ten years since there was an increase in the amount of money given to chiropodists for visits by medical card holders. The equivalent of &euro;18 may have seemed fine at that time, and whatever the Minister may feel about people not deserving an increase for their services &mdash; I doubt he feels that &mdash; materials have increased enormously in cost. Older people must now pay a top-up fee to many chiropodists and this is not helped by the fact that there has been no agreement since 1997 on what qualification for chiropody or podiatry is recognised by the Department of Health and Children. These matters are hitting very poor people.</P>
    <P>There is also an increase in the amount people must pay per month &mdash; &euro;78 &mdash; if they are on long-term drug programmes. Many people who are <Col N="1876"/>just outside the medical card threshold are affected by this. Those earning approximately &euro;220 per week have to pay one fifth of their wages for a visit to the doctor while payment for drugs, if necessary, will account for another fifth of their monthly earnings. Those are very large amounts of money for some people and I wish such a huge chasm was not developing between the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs. Those two Departments must work together.</P>
    <P>The Government is proud of the increases it has introduced, which have been very good. At the same time, the cases of those who are losing out must be examined. I remember a triumph for those on low incomes who did not receive the benefits of those on State payments, such as the free telephone allowance. This was when Proinsias De Rossa was Minister for Social Welfare and I explained to him that many people on private pensions got little more than those on public pensions and got none of the benefits. I was glad he extended some of those benefits to private pensioners within 20% of the State pension and I am pleased these have not been touched, as such a move would have been very regressive.</P>
    <P>I have always admired the staff of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in that they try to understand that there are people trying to exist on very limited sums of money. I realise the Government is trying to do its best for them but one Department must look at what is happening in other Departments. People are becoming marginalised and there are problems such as the serious decrease in the number of medical card holders.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, on her excellent speech. As she said, this is the second of two Bills which are necessary to implement the &euro;630 million social welfare package of the 2004 budget. A separate Bill came before us in December which gave effect to significant increases in weekly social welfare payments and allowed the increases to take effect from the beginning of January.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 social welfare payment rates have increased by 62%. If we cast our minds back to 1997, though some on the Opposition benches may not want to do so, the total budget for the Department of Social Welfare for the year was &euro;5.7 billion. This year over &euro;11.2 billion will be spent on social welfare payments, the highest amount in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements key improvements in social welfare schemes including increases in child benefit, improvements in the carer&rsquo;s respite grant, increases in death benefit pension payable to recipients aged 80 years and over, improvements in the payment after death arrangements and a range of other measures. Child benefit payments have more than tripled <Col N="1877"/>since 1997. Senator Cummins used figures and statistics so I feel it is necessary to point some out also.</P>

	<P>Senator Wilson without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>This year over &euro;1 billion will be spent on child benefit. The number of people who qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance has increased by almost 140% since the Government took office. The Bill also provides for amendments to Part VII of the Pensions Act 1990 which deals with the equal treatment of men and women in occupational pension schemes. The Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government promised to increase pensions to &euro;100 per week when it came into office. We have exceeded that figure and we are on target to provide a pension of &euro;200 per week by 2007. Taken together with the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000, which prohibit discrimination in the areas of employment and access to goods and services, the amendment to Part VII of the Pensions Act ensures a coherent and consistent approach to equality across our legislation.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has addressed concerns raised by Members of both Houses about the labour market and the enlargement of the EU. The Government has given a commitment that any EU citizen who wishes to come here to work after 1 May can do so freely. The economy is strong and we will welcome people who wish to come here to work. Last year, 47,000 work permits were issued to non-nationals to help Irish businesses to meet their labour supply requirements. I personally know of many businesses in my own area of Cavan which have employees from the four corners of the earth and pay them well. They are a great asset to the companies for which they work.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct to say that the Government cannot allow our social welfare system to become overburdened. The Government has a duty of care both to social welfare recipients and those who fund such payments &mdash; the taxpayers. The Minister has moved to protect our social welfare system as we approach the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May. The sensible, prudent, fair and reasonable measures the Minister proposes to introduce will ensure that our social welfare system is not overburdened.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cox that the situation concerning widows should be re-examined. Vulnerable widows and widowers are depending <Col N="1878"/>on payments they receive from the Department. It is neither fair nor reasonable to cut them off. I welcome the fact that the Minister is to meet representatives of the National Association of Widows in Ireland this evening. The issue needs to be re-appraised.</P>
    <P>The facts are clear &mdash; the Fianna F&aacute;il-PD Government increased spending on social welfare this year by 7%. For every &euro;10 spent this year, &euro;4 will be spent on social welfare. Never before in the history of the State has any Government put such an emphasis on the social agenda. This week and every week, approximately 970,000 people on average will claim a social welfare payment. The number of low-paid people removed from the tax net has increased. This year, one in three people will pay no tax at all. The Government is putting more money where it is most needed but the Minister cannot do so if there is abuse of social welfare schemes or if money is being wasted. The Minister has engaged in reform to copperfasten the gains already made in our social agenda and to ensure that we will continue to support those who are most disadvantaged and, therefore, most in need of help. Following the budget, the Minister instituted reforms so that taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent on alleviating poverty and disadvantage. In budget 2004, the Minister introduced reforms but she was criticised for putting a cap on the multi-millions given to landlords in rent supplement grant payments. However, as a result of the reforms, rents stabilised or came down. The Opposition predicted dire consequences from the further reform of rent supplements, which are set to cost the taxpayer approximately &euro;325 million this year, but those consequences have not yet materialised. That money goes straight into landlords&rsquo; pockets and was never intended as a response to long-term housing needs. The Minister is working to reform the system, bring this problem to an end and achieve better housing for those in need of rent supplement.</P>
    <P>I recall that in a previous contribution, Senator Cummins mentioned the lack of finance for housing. However, &euro;1.9 billion is being invested in housing this year.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her presentation earlier, and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to the House. The Minister said there was a need for foreign workers, who are welcome, but the habitual residence test sends out a different message. I wonder if such a test is required. Perhaps the Government should have waited to see what measures were actually required to address any social welfare abuses that may arise. Will such a test deter people from coming here or result in some people being sent home whom we should not repatriate? We have made mistakes in the past in our treatment of people coming here to work, such as nurses, because we did not allow their spouses to work here also. As a result we <Col N="1880"/>lost foreign nurses whose expertise was badly needed here.</P>
    <P>Workers from the new accession states will not be tied in to the work permits system so they should be able to change jobs. However, anyone who changes job can be unemployed in the interim, so where will such people stand? They and their children will be discriminated against under the social welfare system. I have no problem with measures aimed at tackling social welfare abuses but I wonder whether the Minister&rsquo;s proposals will deal with such abuses or will penalise workers from the accession states while social welfare abuses by others continue.</P>
    <P>I also wonder about the tests involved, including employment prospects. The situation concerns people who might be here for more than two years; will they also be subject to tests? Who will be affected by these provisions and will they be more far-reaching than the Government intends them to be? The proposal should be reviewed because it is premature.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments concerning the qualified adult administrative scheme. There is an anomaly in the legislation in terms of making a moral judgment. We have no problem in recognising unmarried, mixed sex couples, yet we are not prepared to do the same for same sex couples. Senator Norris outlined the moral reasons for not having this provision but there are also social reasons. People in mutually supportive relationships should be looked after but this provision is a backward step as it undoes a court judgment which found, for good reasons, that the State should act in a particular way. I refer to amendments to inheritance tax provisions. If one member of a same sex or opposite sex couple dies and they have lived in a house for a specific period and fulfilled certain requirements, the surviving member does not pay inheritance tax. There are social reasons for this apart from compassionate reasons. A person should not be thrown out of a house he or she shared with his or her partner because he or she had to pay a major inheritance tax bill. That was a progressive step and nobody complained about it. Similar logic should be applied to this provision. The people involved in such long-term relationships are vulnerable and dependent and we must look out for them. Discrimination should not come into play.</P>
    <P>This provision also differs from the Government&rsquo;s approach to pension provisions. Where a scheme pays partners of the opposite sex, it must also pay partners of the same sex and the Government is doing this for social reasons. It is positive from a societal point of view to look after those who have been in supportive relationships, regardless of their sexual orientation. The Government is prepared to do this in regard to pensions. However, in general, couples who are not married can be discriminated against and the Minister said this would be reviewed. I would very much welcome a review as soon as possible.</P><Col N="1881"/>
    <P>She also stated this provision is an interim measure and the Government will review it but that may take years. I urge that it be reviewed as soon as possible. While I do not agree with it, I do not understand why it should take years, given that the Government introduces other radical measures quickly when it wants to. I do not understand the reasoning behind that.</P>
    <P>Opposite sex couples can take up various schemes that same sex couples cannot but such couples often lose out in terms of social welfare because they are treated as a unit. Same sex non-married couples do not benefit from the tax breaks to which married couples are entitled and that needs to be examined down the line. They are penalised in two contradictory ways.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the increases in income limits for eligibility for carer&rsquo;s allowance and so on. However, four months after the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recommended the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance should be abolished, the Government did nothing and it should give priority to this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the 16 savage cuts, including those being implemented against widows and lone parents. The savings made by these cuts will be minimal and the cost of reversing them would be minimal. I urge, therefore, that the Minister should, like the Minister for Education and Science, ask the Government and the Minister for Finance to find the necessary money to reverse them.</P>

	<P>When the Government wants, it can do so. I welcome the provision for payments after death. I dealt with a constituent recently who lost out on the six week payment covered by the provision. Under the legislation, she will not be paid retrospectively and I ask that such people should receive the payment retrospectively. There was an anomaly in the previous legislation which resulted in unfair treatment of certain people. While it will be reversed under this legislation, people who have lost out over the years should be recompensed retrospectively.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I warmly welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and her Department on continuing to build on the solid foundation stones laid by the previous Government. While there were restrictions on budgets, the Minister managed to secure a 7% increase across the board, which is a phenomenal achievement. Many lives are touched by the social welfare system and employment opportunities have improved significantly. The taxes generated as a result have been re-invested in the welfare system. Many countries, particularly in Europe, look with envy on Ireland when they see how it was done and how the population is benefiting.</P>

    <P>I refer to changes in work permit provisions and people entering Ireland from the accession states. A total of 16,500 of the 47,000 permits granted last year were issued to EU citizens. Following enlargement on 1 May, the population of the EU will expand significantly and it is essential and prudent to protect our welfare system. Every other member state has done so and the Minister should be congratulated on introducing the necessary changes. The introduction of the habitual residence tax will provide an essential protection and it will be applied evenly and impartially. It can only benefit the system as a whole.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome other measures in the legislation such as the equal treatment of men and women in terms of pensions. Ireland is complying with its obligations under EU law. A great deal of work has been done in terms of equality throughout society, particularly in the area of employment. When the Taoiseach was Minister for Labour, he departed completely from previous policy and there was a fight to achieve equal benefits and pay for women. That was not long ago and we have not come that far since but it is great that when the State is in a position to address equality issues for all, it takes them on.</P><Col N="1883"/>
    <P>I refer to the provisions to combat discrimination on race or other grounds with particular reference to the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>This touches on very vulnerable sections of society. It proves the Government&rsquo;s commitment to social inclusion and the welfare of the most vulnerable in society. The increases in child benefit have gone a long way towards creating a level playing pitch, particularly in vulnerable areas. For many years whole sections of the community in the north inner city were devastated by the effects of drugs, unemployment and lack of education. Anyone passing through areas such as Sheriff Street and the north quays will see the dramatic improvements. If one were to suggest less than ten years ago that a third level institute would be located within walking distance of one of the most deprived communities in the country, one would have been laughed at, but that is now a reality with the National College of Ireland located there. Dramatic changes in housing conditions and educational and employment opportunities have meant that from a base where generations of local families had not been in a position to gain employment, their children now are aspiring to work in major banks in the Financial Services Centre. The welfare system played a huge part in those communities.</P>
    <P>Some commentators on child poverty and child care use statistics to back up positions for their own benefit, be it political or financial, which annoyed people in these areas. Child benefit is equitable and fair and the consistent increases in the past number of years has been proven in those areas where it is most needed. I congratulate the Minister on bringing child benefit so far and I urge her to continue this good work.</P>
    <P>Following the payment of a death grant, payments of all benefits and allowance will be extended for a further six week period. After a death, people are at a vulnerable stage and are under severe pressure. Extending all payments for a further six weeks is indicative of the way the Government looks at people&rsquo;s lives and takes account of what every family will experience at some stage. The maternity benefit changes are welcome, in particular in the case of adoptive parents. For many years adoptive parents were ignored and were not granted the same benefits as other parents.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of same sex couples. We have to be progressive and consider the issue because the vast majority of countries in Europe have dealt with it. I think that slowly but surely it will be examined.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunities child care scheme, which is under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has made a serious impact on the provision of affordable child care in areas where the only option for young people with young families was to have the grandparents look after the children, but now, because of this and other schemes, people can <Col N="1884"/>afford to have their children looked after in good quality affordable child care centres. All the grants and benefits ensure that the playing pitch has been made more level and people are able to avail of the benefits due to them because it is easier to apply for them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on her swift response to the current postal strike and the measure she has put in place for people to collect his or her benefits. This is a sign of the Department&rsquo;s proactive role.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Other speakers referred to the fact that, in a global context of expenditure of approximately &euro;12 billion, to take &euro;6 million from widows and widowers in a social welfare code is outrageous. There are more than 120,000 widows and widowers and until now they were entitled to obtain half rate benefit on unemployment benefit or disability benefit as well as the widows or widowers pension. I know that a principle of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is that one cannot claim two benefits, but the essence of a flexible system is to be able to respond to the needs of people.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers have paid into the social welfare fund, which my colleague informed the House is in the black by almost &euro;500 million this year, and we have built up substantial reserves <Col N="1886"/>every year in the past ten years. Having been in a very difficult position ten years ago, the fund is now in a very favourable position. We want the Government to give way on what amounts to almost &euro;6 million to ensure people can continue to claim half-rated benefit under unemployment or disability benefit. This is not asking too much. I was heartened to hear the contributions of the Fianna F&aacute;il speakers this afternoon who urged the Government to perform a U-turn on this issue. A wise Minister for Social and Family Affairs would comply as there is no support for this measure in the country. It is a niggardly proposition and it will be completely opposed here and in the D&aacute;il. I predict that come lunch time tomorrow the Minister will issue a statement indicating her intention to perform a U-turn. She realises, as do many others, that the cutback is utterly unfair and wrong.</P>
   
    <P>I have two points to make on child benefit and one on child dependant allowance. I recognise that there have been significant improvements in child benefit in recent years largely as a result of two national wage agreements put in place by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats coalition. The issue five years ago was whether working people would be given a tax break on the cost of putting children into cr&egrave;ches or a child benefit payment. I accept the argument in favour of a general increase in child benefit for everyone rather than simply providing a tax deductible credit for those who have to pay a considerable proportion of their incomes to provide child care. Despite the resources we have, child benefit was increased by less than half the sum required simply to keep pace with the commitments made in Sustaining Progress. These were absolute guaranteed commitments the Government entered into for the life of the programme. This year alone we have not seen the increase in child benefit promised under Sustaining Progress. To make the increase next year, we will have to travel a considerable distance.</P>
    <P>Looking at the rate for the first and second child, after which one takes inflation into account, the real increase is only &euro;2.86 per month. In Senator Wilson&rsquo;s parlance, this equals 66 cent per week, or less than 10 cent per day.</P>

   </Speaker><Col N="1887"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Senator has done the sums again, she will come to the conclusions I have just outlined.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>The &euro;2.54 was per month, not per day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again, Senator Cox is wrong. I would not be part of the Sustaining Progress partnership programme if I did not believe the Government was sincere in its commitment on child benefit. However, a huge commitment will have to be made next year because we failed to make the full commitment this year. That must be understood by Senators opposite when they rise to speak on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government to which I belonged before 1997 decided not to increase child dependant allowance on a yearly basis. That was a wrong decision by the rainbow coalition as it has been the wrong decision by this and the previous Government since 1997. The only way in which to target additional resources at poorer children is through child dependant allowance. As colleagues will be aware, there has been no significant increase in the allowance since 1994. I disagreed with the rainbow Government&rsquo;s decision and I have continued to disagree since. It is necessary to have some means of reaching out to the 150,000 to 200,000 children living within the poverty trap. Despite the fact that the way to do this is through child dependant allowance, this has not been increased in any Social Welfare Bill brought before this House since 1994. I very much regret that.</P>
    <P>Senator Wilson and others failed, of course, to mention the significant cutbacks which have been made this year. These real cutbacks affecting real people include the cr&egrave;che supplement for child care which has been discontinued. A total of &euro;2.3 million has been lost by the 1,600 families directly affected. The intention to phase out dietary supplement is another point Senator Wilson failed to bring to the attention of the House. It is a further example of the very negatives cuts being made by the Government. Half-rated child dependant allowance is to be discontinued in the context of unemployment and disability benefit claims where the claimant&rsquo;s spouse or partner has a gross weekly income in excess of &euro;300.</P>
    <P>Despite the argument presented by some of my colleagues opposite to the effect that this is a land of milk and honey, circumstances are not as rosy as they would like to pretend. The most sensible way for the Government to proceed on the unjustified cutbacks in the provisions for widows and widowers is for the Minister to fold on the issue in this House tomorrow. I predict she will.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The measure of a Government&rsquo;s caring philosophy is not just found in a Finance Bill, but also in the detail of its annual social welfare provisions. Notwithstanding the grandstanding of certain Opposition Members on a number of issues, a social welfare budget of &euro;11 billion is a remarkable achievement by any <Col N="1888"/>yardstick, particularly in the context of the economic uncertainty obtaining when the Estimates were being drawn up. That fact should not be lost on those who criticise from the sidelines. I do not mean to suggest criticisms, particularly of social welfare provisions, are not justified at different levels. However, I have every confidence that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will robustly defend her position and answer those of her critics who have singled out various aspects of the budgetary proposals which affect her Department.</P>
    <P>My colleagues have outlined the details of the various increases. The word &ldquo;increases&rdquo; is bandied about a great deal when talking about the budgetary provisions of all Governments. The devil, they say, is in the detail although that is more of a legal term than anything else. When one examines the detail of the provisions before the House, one sees the increases are, in many instances, quite substantial. I have benefited as a parent of five children between the ages of eight and 16 from the massive increases in child benefit since 1997. More accurately, my wife has benefited from the increases as she has ring-fenced the money as most mothers and wives do. Indeed, I suggest that is in keeping with the original concept behind what was known as &ldquo;women&rsquo;s money&rdquo;. I welcome, applaud and support these provisions. If I did not, it would not make a blind bit of difference as my wife would not let me see a euro of the money anyway. I have noticed in terms of house management the manner in which my wife manages child benefit to the advantage of our children. I am sure the same is true of households across the country. The money is used wisely. Notwithstanding minor income from other sources, I rely as a full-time public representative on the good offices of the Minister for Finance each year to provide an extra few euro. The child benefit which is provided to our house is an essential plank of our housekeeping budget.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister who managed to fight her corner successfully at a time when most Departments were under severe threat. Last July, Ministers and their Departments set about formulating a draft of the annual Estimates. Things looked fairly grim at that time and growth was not buoyant. Economists, who usually differ more than Cheltenham racegoers, were united in not knowing what way the economy was going to bounce. To have secured significant increases across the board and an overall budget of more than &euro;11 billion in such an environment is a magnificent achievement and one on which I congratulate and applaud the Minister.</P>
    <P>As someone like me, who was reared in the snipe grass of the north west, the Minister knows the value of a euro.</P>

	<P>Neither do we, although we have lots of rushes.</P><Col N="1889"/>
    <P>I wish to dwell on the carer&rsquo;s respite care grant. I am pleased to note that the Minister has yet again increased this grant. While the Minister has had more experience of dealing with the families of carers than me, I know of a family in my home town with two severely handicapped children struck down by a rare disorder. The local community voted the parents of these children people of the year last year. If ever there were saints on earth, these people are certainly saintly. The family gets great support from the community and they welcomed the provisions contained in the budget. The increase is to &euro;250 for a single person and to &euro;500 for a couple. Concerns have been expressed about the respite grant. I hope the Minister takes account of the need and value that is placed on this grant. When she fights for funds later in the year, I hope she continues to fight for increased funding in this area.</P>
    <P>If my memory serves me right, Senator Cox was on the battlements a couple of years ago over the question of means tests for carers. The debate centred on whether the Government should abolish means tests for carers. The financial implication of abolishing the means tests was the main obstacle. While there is no means testing for child benefit, one could argue, perhaps even with greater justification, for the introduction of it. Despite my earlier comments on how essential the increases in child benefit were to my family, my wife and I have discussed this and we feel we could accept the introduction of means tested child benefit. We believe it would help those less fortunate than ourselves and less able to cope financially. Carers have to give commitments that are far beyond the call of duty. The commitment is borne as much out of love and affection as it is out of obligation. The Government should have a soft side. It should say it cherishes carers, ensure money is not a problem and dispense with the means test. I have made this case in the past and I know the Minister is aware of the difficulties facing carers. This care is reflected in the increases introduced this year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the manner in which the Minister moved so quickly to respond to the current postal dispute. I have no doubt that when social welfare recipients, particularly those on the lower socio-economic level, saw the dispute escalating over the weekend, they must have been horrified at the prospects of a nationwide dispute and feared their payments would be denied. The Minister used the media and moved quickly to reassure social welfare recipients their weekly or monthly allowances would not be denied.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to compliment the Minister on the provisions contained in the social welfare budget. I look forward to hearing her rebut some of the criticisms that have been made of it. We have found that some of the earlier criticisms were inaccurate and I hope the Minister has an answer for the criticisms that have been made more recently.</P>

    <P>One of the more disgraceful aspects of this country, which has made the lives of working families increasingly difficult, has been the deliberate attempt to squeeze people out of the medical card system. As I noted in my minor run-in with the Cathaoirleach on the Order of Business, this issue is bigger than social welfare. It is about values. The fundamental value in this instance is about whether one believes we have a society based on solidarity or one based on the notion of &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo;. The Fianna F&aacute;il view of the latter notion, which is perhaps even more extreme than that of the right wing in the United States, is that it takes everything and everyone else must put up with it.</P>

	<P>I always love how Fianna F&aacute;il finds the anomalies at the bottom end of the market. The widows issue was an anomaly. Some other issues were anomalies.

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the other problems that Fianna F&aacute;il has is that while the party has learned to live well, it still cannot acknowledge the fact. The party blames everyone else for eating smoked salmon, as if it were a mortal sin.</P>

	<P>It was far from smoked salmon that Senator Ryan was reared.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister for Finance entertains his very rich friends in the K Club, that is seen as a sign of the country prospering, but when someone from a different political party eats smoked salmon in a small quantity, that is regarded as a sign of some betrayal of some <Col N="1893"/>principle or other. I do not know what the unfortunate fish ever had to do with principles, but it seems to provide Fianna F&aacute;il with endless entertainment. I wish the party would find something new. The notion of smoked salmon socialists is about 25 years old.</P>

	<P>Smoked salmon is a little dated. If the men in this Chamber did their own shopping, they would know that smoked salmon is far from the most expensive commodity. The real problem is that most of the men on the other side of this Chamber would not recognise smoked salmon in a supermarket because they remain traditional men, who believe shopping is women&rsquo;s work. They do not know what is going on in the world.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rhetoric I listened to about child poverty showed an oblivion to the standard way in which it is measured. The Minister might tell me if we have opted out of that. If she accepts the universal index of child poverty used in Europe, Ireland lies towards the bottom of the list. We have remained there as we got rich. Moreover, our expenditure on social protection dropped as we got rich. While other countries use their riches to improve social protection, we have used our riches to look after certain groups which this Government decided were deserving.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those opposite appear to be deriving entertainment from it. The increased benefits such as those for the old age pension and child benefit are very welcome. The tragedy is that up to now, huge gaps were left in our system of social protection and the Government made the gaps wider this year. It did not abandon <Col N="1894"/>certain people which it had looked after over the past six years, but various groups were targeted which were all vulnerable, small and largely inarticulate. The situation is now rebounding on the Government, which does not like it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coughlan. She said in her statement she is proud of the commitment to fostering an inclusive society. If this particular Social Welfare Bill is her contribution to an inclusive society, what about the 16 cutbacks included in it? Considering any one of them, or all together, if this is what inclusiveness amounts to in the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats agenda, then God help those who are really in hardship.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from what we have heard from the Government representatives here today that there are winds of change, particularly in the situation of widows and widowers. It would be great if the Minister would clearly indicate in her concluding speech at the end of Second Stage that she will change this aspect, which for very many people is a serious encroachment on the inclusivity to which she referred. The Minister is causing great hardship, particularly to vulnerable people. She might indicate at an early stage that she is changing her mind, because many of the Senators who contributed on the Government side of the debate clearly do not agree with the current situation. They do not know what will be done, but will impress their feelings on the Minister when she decides to change that aspect of the Bill. We would greatly welcome the change on this side of the House. The hardships resulting from this aspect of the Bill have been highlighted in the media, in this House and in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>The Minister has all but abolished the back to education allowance scheme. It was a very valuable scheme, of great benefit to people who perhaps in the past were, for some reason or another, excluded from the education system, or who have had to leave it because of the inadequacies of the support mechanisms there for the underprivileged and disadvantaged. I do not know how the Minister can reconcile her abolition of the back to education allowance scheme with the stated policy. Without a doubt, the scheme has now been effectively abolished. How can the Minister for Social and Family Affairs reconcile this with the stated policy of the Minister for Education and Science who wants to bring disadvantaged people back into the system? On the one hand, the Minister cannot say he wants to bring people back into the system while another organ of Government excludes people from it. People are too alert to this Government doublespeak.</P>
    <P>In his 2003 budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced a rural social scheme. It was not to come under the brief of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, but of the other coastal and island Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. However, when I tried to ascertain at the Departments of Finance and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht <Col N="1895"/>Affairs what has happened to this scheme, I discovered no one knew about it and that there are not even application forms. Instead, we are informed it will shortly come before Cabinet. The Minister for Finance in December 2003 announced a scheme that people believed was prepared and agreed by various Departments. However, there is no sign of it. It will happen sometime in the future as the Department of Finance, in a cynical way, informs us that Cabinet will agree to it in late April or early May. Lo and behold, it will be announced and put into action just before the local and European elections. If one wants to be cynical about Government schemes, that is the way to go about it. There was to be &euro;10 million available for this scheme yet other sources inform us that it will be far more than that figure. As to how many would take up the scheme, the number of applicants was put at 2,500. Now we are informed it could be far more than that. When can we arrive at a consensus as to what is involved in this scheme, rather than it being another political ploy and promise for which there is no basis? I have never seen a scheme announced on such a basis that then takes four months or more to put in place.</P>
    <P>The criteria given for this scheme are that one has to be a herdowner, on low income and receiving farm assist. It is all about social inclusion.</P>

	<P>The 16 cutbacks in the social welfare budget have been already mentioned, particularly the cutbacks in widows&rsquo; and widowers&rsquo; benefits. However, with regard to the back to education scheme, at the invitation of the Leader of the House, the Minister spoke on it recently and gave undertakings for its future. Yet nothing has been seen since. I hope in her summing up the Minister will indicate her intentions for the scheme and will show her commitment to inclusiveness.</P>
    <P>In the last two years in the Western Health Board area more people have lost their medical card entitlements than ever before. This is not due to anything the Government intended to do, but rather what it did not do in order to bring the limits within reasonable standards. It is serious when people on &euro;160 a week are excluded from medical care. I ask the Minister to reply to the issues raised in an open manner and not to add further confusion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>There were some serious abuses of the back to education scheme which were damaging to the overall scheme. This was a successful scheme that enabled many people to get back into education, gain qualifications and play a meaningful role in the economy and enjoy fulfilment in their careers. However, a small number of people abusing the system brought it into disrepute.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Abuses are what they are called now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Were this not dealt with, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs would have seen the scheme entirely terminated. It is most unfair to make attacks on particular aspects of this scheme without looking at the overall picture. This scheme made a valuable contribution and I compliment the Minister for Social and family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, on her innovative way of addressing it.</P><Col N="1897"/>
    <P>The Minister has made an enormous contribution to the overall development of the social welfare code. Over the last number of years, enormous increases have been made to the social welfare budget. Up to 1 million people now benefit from these substantial increases in one kind or another. This year alone up to &euro;11 billion will be spent on the budget. I recall when I was Minister in the Department for a short time a number of years ago, we would not have contained ourselves if we had that kind of budget. Again, there is this picking on small aspects of the budget and counting the number of cuts. We had a dozen cuts before. No matter who is Minister in the Department, they will always have to apply certain restraints in spending. Otherwise, the future of the social welfare fund itself would be put in jeopardy. I compliment the Minister on the innovative schemes she introduced in this budget. While all Members welcome the increases made, there are limits to what can be achieved and delivered within the spending restraints of each Department. With the guidelines set down by the Government, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has done remarkably well in her welfare brief. The majority of the public is grateful to the Minister for the work she has done in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about a few aspects of the Bill. I hope the Minister responds to my comments if she gets the opportunity to do so. I am not aware of the current value of the training fund to which we have been making contributions since 2000. I do not know what benefits are accruing from it. The Bill makes provisions in respect of the fund. I am not sure if the Minister has already commented on the matter. I would like the fund to be expanded because funding and innovative training schemes are needed, especially in the high-tech area. Many young people require additional training to help them to make a more meaningful contribution to the economy. I would like the Minister to state what use or benefit is being derived from the fund. What amount of money is currently in the fund? I would like to know if the fund can be expanded, even if it means that bigger contributions have to be made.</P>
    <P>Section 22 inserts new provisions into the Pensions Act 1990. The new section 81E of the 1990 Act, which relates to equality in pensions, is the most cumbersome procedure I have ever seen. It mentions the Director of Equality Investigations, the Circuit Court and the Labour Court. If an issue needs to be addressed or redress needs to be provided, a less complicated procedure should be put in place to that end. I am sure the new section 81E has been included for a reason, but it seems cumbersome. It may be expensive for one to get redress in such a way, especially if one has to use the Circuit Court. I ask the Minister to examine the section to assess whether the overall issues can be addressed without having to involve the Labour Court, the Circuit Court or the director of pensions.</P><Col N="1898"/>
    <P>I pay tribute to the regional offices for the work they are doing in dealing with specific cases. There has been a dramatic improvement in the performance of the local offices since I have been in the House. I pay tribute to the staff of the local offices for their courteous way of dealing with the public. We should acknowledge the dramatic change in this regard in the last few years. I pay tribute to the staff of the Department for the invaluable work they are doing in guiding and helping people, especially with some of the complicated issues that are involved in this area.</P>
    <P>I cannot finish without referring briefly to the grievance felt by widows and lone parents, in particular, because of proposed changes that relate to a date in January of this year. There are approximately 2,000 lone parents and 3,000 widows in County Clare, although they are not all affected by these changes. It seems somewhat unfair that if one has a claim in existence, one does not have an entitlement if one makes a claim after the January date. This sets up a form of discrimination because widows in equal or similar situations will have differing levels of payment. People who have contributed to schemes will receive half of the disability or unemployment payment that was made. The amount involved is not very significant in the overall context of the budget under discussion.</P>
    <P>While it may not be possible for two payments to be made from the fund, it may be possible to devise a form of allowance that could be paid in the same way as supplementary welfare allowance is paid. This might help to retain a balance between people who have made claims and are drawing down the benefit and those who will be deprived of the benefit as a result of certain circumstances in which they will find themselves in the next few months. I would like the Minister to re-examine this matter before we conclude our consideration of the Bill. Is it possible to find a way of remedying the grievances of widows and lone parents? It is possible to help them without massively disrupting the social welfare budget or discommoding the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the magnificent work she has done in all aspects of her complicated portfolio. The Bill makes provisions in respect of 50 payments of various kinds. The improvements that have been made recently, which have been acknowledged by the public, exceed greatly the expectations of many of us. I did not think that pension payments would reach their current levels. I hope the Minister will find a way of making adjustments to deal with certain anomalies before the House concludes its consideration of the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>While I welcome the Minister, I have to express grave concern about the cuts provided for in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004. Many of the cutbacks have been mentioned by previous speakers, <Col N="1899"/>particularly on this side of the House. I hope I will be able to thank the Minister when she changes her mind about the proposed cutbacks in the disability and unemployment benefits paid to widows and lone parents. People on the other side of the House have told me that they agree the cuts should not be implemented. All of the cuts proposed in the Bill affect the most vulnerable people in society. We will be judged by how we look after such people, but the Minister will not be looking after them if she implements so many of these cuts.</P>
    <P>The Government promised before the 2002 general election that it would provide for 200,000 additional medical cards. Fewer people than before have medical cards, however, because the eligibility levels have been increased. The Government has not met its promise to provide 200,000 additional medical cards.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that child benefit payments have increased significantly in recent years &mdash; the benefit has certainly increased since I was drawing it &mdash; and that is welcome. Many organisations that deal with children and poverty will state that child poverty is a problem and should be recognised as such, but I do not believe it is being recognised. It is reprehensible that some of the cuts in this Bill will affect children and families.</P>
    <P>There have been reductions in the back to education allowance and the cr&egrave;che supplement. Why is the Government cutting the allowances being paid to people who are trying to improve their lot? Lone parents are being hindered at every turn as they struggle to improve their circumstances. That is wrong and I ask the Minister to reconsider it. The phasing out of the dietary supplement will affect many people but will save just &euro;1 million, approximately. Why do we try to save small amounts of money in areas that have serious effects on individual lives? There are a number of other cuts, including in the area of rent supplements. This will affect many people. There is a serious housing shortage and people are finding it extremely difficult to obtain their first homes. There are also many who will never aspire to owning a home. Now these people cannot even obtain rent supplement without a further delay.</P><Col N="1900"/>
    <P>There are many issues to be discussed and five minutes does not give me enough time to cover all of these, although many have been raised by other speakers. This Bill is an indictment of the Government and will have a serious effect on our society. We will be opposing the Bill.</P>

Ar nd&oacute;igh, n&iacute;l mise &aacute;balta athr&uacute; ar bith a dh&eacute;anamh ar rud at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an D&aacute;il agus ag an Seanad agus at&aacute; s&iacute;nithe ag Uachtar&aacute;n na n&Eacute;ireann.</P>
    <P>A number of issues have been raised and I will discuss these in general categories rather than dealing with each contributor&rsquo;s particular viewpoint. It seems to be unanimously agreed that home-based care is very important. It is on that basis that I will shortly launch the issue of long-term care funding. This will be part of a discussion with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. We will be seeking points of view and I would appreciate it if Senators took ten minutes to participate. Dealing with the carer&rsquo;s allowance and the home-based subvention scheme within the health sector is probably the best way forward on the basis that the majority of people would prefer to stay at home. A small monetary token can be beneficial.</P>
    <P>This is an issue we will need to consider, particularly in view of major changes in society that have resulted in two people working in most families. This creates many difficulties within the caring profession. The issue will remain important. I welcome the proposals of the Oireachtas joint committee in this regard. The Chairman has been most vociferous about these matters in the other House. Only last week I provided the Carers&rsquo; Association with funding for the provision of an information booklet, which was one of the recommendations of the committee. I was delighted to do this. We are considering the possibility of a care strategy in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. This will take time, but it is worth it. We will need to consider how to provide funding in this area in the future. We will need to put our hands on our hearts and decide whether we want to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The issues of child poverty and child benefit were mentioned. Everyone agrees that the provision of child benefit as a universal payment on the basis of a child poverty initiative and a child care initiative is the best way forward. It <Col N="1901"/>deals with the issue of women in the home and women who need child care as well as those who need income support for children. There has been a major investment in this area. We will soon reach the target of providing &euro;2 billion each year in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke of the academic discussion that takes place <i>ad infinitum</i> about the indicators known as consistent poverty, relative poverty and at risk of poverty. We do not use the at-risk-relative poverty indicator in this country, although others do. It is all relative. We are dealing with consistent poverty; in other words, there is an immediate interaction with those who are poor. The results of the statistical analysis of the at-risk and relative poverty indicators are due to the fact that so many people are now in employment and have been removed from unemployment. Naturally, this cannot continue for ever because this in itself creates a greater disparity of income, which we must look towards in the future in ensuring that the gap of relativity does not expand considerably. However, it is important that we deal with the issue of consistent poverty. We must deal with the people who have an immediate problem, not with the academic discussion of what might be a problem in terms of an at-risk register.</P>
    <P>The rural social scheme was announced at the time of the budget. There have been many discussions between my Department, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment about this initiative and we are currently approaching a conclusion. I am working closely with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on the methodology of payment and the numbers of people that could be accommodated on the scheme. It is a rural-based scheme aimed mainly at people on farm assist, many of whom are over 55, which is a group about whom we are particularly concerned. We hope to come to a conclusion on this issue shortly.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Norris is not here to discuss the issue of same sex couples. I listened to his comments and his view is that I am creating an inequity within the social welfare system even though there is a blatant inequity in determination. For example, in regard to a married or cohabiting couple, both of whom are entitled to unemployment assistance, one person receives the full rate while the other receives a qualified adult rate, as it is a means tested scheme. In the case of a same sex couple, each will receive the single rate. The converse of that is found within the administrative schemes. The Senator&rsquo;s point of view is valid, but we must all accept the realities of life. If we want to be treated equally we must accept equal treatment. Some people do not like equality if it affects them personally.</P>
    <P>We must come to a decision on this issue at long last. I am wholeheartedly in agreement that we need to consider not only the social welfare <Col N="1902"/>code, the changing of which would have major implications, but also the taxation system and the justice system. All of this must be dealt with in a proper review. I have spoken to the Senator and I am sure he will be vociferous in putting forward the viewpoint of his constituency. I will listen carefully to what is said. I assume there will be participation by a number of organisations in this review. Results will not be achieved instantly, but we must deal with the issue once and for all. We must have universal administration of these issues under the entire ambit of Government if we are to have true equality.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of the training fund. The total value of the fund is currently &euro;1.628 billion, which is a post-budget cumulative surplus. He mentioned pension provisions and the changes within the Pensions Act 1990. We may discuss this tomorrow as it is a technical matter. The issue of the habitual residency test was also raised. It is incumbent on me to consider the protection of the social welfare system. I did not follow the British system. That system has gone well beyond social welfare and is inclusive of labour issues as well as access to social assistance. The UK, like many other European countries, has had an habitual residency requirement for the past ten years. This is the first time the requirement has been introduced in Ireland in primary legislation. It applies to everyone.</P>
    <P>I have confirmed the methodology that will be used by the officials of my Department in determining habitual residence. The requirement will be dealt with on an individual, case by case basis. If a person is unhappy with the decision based on the guidelines that will be issued by my Department, it will be a matter for the individual himself or herself to prove his or her situation.</P>

    <P>In my view and in particular given the circumstances in which we find ourselves, as a very vulnerable country within the European Union and the only one that had not addressed the issue, I felt it was incumbent on me to include it in the social welfare system. I reiterate that we are encouraging people to work in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The matter of changes to widows&rsquo; benefits was raised. It is unfortunate that this discussion did not take place when the legislation was before the House last December. One has very difficult choices to make. One of the parameters of the social security system has been that an individual only receives one payment, whichever payment is financially more supportive to the family. That has been the case with social welfare for a considerable number of years. The number of people affected is very small and it involves a very small amount of money but if it is taken in the context of the overall discussions at budget time with regard to the preparation of the Estimates, it was incumbent on me, given the particular circumstances, to find a certain amount of money so that I could significantly increase the base line payments of up to &euro;630 million this year <Col N="1903"/>for all those in receipt of social welfare payments, including widows and widowers who received an additional entitlement of &euro;10.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Senators have expressed very emotional views which they are entitled to do and reflected what has been said in their constituency clinics, correspondence and in telephone calls. I am meeting the National Association of Widows in Ireland in about two minutes. I am going with an open mind to discuss the issue and perhaps there might be a more progressive and long-term way of dealing with what I and all of us accept are the difficulties which widows and widowers experience. Not only do they find themselves in a financial difficulty, with an income-related problem, but they also have an emotional issue with which they must deal. One of the major difficulties and one of the biggest frustrations for any Minister for Social and Family Affairs is the fact that when one tries to support one particular group within the social welfare code, it must be done for everyone. The consequences are very difficult from a financial perspective.</P>
    <P>We have done much in terms of supporting widows aged over 66 years. Part of An Agreed Programme for Government was to address an anomaly and that has been finalised this year. As I stated in the other House, I will examine <Col N="1904"/>specifically the issues pertaining to widows under the age of 66. It is my view that, if it is at all possible, a programme of supports for widows and widowers should be introduced. It is not long ago since we introduced a widower&rsquo;s pension in this country. We introduced a bereavement grant which is very progressive and supportive. The taxation system has been very supportive in addressing the concerns of many widows and widowers. A widow or widower who is in employment does not pay any PRSI on the first &euro;289 of either their pension or their financial income.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the sincerity of those Senators who have spoken and I know about the issue and care about it. At the mouth of an abyss we might perhaps come up with a better solution to support very vulnerable people, especially young widows under the age of 66 who have children. Those are the people who are most vulnerable. The Senators should note the statistics which show that the greatest number of widows are aged over 66 years. We need to be aware of the facts but I appreciate the sincerity of the remarks made by Senators. I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to wander for a few minutes. I sincerely thank all the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann who decided to participate in the debate.</P>

   <Title>Finance Bill (Certified Money Bill) 2004: Second Stage.</Title>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P><Col N="1904"/>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance Bill implements the tax changes announced in the budget and provides for a range of other measures. In particular, the Bill includes measures that will continue to foster an environment which will allow Ireland&rsquo;s economy to take advantage of the international recovery <Col N="1905"/>as it develops and to sustain employment. The economy is in safe hands and will continue to be so under the Government. The Bill also provides for implementing measures for a number of EU directives.</P>
    <P>This year&rsquo;s Bill runs to 94 sections and four Schedules and I propose to give an outline of the main provisions. Part 1, which runs from sections 1 to 42, deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. In my period in office, the income tax burden has reduced significantly. Since 1997, average tax rates have fallen for all categories of taxpayer, including those on lower incomes. After budget 2004, for a person on the average industrial wage, the average tax rate will be 10 percentage points lower than in 1997. An increasing proportion of those on the income tax record &mdash; over 35% of all income earners &mdash; pay no tax. The number of such income earners increased by over 75% from 380,000 in 1997-98 to 669,000 after budget 2004. For 2004, the percentage of the income tax yield coming from those earning at or under the average industrial wage is estimated to be about 6% as compared to over 14% in 1997. The tax wedge for a typical married production worker is the lowest in the EU and, indeed, the lowest in the OECD. Contrary to what some try to present, the Government has helped those on both low and middle incomes enormously and we are proud of our record.</P>
    <P>We are now consolidating the gains we have made. Available resources have been concentrated on continuing progress towards removing those on the minimum wage from the tax net. When the statutory minimum wage came into effect in April 2000, less than 64% of the minimum wage was exempt from tax. Section 3 increases the entry point to taxation of a PAYE worker by &euro;240 per year to 90% of the increased new minimum wage annualised. Thus, for a single PAYE person, the first &euro;12,800 per annum, or &euro;246 per week, of earnings will be tax free. This compares to &euro;98 per week in 1997 to 1998. All PAYE workers will benefit from this increase of &euro;240 in the employee tax credit.</P>
    <P>Section 2 increases further the exemption limits from income tax for persons aged 65 and over to &euro;15,500 single and &euro;31,000 married. Since I became Minister for Finance, the income tax exemption limits for the elderly have increased by more than 135%. In that period, more than 81,000 income earners aged 65 or over have been removed from the tax net.</P>
    <P>Section 4 increases the standard-rated allowance for trade union subscriptions from &euro;130 to &euro;200. Section 6 puts beyond doubt that income arising from the investment of personal injury awards made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board for permanently incapacitated persons will be exempt from income tax in the same way as if the awards had been made by a court. This applies where the income in question forms the sole or main income of the individual.</P><Col N="1906"/>
    <P>Section 7 exempts from income tax compensatory awards where an individual&rsquo;s rights under employment-related legislation have been infringed, for example, in the case of discrimination, harassment or victimisation. Up to now, the position has been that such awards have been subject to income tax. Provision is also made to exempt out-of-court settlements in such cases subject to certain restrictions.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Act 2003, I provided for the direct application of PAYE to taxable benefits-in-kind. Taken together with the changes in the Social Welfare Act 2003, this has ensured the application of PAYE and PRSI, including the training and health contribution levies, to these benefits from January this year. Some further legislative provisions are required to bed down the new regime, and these are provided for in sections 8 and 9. They include an exemption for mobile phones as well as for computers and high-speed Internet connections provided by an employer to an employee in his or her home for business use. An exemption in respect of certain company vans parked at home by employees is also provided for. This takes account of representations made to me by both employers and employees to which I was happy to respond favourably.</P>
    <P>Section 9 also extends the existing benefits-in-kind tax exemption for employer-provided travel passes to include Luas services, which are due to commence this year, while section 10 confirms the budget day announcement that the specified rate used to calculate the benefit-in-kind charge on certain preferential rate mortgage loans will be reduced from 4.5% to 3.5%.</P>
    <P>Section 11 extends the existing standard-rated tax relief in respect of health insurance policies which cover non-routine dental treatment to policies issued by insurers providing dental insurance only. The budget announcement of an income tax exemption for income received by Gaeltacht households under the summer college student scheme is provided for in section 12.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for an updating of the qualification requirements in respect of the 100% stock relief for young trained farmers to reflect changes in the underlying academic courses. It also provides that, in general, it is the achievement of certain standards that is mandatory rather than just attendance at courses. Similar provisions are included in sections 69 and 70 on stamp duty relief for young trained farmers.</P>
    <P>Under section 14, the income tax exemption to encourage farm leasing is being improved by increasing the annual amount of leasing income exempted from tax and reducing the age limit for qualifying lessors. These improvements in the relief will encourage the higher utilisation of our agricultural land, which will become all the more important in view of the changes to the EU Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Section 16 facilitates occupational pension schemes in their investment activities by providing that any such schemes which borrow <Col N="1907"/>for investment reasons can be approved pension schemes for tax purposes. This section effectively levels the playing field between pension schemes which wish to borrow directly for investment purposes and those which invest in products where borrowing takes place, for example, an insurance company product such as a unit-linked property fund.</P>
    <P>Section 17 gives a capital gains tax exemption to certain individuals on the disposal of assets. The individuals concerned are those who already have an income tax exemption on the income derived from those assets, for example, persons in receipt of court compensation arising from incapacity. Where the gains and income of a year from those assets are the principal source of income and gains in that year of such individuals, then both the income and gains will be exempted from tax. This will facilitate the use of a wider range of investments by these individuals.</P>
    <P>Given the sometimes contradictory debate on tax reliefs and expenditures, it is important to remember that such reliefs are normally introduced to achieve desirable public policy objectives. It must be recognised that it is in their nature that such schemes will be used by high earners to reduce their tax liabilities. The value of such schemes must be balanced against the important objective of ensuring a wide tax base if we are to maintain low rates. Accordingly, we must keep such schemes under review.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme and seed capital scheme reliefs are good schemes as long as they remain focused and targeted. Having reviewed the schemes in the lead-up to the budget, I am satisfied they continue to serve their purpose as now focused, and section 18 provides for an extension of these schemes for a further three years until 31 December 2006. It also provides an increase in the maximum amount a company can raise under both schemes from &euro;750,000 to &euro;1 million as announced.</P>
    <P>The increase in the limit and extension in time from 5 February 2004 to 31 December 2006 and certain other changes to the schemes will be subject to a commencement order to allow for clarification of potential EU state aid issues raised by the European Commission. Other changes include an increase in the non-PAYE income limit for investor eligibility for the seed capital scheme and the phasing out by the end of 2004 of the application of the seed capital scheme to trading activities in an exchange facility established in the Custom House Docks area in Dublin. Separate to the commencement order, an initial extension of the scheme to 4 February 2004 is provided for and sections 18 and 19 provide for transitional measures, including for arrangements and investments made before 4 February 2004.</P>
    <P>I have stated before that it is essential that tax avoidance schemes and loopholes are tackled vigorously. In a press release last March, I made clear my intention to close a loophole which had come to my attention. It related to the relief <Col N="1908"/>available to individuals in respect of interest paid on money borrowed for the purposes of acquiring an equity stake in, or lending money to, a company where the moneys are used to acquire certain premises. This is provided for in section 22.</P>
    <P>Section 23 amends the scheme of capital allowances for qualifying residential units associated with registered nursing homes. These are units which allow older people to continue to live independently but to have access to nursing home facilities. The minimum number of qualifying residential units is being reduced from 20 to ten to allow for smaller developments. The condition for buildings to be two-storey at maximum is being amended to allow that the units may be in a building of any number of floors where a fire safety certificate is issued.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is a technical change and redrafts one of the eligibility conditions for investors in private hospitals to bring it into line with other reliefs by removing an unintended effect of disqualifying all investors in a project where one is ineligible.</P>
    <P>Sections 25, 26 and 27 provide for an extension of various tax reliefs and set out transitional provisions where appropriate, as well as clarifying the conditions associated with the reliefs, for example, where planning issues arise. Many places in Ireland have enjoyed a regeneration directly due to area-based tax reliefs. While these reliefs are now being phased out, arising from concerns expressed by various individuals and groups, including various local authorities, I felt, on balance, there was a rationale for allowing a longer wind-down period for the various tax reliefs referred to in these sections. This will allow for a more orderly completion of projects where delays had arisen for various reasons.</P>
    <P>Section 28 confirms my budget announcement that the termination date for film relief is being extended from 31 December 2004 to 31 December 2008 and the cap on the amount that can be raised under the section in respect of any one film is increased from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;15 million per film. Changes to address instances of abuse are provided for in the section and these include the revision of the certification procedures, provisions to deal with overcomplicated financial structures and enhanced record-keeping requirements for film production companies. European Commission approval will be needed for the continuation of the scheme and the increase in the overall investment.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that Ireland remains competitive as a location for attracting and retaining foreign investment. The Bill provides measures that enhance the prospect of attracting further high quality investment projects in Ireland leading to additional future employment opportunities. Sections 31, 34 and 42 are designed to encourage multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters and holding companies in Ireland. The Bill provides for an <Col N="1909"/>exemption from tax on gains for holding companies on the disposal of a shareholding in a subsidiary, whether Irish or foreign, and makes a number of related changes to the scope of our provisions for relief against foreign tax in respect of dividend income paid to parent companies. Specifically, sections 31 and 34 amend the provisions on relief for foreign taxation in the case of dividends paid by a subsidiary to a parent company. To qualify for relief for foreign taxation in the case of dividend income under a unilateral credit relief provision where no double taxation treaty applies, the shareholding involved must up to now have been at least 25% of the subsidiary company. This is being reduced to 5%. Relief is also being made available for foreign tax imposed on company tiers lower than the immediate subsidiary. The provisions in sections 31 and 42 will come into effect by way of a commencement order following clearance by the EU Commission from a state aid perspective. Section 34 will implement Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the EU Parent and Subsidiary Directive.</P>
    <P>Section 31 will also allow companies to average the credit tax for foreign tax across dividend streams on shareholdings of 5% or more for the purpose of calculating the relief. The section also extends the credit mechanism to certain sub-national taxes imposed in tax treaty countries where those taxes are not covered by the relevant tax treaty. This issue arises in particular in the cases of the US and Canada where non-federal taxes are not covered by the relevant tax treaty.</P>
    <P>The CGT exemption provided in section 42 will apply where the shareholding held by the holding company is a minimum of 10% of the subsidiary concerned and at least &euro;15 million in value, or where the shareholding held is a minimum of 5% of the subsidiary concerned and at least &euro;50 million in value. It is also a requirement that the subsidiary is primarily a trading company or, taken together, the holding company and its subsidiaries are primarily a trading group. The minimum shareholding must be held for a continuous period of 12 months in the three years prior to the disposal.</P>
    <P>These measures will encourage foreign direct investment by facilitating multinational companies with operations in a number of different countries to set up holding companies in Ireland. The objective is to bring regional headquarters companies to Ireland, which would include corporate functions such as control of regional operations, group treasury and centralised administration. These initiatives have been welcomed by IDA Ireland and by key industry players.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government includes commitments to build the capability of firms to carry out and manage research and development in Ireland and work to ensure that Ireland develops a world-class research capacity. Following on from my announcement in the budget, section 33 provides for a 20% tax credit <Col N="1910"/>for companies for qualifying incremental expenditure on research and development.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy needs to make a decisive transition from high-volume, lower value enterprise to high-value, high-innovation, knowledge-intensive enterprise, and research and development activities can encourage such enterprise. In addition, increased research and development activities can help embed an existing firm&rsquo;s activities in Ireland as well as developing additional high quality employment. Senators might be interested to note that tax incentives are widely used to stimulate research and development in other advanced economies. Their effectiveness has been established by a series of empirical studies, particularly among large firms in high-tech sectors, and this is where the need in Ireland for greater research intensity is most pronounced. As with all tax reliefs it is important that the measure be focused. Accordingly, the measure is targeted at encouraging additional research and development by basing the scheme on incremental expenditure rather than permanent additional tax deductions for all research and development activities.</P>
    <P>Full details of the scheme, including a core definition of research and development activities, are set out in section 33 and detailed guidelines will be issued by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on what activities will constitute research and development activities for the purposes of the credit. Companies will be able to deduct 20% of the incremental spend on research and development from their corporation tax bill in addition to its normal deduction as an expense.</P>
    <P>Incremental spend will be calculated by reference to a base year. For expenditure in 2004, 2005 and 2006, incremental spend will be calculated by reference to expenditure in 2003. In 2007 the base year will be 2004, 2005 will be the base year for 2008 and so on. In order not to distort the year-on-year calculation of incremental expenditure, capital investment on construction and refurbishment of building will be treated separately with a 20% credit made available to companies to invest, irrespective of its incremental nature.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is aimed at assisting the leasing sector of our financial industry and it provides that lessors engaged in finance leasing may elect to pay tax on income from the finance leasing of short-life assets on the basis of accounting income rather than income based on current tax rules. The option will be subject to a number of conditions detailed in the Bill. The section allows lessors of such assets to account for them for tax purposes in accordance with accounting rules. This will result in the &ldquo;interest element&rdquo; of lease payments being taxed but no capital allowances being available. It will not change the amount of tax paid but will involve a more even spread of the tax over the lease period. As I said in the other House, this provision is being introduced to <Col N="1911"/>address specific issues which arise with the phasing out of the IFSC regime, but the new provision will apply across the board to all lessors of short-life assets. This change will help to keep Ireland competitive in this important sector.</P>
    <P>Section 39 extends the qualifying period for the scheme of tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects from 31 December 2004 to 31 December 2006. An EU directive dealing with the taxation of interest and royalties was agreed in 2003, the purpose of which is to eliminate withholding taxes on cross-border interest and royalty payments between associated companies and branches in different member states. The directive was transposed by way of statutory instrument in late 2003 and its provisions are being repeated in section 41 and Schedule I to the Finance Bill, with a number of minor technical additions.</P>
    <P>Part 2 deals with excise duties. Sections 45 and 48 confirm respectively the budget increases of 25 cent, including VAT, in the excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes and of 5 cent per litre, including VAT, for petrol and diesel. As indicated in the budget, changes to indirect taxes were limited this year in the light of our goal of reducing inflation. Section 46 enables certain quantitative restrictions on cigarettes and tobacco to be retained in respect of travellers from the new EU member states after 1 May next. In effect, the regime applying to travellers from other existing member states will not be applied to cigarettes or tobacco acquired by travellers from the new member states in question during the transitional arrangements for accession states.</P>
    <P>Sections 49 and 50 provide for a qualified exemption from the excise duty on biofuels for use in certain approved pilot projects including projects undertaken to test the technical viability of using biofuel as a motor fuel.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with VAT. Sections 55, 56 and 58 provide for the EU directive on the VAT treatment of cross-border supplies of gas and electricity to be transposed into Irish law. Increased liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets and increased cross-border trade between member states required a change in the rules to clarify that supplies of gas and electricity were taxable in the member state of final consumption, avoiding the need for a supplier to register in every member state which he or she supplies.</P>
    <P>Section 57 confirms that where a house and site are sold together, the VAT treatment is that both the house and the site are subject to VAT. An interpretation of the VAT Act 1972 has been used to attempt to exempt the sale of developed sites where a site and new house or apartment are being sold together. The Bill provides that where a developed site is sold in such circumstances it is subject to VAT.</P>
    <P>Sections 59 and 61 confirm the budget night financial resolution to increase the farmers&rsquo; flat rate addition for VAT purposes from 4.3% to <Col N="1912"/>4.4% with effect from 1 January 2004. There is a corresponding increase to 4.4% for the sale of livestock by VAT registered farmers.</P>
    <P>Section 63 clarifies that where a trader in Ireland supplies goods or services to a trader abroad, in a situation where the recipient in the other member state is liable for VAT on a reverse charge basis, then the Irish trader must issue a VAT invoice. This will not impose any extra burden on traders and reflects existing commercial practice. Sections 64 and 65 contain a number of technical amendments to clarify the VAT treatment of fund management and administration services provided to Irish and foreign investment funds. The stamp duty provisions are contained in Part 4 of the Bill. Section 68 closes off a loophole whereby an exemption from stamp duty, in the case of certain company reconstructions and amalgamations, was being used to seek to avoid stamp duty on transfers of real property. The stamp duty exemption for owner-occupiers of new houses and apartments has up to now been dependent on a floor area certificate from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, indicating that the building is not greater than 425 sq. metres. However, this particular certification process is linked with the now abolished new house grants and will cease on 2 April 2004. Consequently, section 72 provides for a new floor area compliance certificate for such houses and apartments, which will also certify that the property conforms to approved building standards. The certificate will be issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the purpose of the stamp duty exemption.</P>
    <P>Section 74 replaces the current section of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, which provided for a stamp duty exemption for certain international trademarks. This new section provides for an exemption from stamp duty on the sale, transfer or other disposition of intellectual property as announced in the budget. Intellectual property includes any patent, trademark, copyright, registered design, design right, invention, domain name, supplementary protection certificate or plant breeders&rsquo; rights. This measure is aimed at making Ireland a more attractive place for the location of such intellectual property.</P>
    <P>Section 75 provides that the 2% duty on non-life insurance policies will not apply to dental insurance as is the case with medical insurance policies generally.</P>
    <P>Section 78 amends the definition of a holding company for the purposes of the CAT business relief to take account of situations involving family companies where there may be more than one holding company and where there are intermediate companies between the holding companies and the underlying trading companies.</P>
    <P>Sections 79 and 82 provide for an extension of the legislative framework that underpins tax information exchange agreements with certain <Col N="1913"/>jurisdictions in order to include gift and inheritance tax. An amendment is also being made to the relevant legislation to apply the existing Revenue powers to encompass the foreign equivalent of estate, inheritance and gift tax.</P>
    <P>Section 85 amends the scheme of tax relief for donations of heritage items to cultural institutions of the State. The minimum value of an item or collection which can qualify is being increased from &euro;100,000 to &euro;150,000 with the additional requirement that, in the case of a collection, at least one item in the collection must have a minimum value of &euro;50,000. In addition, there are detailed changes in the rules governing the selection of heritage items. These changes are designed to facilitate the work of the selection committee, which is made up of representatives of the cultural institutions and bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need to keep tax reliefs and expenditures under review. To facilitate this, it is important to improve the information available regarding the cost of such reliefs. Changes are being made to various tax forms to capture more information.</P>
    <P>Section 86 provides for a number of statutory changes to the annual tax return forms for the 2004 tax year, and thereafter, to underpin this work. Essentially, persons wishing to claim certain reliefs will be required to provide additional information by completing an additional part of the form. Persons not complying will be liable for the standard surcharge and penalties for incorrect returns, where the error is not remedied without unreasonable delay. Section 86 also amends the end-of-year P35 employer return to require employers to show the overall amount of employer and employee pension contributions together with the number of employees contributing and the number of employees in respect of which the employer is contributing. These changes will take effect for the February 2005 P35 returns. In time these changes will yield accurate information on the cost of tax reliefs, such as the property-based tax relief schemes and on the cost of pension tax relief.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain conditions, Revenue already has the power to apply to the High Court for an order requiring a financial institution to make records available for inspection or to furnish information relevant to the tax liability of a taxpayer, including a group or class of person whose individual identities are not known to Revenue.</P>
    <P>Section 87 extends this power so it can apply in respect of information and records held by certain foreign financial entities, which are under the control of a domestic financial institution. This is a recommendation made in the Revenue powers group report, which is being proceeded with now because of the current Revenue initiative on offshore accounts. I published the report of the Revenue powers group on 4 February 2004 with a view to allowing time for all <Col N="1914"/>interested parties to discuss and debate the issues raised by the group. I will consider the various recommendations made in the report in the context of next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 90 and Schedule 4 confirm the transposition into Irish law of the EU directive on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments. The aim of the directive is to enable savings income in the form of interest payments made in one EU member state to individuals resident for tax purposes in another EU member state to be taxed in accordance with the laws of the latter member state.</P>
    <P>Section 91 provides for the carryover from one year to another of unspent Exchequer capital allocations up to a limit of 10% of each year&rsquo;s total capital allocation under the rolling five-year multi-annual envelopes for Departments announced in the budget. The Government is committed to keeping capital investment at 5% of GNP over the period 2004-08. Under the capital envelopes, a total of &euro;33.6 billion will be available for capital investment to support the economy&rsquo;s future growth potential. The ability to carry forward from one year to another unspent Exchequer capital is an important element of multi-annual budgeting for capital purposes and for the management of capital programmes.</P>
    <P>In successive budgets and Finance Bills I have managed to create a low tax rate environment. This policy has boosted investment and created jobs. Shrewd observers will be aware that governments and administrations throughout the world are pursuing this approach because they have witnessed its success. The rules are relatively simple: create the conditions in which enterprise and employment are rewarded through a low tax burden and people will respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>Probably the most telling statistic in recent years is that over the past six years the numbers at work have increased by over 300,000. Unemployment today remains at historically low levels. Much has been achieved in this respect but we cannot take future prosperity for granted. This Bill includes significant measures that ensure further investment for Ireland and jobs for its people.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators have benefited from this outline of the provisions in the Bill. I look forward to the debate on the legislation and I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. I apologise for the absence of my colleague, Senator Higgins, who has asked me to deputise for him. Hopefully, I will be able to deliver a few political blows on his behalf, although that may be difficult.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the low tax base but it is important to point out that while we have one of the lowest levels of taxation in the EU as a percentage of our GDP, statistics show that more than 50% of taxpayers are now paying tax at the higher rate of 42%. In 1999, personal tax credit under the equivalent tax code amounted to <Col N="1915"/>&euro;1,000. By 2001, the Minister had reduced this to &euro;814. In 2002, it had doubled to &euro;1,520 and in 2003-04 there has been no change, so it has been eroded. The year 2002 was significant as a general election was held, so I do not need to dwell further on that point.</P>
    <P>The Bill is flimsier than most of its predecessors because the December budget contained very few financial measures. In his budget speech, the Minister spoke predominantly about decentralisation. This caused much surprise because people felt that a budget speech was not the place in which to outline such proposals.</P>
    <P>Since its election, the Government has introduced 27 stealth taxes and is the primary culprit in the creation of a rip-off society. While the Minister may talk about low taxation, and few in the House would disagree with him on that point, he should also mention the stealth taxes that affect our daily lives. They range from the non-indexation of tax credits to higher VHI and ESB charges, and as a result the Government is responsible for 100% of inflation. The stealth taxes introduced in 2002 were as follows: VAT went up 8%, motor tax rose 12%, hospital charges increased by 26%, drug refund scheme up 31%, VHI up 18%, cigarettes and alcohol, up 15%, bank and car charges, up 108%, bin charges, up 29%, ESB bills, up 13%, college fees, up 9%, parking, up 25%, bus fares, up 9%, and the TV licence, up 40%.</P>
    <P>In the November 2003 Estimates the drug payments scheme threshold rose by &euro;8 to &euro;78 per month, accident and emergency charges increased &euro;5 to &euro;45, and the cost of private beds in public hospitals rose by 15%. The cost of an overnight stay in hospital has risen by &euro;5 to &euro;45, with a cap of ten nights per year. The third level student registration fee increased by &euro;80 to &euro;750 while the reintroduction of third level fees remains a possibility. The fee for junior certificate examinations increased by &euro;10 to &euro;82 while the fee for sitting the leaving certificate increased by &euro;10 to &euro;86. Development levies will increase from &euro;6,000 to &euro;30,000 and will raise &euro;700 million from house buyers. The minimum contribution all recipients of supplementary welfare allowance rent-mortgage supplement are required to make towards their accommodation will increase by &euro;1 to &euro;13 per week and the allowance is no longer available to couples where one member is in full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The fee for a standard ten year passport increased on 1 March by almost one third from &euro;57 to &euro;75 and there has been a significant percentage increase in the cost of children&rsquo;s passports, which is grossly unfair. The cost of a three year passport for infants has increased from &euro;12 to &euro;15 and that of a five year passport for those aged three to 18 from &euro;12 to &euro;25. The emergency fee for passport applications processed outside office hours has been increased by &euro;37 to &euro;100 for adults. Motor tax increased by 5%. Further stealth taxes were announced last <Col N="1916"/>December, including an increase in bus and rail fares in line with inflation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>What is wrong with that? That is not a tax.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Basic personal tax credits have not been increased under the legislation. It relies heavily on increased charges and it has totally failed to reduce levies that are putting homes beyond the reach of first-time buyers.</P>
    <P>There is a complete absence of joined up thinking. The Minister is introducing property-based tax breaks, barely 12 months after he won public praise for his decision to eliminate them because they had outlived their usefulness. No ceiling has been placed on the degree to which well placed individuals can reduce their tax contributions through the use of these reliefs. The Minister accepts this because he stated in his contribution that the value of such schemes must be balanced against the important objective of ensuring a wide tax base if low rates are to be maintained. Accordingly, such schemes must be kept under review.</P>
    <P>A recent newspaper article estimated the State&rsquo;s urban and town renewal schemes will cost the Exchequer &euro;750 million in lost taxes by July 2006. The two renewal schemes, which have attracted a massive &euro;3.8 billion in investment since they were established in 1989, were due to expire at the end of this year. However, the Minister extended the deadline in the budget for the schemes and eight other property-based tax incentive schemes, even though he said he had difficulty doing so. This is a backward step and such tax breaks should be re-evaluated. Worse still, almost 130,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing. Less than 64% of net average industrial earnings was required to pay off a 20 year mortgage on a standard dwelling in the Dublin area in 1980 whereas this had increased to 82% in 2002 and it is even higher now.</P>
    <P>Following the furore over the scrapping of the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant, the Minister attended the House and indicated that even he accepted it was unfair in the absence of an alternative. He gave the impression he would examine an increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers and scrap stamp duty for first-time buyers on smaller properties but, unfortunately, nothing has been done. I was sore about this issue following the budget. I urge him to re-consider these proposals considering that not only was the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant abolished but VAT increased on all house purchases and development levies have been increased twofold, if not threefold, particularly in Kildare, his own county.</P>
    <P>I refer to the decentralisation programme, about which there is confusion. Bus &Eacute;ireann is due to be relocated to Mitchelstown, County Cork, but the Minister for Transport plans to privatise the company. How can a State agency be decentralised given that it more than likely will not exist in a few years if the Minister for <Col N="1917"/>Transport&rsquo;s plans are implemented? It was disingenuous of the Minister to announce the decentralisation of Teagasc in the Budget Statement. I was amazed when I read under the Carlow heading that, in addition to the 250 jobs that are to be decentralised from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which are welcome and for which we lobbied hard, the headquarters of Teagasc is also to be decentralised, because that was a done deal.</P>
    <P>The Minister landed in difficulty over this announcement because the Civil Service unions involved were not happy. A deal had been concluded whereby compensation of more than &euro;6,000 would be paid to civil servants who opted to relocate to Carlow. The trade unions felt a precedent had been set, which would expose the Government to payments of millions of euro in compensation for the relocation of civil servants. Will the headquarters of Teagasc still be decentralised to Carlow? Did the Minister jeopardise the move by announcing it in his Budget Statement? I hope he has not because the people of Carlow will be disappointed if that is the case.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will table numerous amendments on Committee Stage because the legislation should address the following crucial issues: revelations that the Revenue is unable to collect enough evidence to prosecute breaches of the tax amnesty or to prosecute officials of financial institutions who promoted tax evasion vehicles; the lack of proper scrutiny of special reliefs in the tax code; the absence of a ceiling on the extent to which well placed individuals can reduce their tax contributions to zero through the use of these reliefs; the need to examine afresh the financial support of families through tax and welfare systems during their life cycles; and the imminent introduction of the carbon tax system, which poses serious challenges in terms of the competitiveness of certain businesses and the capacity of families on low incomes to cope.</P>
    <P>The Minister is due to make a decision on carbon taxes at the end of the month and it is expected a carbon tax system will be in place by the end of the year. However, the Minister has given no inkling of the approach he plans to adopt. The Government is obliged to notify its decision on the emissions trading regime for Ireland by the end of the month but people are unclear about it. Perhaps the Minister will address the issue when he concludes the debate.</P>
    <P>The Revenue admitted recently that it is unable to prosecute breaches of the 1993 tax amnesty and no evidence has been furnished which could facilitate the prosecution of officials in financial institutions who promoted bogus non-resident accounts. That has not gone down well with the public. The public is also sick and tired of being told no money is available for certain projects while significant infrastructural projects such as Luas go &euro;600 million over budget.</P>

    <P>I wish to refer to an issue which highlights for what Fianna F&aacute;il stands. Two weeks ago, I attended Buswells Hotel to meet the GPA, which was seeking a tax break for amateur sports people. I was almost knocked down by a number of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and Senators who were smiling beside the group&rsquo;s representatives as they posed for photographs and signed petitions. The same Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies entered the D&aacute;il that evening and voted against the amendment tabled by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, under which such sports people would receive a tax credit of &euro;2,000, provided they made themselves available for drug testing.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The caveat was that by making themselves available for drug testing, it would differentiate them from the ordinary amateur sportsperson. I was amazed to see the Government Members voting it down, having made positive soundings on the issue on the plinth. However, when it came to a vote, they voted against it and I look forward to seeing how my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues react on this occasion because we will table amendments on it tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I urge Senator Mansergh not to give us a history lesson on Fine Gael before 1997 and I look forward to his positive contribution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome to the House the Minister and his officials, former colleagues of mine on the tax strategy group.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is now the longest serving Finance Minister since the 1930s and there is no doubt that he has made an impact, which both friend and foe will agree is greater than any of his predecessors. His period in office since 1997 coincides, but is not coincidental, with the greatest period of economic expansion in the history of the State and long may it continue. I <Col N="1919"/>was at an art exhibition in Cologne where I saw a picture of a tiger in a European setting. I thought it was the symbol of the Celtic tiger and I will send the Minister a copy.</P>
    <P>The Minister &mdash; when I give the statistics, Members will see this is not hyperbole &mdash; has discovered the philosopher&rsquo;s stone of increasing tax revenues while reducing tax rates, greatly increasing public expenditure and at the same time improving the public finances. If one goes back to 1996, the last full year of the rainbow Government, tax revenues were &euro;16 billion and in 2004 they will be &euro;33 billion, a little more than double. The Minister did not achieve this by doubling the tax rate. The standard rate of income tax was reduced from 26% to 20% while the top rate was reduced from 48% to 42%. Corporation tax was reduced from 36% in 1997 to 12.5% and capital gains tax was halved from 40% to 20%. While we are on the subject, gross current expenditure in 1996 was &euro;19.5 billion and this year it will be &euro;39.3 billion. Capital expenditure at &euro;2.1 billion in 1997 increased to &euro;5.5 billion in 2004, more than double. However, the general Government borrowing level was 64.5% in 1997 which has been reduced to 33% in 2004. All the signs are that the public finances are in very good shape. I note Senator Browne did not comment on benchmarking, which last autumn was thought would wreck and ruin the public finances. In general, he raised only quibbles but I do not blame him for doing his job.</P>
    <P>I was in Germany after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and a headline in one of the German newspapers caught my eye. It stated that full employment was possible in eight years, according to a comment by the president of the external trade chamber. We practically have full employment, with an unemployment rate of only 4.5%. I also note that the current issue of <i>Der Spiegel</i> commented that with its tax policy, Ireland attracts entrepreneurs from all over the world who are willing to locate abroad &mdash; more or less suggesting, albeit in a slightly exaggerated way, that Ireland is hovering up foreign investment. I heard the Labour Party&rsquo;s Senator Brendan Ryan state that the Fianna F&aacute;il philosophy was winner takes all. I do not agree with him. The Fianna F&aacute;il philosophy is that everyone is a winner and they have been under the Government&rsquo;s tax policies.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave priority and nobody, including CORI, could fault him on weighting the benefit to the low paid. For those on the minimum wage, 90% of his or her income is free from tax. It was a move unassailable from the point of view of equity. Senator Browne has to take account of the content of the Minister&rsquo;s speech, that 35% of people registered with the tax authorities are not paying tax at all. When one states that 50% are on the upper rate of tax, one is referring only to those paying tax. However, if one is referring to income earners subject to the tax code, it is only 33%. I wish it were fewer, but it is a good achievement.</P><Col N="1920"/>
    <P>We have got much credit for having the lowest tax wedge in the European Union and that is particularly family friendly. I was particularly struck by the Minister&rsquo;s statistic that the amount of income tax paid by those on the average industrial wage is 6% today compared to 14% in 1997. The Opposition should recognise the general advance and its equity. Part of that was due to the tax credit revolution during the last period of office. The Minister has been very good over a number of budgets to the elderly. A tax exempt income of &euro;31,000 for a married couple is impressive. The Minister, although he might not always be credited for it, has good relations with the trade unions and the social partnership is shown by the increase in the credit for trade union membership.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that Luas will be included on the travel pass. I remember that in the tax strategy group, we had a great many discussions on what to do with the income of the bean an t&iacute;. In a sense, the pragmatic solution is to do nothing and let it be tax free. I query whether a mother who looks after two or three other children is a similar case and whether the sensible approach would be to make it tax free, thereby encouraging a solution to the child care problem.</P>
    <P>If we want a film industry in this country, film relief is essential and this is partly a competitive issue. If other countries are giving generous tax reliefs to films and if we want to compete, we have to do the same. The Minister is right to point out, and everybody realises it, that, as a result, inevitably high earners use this mechanism to reduce their tax bill, but it is a question of the overall economic benefit.</P>
    <P>The two most important measures in the Finance Bill are those relating to the location of company headquarters and I suppose that is particularly relevant to the Financial Services Centre but also the 20% tax credit for research and development. I was at a dinner with the executives of multinational companies last night and they take the view that this is a welcome start, but they may want to discuss with the Minister how it could be further extended. I understand the Minister is anxious to avoid dead weight and that he wants incremental benefits. At the same time I am sure the Minister realises that we have to compete with the United Kingdom and Mr. Gordon Brown has made it clear that he will focus on research and development, making Britain one of the most competitive countries in the world. That we have to compete with that may have implications for the funding of higher education.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on something which is not contained in the section on excise duty. I point out to the Minister for Finance, who was previously a Minister with responsibility for tourism, that Ireland has the highest level of excise duty on wine in the European Union. On the next occasion on which the Minister is being pressed by the Minister for Health and Children to jack up the price of cigarettes and does not <Col N="1921"/>wish to affect the consumer price index, he should consider reducing the excise duty on wine. Wine drinking is no longer an elite activity. It is important for the tourism industry as the price of wine is something tourists, particularly those from the Continent of Europe, notice most. There is a economic case to be made in this regard.</P>
    <P>Gordon Brown announced in his budget a measure whereby tax avoidance schemes will have to be cleared with the revenue authorities. I gather the USA operates a similar system which means there is not a presumption of legality on the part of such schemes. Before next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill, the Minister should examine these measures closely. I congratulate the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners on the amount of tax money they have collected. Huge progress is being made though this is partly because we are in the euro zone and a run in the currency is no longer possible. It is possible to accomplish things today that would not have been easy ten or 15 years ago. While people may not like that from a moral point of view, it is the pragmatic reality.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 88 which deals with capital envelopes and I note the Minister for Transport announced this morning that some &euro;3.5 billion is to be invested in public transport over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with the position of the Minister for Finance. I have been lobbied like most other Senators as part of a very strong push by charities to exempt contributions from taxation. The point can be made that charities are exempt from most forms of taxation. The Minister made a significant provision for charities in 2000 when every contribution over &euro;250 was exempted from tax.</P>
    <P>Quite generous construction reliefs are in place and the construction industry has been a major underpinner of the economy, particularly in the less strong growth years of the last couple of years. However, the reliefs should not continue indefinitely. The problem with Senator Browne&rsquo;s suggestion on mortgage interest relief and reductions in stamp duty is that experience tells us builders simply increase prices and pocket the difference. The young first-time buyer finds he or she is no better off. I am a little surprised by today&rsquo;s report that there is not a stronger take up of affordable housing in Cork. I must talk to my brother who is an employee of Cork Country Council. Perhaps it is a short-term phenomenon.</P>
    <P>The issue of carbon taxation has been around for a great deal of time. We must be very careful in introducing a tax of that kind and consider our competitiveness. The economy of the USA is built in part, whether we like it or not, on cheap energy. If we are not very careful, Europe will increase its competitive disadvantage. If this step is taken, countervailing measures will be necessary to ensure our competitiveness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the USA is not affected.</P>
    <P>A matter which was mentioned in the Budget Statement but does not appear in the Finance Bill is decentralisation.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1922"/>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Gordon Brown announced decentralisation in his budget speech also.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I was about to come to that. I do not recommend Gordon Brown&rsquo;s approach, which is very different. According to Gordon Brown, 20,000 civil servants are to be moved out of London and, God help us, those who do not want to go will be made redundant. The civil servants will experience a 27% cut in salary and lose London allowances. We have a different way of doing things here, which I much prefer. It is an illustration of how fortunate public servants are to live in this country rather than across the water. I hope a constructive approach will be adopted.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, if one takes existing decentralisation programmes, which have worked perfectly smoothly, every hub and gateway has decentralised offices in it. It was perfectly clearly stated in the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto that decentralisation would be to substantial and well-placed towns which had difficulty attracting industry. Many other towns are mostly near national spatial strategy highways, or main routes. I hope decentralisation will proceed expeditiously. It is the key to the regeneration of certain parts of the country and to a better spatial balance.</P>
    <P>Britain is, geographically, a less well-shaped country than Ireland, but Gordon Brown does not appear to be overly worried about the coherence of Government or that something infinitely precious will be disrupted. On the contrary, Senator McDowell&rsquo;s Labour friends across the water are going about decentralisation in a rather more brutal fashion than we are. Public servants should examine the way in which decentralisation is being planned here and consider how much more fortunate they are to live and work in a country which operates according to a proper principle of social partnership.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address the issue of decentralisation before I finish, but I will begin with some general remarks about the economy. This must be the shortest Finance Bill the Minister has published during his time in office. Certainly, it is almost completely devoid of the grand gestures, ideas and the singular ideological shifts, swathes of tax cuts, cuts in expenditure and various other traits for which the Minister has become renowned over the last seven years. As such, there is very little with which to disagree in the Bill. In as much as the Bill offends, which it does, it is through sins of omission rather than commission. I will address those in detail in a few moments.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to comment from this side of the House on the resilient and sturdy state of the economy. Most of us feared 15 to 18 months ago as we looked into the near future that circumstances would be a great deal worse than <Col N="1923"/>they are. To be blunt and clear, if 2% growth, less than 2% inflation and virtually full employment is as bad as the recession is to get, we have not done half badly. It is appropriate to acknowledge that the economy has demonstrated a toughness and resilience which has surprised me and, I imagine, a great many economists and commentators. It does not serve the interests of the country or the Opposition to understate or fail to acknowledge that fact.</P>
    <P>I say that by way of acknowledging that when things were going badly over the last 18 months, I found less to criticise in what the Minister did than I did when things were going well. When he had money to spend and choices, he made all the wrong ones. He cut taxes in the wrong way and spent money poorly. He operated counter to the cycle I would have chosen or thought appropriate at the time. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that in the last 12 to 18 months, the Minister has adopted the cautious approach appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not support all the cuts the Minister imposed on his colleagues. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs made for a rather sad sight when she was here. It looks like she is preparing the way for a climb down on a particular cut with which the Minister will be familiar. The social welfare cuts amounted to &euro;50 million. With the benefit of hindsight, and even at the time, it shows how pointless they were in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone would argue that in the aftermath of the general election there was not a need to cut back the then runaway level of current expenditure. This is not to say that I was not in favour of planned public expenditure in the previous period &mdash; I was. Neither is it to say that I am not in favour of planning public expenditure in a way that will lead to improved public services over time. However, I do not believe this can be achieved by failing to increase spending one year, increasing it by 20% the following year, and cutting back according to the electoral cycle. The Minister has, by and large, got it right since the election. I say this in the knowledge that anything uttered at 7.30 p.m. in the Seanad on a Tuesday evening is unlikely to be reported by anyone.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the social partners set out three main aims on income tax in Sustaining Progress, namely, reducing the upper rate of tax to 40%, removing those earning the minimum wage from the income tax net, and completing the individualisation process. It is now unlikely that any of these three aims will be achieved. While I will not shed tears about two of the three aims, efforts should be made to remove those on the minimum wage from the income tax net. Notwithstanding the increase in the minimum wage this year, the Minister has more or less stood still with his increase in tax credits. Secure in the knowledge that no one is going to pay a blind bit of attention to what I say, if choices are to be made in the tax code they should made in <Col N="1924"/>order to remove the minimum wage from the income tax net. This should be done even at a time when there is little scope.</P>
    <P>It is nonsensical to forbid employers paying employees less than &euro;7 per hour and then taxing these employees. It does not make sense. There is no logic or coherence to it and it should be changed. This should be done even if it must be done within the income tax code. While I recognise most Oireachtas Members would not share my view, this should be done even if the standard rate cut-off point must be changed. We need to take this measure to a conclusion and it must be done now when the opportunity exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had an interesting experience in interacting with the tax code over the past seven or eight years. Senator Mansergh also referred to this. The Minister has not had to do much in the way of distribution; it has largely been a matter of deciding where to cut taxes. While I do not necessarily agree with the argument, I accept that cutting taxes in some cases has not reduced the tax take. We are now in a position where we cannot cut the overall take and where changes in the tax code are necessarily redistributive. Harder choices must now be made and the Minister has clearly taken the decision not to make changes. This is interesting and instructive in itself.</P>
    <P>Based on previous experience, I feel the Minister and I share a similar view on tax breaks. If it can be shown that breaks are filling a need and provide a value added element, then I believe they are good. My real difficulty is that we have not carried out any serious work in showing that multi-storey car parks tax breaks and health-based initiatives actually work. While the Revenue Commissioners have made an effort to quantify the loss to the Exchequer arising from these breaks, the work seems to have been carried out on the back of an envelope. I am not convinced that the numbers stand up to scrutiny. We must be sure that there is a need and that the tax breaks fulfil it.</P>
    <P>It is 15 months since the Minister announced that he was going to end these tax breaks. I did not believe him then and I still do not. People whispering in the Minister&rsquo;s ear about strategic and logistical reasons that these breaks should not be ended have clearly persuaded him. It would not surprise me to hear the Minister announce in next December&rsquo;s budget that they will be prolonged yet again. We should be honest about this and accept that they are justified in certain circumstances. They are a way in which high earners can often substantially reduce their taxes due. It is fine if the breaks help achieve targeted and defined social ends. However, if they do not they should be ended. I support the changes in the film tax relief, at least as a measure for the foreseeable future. I know the Minister has had some opposition to this measure from within his Department.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the move on private hospitals. While I am speaking off message again, <Col N="1925"/>I broadly support the Hanly proposals. There is merit in centralising specialities in larger hospitals while maintaining as good a service as possible in local hospitals. My wife is from Clare and I know the way in which people regard the hospital in Ennis. While tens of thousands demonstrated on the streets of Ennis, there is no doubt that in the event of a car crash, many of them would be slow to go to Ennis hospital. They would rightly choose to go Galway or Limerick hospitals.</P>
    <P>While there is merit in the Hanly proposals, it is only in the context of the overall implementation of the health strategy. The Minister and his colleague undertook to increase the State&rsquo;s hospital bed capacity by 3,000. People are afraid that if the Ennis casualty ward is closed they will end up in longer queues in Limerick or Galway hospitals. If the capital investment for increased beds promised in the health strategy is not released, it is folly to follow the Hanly route. The Minister will not be able to persuade his backbenchers. Nor do I think he can reasonably expect support from independent commentators or even the miserable few of us on the Opposition benches who see some merit in the overall strategy.</P>
    <P>Others have mentioned the issue of carbon taxes. I know the draft emissions strategy has been drawn up and I gather the full strategy will be submitted to Brussels in the coming weeks. While I have thought about this issue deeply in recent years, I have not come to a full conclusion. Taxes on energy only have merit if we bring about a behavioural change that will reduce carbon emissions. I do not see this happening unless there are significant increases in taxes on dirty energy sources and not on others. I do not see how we can do this without significantly impacting on our competitiveness and the poorest in society. If the great and the good in the Departments of Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can develop a scheme that will secure competitiveness, ensure the impact on the poor is not excessive, and will bring about the required behavioural change, then I will happily support it. I am not persuaded that the Departments will be able to do this and I suspect the Minister is not persuaded either.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister either has not decided or does not want to impose carbon taxes. If this is the case, it is silly and hypocritical to suggest we are going to introduce measures on 1 January next. We deserve more honest debate in this country and we have had little of it on this issue. There is a notion that if one is concerned about the environment then one should be in favour of carbon taxes. I am in favour of protecting the environment and favour taking hard choices, including tax measures, if they positively impact on the environment. There is a responsibility on those who favour carbon taxes to demonstrate that they will impact positively on the environment. As of now, I am not persuaded this is the case. I am interested by the provisions in the Bill for research and development. In a <Col N="1926"/>somewhat different context, I read carefully a short time ago the Lisbon strategy documentation prepared in the context of our Presidency. There is an aspect of motherhood and apple pie in its talk of improvement of IT facilities throughout the European Union, and in R &amp; D, and so on. Yet there is no doubt that R &amp; D forms an important part of the strategy, and will in the future form an important part of our capacity to maintain our cutting edge in terms of competitiveness, attracting foreign investment to Ireland, and, down the line, retaining the product of that R &amp; D in this country.</P>
    <P>The proposals in section 33 of the Bill are quite well formulated. One certainly needs a minimum level of research and investment, and the &euro;50,000 tax credit allowed in that area seems reasonable. One element I worry about is the link with property incentives, with buildings constructed for the purpose of carrying out R&amp; D. It does not need genius to suggest that this is open to abuse, and will need to be carefully policed. We want to see the work carried on in Ireland, and I appreciate that some of the investment will be in buildings, but we do not want to see all the additional benefit which R&amp; D will now attract going into the construction of buildings. If that were to happen, it would be a mistake and would be wrong. I urge the Minister to keep a careful eye on how this R&amp; D benefit and relief will be channelled in future.</P>
    <P>I remember in our short debate on budget night being sceptical about decentralisation. I am now quite critical of it, and not even sure that it is right in principle. Administering policy outside Dublin is fine, but as for the formulation of policy by people occupying offices in different parts of the country, whether the formulation is done by email or phone, I cannot see it working as effectively as through face to face meetings. We already have difficulties with a number of policy areas spread across different Departments. Children provide the classic example, with three or perhaps four Departments regularly involved in policy making. We appointed a Minister of State to co-ordinate matters, yet inadequacies remain in the policy-making process and in the final polices that emerge. People need to meet regularly. They need to look at each other directly, to sit down, debate, discuss and formulate policy. That cannot be done effectively if people are in different offices throughout the country, even if they sometimes come to meet the Minister in Dublin.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the civil servants who want to stay in Dublin, someone must say that this is a fine city. There are jobs here. If one says to perhaps 1,000 or more people, along with their families, in each constituency in Dublin, that we do not want them here but in some part of country, then some will wish to go as the Minister is happy to tell us, but many will want to stay in our fine city. These people should not be disadvantaged in their career prospects because of that simple choice, which is a logical one for them. Some of <Col N="1927"/>them, God help us, are Dubliners, and do not necessarily want to live in the country. Someone should break the consensus of political correctness, something which the Minister is usually anxious to do, which seems to surround the issue of decentralisation and assert that Dublin is a good place in which to live and that civil servants should not be blamed for wanting to stay there. I do not blame them.</P>
    <P>I have not put down any recommendations for tomorrow&rsquo;s session. Last year we asked the Seanad staff to toil into the night and eventually got onto recommendation No. 2. Nonetheless we had a useful debate. I hope we will have the opportunity for something similar tomorrow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his officials. It is right for us to throw bouquets at the Minister and at the officials who have so robustly supported him in his seven years as Minister for Finance. I am proud of what has been achieved in our economy over the last seven years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Senator was a socialist.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>One can look at the international economy and at that of the United States. The latter thought the economy was turbo-charged at the end of 2003. US productivity has risen, but the employment level has not. I follow the American economy closely on a daily basis. I read <i>The New York Times</i> on the Internet every day. America is in economic disarray and fear because despite all the tax cuts, no improvement has taken place.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell generously complimented the Minister on what has been achieved. That was gentlemanly of him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It never got me anywhere.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should stay the way he is. It is a good way to be. There is no point in disagreeing and finding fault just for the sake of it.</P>
    <P>The items in the budget which are most significant to me are the personal income tax changes. Since 1977, average tax rates have fallen for all categories of taxpayers, including those on lower incomes. We all recall when we were paying high tax, and how awful it was that no matter how much one earned, one had little disposable income left. We know the difference the improvements in the tax system have made. What warms my heart is that an increasing proportion of those on the income tax books, currently over 35% of them, pay no tax. It is critical that people on lower incomes pay no tax.</P>
    <P>The second item of significance to me is the BES. Having started a business with Connie Doody, I know the importance of the BES. It was critical to us at a certain stage in our business. It is very difficult to get money and the BES kept <Col N="1928"/>us going. We were about three years in business at the time and it was the life blood of the company. The Minister is correct to say the scheme should be focused and targeted. It cannot be applied in a slapdash manner. The increase in the maximum amount of money that a company can raise under the BES as well as under the seed capital scheme, from &euro;750,000 to &euro;1 million, is very important to new, young entrepreneurial companies, which are finding it hard to get money.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service we listened to a very passionate plea by members of the film industry and the unions involved. They begged us to ask the Minister not to remove the tax relief on films. I accept there were abuses, but it is good to give the industry another chance. The trade unions told us there were about 4,000 people directly or indirectly employed in film-making in Ireland. There are also thousands of young people studying film in different colleges around the country. It is a very important industry. I was conscious at the meeting of the committee that different groups were attending. It might be good to have an umbrella group, a film industry authority, similar to the IDA, selling Ireland as a film industry base. The Minister&rsquo;s decision is, however, correct. Those involved in the film business felt it would collapse if the relief was removed.</P>
    <?oasys [dc14]?><P>Tax credit on R &amp; D is critical. In his speech in Dublin Castle on his priorities for the EU Presidency, the Taoiseach said that regarding R &amp; D, Ireland and the EU were only in the halfpenny place compared to the United States. The competition that Ireland will face from China, India and the new entrants to the EU will be extraordinary. As a business person I know the reality of competition. It is hellish to survive in the market. As a country, we will have to be very hungry for survival in the face of cheap labour in China, India and the eastern European countries which want to be like us. We must improve our performance on competitiveness which concerns not just wages but many other issues and of which there is not an awareness. As my company does half of its business with the UK, I have experience of overcoming the growing strength of the euro. We struggled to sustain our business in the UK and had to get extra sales to make up for the loss in the exchange rate. It may sound easy, but to be competitive requires extraordinary dedication by all concerned. I also wish to personally thank the Minister for Finance for introducing a tax exemption on the transfer of intellectual property. I was delighted that he did so and I will appreciate it for the rest of my life.</P><?oasys [dc0]?>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has kept a steady course through a terrible world recession. We are doing much better than any other country. I found it sickening to listen to the UK Chancellor, Gordon Brown, blowing on about how Britain was best at this and that. Ireland is far superior to Britain in the handling of its economy. The <Col N="1929"/>next step is to declare war on poverty in Ireland. There are pockets of people who cannot compete and work in the economy and who need to be helped. A sustained and targeted ten year war on poverty is where our attention should next be directed. Those of us who can work and compete are doing grand. However, those, such as the disabled and Travellers, in poverty need help. I have seen it in my own business with young employees coming from dysfunctional homes. I have seen them bursting for a job, wanting to be good at it only to return to a dysfunctional family in the evening. This affects them coming to work the following day.</P>
    <P>In the coming years, child care will become the most important issue for the age 25-40 years cohort. With the cost of child care, it is now a luxury for some to have a second child. The Government has done its best to increase the number of child care facilities. However, a family with two children, one of six months and another of two years, and earning &euro;30,000 will only break even. A second child has become a luxury to such families. The supply of child care has increased but the demand is still greater, leading to expensive charges. It is also stopping highly qualified women from that age group from working. They are dispirited as they are inclined to stay at home to care for the children. Reintegration into the workplace then becomes a further problem. This issue must be dealt with as it is critical to that age group. I have worked on this issue and I hope the Minister will address it.</P>
    <P>A war on poverty needs to be declared and the child care issue needs to be addressed. I am proud of what the Minister for Finance and his officials have achieved. It is marvellous how they have put their hands on the tiller, particularly when one sees the state of the US economy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator speaking on the Finance Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am indeed. That was a reference one of his colleagues made to me earlier.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we get back to the Finance Bill, Senator?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely, a Chathaoirligh. Would I ever disobey you?</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. I am surprised that Senator White is upset with some aspects of it. The Finance Bill 2004 will go down in history as one of the shortest Finance Bills to come before the Houses. This is understandable in the context of the significant attention the Minister must be giving to his role and responsibilities as chairman of the European <Col N="1930"/>Council of Finance Ministers. The Budget Statement also gave rise to huge hopes and expectations for decentralisation. As a Killarney man, I look forward to seeing the legions of public servants that have been promised to the town in the wake of the Minister&rsquo;s budget day announcement.</P>
    <P>There is one important area where this Bill has done a disservice to the public. In the 2003 budget, the Minister introduced new stamp duty regimes for credit cards. Measures were introduced to prevent the avoidance of stamp duty which have had a negative impact on consumer choice, innovation and competition. While all Members support measures designed to prevent the avoidance and evasion of tax, it is important they are proportionate and effective. In the 2003 budget, the Minister&rsquo;s measures imposed a charge on any credit card that a cardholder had in a given year. This has the unfortunate effect of penalising cardholders who wish to change credit card provider. In other words, a cardholder who moved from AIB to MBNA got hit twice by the card tax, although still only holding one card. This is wrong and discourages competition which we want to see in all sectors.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to review the stamp duty on credit cards introduced in the 2003 budget. Amending it would lessen the burden imposed on consumers. There must be some way of amending these measures while maintaining the integrity of the collections system. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendments to the Bill on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il relating to research, development and innovation. I hope he will show equal generosity and foresight in other budget measures that will have direct implications for consumers.</P>
    <P>Our famous tax exiles do much charitable work in this State. However, there is something wrong in a society where wealthy individuals pay practically no tax by taking bed and breakfast for 183 days outside the State. To paraphrase US Senator John Kerry&rsquo;s call of &ldquo;bring &rsquo;em on&rdquo;, can we bring them back? They are not being patriotic even though they are as Irish as the rest of us. The Minister has been a man of innovation on many occasions, so perhaps he will have a way to tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>The hard-pressed consumer is the loser under this Bill. At a time when Ministers are telling consumers to shop around, the Minister for Finance has perpetuated features of the tax code that prevent shopping around for financial services. The stamp duty on credit cards is still structured in a way that when one moves card provider, one is hit twice. The stamp duty on mortgage instruments also means that the consumer who decides to move their mortgage account gets hit with a stamp duty bill. I would like the Minister to reconsider the issue of stamp duty for first-time buyers, because he made some more than sympathetic soundings in that respect last year. I look forward to hearing his comments in that regard.</P><Col N="1931"/>
    <P>Many people felt that decentralisation was not a suitable subject for a budget day announcement, but the Minister decided to make the announcement in the way that he did. I am delighted that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism will be relocated to Killarney. If I may say so, the town of Killarney and the Department in question are well-matched.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I am watching the Cathaoirleach with my left eye, which is my poor eye. I have read and heard references to the suggestion that some of the Sir Humphreys, according to the results of surveys conducted in various Departments, may not be too keen about decentralisation. I am glad that there was no need for a survey in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, because the indications are good. The Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Philip Furling, is a superb public official who was formerly of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if the Senator did not mention names.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand. The kindly gentleman in question has a great appreciation and understanding of Killarney. D&uacute;chas was within the ambit of his former Department, but it is now under the control of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, for reasons that I do not fully understand &mdash; it is probably misplaced. The man to whom I referred will give tremendous leadership. I do not know much about other Departments, but the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, can rest assured that everything is fine in respect of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, knows that he is &ldquo;on to a good thing&rdquo;, regardless of how he did with the ponies.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about D&uacute;chas, without showing disrespect to anyone. I have discussed the organisation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon. I do not <Col N="1932"/>understand the decision to move responsibility for D&uacute;chas to another organisation. I am aware that there are turf wars within the Civil Service &mdash; many people&rsquo;s attitude is &ldquo;what we have, we hold&rdquo; &mdash; but I genuinely believe that D&uacute;chas has been misplaced. I say that in the presence of the Minister who is responsible for the Office of Public Works. Responsibility for environmental and built heritage has been divided and there is a crazy situation in Killarney as a result. Killarney&rsquo;s built heritage includes Ross Castle, Muckross House and the cottages in Killarney National Park. However, responsibility for Muckross House, which is an integral part of Killarney&rsquo;s built heritage, rests with D&uacute;chas and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. With respect to the Minister, it does not make any sense. The solution to this problem is probably to reunite the former elements of D&uacute;chas under the aegis of the OPW, within the Department of Finance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator might be right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is where D&uacute;chas properly belongs. I am serious about this matter and I am glad to have mentioned it. I look forward to discussing it with the Minister on the margins at some suitable future stage, although I appreciate that he is busy with other duties.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his staff to the House. I welcome the Bill. I congratulate the Minister and his staff on his firm control of the public finances. The Government&rsquo;s fiscal policy was endorsed by the European Commission a short time ago. The suitability of the Minister&rsquo;s budgetary policy has been endorsed by the Central Bank and the ESRI in recent reports.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill&rsquo;s impact on inflation will be minimal, the budget deficit is prudent and discipline in current expenditure looks set to continue. We have been experiencing an international downturn, but so far we have survived it better than most other countries. Nobody can dispute that the downturn has been disappointing and painful for some and that tough choices have had to be made, but we can be grateful we have a Government that acts decisively.</P>
    <P>The public recognises the need to have fiscal restraint and to avoid excessive borrowing, which is the real stealth tax. We need to limit our spending to what we can afford. When I first entered the House, the national debt was over 100% of GNP and the IMF was at the door because of irresponsible borrowing policies pursued by Governments of all stripes between 1972 and 1987. There are encouraging signs, such as strong domestic and US growth and Ireland&rsquo;s GNP growth figures for the first few months of 2004.</P>
    <P>The fall in inflation is welcome. A great deal of nonsense is talked about inflation. The rise in <Col N="1933"/>inflation in recent times was caused by the euro&rsquo;s weakness and the fact that much of our trade is with countries outside the eurozone. In any case, inflation is now falling, which is especially welcome in terms of our competitiveness. I hope this decrease will encourage moderation in pay rises when the discussions take place.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House yet again reaffirms Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s commitment to the less well-off in our society. No Minister for Finance has provided more for the lower-paid than the present incumbent. The budget protected the weaker sections of the community through substantial real increases in welfare payments. Social welfare expenditure is twice what it was in 1997, even though employment has been halved.</P>
    <P>It is not just through social welfare increases ahead of the rate of inflation that the Government has done its duty. It has also improved the tax position of the lower-paid. The Bill delivers an increased employee credit, which ensures that tax is not payable on up to 90% of the minimum wage. When the minimum wage was increased in April 2000, less than 64% of those earning it were exempt from paying tax. The minimum wage was increased to &euro;7 on 1 February last and it is now the third highest such wage in the EU. On a monthly basis, it is almost three times that of Portugal.</P>
    <P>Some 700,000 people will be exempt from income tax in 2004, representing an increase of 40,000 from 2003 and of almost 300,000 since 1997. A single earner&rsquo;s entry point to the tax system has increased to &euro;246 per week from &euro;223 in 2003. As the Minister stated after the introduction of the budget, the average tax rate for a person on the average industrial wage will be ten percentage points lower than it was in 1997. An increasing proportion of those on the tax record &mdash; over 35% of all earners &mdash; will pay no tax this year.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Finance Bill will legally enact the Government&rsquo;s provisions to foster enterprise and to protect our jobs base for the future by putting in place measures to support our ability to sustain and expand employment. I am pleased that the rural renewal scheme is in place, particularly in the west. It has made a difference and brought benefits to parts of counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo. A young couple can buy a three-bedroom semi-detached house in a nice housing scheme for &euro;150,000. I have spoken to a number of friends in the Civil Service who were fortunate enough to have mortgages to help them to buy their homes ten years ago. I am aware that such people, who have equity of almost &euro;300,000 in respect of their Dublin homes, are only too delighted to move. People from Sligo are only too delighted to move from Dublin to Sligo, where they can buy a home for approximately &euro;150,000.</P>
   
    <P>It is important that we acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s extension of the timeframe for the rural renewal scheme from the end of 2004 to June 2006, in order to complete construction. I <Col N="1934"/>congratulate the Minister on that necessary change. Planning permission has been secured for a number of developments and a number of developments are in planning at present, despite the best efforts of some councillors and the changes made to county development plans. I know people who applied for planning permission a month ago for small schemes of between 18 and 20 houses in the rural renewal areas. The first problem is having the application validated. Then there is a request for further information and even though we do not have our development plans, further information can only be requested once. Now there is a new problem: a request for clarification, which takes another five or six weeks. While the timeframe to build is sufficient, I ask the Minister not to close the door on schemes for which permission has not been granted by the end of 2004 because there are serious hold-ups in the planning process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his seven years as Minister for Finance. As Senator Mansergh pointed out, he has probably served the longest term as Minister for Finance since the 1930s. I congratulate the Minister on pulling a fair few rabbits out of hats during that time. He sold Eircom and the TSB and then he raided the Central Bank. When he could find nothing else to do he introduced the decentralisation programme. He has presided over the introduction of lower tax rates of 42% and 20%, but he is shifting the tax base by introducing what other Senators have described as stealth taxes.</P>
    <P>Many other Departments are also making use of stealth taxes. Rather than funding local authorities, for example, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is asking them to raise taxes locally. This is of concern to members of local authorities, particularly those councillors who are facing into local elections, because they must raise refuse, development, water and sewerage charges. Many of these services are being funded under public private partnerships. We will not see the real cost of this until the increased rates come into effect in a year or two. The Minister has been very shrewd by shifting the blame, so to speak, in such areas.</P>
    <P>Everybody fought for the establishment of the BMW region, but the funding that is being drawn down is not working its way to the poorer areas. I have raised this issue a number of times with the Leader of the House and asked for a debate on how funding is distributed in the region. It has not been receiving its fair share of funding over the past number of years. I ask the Minister to take this into account.</P>
    <P>I recently tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion for the attention of the Minister for Transport, although the Minister that dealt with the matter was the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid. The motion was concerned with the national primary route from <Col N="1935"/>Westport to Castlebar, which has been put on the long finger. The Minister of State pointed out that roads such as this will not be completed until the larger projects in Dublin are completed. He mentioned the M50, the Luas project, the port tunnel and the recently announced rail link to Dublin Airport. While all these projects are welcome and necessary, so are the other routes.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that a balance is struck in regional development. We are not receiving our fair share. The Minister&rsquo;s decentralisation programme did not feature towns such as Castlebar, Westport and Ballina, although they are at the heart of the BMW region. I ask the Minister to consider how the Government can fund projects such as the Westport to Castlebar road. There are other roads such as this throughout the country. Why can projects in the BMW region not go ahead until the bigger projects in the Dublin region are completed? In a city that is growing as fast as Dublin, when one project is finished another will need to start. There will be an endless number of projects in the pipeline.

	<P>If that is happening, the land will need to be acquired and funding put in place. The Minister might consider these issues.</P>
    <P>This is one of the least controversial Finance Bills to pass through the House for many years. There are some issues that could be discussed further. As has been pointed out by a number of Senators, we should investigate more closely the position of the underprivileged and the less well off. There are many poor people out there and many who are suffering. Housing is very expensive and frequently both members of a couple must work to keep up with mortgage payments. Although interest rates are low, there is great hardship in some homes because of the high cost of housing. The housing situation in Cork was highlighted on television recently. Those who can avail of schemes such as these cannot even afford the house prices. Finally, although we have not had a debate in the House on funding for the BMW region, I hope the Minister will address this issue in his summing up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate. By way of a general comment, I point out to the House that the budget and its implementation, including the Estimates and tax provisions in the Finance Bill, are part of a strategic approach to our economic development. I agree with Senator McDowell that the economy has shown itself to be resilient and sturdy.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan mentioned that we currently have the privilege of holding the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. For some time now, the policies advocated at the Economic and Finance <Col N="1936"/>Council and by the European Commission consist of lowering the tax burden on labour and capital to stimulate the EU economy and keeping down the ratio of public spending to GDP so that Europe may regain competitiveness. These policy prescriptions are shared by the right and the left in Europe and are already being followed to a large extent by the Government. I assure Members that Ireland&rsquo;s economic situation is the envy of many other states in the Union and has been widely praised by all the main and reputable economic commentators.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the income tax changes in budget 2004. I reject any criticism that the Government has failed to index credits and bands. Senator Browne referred to stealth taxes and highlighted the non-indexation of tax credits in this sector. I dismiss the notion of stealth taxes. The measures to implement Government income tax policies are laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the Finance Bill and are debated openly. There is no stealth involved. All PAYE workers benefited from the income tax changes in budget 2004. However, the resources available were focused on the lower paid and the elderly, providing significant increases in PAYE credits and exemption limits for the elderly. This approach ensures that 90% of the minimum wage, annualised, is maintained free of tax and that the real value of income for pensioners on low incomes is protected. It is fully in line with the commitments contained in An Agreed Programme for Government and Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>The increase in the PAYE credit means that in 2004, for a single PAYE worker, the first &euro;12,000 per annum or &euro;246 per week of earnings will be tax free. For a married one-earner with a carer in the home, the first &euro;24,250 per annum or &euro;466 per week will be free of tax. I remind Senators that in 2004, 35% of all income earners will now be entirely outside the tax net.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne referred to more than half of all PAYE taxpayers paying tax at the higher rate in 2004, suggesting that the Government had abandoned its policy of having 18% of income earners pay tax at no more than the standard rate. To talk about half of all PAYE taxpayers paying tax at the higher rate this year gives the wrong impression. If one talks about taxpayers rather than income earners, perversely the more people we exempt from tax, the higher the percentage of taxpayers at the top rate, even if there is no increase in the numbers. There is nothing incorrect in shifting the basis for comparison. This became necessary once we moved to tax allowances or tax credits. Some commentators are not comparing like with like. Under the allowance system, a person does not enter the top rate band until allowances are used up but under the tax credit system, which currently applies, the bands apply from the first euro with credit deducted afterwards.</P>
    <P>I also draw the Senators&rsquo; attention to the real reduction in the tax burden for those on average incomes. May I remind Senators that since 1997, <Col N="1937"/>the average tax rate for a single worker on the average industrial wage has dropped by ten percentage points from 27% to 17%. In addition, it is expected that in 2004, those earning at or under the average industrial wage will contribute approximately 6% of the total tax take; the equivalent in 1997 was 14%.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention international comparisons. The tax wedge, which in simple terms is the difference between what the worker receives into his or her hand and the total payroll cost to the employer of hiring that worker, is crucial from an employment point of view. For the average production worker who is married with a carer in the home, Ireland now has the lowest tax wedge in the European Union and the OECD. Furthermore, recently released OECD data show that the tax wedge for workers has fallen more sharply in Ireland than in any other OECD country, reflecting the progress the Government has made in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne referred to housing and the position of first-time buyers in regard to stamp duty. The Government considers that one of the main objectives of housing policy is to increase supply and we have been phenomenally successful in achieving this. Last year, almost 70,000 new housing units were constructed which is a record and per head of population must be the highest ratio in the European Union.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please. The Minister without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards stamp duty, first-time buyers and other owner-occupiers pay no stamp duty on new houses up to 1350 sq. ft. On houses bigger than this duty is only paid on a quarter of the total value of the house plus the site or on the site value only. In practice a new house must cost approximately &euro;760,000 for first-time buyers before this duty arises.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the issue of prosecutions and the tax amnesty. As Minister for Finance I have done more to combat tax evasion than any previous holder of the office. I have provided powers to the Revenue in the Finance Act 1999 and in later years, which have facilitated the collection of over &euro;1billion in tax interest and penalties through the various investigations carried out by the Revenue in recent years. Revenue powers have recently been reviewed by the Revenue powers group and I will be receiving its recommendations in the context of the 2005 Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Senator called for the introduction of a &euro;2,000 annual tax credit for relief to amateur sportspersons. This proposal was discussed at length in the D&aacute;il on both Committee and Report Stages where I made my views clear. This proposal of a tax credit for relief to amateur sportspersons has been promoted by the Gaelic Players&rsquo; Association whose members are not paid <Col N="1938"/>in respect of their direct participation in the games. In effect it means that the taxpayer should subsidise the Gaelic players when their own governing body is unwilling to do so. This is the nub of the matter. Furthermore, the proposed tax credit of &euro;2,000 per annum per sportsperson is more than the total tax credit available to a non-PAYE single person, which stands at &euro;1520 while a PAYE tax credit of &euro;1040 is almost half of what the GPA propose to be granted to a select group of players. A tax credit of &euro;2,000 is the equivalent of exempting &euro;10,000 of income from tax for a standard rate taxpayer and is hardly justifiable in the circumstances. For these reasons as well as the inevitable consequences that the introduction of this credit would lead to other categories of individuals who give of their time and incur expenses in a wide variety of community, youth and other voluntary work demanding a similar credit on equally supportable grounds, I cannot agree to this proposal.</P>
    <P>The extension of the urban and town renewal schemes is intended to provide for an orderly winding down of the schemes. I received numerous representations from across the political spectrum, including Members of the Opposition, urging me to extend the deadline for such schemes. All the extensions are subject to conditions which will limit the number of projects that can avail of the extensions. For example, the urban renewal scheme must have incurred 15% of the total project costs under the scheme by 30 June 2003. Furthermore, these schemes are also based in integrated area plans which set out the plans of relevant local authorities which deal with the redevelopment of these often deprived areas from an economic, social and community point of view.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne referred to capping the level at which an individual may claim certain reliefs and allowances. The Senator may be interested to learn that in the budget of 1998 I introduced a cap of &euro;31,750 in relation to an amount that an individual passive investor can offset against non-rental income. Any unrelieved allowances can be carried forward for offset against the individual&rsquo;s rental income. Other relief schemes, such as the business expansion scheme and the film relief scheme, also have a limit of &euro;31,750 which individual investors can set off against their general income. The placing of additional limitations on the setting-off of income from such schemes is not something I would favour as it may limit the effectiveness of these schemes in providing the economic and social benefits to the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senator McDowell, referred to the issue of tax expenditures and tax incentives. There is no doubt that tax reliefs and incentives can be very effective. The evidence of this is for all to see in the shape of significant developments, regenerations and improvements. The question which has to be posed on a regular basis, not least by myself, is whether such reliefs continue to be <Col N="1939"/>as necessary in the current situation when we have lowered tax rates so significantly in the past seven years. In other words, when rates are brought down, does the tax base need to be broadened or at least, stabilised, in order to protect the flow of revenue to the Exchequer?</P>
    <P>There is another prong to this theory, namely that when one lowers tax rates, the incentive to shelter from the Revenue Commissioners should be similarly reduced. Regardless of the theory, the hard reality is that there will always be an understandable inclination among certain taxpayers to try to reduce their tax liabilities. This has proven true despite the reductions in the rates of income tax and corporation tax. It has been acknowledged the world over. One has only to observe the debate about tax evasion in the United States, hardly a high tax economy, to have an understanding of the complexities surrounding this issue.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, Ministers for Finance of all political hues have recognised this and have for many decades accommodated this by introducing tax <Col N="1940"/>incentive schemes in order to harness the inclination so that it will be put to some use for the wider economy. I have spoken before about my experiences of the end of the tax year rush to participate in certain schemes in order to reduce the tax being paid regardless of the merits or otherwise of the scheme in question.</P>
    <P>In my time as Minister for Finance, I too have introduced a number of incentive schemes. I have also abolished a number and amended, clarified or curtailed others. I believe that in order for tax incentives to be effective, we must have people who are paying tax and are prepared to invest. Tax expenditures reduce the tax base and it is, by and large, higher earners who avail of them. As with most things in life, the issue is one of balance. We need to strike a balance between encouraging higher earners to avail of tax incentives in order to meet a need in our economy or society and the cost of this.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and I look forward to Committee Stage tomorrow which will offer an opportunity for more detailed discussion.</P>
