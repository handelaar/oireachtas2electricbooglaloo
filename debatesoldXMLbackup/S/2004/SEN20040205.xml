	<P>I have received notice from Senator Brennan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to indicate the current position on an application by Limerick County Council for refurbishment works at Glenma housing estate, Croom, County Limerick.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to report on the delay in fully commissioning the new facilities at James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Higgins of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to approve the necessary funding for the extension of the Ballyhaunis sewerage scheme to Derrymore, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to state if he has received a report from An Post concerning the downgrading of Kiltormer post office, Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give the up to date position on the urgent need for additional school accommodation at primary and second level for the growing population of Lucan, County Dublin.</P><Col N="522"/>
    <?_cl11.5-?><P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to explain why towns which did not qualify under the original scheme but urgently need incentives to survive are not allowed to participate in the town renewal tax incentive scheme.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to intervene in respect of the proposal to replace kitchen staff in the Plunkett nursing home in Boyle, County Roscommon, with outside caterers; and if this proposal is part of a wider policy by the Department to close down such facilities.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Kitt as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. I regard the matters raised by the remaining Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Brennan, Terry and Higgins's matters which will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Tuffy, Bannon and Feighan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
   </Speaker>

 <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, a new Standing Order dealing with interventions in debate, a copy of which was circulated to all Members following a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges yesterday afternoon; and No. 2, statements on the proposed stadium at Lansdowne Road, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and Members may share time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will be aware that a decision was taken yesterday by the Member for the Foyle constituency in the British Parliament, John Hume, not to contest this year's European elections and the next British general election. It would be fitting to record the enormous contribution of John Hume, MP and MEP, to politics on these islands. He has made a major contribution to the peace process, stood absolutely firm against violence, intimidation and paramilitarism for the past 35 years and has been the voice of reason and confidence for the middle ground in Northern Ireland. It is wise and appropriate that we should recognise his contribution.</P>
    <P>On a second issue, yesterday during Prime Minister's question time in the House of <Col N="523"/>Commons, Prime Minister Blair stated that the British Government is considering changing the welfare and labour entitlements offered to the citizens of the new accession states from May of this year. I do not raise this issue in an alarmist way; I am being utterly reasonable about it. An issue arises, however, in that if the British take a position whereby the citizens from the accession states are prohibited from May of this year from working and obtaining benefits in Britain, it could have an impact here in terms of an overflow.</P>
    <P>In many respects, when it comes to common travel areas, the Schengen Agreement and other matters, we have taken a joint position with the British. We may have to take a joint position with them on this issue. As the Leader is aware, when the treaty was being negotiated, all states had a right to a concession from 2002 to 2006; after that time it will require agreement from Brussels. We should probably harmonise our position with the British on this issue to ensure that for that two year period there is a sensible flow of new workers into this country from the accession states. I do not raise this issue in an alarmist fashion, but it is a practical issue that both Governments should work on together rather than one working unilaterally.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Hayes regarding my constituent, John Hume. We take a broader view from these benches.</P>
     </Speaker><P el="10"><i>(Interruptions)</i>.</P>
  
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure Senator Ross he has been an NUI voter for many years. I also support what Senator Hayes said about his absolute courage at all times. I remember meeting him here in 1988-89 during the talks with Gerry Adams, which had begun at that stage. I asked him if he was very busy meeting many people and he said none of the party leaders, including those of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or Labour, wanted to talk to him because he was in discussions with Sinn F&eacute;in. He is a man who has shown courage all the way through and I support very much what Senator Brian Hayes said about him.</P>
    <P>Does the Leader feel she has been put in the extraordinary position of misleading this House by the misinformation which was given to her by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which insisted the Immigration Bill would have to be passed by last Friday? We now find it will not come back to this House earlier than the middle of next week. This is absolutely appalling. The Leader has been put in an awkward position. She and the Deputy Leader have discharged their position admirably despite all the circumstances, but it is unacceptable. Some points were made here last week that what was written down was absolutely immutable, and we said to the Department it would not last a week <Col N="524"/>and were proved right, something we will say when the Bill returns to the House. However, there is a bigger issue. We are simply being kicked around at the mercy of the Department, which does not care about embarrassing Leaders, Deputies or Ministers. They will give them any kind of script to get them through. It is appalling and we should all agree that they be forced to give an explanation for those kinds of wrong advice and misinformation &mdash; I could use stronger words, but I do not want to embarrass the Cathaoirleach by doing so, though in the future I may have to do so. That Department badly needs to be shaken up, told who is in charge and that those who work there are servants of the State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would love to get into a competition about who's constituent John Hume is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>You have the Roman Catholic Church sewn up, so let him have the universities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please. On the Order of Business, Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the Catholics half as well tied up as Senator Norris has the Anglicans.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the prominence in my Church that Senator Norris has in his.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is time-wasting while many are offering and I would like to be fair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a far more serious note, I agree with Senator O'Toole. My experience of that particular Department concerns two successive years in the 1980s when an educational tour to Ireland by a secondary school in Britain was almost disrupted because two of the 15 year old pupils were refused visitors' visas to come here by the Department of Justice. They were 15 year old Asians who were coming here with their school. On two successive years I was approached, on one occasion by three members of the House of Commons who asked what sort of a country it was that would stop kids coming with their school on an educational tour. To put it gently that Department is peculiar. It needs to be looked at seriously and to have explained to it that the order of governance is that the Oireachtas picks the Government and the Government runs the Department, not that the Department runs the Government which in turns runs the Oireachtas, which seems to be the illusion under which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform operates. It severely <Col N="525"/>needs to remember its place which is that it is there to serve others, not to be served by others.</P>
    <P>I would like a clear statement from the Government about, not the assurances of the Minister for Transport who never comes into this House, but the future of publicly owned airports in the light of this week's decision by the European Commission. It was interesting that last week's edition of <i>The Economist</i>, before this decision was made, suggested there was a simple solution to the Ryanair-Charleroi problem, namely to privatise all the publicly owned airports. Given the clear agenda of the Minister for Transport, it immediately raises the question of whether he believes the solution to all these problems is to privatise the airports because his current policy is a step in that direction. What is the Government's position on the publicly owned airports, particularly those outside Dublin?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is unusual but I am sure I will be allowed some latitude to acknowledge the debt this country owes to John Hume and to acknowledge the contribution he has made to peace on this island. He has been a champion of democratic politics at a time when it was extremely difficult to be one. He was quite single-minded about that and in ensuring peace would be brought to this island. He is a Nobel laureate in acknowledgement of that fact. I met him just before the Sunningdale Agreement. At that time one could understand the emotional toll such things took on him. To sustain that over such an extended period was remarkable. It is important that the House acknowledges the debt owed to him by everyone on this island and in the wider world.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to make time available as a matter of urgency for a debate on the EPA report on drinking water and the quality of water in our lakes, rivers and estuaries, published today. The most frightening aspect of the report is that many local authorities use seven times the permitted level of aluminium in the treatment. That aluminium has links with the increased rate of Alzheimer's disease. It is a damning indictment of the Minister that a quarter of waste water from sewerage is released untreated into the lakes, rivers and estuaries. Only last week in the House, I raised the issue of the town of Kinvara which is releasing raw sewerage into Galway Bay and causing serious damage to the oyster beds which are unique and commercially important to the west. If we are ever to reach compliance with the EU water directives, it is important that the Minister provides funding to local authorities to ensure they do not continue to allow the release of untreated sewerage into our rivers and likes. Other industries and farming have been blamed. <Col N="526"/>We want to place the blame exactly where it should be, in the Minister's hands.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is seeking a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept your ruling that I cannot raise the issue of Kiltormer post office. There is a commitment to review the automated office in Kiltormer in six months' time and I hope that my raising the issue yesterday played some part in that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ulick Burke on the issue of the EPA report. I raised in the House last week the amount of voluntary commitment that goes into these schemes. I said then and I say it today that we need to help the smaller group water schemes. There is a low level of water monitoring and there are small schemes in need of assistance. I hope we can have a debate on this and on other environmental issues as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senator Ulick Burke about the EPA report. I would like the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come before the House to debate this issue. There have been statements by the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, on rural housing. It has been identified in the report that much of the pollution in group water schemes results from septic tanks and other types of effluent. How can both be reconciled in respect of the plans for expanding rural housing?</P>
    <P>I have raised with the Leader on many occasions the question of the Minister coming before the House to speak on the prisons issue. The Minister made a statement yesterday about the closure of Mountjoy and the building of a new prison which is very laudable. Some &euro;100 million has been expended on Mountjoy in recent years. One of the units remains unopen, while another unit is open only from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. I would like to know what is happening because there is much confusion regarding prison policy, much of which is happening against the backdrop of the dispute concerning overtime <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Prison Officers Association. I am concerned the good progress made in the prison service will go in a different direction as a result of what is happening. If the Minister would come into the House and at least answer questions on the matter we would have a better understanding of what is happening.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I too believe that John Hume has earned a special place not only in Irish history but in the hearts of people of all traditions on this island. Not only did he display courage at an horrific time but the vision and confidence he displayed kept hope alive in the hearts of the <Col N="527"/>people that a resolution to our problems could be found.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to invite to the House the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to discuss the decision of the Government to improve local and community development programmes, which would also give us a particular opportunity to discuss issues regarding rural Ireland. Many issues, such as decentralisation and planning, impact on the programmes which are now to be implemented. We have touched on some of them before but we need an integrated discussion on the issues regarding rural Ireland. Anybody living in urban areas, particularly Dublin city, will realise that we have over-saturated some areas with amenities and industry and need to consider how we can help rural Ireland.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what Senators Ryan and O'Toole have just said regarding the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is important that a message goes out from this House that we are not an instrument of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but that it is an instrument of this House. It has been known for many years that the Department has a Kremlinesque attitude to disseminating information, is a fortress in terms of its own empire and regards democracy as something of a nuisance in the promotion of its objectives. We ought to send out that message and, if the Leader of the House is being abused in this way by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we should say that we will not put up with it.</P>
    <P>On a more specific level, some months ago in this House Senator O'Toole and I had a motion agreed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which agreed to set up a review of auctioneering. I will not speak on the substantive issue but point out that the review has not taken place. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has simply ignored what it agreed to in this House. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister or Minster of State at the Department to report back to this House about what is happening in regard to that review.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the House will agree that we rise to the occasion when we debate foreign affairs, as was evidenced by the level of debate last evening in regard to the Independent motion. The Leader might consider that we would have this as a normal part of our business on a more regular basis, although I appreciate that it is the procedure that this comes from one of the groupings or by way of Government business. I am specifically interested not only in our ongoing monitoring of events in the Middle East but in the Iraq situation, which is constantly <Col N="528"/>evolving. I ask the Leader that Government time might perhaps be given for that during one of the Wednesday debates. As spokesperson on foreign affairs, I would be happy to liaise with the Leader on the text.</P>
    <P>I also support the important point made by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;. There is a need to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to the House to bring together the various strands regarding his Department, to present Government policy in a cohesive fashion and to allow Members, particularly those from rural areas but also those from urban areas, to make a contribution to a debate which is obviously significant due to the changing nature of Irish society. That might be an issue the Leader could consider in the context of rural development.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is trying to bring us back to the days of dancing at the crossroads.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Considering media reports last week regarding the possible privatisation of the universities, does the Leader think this will have an impact on the proposals of the Sub-committee on Seanad Reform and that, at a stroke, we may abolish the Seanad votes of university Senators?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Last October or November, I called for a debate regarding the publication of the BMW mid-term evaluation report as I was extremely concerned with the slow uptake of funding with regard to the protection of the environment. Today, with the publication of the Environmental Protection Agency water quality report, I have serious concerns as to why funding was not taken up at the time. Smaller group water scheme committees in the west and midlands were very concerned with the level of bureaucracy involved in drawing down funding to upgrade their schemes.</P>
    <P>Today's report suggests that nearly 40% of our lakes and rivers have phosphorous levels exceeding EU limits. We are told that we must comply with EU regulations in this regard by 2007 but, given today's report, this would seem virtually impossible. We need an urgent debate on the three published reports and I support my colleagues in calling for a debate as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators in paying tribute to John Hume who for 35 years was at the centre of practically every creative initiative to bring peace to Northern Ireland. We need to give him and his colleagues credit for averting or at least mitigating disaster.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the peace process, there are at least a couple of people in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who played a quite outstanding role in that process. While we are discussing what happened <Col N="529"/>last week, I point out that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform took full personal responsibility for the arrangements. We should not go down the track of criticising civil servants for what are and ought to be political decisions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>While I sympathise with the position taken by Senator Mansergh, if we have difficulty with the attitude of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and I share the reservations of my colleagues on this side of the House, we have the remedy in our own hands. Theoretically, this House directs and orders its own business but what happened last week exposed the cosmetic nature of this perception as it simply is not true. We are directed by outside forces at various times. If we really want to reclaim democracy, we could buck the system by ordering our own business independently in this House. However, for political reasons it is unlikely that this will happen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the PDs one of those forces?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the compliments paid to John Hume. One of the most significant points about Mr. Hume was his way of expressing a complex political view with simplicity and clarity in a completely lapidary manner. Although, towards the end of his regime one became a little used to them, certain phrases, such as that about the significant border being in the hearts and minds of the people and not on a map, went to the heart of the matter.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o'clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to raise a particular matter regarding violence against women which we discussed in the past week or so. Subsequently, there was a report in the newspapers regarding two young women living quietly on the outskirts of Dublin. They were lesbians and did not make a fuss about it, but some locals discovered this and teenagers and people in their early twenties besieged the house on a regular basis and caused the women annoyance. Eventually, they made so much of a nuisance of themselves that one of the women went out to ask them to keep the noise down. She was viciously attacked, a bottle was broken on her head and she subsequently received a number of stitches.</P>
    <P>The case went to court where the young woman assailant was fined &euro;500 and, on the basis that she would eventually manage to pay that sum, she was to be let off with the probation Act so that she would not have a criminal record. This is extraordinary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the point has been adequately made.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="530"/>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to make representations regarding this matter in the appropriate quarter, which I presume is that of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to ensure monitoring of this type of attack. The report concluded that the matter was now resolved as the two women had relocated. It is not appropriate in this day and age that two young people living together peacefully should be driven out of their home, and that the community is happy they have relocated as this solves the problem.</P>
 
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the words of thanks and congratulations to John Hume and ask the Leader if it would be possible to invite him to this House in his capacity as a member of the European Parliament.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be a matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to this House, as requested on a number of occasions in the past two weeks, to present his proposals for the reform and restructuring of both the prison service and the prisons? In light of the decision made by the Government yesterday to replace Mountjoy Prison with a new prison somewhere in Dublin, it is important that the Minister should keep us informed of changes he is making. Spike Island and the Curragh prisons are now closed and he has not come to this House to discuss any of these issues. The prison service is currently in a very serious state with one man dead and others injured in recent disturbances in prisons. It is imperative that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform himself should come to this House to present his proposals so that we can debate them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has continued to lecture us that electronic voting is tamper-proof and idiot-proof. He has asked us to put our faith in this new voting system. We all know that the contract for publicity for this electronic voting system has been awarded to a company with strong links to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. I would like the Minister to come to this House and confirm or deny this company has a deliberate agenda to influence the public by way of its explanatory leaflets which clearly indicate a voter casting a vote for the Fianna F&aacute;il candidate. Second, and more worrying, it excluded Fine Gael as there is no Fine Gael logo or candidate in the European elections. This is blatant discrimination.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>It raises the question of the impartiality of the company. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to come to this House and appoint an independent body or commission to <Col N="531"/>handle the introduction and management of this new system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Brennan that we should invite John Hume to this House. Perhaps we could also invite his wife, Pat, who was the engine room behind John Hume's success down through the years. It would be appropriate to invite both of them.</P>
    <P>Six months ago, the Leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Ahern, announced there would be a major drive to make it easier to build one-off housing in the countryside. Two weeks after the announcement, RTE's Brian Dobson travelled to Galway to interview the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who said the system would be changed to make it easier for local people to build one-off housing in the countryside. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, made a front page announcement in one of the broadsheets over Christmas that it would be easier for local people to build one-off housing in the countryside. Six months later, there is no mechanism on how this will be done, what it is all about or when it will be implemented. It is empty rhetoric.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has tabled a motion on the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tabled a joint motion with the Labour Party. We tabled a motion three weeks ago on development levies. A motion on planning is required. Senators on this side of the House agree with me in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for Private Members' time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>How can we and the media in a democracy allow the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to rant and rave six months later about a policy that does not exist? There is no flesh on a skeleton.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can do nothing about that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brian Hayes for raising the issue of the retirement of John Hume. There is no doubt it is the issue of the day in political terms. The Cathaoirleach allowed extensive laudatory remarks on John Hume, which was correct, because he is a person apart. He is a very special person. Courage is one of his biggest qualities, to which Senator O'Toole <Col N="532"/>referred. At one time if one took part in a radio programme with other parties the fact that John Hume met with Sinn F&eacute;in would be condemned. I recall him being battered on a programme, so to speak, because he had met with Sinn F&eacute;in, which was not the flavour of the day. I applaud his courage and thank Senator Hayes for raising the matter.</P>
    <P>It appears the UK is limiting in some fashion, whether by not providing benefits or otherwise, the numbers entering the country from the accession countries. Ireland and the UK were the two countries who did not intend putting a stay of any kind on the numbers coming from accession countries. It now appears that the UK will put a stay on the numbers coming to the country, but it is not clear what vehicle it will use. I will raise the issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Given that we have expressed an open welcome to these countries, we should stick to it. A change of policy in the UK would leave us in a particular situation. I will ask the Minister to clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>I echo Senator O'Toole's thoughts on the courage of John Hume.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify the issue of the Immigration Bill. The Deputy Leader and I conveyed by telephone and directly to the Minister on several occasions that we wished to have a gap between the Second and Committee Stage debate. It was based on my clear belief that the Bill would not get through the D&aacute;il in one day. I knew it would not, nor should it. For us to deal with the Bill on Tuesday and Friday appeared a more realistic way to do business. I knew the Bill could not be railroaded through the D&aacute;il, which was the point the Deputy Leader and I made. Be that as it may, what happened last Friday happened. I understand many amendments are being tabled in the D&aacute;il, which is correct. Many of the points raised in this House on Second Stage have found their way into amendments which have been accepted. There was a role, limited though it may be, for the Second Stage debate in this House which has found an echo in amendments. It is intended to finish the Bill tonight in the D&aacute;il after which it will be reshaped, with the inclusion of many amendments. The business for next week will be taken over two days because there is not sufficient business for three days. I suggested that we would deal with the Bill on Wednesday, which was accepted.</P>
    <P>This is a very strong lesson to Departments. We are not opposed to dealing with emergency legislation which is sometimes required urgently. As a Bill of this kind will shape the lives of many people for years to come, it is important that it is treated in an even-handed manner and within a broad timeframe. Rushed legislation is bad legislation. Each day we are confronted with the need for new or updated legislation. Senators made a stand last Thursday and Friday and I understand their point of view.</P><Col N="533"/>
    <P>I feel that a greater understanding now exists in various Departments on how we approach our business.</P>
    <P>On Senator Ryan's point, civil servants in the main agree they are employed to serve others. That is why they enter the service. The Senator asked that the Minister for Transport be invited to the House to explain his position on airports. We will request that and I will bite my tongue.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis expressed very clearly how highly he and his party regard John Hume.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke raised the issue of group schemes. Those of us in rural areas seem to have spent much of our lives labouring on group schemes, getting the money, getting the groups together, paying subventions and gathering the rest of the money. Only 25% of the 8% of drinking water in question is now deemed to be of bad quality, but we had a significant debate on the recent Water Services Bill. It passed through this House and I remember listening to many of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We will see. In any event, there were very some very positive findings in the report issued. I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the report and various environmental matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt certainly had an effect if the Kiltormer issue is under review. He, too, called for a debate on water supplies. Senator Finucane called for a debate on rural housing. His points were echoed by others. Everybody is receiving plaudits for being in favour of rural housing, but services must be supplied individually to each house. Problems may arise in obtaining planning permission because services are the main matters that bring themselves to bear on this. However, it is time to draw the threads together regarding what seems a laudable policy and to put a shape on it. I will ask the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to come to the House to discuss the issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane also raised the issue of Mountjoy and prison policy, on which he called for a debate. It is time for such a debate because the matter is rolling ahead.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that John Hume has earned a special place not only in Irish history but in the hearts of Irish people of all traditions on this island. He also asked that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, be invited to the House to discuss, in an integrated way, the various grants and schemes that are available for rural living.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross stated the House is not an instrument of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I have asked for the review of <Col N="534"/>auctioneers because the Department in charge promised it. We should invite the Minister to the House to discuss this.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the debate on the Independent Senators' motion last night. Again, I thank Senator Norris and his colleagues because it was a really excellent debate. I thank everyone who contributed, including the Minister and Minister of State. It was a worthwhile occasion and I look forward to a debate on Iraq, perhaps on an all-party basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney wondered if the privatisation of the universities might be the death knell of our esteemed university Senators. I do not believe it will.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon called for a debate on the BMW mid-term evaluation report and the EU regulations on phosphorous limits in water supplies. I will endeavour to facilitate him. We try to process the various requests for debates in some kind of chronological order, but we will certainly highlight the issue raised by the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh paid tribute to John Hume. The Senator, above all others, should know about the work of John Hume because of all his dealings with him and all the labyrinths through which they trod together. His words were so well chosen. He also spoke of ministerial responsibility, on which his comments were correct.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris stressed the need for us to order our business independently. We cannot do so because we have to await legislation. We cannot decide in any give week that we would like a particular Bill. There is a conduit through which Bills come to the House. However, we try to be as independent as we can and to have our own agenda. It would not be possible to operate in a limbo in which we would decide each week to consider a certain Bill. I note the Senator's sentiments on John Hume and on violence against women. On the latter point, the fact that the couple in question had to relocate meant they had to run from their home, which was disgraceful.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Senator Brennan took up and ran with the good idea of having John Hume in the House. I was going to request this myself. I ask the Cathaoirleach, as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, if we could have a short meeting next week just to deal with an invitation from the House to John Hume. It would be brilliant if he could come and it would be very worthwhile.</P>

   <Title>Proposed Stadium at Lansdowne Road: Statements.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on what is a most important sporting issue, namely, the decision of the Government to support the development of a sports stadium at Lansdowne Road and a sports campus at Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>Tuesday, 27 January was a good day for Irish sport. Early last week, I was proud to announce that the Government had agreed to allocate substantial grant assistance in support of a joint Football Association of Ireland-Irish Rugby Football Union project to redevelop Lansdowne Road as a all-seated state-of-the-art stadium with a capacity of 50,000.</P>
    <P>It was also my great pleasure to announce that the Government has agreed to proceed with the phased delivery of a sporting campus at Abbotstown. The decision on the stadium at Lansdowne Road has been arrived at following many years of hard work on the part of very many people. It has involved disappointment and some reversals along the way and there were some difficult times. Since becoming Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I have engaged in an extensive series of consultations with the major sporting bodies and with my ministerial colleagues on how best to address a widely acknowledged deficit in Ireland's sporting infrastructure, namely, inadequate quality stadium accommodation to house prestigious international sporting fixtures.</P>
    <P>The FAI and the IRFU have been under pressure in recent times to provide acceptable stadium accommodation for their major international fixtures. In the case of the FAI at least, this had become an issue of immediate concern affecting its ability to host fixtures in the 2006 World Cup preliminaries in the country.</P>
    <P>FIFA, the world governing body for football, had indicated to the FAI that temporary seating for Lansdowne Road would no longer be acceptable for international soccer events, creating the real possibility of preliminary round qualifying matches for Ireland's 2006 World Cup campaign having to be played outside Ireland. This was a scenario the Government was not prepared to countenance. The IRFU too needed to secure its international future at Lansdowne Road.</P>
    <P>Lansdowne Road has, since 1872, served the needs of Irish rugby. Since 1982 it has been the home to Ireland's soccer internationals. However, <Col N="537"/>arising from the needs of spectators both in terms of safety and comfort, the facilities at Lansdowne Road are no longer adequate for it to be a venue for major international fixtures.</P>
    <P>The re-development of Croke Park into an 80,000 seat stadium, which is now nearing completion, has rightly been acclaimed as a magnificent achievement. However, this represents only one part of the jigsaw. Over recent months I have had ongoing contact with the sporting bodies and in my meetings with the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA, I found broad support among them for the proposition that two modern stadia were required, one capable of accommodating 80,000 spectators and one catering for 50,000 spectators.</P>
    <P>It was in this context that the FAI-IRFU put forward their proposal for a 50,000 all seated stadium at Lansdowne Road. The concept is truly state-of-the-art. I am advised that this project is both deliverable and cost effective and is considered least likely to give rise to major planning difficulties. The estimated cost of this project is &euro;250 million in current prices, which is likely to translate into actual outlays totalling just under &euro;300 million as the project is realised over the next five years. Approved Government support is &euro;167 million in current prices, which is expected to translate into cumulative outlays of just over &euro;190 million over five years.</P>
    <P>The new Lansdowne Road will be a 50,000 all seated stadium with a transparent roof covering the seats which will be built on the axis of the existing stadium at Lansdowne Road. The process of securing planning permission for the project will now commence. Subject to compliance with all planning requirements, it is hoped that the new stadium will be completed by 2008. It will meet all the current international standards for rugby and soccer and the pitch area will be of sufficient size to accommodate Gaelic games. The standard of the facilities will be broadly equivalent to those at Croke Park and will include about 64 corporate boxes and 8,000 premium seats as well as substantially improved back-of-house facilities both for players and spectators.</P>
    <P>The design concept for the stadium at Lansdowne Road is imaginative and state-of-the-art. The design is similar to the one being used for the new stadium under construction at Oporto, Portugal, for the 2004 UEFA finals. Once built, the stadium at Lansdowne Road will be one of the most significant pieces of sporting infrastructure in the country. Thus, the Lansdowne Road re-development project is both visionary and timely. The decision is about ensuring immediate and effective support for the imaginative proposals of the FAI and IRFU to secure their international future. I have no doubt that the stadium decision has also strengthened the hand of the FAI in its dealings with FIFA relating to a continued derogation from meeting the all seated requirement for international soccer fixtures at Lansdowne Road.</P><Col N="538"/>
    <P>I am confident that, with this decision, sport has been the winner. Without the support of the Taoiseach, last week's announcements on the Lansdowne stadium development and sports campus facilities at Abbotstown would not have been possible. The Taoiseach's vision for the creation of a modern sporting infrastructure has sustained the debate on how best to ensure that international sporting events can be staged in this country in state-of-the-art facilities in difficult budgetary conditions. The decision highlights the Government's commitment to the development of sport in the country.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted with the decision of Government to agree to the development of a sports campus on the State-owned lands at Abbotstown. The National Aquatic Centre, which opened its doors last year, brought state-of-the-art swimming facilities to this country and was a widely admired and splendid location for the Special Olympics aquatic events in June last year and the European short-course swimming championships in December.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to endorse the phased delivery of a sporting campus at Abbotstown over a period of years. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited will continue as the agency responsible for the delivery of the campus at Abbotstown. It is envisaged that funding will be provided on an annual basis for the phased delivery of the campus facilities. Earlier this week I met with the board of CSID and I asked it to provide me with a programme of phased developments at the State-owned lands at Abbotstown which will effectively accomplish a major transformation in the quality of Ireland's sporting infrastructure. I have looked for a phased and prioritised proposal, with a business plan and annual budgets in each case, which will deliver the component elements of the campus within a realistic timeframe by building on and updating the existing framework plan for the site in consultation with the various interested parties. CSID Limited will now initiate an assessment of the needs of Irish sport which can be provided in a campus, outline a business and sporting case for each facility and propose a timeframe and cost for each facility.</P>
    <P>The scale of the site at Abbotstown is such that it can accommodate the requirements of sporting organisations for high quality pitches and training facilities for both amateur and ranking team sports which would be of benefit not only to major sports organisations, but also to some of our smaller sports whose need for modern facilities is very real. I have asked CSID to explore the potential for private sector investment, especially regarding the development of an indoor arena. A number of sporting organisations have already expressed an interest in relocating offices to Abbotstown, including the FAI which has said it is interested in selling its current headquarters in Merrion Square and moving there. I can also confirm that the GAA <Col N="539"/>and the IRFU have indicated an interest in using what Abbotstown has to offer for the development of their sports.</P>
    <P>The availability of centralised high quality sports development facilities will appeal, in particular, to smaller sporting bodies, many of whom depend largely on voluntary commitment. Medical and research facilities for elite athletes might be developed in partnership with one or more of the third level education institutions. All of this will give a further impetus to the work that the Irish Sports Council is doing to support our elite sportsmen and sportswomen.</P>
    <P>This initiative is not a vague aspiration, but will be of lasting benefit to Irish sport. There is a real commitment on the part of the Government to a phased development of the sports campus project at Abbotstown. A clear Government decision has been taken and the work can proceed without further delay and without distractions.</P>
    <P>We are bringing our national sporting infrastructure into the 21st century. Lansdowne Road is steeped in tradition and history and resonates with some of our great sporting successes. Our international sports of rugby and soccer will now have a platform on which they can showcase themselves and Ireland to the world and from which they can develop and build on the great progress they have made over the past 15 years, while the sports campus at Abbotstown will provide the training facilities and support for both amateur and ranking team sports.</P>
    <P>These proposals, together with the investment which this Government continues to make in the development of our sporting infrastructure through the sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes and in supporting the Irish Sports Council with its sports development programmes, are further evidence of our commitment to the development of sport in this country. It is our intention to see these facilities completed in a short timeframe so that all our people, both at competitive and recreational level, can enjoy sport in facilities which are modern, well equipped and well managed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his contribution. I thank the Leader of the House for arranging statements on the issue of the national stadium. Persistence pays off. I constantly raised this matter on the Order of Business a couple of weeks ago and I thank the Leader for agreeing to arrange this debate.</P>
    <P>There were a number of comments in the Minister's address which made me wonder whether he was having a laugh or whether the official who composed the script did not know what he or she was on about. The Minister said that the stadium at Lansdowne Road and the announcement by the Government was visionary and timely. To describe the upgrading of a stadium as visionary and timely when five years <Col N="540"/>have elapsed since it was proposed beggars belief. I cannot understand how the Minister can say it.</P>
    <P>I compliment him on putting a brave face on what has been a remarkable climb-down by the Government over the past couple of years. In his closing remarks, the Minister said that a clear Government decision has been taken and that the work can proceed without further delay and without distractions. Clear Government decisions were made in this regard before. A clear Government decision was made regarding the land at Abbotstown. It did not proceed without distraction and in fact has not proceeded at all. I wonder whether the commitment expressed by the Minister today will be delivered. Two central problems have arisen with the debate on the national stadium. One is the delay that has occurred over the past few years. The Minister is right in many of the points he made about the delay and the possible effects that can have for the IRFU and the FAI with regard to qualifying matches for European championships, World Cups and so on.</P>
    <P>The other issue is the amount of money that has already been spent on the lands at Abbotstown on drawing up plans and proposals which will not be brought to fruition. It seems to me that a large amount of money has been expended in those areas. A committee was set up by the Taoiseach in 1998 to investigate the possibility of building a new national stadium. In 1999 the FAI came forward with proposals for Eircom Park, which it had fully costed. It had a site and it felt it had the resources to go ahead with that project, but it was scuppered, purely and simply, by the Taoiseach's ego. Supported by the Government and even the Progressive Democrats at that time, he decided that Campus and Stadium Ireland &mdash; the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; project at Abbotstown, as it came to be known &mdash; would proceed rather than Eircom Park.</P>
    <P>Every possible obstacle was placed in the way of the FAI. It was even tempted by funding commitments from the Government to drop its plans for Eircom Park and back the proposals for Abbotstown. The national stadium at Abbotstown was first announced on 26 January 2000 by the Taoiseach. Remarkably, it was almost four years to the day before those proposals were officially jettisoned and the Minister made his announcement last week with regard to Lansdowne Road.</P>
    <P>I would like to make clear, as I have done before, the position of Fine Gael with regard to the question of the national stadium. As far back as 2001, the Fine Gael spokesperson on sport, Deputy Deenihan, launched a document on the national stadium. It was stated clearly that it was Fine Gael Party policy at the time, and it remains so, that Lansdowne Road should be upgraded as the new national stadium. This was at the height of the fiasco that we now know as the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;. It is truly remarkable that at that particular time the FAI, the IRFU, members of the Government and particularly the Progressive <Col N="541"/>Democrats said nothing in support of Lansdowne Road. They were all bought and sold on the notion of the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; in Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>It is clear also that the man who made most play at the general election on the issue of the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who was a member of the Government in 2001, had little to say on the issue at that particular time. However, he jumped on the political bandwagon before the last general election, accused the Taoiseach of being like Mr. Ceaucescu in Romania and made other such remarks. Now, it seems, the policy has been reversed by Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister a number of specific questions with regard to what has taken place at Abbotstown and what exactly the proposals are for Lansdowne Road. I would welcome a response, if he can provide one. A number of different figures have been bandied about as to the amount that has been spent thus far on Abbotstown. Will the Minister inform the House in his closing remarks as to how much money has been outlayed on Abbotstown? I want a specific reference to the amount spent on the aquatic centre. Nobody would deny this is a great facility which was used extraordinarily well in the Special Olympics and is a credit to the people who built it. I support it fully, but how much did it cost? How much did it cost to relocate the Government Departments that were already <i>in situ</i> on the site in Abbotstown, prior to the Campus and Stadium Ireland development?</P>
    <P>How much has it cost to draw up plans for the different arenas that were proposed at Abbotstown? I would also like the Minister to comment on the whole issue of consultants and consultancy fees. We have seen in the newspapers in the last couple of weeks since this issue again gained prominence a number of references to different consultancy groups who still claim fees and are being paid for work that is allegedly being carried out in Abbotstown. I would appreciate it if the Minister could outline how much has been spent on consultancy fees, how much is being spent and what the future holds in that particular area over the course of the next few years.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask him whether, if the development proceeds at Lansdowne Road, it will be a phased project. Is the stadium to be pulled down all at once and what will the sporting bodies that currently use it, the FAI and the IRFU, do about their home fixtures? Will they have to find alternative stadiums to hold the games that would have been held in Lansdowne Road if it was not under reconstruction? If they have to find alternative stadia, what is the view of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism as regards in which locations they will hold their home matches?</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the new stadium will cost in the region of &euro;250 million. One of the figures mentioned as regards Abbotstown is &euro;220 million. It is clear that the money was there and <Col N="542"/>has been spent. Over the past five years the Government has largely squandered that money, which could have at this stage ensured the development of a new national stadium, either at Lansdowne Road or some other location in the capital city. It is not good enough for the Minister and Government Senators to clap themselves on the back for what has been done. The reality is that five important years have been wasted. Irish sport finds itself facing the possibility of not having an arena over the next couple of years in which to hold international soccer and rugby matches, if Lansdowne Road is to be developed. That is not a position with which any Department of sport can be satisfied.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad and congratulate him and the Taoiseach on all the effort they have put into making this development a reality. As the Minister said, this will be a fantastic development, a stadium of which the country can rightly be proud. The development will comprise a state-of-the-art bowl-shaped all-seater stadium with a capacity for 50,000. It will consist of two single tiered stands at the north and south ends, while the east and west stands will have high capacity three tiers as well as space for corporate boxes. The seating will be covered by a transparent roof and from the published designs it seems the entire structure will be similar to the highly regarded McAlpine stadium in Huddersfield. The total cost of the development will be &euro;250 million at current prices, but that is likely to rise to &euro;292 million over the period of construction due to building cost inflation. The Government has wisely factored such increases into its calculations when assigning the relevant funds to the project.</P>
    <P>There has been much speculation on this matter. Since before the last general election the issue of the national stadium has been discussed in detail by the press, politicians and the public. Never before has an issue concerning sporting infrastructure so captured the attention of the country. It would seem everyone has an opinion on the best way forward. Various options have been discussed, others dismissed. No one can accuse the Government of not considering the matter fully. Every possible scenario has been examined and now a conclusion has finally been arrived at that takes account of the current budgetary climate in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>The case for remaining at Lansdowne Road has always been strong. There were clear economic considerations. A stadium is there already so it is not necessary to acquire land and build from scratch, but rather to improve on the facilities that exist. It is centrally located in Dublin terms and this allows for easier access for people throughout the city. It is on the DART line and general transport infrastructure is already in place.</P>
    <P>It also adds more to the city. When Lansdowne Road plays host to a big match, Dublin as a whole enjoys the benefits. That is not only an economic <Col N="543"/>consideration, but a cultural one. We do not simply sell the match. We sell the city with considerable economic benefits for hotels, public houses and shops.</P>
    <P>However, I am sure another consideration weighed heavily on the minds of those who opted for Lansdowne Road. I am referring to the historic significance of the venue. Lansdowne Road is renowned as an historic and passionate venue throughout the sporting world. It has also been the scene of many great Irish sporting moments. When we think of Lansdowne Road, we think of the great Irish rugby teams of the 1980s, of Jack Charlton's record setting soccer team and that unforgettable match when the whole country cheered as Jason McAteer's goal helped us beat Holland on our way to the World Cup in Japan and Korea. Lansdowne Road is inextricably linked with these proud moments in Irish sport. That link will continue for the foreseeable future as a result of this proposal.</P>
    <P>When announcing these proposals, the Minister also announced his plans for the Abbotstown project. I was pleased to hear that the Government has decided to proceed with the development of state-of-the-art infrastructure over time at the Abbotstown site. Step by step, the sports campus will come to life. Once in place, it will provide world class training and organisation facilities for our various sporting bodies and stars. It will benefit amateur and professional sports people alike. It will also add significantly to the magnificent National Aquatic Centre in Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>The National Aquatic Centre, which opened last year, recorded 600,000 visitors in its first six months. Last year, it played host to 500 swimmers from 40 countries during the European short-course swimming championships. That event was broadcast to an audience of 30 million people, all of whom view this as a venue of which we can be proud. Let us not forget that last year's historic Special Olympics, which brought such festivities and pride to the country as a whole, would not have been possible had the Aquatic Centre not been in place. During those games 600 athletes from 160 countries competed at the venue. I am sure television viewers and the 2,500 people who attended were impressed by the venue. Lest we forget, it too is a part of the Abbotstown sporting development so widely criticised.</P>
    <P>I noticed, as the debate on the national stadium developed, both here today and in the last few weeks, that some members of the Opposition have seen fit to criticise the Government and the Taoiseach, in particular, on that issue. The Taoiseach and the Government have been accused of vanity for taking time to reach this decision. It is remarks like those that give a bad name to politics. Clearly, the Government explored other options before deciding on the proposed plan of action.</P>

	<P>I am sure they would be complaining that we did not think through the decision in those circumstances. It is true that the Taoiseach is on record as stating he would like to build a national stadium at Abbotstown. This project was christened with the rather unfortunate title of the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;. The name aside, what was so wrong with it? What aspect of it so galled the Opposition?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>

	<P>It would have been a fantastic development, even larger and more adaptable than the current proposal. It would have been one of the most fantastic venues in Europe and would have provided the kind of capacity to allow supply to meet demand for tickets for big events. I have thought long and hard about why some members of the Opposition were so stringently against that project and I can come up with only one answer &mdash; the nickname they helped to promote.</P>

	<P>In 1997, when the Taoiseach came into office, funding for sport was a mere &euro;17 million. In 2004, that figure is &euro;176.2 million, ten times the amount spent by the Opposition when in office in 1997.</P>

	<P>Since 1998, almost &euro;270 million paid out under the national lottery sports capital programme has been spent on the development of more than 3,500 sports and recreational projects. These are real figures that have made a significant difference to the development of sport and will continue to make a difference well into the future. While the Opposition likes nothing more than to talk about the need to invest more money in sport, the records show that when it gets the chance it ignores sport. The Opposition pays lip service to sport and sports funding. It can say all it wants; the facts are available in black and white for everyone to see. That is the reason it was so opposed to the so-called &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;. The Taoiseach was showing the public how a real sports fan treats the issue of sport when in office. In doing so, he was showing just how little regard the Opposition has for sport. The Taoiseach came across as someone who loves to watch and play sport. One has to wonder whether some of those who criticised the Abbotstown development had ever picked up a ball, let alone played a game.</P>

	<P>The Abbotstown stadium may not have come to pass, but that does not mean it was not a worthy development. Given the changing financial climate, it was decided that it would not be the most prudent move to make and the cheaper option of redeveloping Lansdowne Road was chosen. Rather than criticise the Government for changing its mind, the Opposition should congratulate it on its pragmatic approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before concluding I would like to comment on the GAA. Many people have voiced the opinion that the GAA should open Croke Park to other sports. They put this forward as a solution to the national stadium debate. Let us, for a moment, ignore that the sheer bulk of matches and overlapping dates would make it virtually impossible to host all important sporting fixtures in a single venue. How dare anyone dictate what the GAA should do with its national venue.</P>
    <P>I have heard it suggested that the GAA should open Croke Park to other sports because the Government has provided grants towards its development. That may be so and the Government should be congratulated in that regard, but the GAA should not be held to ransom for such an act. It has more than earned the funds it received through its contribution to this country since before the formation of the State. I do not think anyone here needs to be reminded of the significant involvement of the GAA in the development of this country and the significant involvement it continues to have.</P>
    <P>Should the GAA congress decide, in its wisdom, to remove rule 42, then I am sure the people will welcome that development. It would allow special, significant matches to be played in Croke Park if the demand for tickets was more than the available capacity at Lansdowne Road. That, however, is for it to decide in the future. Those who suggest otherwise do not show the GAA the respect it deserves and appear to have a tenuous grasp of Irish sporting and political history.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to partake in this debate. I welcome my constituency colleague and friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the <Col N="547"/>House for this debate. I also thank the Minister for attending earlier and for his involvement in this debate since taking office.</P>
    <P>I will not deny that I was a critic of this project from its inception. My criticism of it stemmed from the fact that, on a very early learning curve, I found out that Croke Park was the fourth biggest stadium between Ireland and the Balkans and that no city in Europe, despite having big sporting soccer teams, had two stadiums that catered for 80,000 people. For that reason, I did not think Ireland could accommodate two such stadia. My doubts were realised when I met the managers of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited in the early days because I was not able to get answers to simple questions about infrastructure, costs and timing. I do not know whether the current management would have been able to manage a project of this magnitude. I made my view known to my party from the early days and I am delighted we have reached a position where Lansdowne Road will be redeveloped, as this is a realistic project with a realistic budget. Figures can often be dangerous and they have been the downfall of CSID. I am delighted the Government is providing &euro;190 million in funding for the project and I hope that will be capped . The history of State involvement in large projects is they have not been delivered within budget. It must be ensured the money is handed over during the phase-in period and the sporting organisations allowed to get on with it.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael spokesperson sought information on the costs of the project and I am surprised he had to ask the Minister of State for it. I refer to the amount that has been spent on Abbotstown. The original estimate was 280 million or &euro;356 million, which broke down as follows; stadium, &euro;182.84 million; fit out, &euro;2 million; site infrastructure, &euro;10.16 million; design, &euro;40.63 million; professional fees, &euro;21.59 million; local infrastructure, &euro;16.51 million; and campus excellence, &euro;64.76 million. The estimate did not include the National Aquatic Centre at Abbotstown, which was expected to cost between &euro;19 million and &euro;25 million at the time. However, it cost &euro;61.4 million together with executive service fees of &euro;4.9 million making the total cost &euro;66.3 million. That was a small project relative to the stadium proposal, yet the projects costs were overshot.</P>
    <P>The relocation of the Department of Agriculture and Food cost &euro;120 million and the cost of moving the State laboratories to Backweston, Celbridge, County Kildare, cost &euro;79.3 million, a total of &euro;199.3 million. The relocation of sections of the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources was estimated to cost between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million but the figure has not been confirmed. An alternative farm was purchased for the Department of Agriculture and Food at Longstown, Sallins, County Kildare, for &euro;7 million. The GAA was promised &euro;76 million, of which it initially received <Col N="548"/>&euro;19 million and a further &euro;19 million to host the Special Olympics. A balance is still owing of &euro;38 million.</P>
    <P>When the Abbotstown project was mooted five years ago, a contract issued for the development of facilities costing &euro;3.8 million. The contract was abandoned and the developer received &euro;782,000 in compensation for doing nothing. That is a large amount and I am delighted a campus will be built on this 514 acre site, on which sporting bodies will be located.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is a constituency colleague and both he and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will be aware that Blanchardstown is one of the fastest growing areas in the State but does not have a regional park. There is a need for many facilities such as GAA and soccer pitches. The development of Abbotstown should address the deficit in sporting infrastructure in Blanchardstown over the past few decades of fantastic development because this will be the final opportunity to do so on this State land. If clubs that set up in the area must rent land from private developers, they will never own the facilities to which they are entitled. The population of Blanchardstown is expected to increase to 130,000. It has a young population given that only 3,300 people lived in the town in 1961. My party and I will strive to ensure the development of Abbotstown will include a regional park. That is not too much to seek in terms of the development of the community because there is a deficit in terms of sporting facilities in the area.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the two large sporting organisations &mdash; the FAI and the IRFU &mdash; have set up a management structure for the development of Lansdowne Road. That was a momentous decision. One organisation will own the land but, at the end of the day, both will lease the venue for whatever activity and will generate advertising and ticket revenue and so on. They have shown what can happen when people sit down at the table to talk.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not short of stadia as there is one in every major city. However, the utilisation of the stadia must be addressed. The far-reaching significance of the management agreement between the FAI and the IRFU is they have given the lead to other sporting organisations, which can retain their autonomy but can make better use of their facilities on behalf of the people. I call on the GAA to consider the same model as the FAI and the IRFU. That is not asking too much and I expect the GAA will come on side and share its facilities. At the end of the day, that decision will come down to commercial considerations.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o'clock</TimeSt><P>When I began this campaign five years ago, I did not think that I would be in the Seanad or that Deputy Brian Lenihan would be sitting in the Minister's chair but that is how life turns out. Lansdowne Road will be redeveloped and it might also accommodate gaelic games. I hope Brendan <Col N="549"/>Cummins, the Tipperary goalkeeper, will have retired by then because, given the length of his puck out, he might land the ball in the Havelock Square end. I wish this project the best but I hope the proper development of the 514 acre site at Abbotstown will take into account local needs in terms of sporting facilities.</P>

	<P>When I think of Ceaucescu, I do not also think of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell.</P>
    <P>Many years ago someone picked up on a comment the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey made in a narrow political context when asked about a particular policy initiative. The comment may have been relevant to the refurbishment of the new splendid Government Buildings which, at that time, had aroused some controversy. Mr. Haughey said that history would not judge him on how much he had reduced the rate of inflation but rather on other issues and other visionary things.</P>
    <P>This debate is about a vision. The man who had that vision has been pilloried by many newspapers throughout the country in references to the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;, etc. The articles in these newspapers diluted and removed the dignity from a debate which should have been engaged in at a more serious level on what we need in terms of sporting facilities and in respect of the image of this country abroad. Anyone who travels will know that even in the most deprived former communist countries one will find that one of the major priorities of its defunct regime was the provision of sporting facilities. Communist regimes often followed the old Roman attitude of giving people bread and circuses in order to keep them quiet in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that also the Taoiseach's policy?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was in favour of Abbotstown as a development from the outset. I did not necessarily agree with the arguments that were constantly brought forward about lack of resources. We had growth rates of 13% to 14% and we were generating enormous wealth. The <Col N="550"/>figure of &euro;1 billion was bandied about in initial arguments about Abbotstown. I am sure Senator Morrissey will agree that, regardless of his initial objections about the proposal for the stadium at Abbotstown, &euro;1 billion was not a realistic figure. However, it was a nice round figure which the Opposition picked up and was able to throw around like snuff at a wake. We have since moved on.</P>
    <P>While I fully agree with what has been proposed, I feel that, in a sense, it is a climbdown. Lansdowne Road is going to be a state-of-the-art 50,000-seater stadium but I do not believe it is going to take account of the significant expansion in the population of this city and the greater Dublin area in the next 20 to 30 years. There are three friendly soccer matches taking place at Lansdowne road in the near future, all of which have been sold out. People cannot get tickets for the Ireland versus Brazil game. There will be 50,000 people in Lansdowne Road for the match because bucket seats will not have to be used owing to the fact that it is not a competitive fixture and, therefore, people can stand on the terraces. That is the position in 2004 for a friendly match and we are talking about accommodating some of the larger games there in the future. On a recent Friday night, 24,000 people attended a Heineken Cup rugby match at Lansdowne Road. Even though I applaud the decision about Lansdowne Road &mdash; it was much delayed and should have been taken long ago &mdash; I am not sure the ground will be able to accommodate the needs of the sporting public.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on all Governments, irrespective of their complexion, to provide sporting facilities and a particular Minister is always charged with that mandate. No matter how often one proposes on a logical and rational basis that a certain amount of expenditure should be set aside in the national budget for the provision of sporting facilities, there will always be a person who will tell one about the granny on the trolley outside the general hospital in their part of the country because it is an emotive and simple argument to use in reply. One will be asked why the Government is throwing away millions of euro on sporting facilities when the money could be used to build more and better hospitals, schools and roads. That argument will always be used because it is the nature of democracy. There are competing interests in any country and these ensure that what those in Government aspire to &mdash; they may not necessarily achieve it &mdash; is equity and fairness across the board so that all levels of society can feel they are engaged.</P>
    <P>Why should sport always be singled out as the one area in which public money should not be spent? I reject that argument totally because the rationale behind it states that if money is not spent on sporting and recreational facilities, it will not matter. Of course it matters; it is about the health of a nation. It is rather appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who <Col N="551"/>has responsibility for children is present. He would probably be the first to say that in order to ensure the future well-being of the children of this nation we must encourage them to get out of doors to take part in healthy exercise and not have them indoors sitting at their computers or games consoles.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State led the campaign.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to make that point and I do not apologise for doing so. I accept that I have a particular agenda, particular in light of the fact that I have worked as a sports journalist for over 20 years, that I played the game and that I am committed to the whole concept. That is why I applaud the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Government but I have also been critical of the fact that the decision has not been made until now.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I welcome the proposals contained in the initiative announced earlier in the week by the Minister about the development of Campus Ireland. What will be put in place there has already been outlined. However, I want to make an intervention on behalf of the national Community Games movement. The latter has for several years been seeking a permanent campus to allow it to hold its wonderful games on a yearly basis. Campus Ireland will help the movement realise that dream because it is proposed that state-of-the-art facilities across the various disciplines will be provided there. The argument about Santry versus Abbotstown is specious. Santry should continue to be developed and funded and I believe the Minister wants to do that. However, what is to stop us having a multifunctional and multi-purpose indoor arena at which basketball, volleyball, etc., could be played and which would include a running track? In my view a medium sized football stadium, which a capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 seats, should be constructed at Abbotstown in order to accommodate some of the Dublin clubs which may wish to move there. I fully support the idea that facilities should be provided on the campus to allow all of the national sporting organisations have their headquarters there. The Community Games should be given full support and I am sure Members on all sides agree with me in that regard.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about opening Croke Park to other sports. As a strong advocate of the GAA I say God bless that organisation for having done what it did in the face of all the begrudgery about, attacks on and criticism of its culture and that for which it stands. The GAA has provided state-of-the-art facilities across the country without receiving any thanks or making any apologies to anyone. Croke Park is a world class stadium and the GAA should be allowed to decide what to do with it in its own way. I do not believe the IRFU or the FAI have <Col N="552"/>made any formal or informal approaches to the GAA to seek the opening of Croke Park. That has been a media creation and invention because it makes good copy. Let the GAA decide what it wants to do. I have no doubt that in the fullness of time the organisation will make whatever decision is in the best interests of its code.</P>
    <P>People must remember that the GAA is competing with other codes. There has already been an encroachment in various schools where Gaelic games were traditionally played and where rugby and soccer are now making inroads. The number of youngsters who play sports is finite. I do not, therefore, blame the GAA for protecting its interests in that regard. However, it must be allowed to make its own decision.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about an Irish soccer or rugby team playing at Croke Park.</P>

	<P>I look forward to the day when we have an all-Ireland soccer team playing at Lansdowne Road. I hope the Government, through the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs who has just entered the Chamber and who may be able to make headway in this area with the help of our European partners, will make efforts to see that this comes about. There should not be a division in soccer. There is no division in any other national sport on this island. If there was a unity of purpose, it would go a long way to improving the tolerance and reconciliation that is needed on this island to bind the wounds of the past.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mooney made the interesting point that there is only a finite number of young people involved in sport. That is a good point on which to begin a debate. In terms of the public good, public health and so forth, the first priority of a national sports policy ought to be to maximise participation, rather than to maximise achievement.</P>
    <P>It was taken for granted when I was of football-playing age that virtually everybody played some sport, mainly because people did not have the money to do anything else. Recently I was told that only 18% of people in the 18 to 25 year age group were involved in an active sport. That percentage is extremely small. This is a huge issue and the first platform of public policy should be to maximise participation. Achievement will result from maximising participation. Obviously, if one puts in place an infrastructure which encourages participation, it will also encourage achievement.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I have of establishing the national stadium in Lansdowne Road, and it is a criticism I have voiced on a number of occasions, is that this country seems to have constructed a process of public policy decision making which takes about five times longer than in other <Col N="553"/>European countries. People talk about fast track planning and EIS procedures for infrastructural proposals but the process of decision making that resulted in the recent decision about Lansdowne Road was every bit as slow as the much criticised process of decision making on infrastructure. There appears to be a reluctance either in the public service or in Government, and I am not particularly referring to the present Government, on which my views have been well recorded.</P>

	<P>I have said nicer things about this Minister of State than about most other Ministers because of his considerable work on the European brief. The Minister should not spoil his good record.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Mooney about false dichotomies. Some Members of the Opposition are too quick to make them by asking why all this money should be spent on a stadium when there is this or that other need. I believe, and the figures for January show, that the country is not as impoverished as the Minister for Finance would like us to believe. This country could absorb a significant increase in Government revenue through a variety of taxes. The capital gains tax rate of 20% is far too low. This tax could be used both as a revenue earner and an instrument of public policy to encourage certain forms of development and discourage others.</P>
    <P>This country is nowhere near a position where it needs to make choices between apparently conflicting things. If one had to choose between a hospital and a stadium, nobody with a spark of humanity would do other than choose a hospital. However, these are false choices for which I blame the present Government. The fundamental fault of the past seven years of this Government has been the determination to pursue the private good at the expense of the public good. The fundamental difference between social democracy throughout Europe and the parties of the right is the belief in the public good and the need to use the resources of the state to advance the public good, be that in transport, education or leisure infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Leisure is as important a part of life as work. This country has a hopelessly under-developed leisure infrastructure. Swimming pools are fast becoming the preserve of the comparatively affluent. They are becoming a privately provided amenity for which people are not charged by the hour but by the year. Anybody who cannot assemble the best part of &euro;1,000 in a single payment has no access to these rapidly expanding and high quality facilities. Even as the number of private swimming pools in my home city is expanding, the public swimming pools are in danger of collapse. That is the choice we make between public and private good, whereby we leave people to deliver privately amenities such as good quality recreation.</P><Col N="554"/>
    <P>The decision to invest in Lansdowne Road is a step in the direction of the public good. However, the public is entitled to look carefully at the provision of a stadium that will be used overwhelmingly by two professional sports in which a considerable part of the revenue raised will be used simply to pay players. That is the fundamental distinction between those two sports and the GAA. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the GAA. It is possible to be such a supporter and to have many reservations about some of the aberrant utterances of individuals in the GAA when they stray outside their sporting brief to pronounce on the nation, the future of the nation and so forth. Once they move into that territory, they are involving themselves in politics and are fair game. However, as an organisation delivering services to the people of this country, the GAA is unsurpassed.</P>
    <P>This organisation teaches young people how to organise events. I remember participating, as a 16 year old, in the annual general meeting of the Athy gaelic football club and learning the rules of debate, organising one's contribution, getting motions passed and so forth. It has contributed enormously to teaching people the rudiments of administration. People learn it in the GAA from the people who were there previously. This experience moves on into the provision of facilities. There are extraordinary numbers involved.</P>
    <P>There is also the expansion into other sports. I wish the GAA would use the term &ldquo;women's gaelic football&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;ladies' gaelic football&rdquo;. Most of the women I know hate being called &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; except under certain circumstances. I do not know why the GAA does not call the game &ldquo;women's gaelic football&rdquo;. There has been huge expansion into that area. There has also been an extraordinary revival of camogie, which 20 years ago liberal Ireland would have regarded as a leftover from the past. Now, it has become important. The GAA is an extraordinary organisation which has reinvented itself extremely well. It deserves support from the State and that support should not depend on whether it is prepared to allow Croke Park to be used for other sports.</P>
    <P>Croke Park was an extraordinarily brave and farsighted undertaking. If the GAA had not undertaken the Croke Park project, neither of the other two organisations would have had the vision or imagination to think about something similar. Their view of what was achievable would have been far more modest without the example set by the biggest sporting organisation in the country. If the GAA had to pay its players any wages, no money would be available for such stadia.</P>
    <P>One of the popular mythologies is that the GAA is loaded with money. The truth, however, is that there is no more transparent organisation in the country in terms of where money goes. It has always been so. If the GAA has a boom year with plenty of replays and so forth, every cent <Col N="555"/>trickles back into every club in the country over the following 12 months. There is a false dichotomy, therefore, between Croke Park and Lansdowne Road.</P>
    <P>I believe the GAA could take a hard headed commercial decision to let Croke Park be used by other sports when it suits the GAA. However, it is a matter for the GAA and is not related to any other issue. The organisation is entitled to take a view about competing sports. It is running a small sport in a tough competitive market and is in competition with sports, particularly soccer, that have saturation television coverage. To date, it has done a remarkable job to protect and preserve its identity.</P>
    <P>The association's willingness to collaborate with TG4, which is not just about money but about a certain affection in the GAA for matters to do with the language and which allowed TG4, in turn, to let people have television access to matches that would otherwise not be broadcast, was an imaginative decision that was good for the GAA and TG4.</P>
    <P>The next stage after Lansdowne Road must be a well focused public commitment to the development of good quality sporting facilities throughout the country. Clubs in small towns and parishes throughout rural and urban Ireland should not have to spend endless hours working to raise &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 for better dressing rooms. We have moved beyond that point. We should recognise the community contribution of organisations such as the GAA and, through the national lottery or taxation, match local fundraising 50:50 or even 75:25. Sporting facilities are for everybody. The facilities a GAA club or a good rugby or soccer club provides in any town are not just about sport; they are places with which the community can identify and where it can meet and grow. Therefore, they are an investment in all of us.</P>

   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I bow to the superior knowledge of my male colleagues. I am wearing my heart on my sleeve today. Some Senators will remember me standing in the same spot a number of months ago when I defended Connacht rugby. Last week's news was music to my ears. I am delighted with the Government's decision to develop Lansdowne Road. The Minister was right when he said this morning that sport is the real winner in this decision, which outlines the Government's commitment to sport.</P>
    <P>I was a little saddened to hear Senator Phelan complain that this announcement is five years too late. News like this is never too late and five years is a very short time. It may not be so short when one is in opposition and trying desperately to get back into Government. I can understand the begrudgery that comes from feeling like that. I also note that Senator Phelan claims this was the Opposition's plan. So be it. Let it be their plan, but we have taken the ball and are running with it. We are providing the State with a much-<Col N="556"/>needed second stadium and I am proud of the Government for doing so.</P>
    <P>The year 1872 saw the opening of Lansdowne Road, making it one of the oldest rugby stadiums in the world. In 1982 soccer found a home there when the Irish soccer team played in the stadium. We all have wonderful memories of matches played there and names which come to mind include Jackie Kyle, Mike Gibson, Mick Galway, Ciar&aacute;n Fitzgerald, Liam Brady, Paul McGrath, Roy Keane and, of late, the great Brian O'Driscoll. Many others have left memories of triumph and disappointment in all of our minds.</P>
    <P>Like that of Croke Park, the location of Lansdowne Road is central. This gives the State a great advantage. Revenue is created by local hotels, pubs and bed and breakfasts at the time of fixtures, whether in Croke Park or Lansdowne Road. As the mother of two young rugby players who came up through schools rugby, I know the excitement of St. Patrick's Day when parents sit in Lansdowne Road and watch the schools' final. There is nothing to beat that type of excitement. I am delighted that Lansdowne Road is to be developed.</P>
    <P>I hate to think what might happen if Lansdowne was not redeveloped. Would we see an office block, housing or some other type of development and the removal of yet another green area from the city centre? The decision to develop Lansdowne Road for the IRFU and FAI is the right one. When Irish fans go abroad we love to find that the stadium is located centrally. We can presume that fans coming to Ireland feel the same. They should be accommodated at a centrally located stadium.</P>
    <P>The best tourism revenue is generated biennially when the English rugby team visits Ireland. Everyone from Ireland comes to Dublin because we are all trying to beat the English. It is quite a while since we did it but what a wonderful occasion it is when we do. Nowhere is better than Lansdowne road to do that.</P>
    <P>I disagree with my colleague, Senator Mooney, although I bow to his superior judgment. Blackrock College, which traditionally has been one of the leading rugby schools, is now playing Gaelic football.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Blackrock College won one of the first Leinster Colleges senior hurling championships in the early part of the last century.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I bow to two superior judgments and I thank Senator Phelan. Usually I try to speak across him when he interrupts, but I knew something good was coming and I was prepared to listen. Not alone is Blackrock College playing Gaelic football, but the school has a history of playing hurling. My son played on the school's soccer team in 2000.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of Senator Ryan's sentiments. He spoke of the argument often made regarding whether we should have a sports <Col N="557"/>stadium or a hospital. We should have both. Every good health programme promotes the playing of sports. We would have less crime and fewer dysfunctional juveniles if we had better sporting facilities. We would have more healthy young and middle-aged people, like our good selves, if we participated in sports instead of watching them on television. I agree with him when he said it gets under his skin to hear of ladies' football teams. I would much prefer, like him, to hear them called women's football teams. The word &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; conjures up something going back to Victorian times, although I love to be called a lady and I hope I usually act like one. It is better if women are referred to as women. Yesterday we debated equality. I cringe when equality matters are being spoken about and women are referred to as ladies. The proper word, &ldquo;women&rdquo;, should be used across the board.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome this debate. We have arrived at the two stadium solution to this problem. Anyone could have told the Government five years ago that the solution was the total refurbishment of Lansdowne Road and the completion of Croke Park into the terrific stadium it is today.</P>
    <P>That was the solution. We have lost a lot of time and spent a lot of money. We have lost the focus on the debate, which should be about sports participation and getting children to participate in sports in order to deal with the growing problem of obesity.</P>
    <P>We have a new Standing Order regarding decorum in the House and I ask Members to observe it. People need to concentrate on the person speaking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all agreed this at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I put my name to it and I will observe it.</P>
    <P>I repeat my point for the Minister of State, whom I know is listening, that we have lost five years during this debate, largely due to the incompetence of the Taoiseach in this matter. I blame the Taoiseach rather than the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. The Taoiseach has been shuffling about over the past five years trying to find a vision which he patently does not have. His vision was of a stadium in Abbotstown, brilliantly described as &ldquo;Ceaucescu-like&rdquo; by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. We have lost five years and spent a great deal of money while the Taoiseach's incompetence on this issue has been exposed. I have no doubt that most Members on the other side of this House believe that too. The national stadium issue has been a joke from start to finish. I am glad the Government has finally proposed the sensible solution of refurbishing the Lansdowne Road stadium as a modern international stadium for <Col N="558"/>the future, while ensuring we retain the excellent facility on Dublin's north side, namely Croke Park.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of South Dublin County Council a very controversial decision was taken, with the unanimous support of council members, to support Eircom Park in my former constituency of Dublin South-West. That decision was taken on a cross-party basis with the brilliant foresight of Mr. Bernard O'Byrne. The proposal had planning permission, with funding in place. It was close to the M50 and ready to go. What happened? All the little moles in the FAI who had been listening to the Taoiseach's office did the dirty on Mr. Bernard O'Byrne, creating trumped-up charges against him which have yet to be proven, with the result that the Eircom Park stadium was put on the back burner, and more time was lost.</P>
    <P>Despite the revisionism of Members on the other side of the House, we should not lose sight of what happened. Mr. O'Byrne was dumped by the FAI. The first genuine attempt to find a home for Irish soccer was dumped because it did not fit in with the plans of Fianna F&aacute;il at the time. All kinds of promises were made to the GAA. Promises were made by the Taoiseach to some lackeys in the FAI that if they dumped the notion of Eircom Park and came on board with him for the proposed Abbotstown stadium, the world would be their oyster. Those people in the FAI have been shown to be utterly incompetent in the organisation of their own association over these five years. They were duped by the Taoiseach and lost one of the best FAI executives ever, Mr. Bernard O'Byrne, who has since gone on to better things. We had the opportunity to produce another stadium of 50,000 or more seats in the west of the city, which needed it at the time, at virtually no cost to the Exchequer. Five years later, the costs have escalated and we are in this dilemma.</P>
    <P>I commend the GAA, particularly for its plans to redevelop Croke Park. The GAA has shown great foresight and tenacity in bringing to fruition its brilliant stadium. The soccer organisations have been found wanting in urban Dublin when it comes to providing top class club facilities. In my own constituency this week, St. Jude's GAA club in Templeogue became the countrywide club of the year as a result of the kind of hard work and effort put in by urban GAA clubs responding to a need in housing estates over the past 25 years. The FAI was embroiled in typical disputes and petty arguments while the GAA was building up clubs in working class west Dublin. That is why we have effectively professional clubs such as St. Jude's, St. Enda's in Ballyboden, the Thomas Davis club, St. Anne's, St. Mark's and others. They show the tremendous tenacity of the GAA, which deserves credit for that work.</P>
    <P>I have changed my views on the GAA since I became involved in elective politics, and I now believe it makes economic sense for the GAA to open up its stadium for other sporting codes. <Col N="559"/>Croke Park will normally be filled on only four or five occasions annually. While we are re-developing Lansdowne Road, it is only sensible that there should be opportunities for rugby and soccer matches in Croke Park, a stadium seating more than 80,000 people. The vast majority of GAA members to whom I speak would agree. It is not for me or anyone else or the Government to tell the GAA what to do, but it should do what is in its own interests. It makes perfect economic sense, and there are also social arguments to be put for many sporting codes to be allowed use this fine facility, with the GAA gaining the resulting financial benefit. I agree with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, that the new stadium at Lansdowne Road should also be available for GAA matches, because there will be many occasions where that stadium, with its 50,000 capacity, will meet the demand. The GAA should use the opportunity to rent out its fantastic stadium to other sporting codes, particularly at times of the year when its 80,000 capacity would be useful, on occasions when the Lansdowne Road stadium capacity of 50,000 is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I have been very hard on the Government, in particular the Taoiseach, because over the past five years we have lost the opportunity to debate many of the real issues in sports, while exclusively focusing on the issue of the national stadium, the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; or Ceaucescu-like building, call it what one will. There was a very important graph in yesterday's edition of<i> The Irish Times </i>which showed that the number of children cycling to school has fallen dramatically in recent years, as more people drive their children to and from school, particularly in urban communities. The problem of obesity and the volunteer problem in many organisations, with the same people doing all the work, now present the opportunity to invest in sport.</P>
    <P>Thanks to Government support in my own constituency in Jobstown, an excellent all-weather pitch has been installed. The problems involve a lack of full time security and of full-time personnel to organise children's leagues. Unfortunately, local authorities do not match with personnel the excellent facilities being put in place all over the country. We must now invest in full-time community people and support full-time community organisation of leagues, particularly in urban Ireland. Regarding the Jobstown development, within two months there were joyriders all over the place. It was in bits, and the security problem was not resolved. Thankfully, the situation has now been turned around. If we are to invest in infrastructure we must also invest in personnel, and the best way of doing that is through local government.</P>
    <P>The national lottery issue has been debased by politicians of all parties and Governments. Each council should be given a percentage of the money available and must make the hard decisions on what clubs in the community will get <Col N="560"/>the money. This is an argument for greater devolution and in ensuring that more financial accountability is available locally. The current gravy train, with decisions taken purely at the behest of backbench Deputies, in whatever party in Government, is wrong and is bad for sport.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, and the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism before him, to the House. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is to be congratulated on bringing this long-running saga to a satisfactory conclusion. I would also like to pay tribute to the pragmatism of the Taoiseach in respect of this issue. Even though he would have personally favoured another option, he accepted that, in its original proposed form, it was not feasible.</P>
    <P>The Government and its predecessor have done a tremendous amount for sport. Spending has increased from approximately &euro;17 million in 1997 to &euro;109 million in 2004, which has been of tremendous benefit to different sports clubs throughout the country. It is not the case that decisions are made at the behest of backbenchers. Extremely detailed application forms have to be filled in by clubs and projects have to stand up to scrutiny. All of us on this side of the House know of many instances of projects which perhaps we might have supported but were not successful.</P>
    <P>I have come across this in the private sector. There is always a danger that when we engage on an ambitious project, we start filling it up with all sorts of other desirable things and the project then grows out of proportion and ceases to be feasible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what happened.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>That may have happened in this case, but it is right to take one's time and debate these decisions. We are talking about decisions the effect of which will last for 50 or 100 years and it is important to get it right. If there is an element of trial and error involved no one should make any apology for it. That also happened in respect of Luas. It is easy to criticise and say something is a mess if we do not get it absolutely right from day one. I do not agree with that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Luas is a mess.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>These matters should be thought through properly and the right decision reached, even if it takes a little time to do it. I would not apologise for it.</P>
    <P>In the case of facilities in Dublin, and I am not only talking about sports, there is a live debate as to whether they should be located on the periphery, accessible to the ring road or in the city centre. There is something to be said on both sides of the argument. As we all know, it can take a long time to penetrate the city centre from the periphery.</P>
    <P>I am glad the decision has come down on the side of Lansdowne Road which has public <Col N="561"/>transport facilities in place. It also has a long tradition. We also need to think of the visitors who come here. We are talking in many cases about internationals and many supporters would come by air, sea or whatever. A stadium close to the city centre is more attractive to visiting supporters of whatever team we are playing against.</P>
    <P>All of us are very proud of the magnificent facility at Croke Park. I have long been of the view that the more commentators, politicians and others try to cajole the GAA, the less effective it is likely to be. It will have to make its own decisions in its own time and according to its own internal lights. I have little doubt, however, that with two facilities, one for 50,000 and another for 80,000, there will come a point where it will make sense to share or swop facilities for certain purposes. I have no doubt the flexibility will come in due course, but I am not sure that us preaching about it will hasten the day.</P>
    <P>I am glad we can now look forward in the reasonably near future to a second excellent stadium in this city for international matches and for national teams that, by and large, whether one is talking about soccer or rugby, have done pretty well in recent times. The Connacht rugby team, which was in danger of exclusion, was mentioned a number of times last year on the Order of Business, but it has covered itself with glory in the recent past, and the Munster team even more so. I will conclude by wishing them the greatest success in further rounds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome to the House to listen to the debate on the national stadium. While one would have to welcome the fact that at last a decision has been made, and that it is the right one, we have to point out that it has taken five years of wasted time to make it. I heard one of the Senators on the opposite side say that five years to make a decision is not that bad. It is a disgrace that it took the Government five years to make its final decision on providing a national stadium.</P>
    <P>When we look back at the history of this saga I have to start with the proposal for a stadium in Eircom Park. That was a lost opportunity, with time and money wasted. Eircom Park should be up and running now and the FAI would have revenue coming into its purse which could be spent on local clubs throughout the country. Local clubs are playing on shared pitches &mdash; in many cases there are not sufficient pitches &mdash; with no changing rooms. Our local sports clubs, be they soccer or Gaelic, are in a dreadful state. Eircom Park was where this Government made its biggest mistake. We had a Taoiseach who stopped Eircom Park going ahead.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="562"/>

	<P>That is true.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not true.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the most disgraceful aspect of the whole issue of a national stadium. Five years later we now have a proposal, which I hope will go ahead, but in the meantime our soccer and rugby teams will have to play their matches abroad. Irish supporters will have to leave this country and spend their money in the United Kingdom and elsewhere and we will miss out on the revenue which could be generated by supporters coming to this country and spending their money here.</P>
    <P>While the FAI speaks sweetly of the new proposal, in the long term I wonder how satisfactory it will be for the FAI. Who will own the Lansdowne Road stadium in the long term? It currently belongs to the IRFU, but the FAI will want a share if it is to invest money in it. That will cause problems. The planning process, which can be protracted, may also cause problems. Thankfully, the residents appear to speak well of it. We hope this will be up and running by 2008 and that matches will be played on it. In the meantime, our teams will play abroad. That could have been avoided if a decision had been taken and support given to the FAI, instead of obstacles having been put in its way to prevent Eircom Park being built.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to develop Abbotstown as a sports campus as it will be a great benefit to all sports. As it is located in my area, it will be a welcome facility and local sports clubs will be able to avail of it. When will all the facilities be put in place? I note that work is to be done on a phased basis and that funding will be provided on an annual basis. I welcome this and hope it will be developed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It has taken five years to make this decision on a development that will take four years to build. Shame on the Government that it has taken such a long time. That money has been wasted in the process is a disgrace. Money spent on fees for consultants at Abbotstown could have been spent on developing badly needed local sports facilities. On a daily basis, sports clubs are looking for pitches and changing facilities. Young girls trying to get involved in athletics and sports have to change in the ditches. How will this encourage young people to get involved in sport? How can we develop our young sports people into athletes who can compete on an international level when we will not give them the necessary facilities? Instead, we waste millions of euros on consultants' fees while we dither and are unable to make a decision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision that has been taken. It is the right decision and one we have said for a long time should have been made. I wish it and the Minister of State well and hope the project will run smoothly and get started as quickly as possible.</P>

I hate to hear the decrying which is taking place about the time lapse and where people will have to play. The decision has been made. Let us move on in a spirit of unity and in the knowledge that while a world class stadium is in place at Croke Park, there will be a fantastic facility at Lansdowne Road. Even more important there will be a sports campus in the west of the city that will allow many sports organisations throughout the country, which do not have sufficient resources to build their own headquarters, an opportunity to get involved and to develop facilities there. I hope the vision set out by the Government of having a stadium at Abbotstown is not lost. I hope that in ten or 15 years time that will come to fruition. It is important for the young people watching us here today that their future and the part sport plays therein is recognised. They should have something on which to focus rather than encountering the vagaries of society through drugs and other activities.</P>

	<P>Ireland and Dublin are unique compared to other European countries which have populations several times greater than that in Ireland. In Ireland there can be 60,000 or 70,000 in attendance at Gaelic, soccer and rugby matches. I am not sure if Germany or France have three sports at which there would be a similar level of attendance. At domestic and international level, there is a huge interest in sport, not to mention the potential from sport tourism on which we have not touched. I am glad to hear of the welcome now.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A clear decision has been made on the matter. I totally reject the suggestions made about Eircom Park and other places. The Government came forward with a proposal five years ago, for which there was huge welcome. Since 1997, we have had for the first time a Minister with responsibility for sport. I agree about the lack of facilities at local level. Until 1997, sport was dealt with by a minor section of the Department of Education and Science. Since 1997, under this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government we have had a Cabinet Minister with responsibility for sport. There has been enormous investment in sport at all levels, local, national and international. The Senator's constituency, as well as mine, has done well in the past six years out of the sports grants. Enormous investment has been put in at all levels including our elite athletes. I cannot quote the figures but they are impressive. I hope that investment continues into the future irrespective of who is in power. For too long we did not recognise the need. In the past, much lip service was paid to the need for facilities but generally much of the work was done voluntarily by clubs. I would have represented an area quite near to Croke Park. It is easy for people in other parts of the city to say Croke Park or Lansdowne Road should have sports seven days a week. It is not practical from the pitch point of view. People live adjacent to these facilities and it is important to realise they <Col N="565"/>have a breaking point and the pitch has a breaking point, so to speak. I sincerely hope there will be no more delays with the proposal which has been welcomed for Lansdowne Road. Obviously it will have to go through the planning process. I hope the support evident today holds. That support was evident when Abbotstown was announced but it unravelled because many people came out of the woodwork with all kinds of agendas.</P><?_cl10.5-?>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House to address the issue of Glenma housing scheme in Croom, County Limerick and thank him for his help and consideration in this regard <Col N="566"/>over the past 12 months. This application has been ongoing for some time regarding an estate of 43 houses, some in council and some in private ownership. The houses are flat-roofed with no chimneys and poor heating systems and occupants cannot get insurance for them. An application for refurbishment works has been made by Limerick County Council and I understand that detailed drawings and costings have been submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to support approval of the application which would allow the county council to tender for this project. The occupants have suffered through the years since the houses were built, at the same time as the Ballymun flats, under the auspices of the National Building Agency. I understand they are one of the last schemes of this type in the country not to have been refurbished.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brennan for raising this issue. Glenma housing estate is a private estate of 43 houses built by the National Building Agency in 1973. Some 35 houses are privately owned which were sold as private purchases when the estate was originally built, and Limerick County Council owns and rents the remaining eight houses. The houses were constructed with a flat roof and the first floor is finished with a metal cladding fixed to a timber stud wall which forms the internal frame of the houses. There are various defects with the houses and these include leaking roofs and poor quality external cladding which is in general no longer weatherproof.</P>
    <P>Limerick County Council submitted a proposal to my Department to refurbish the estate under the improvement works in lieu of housing scheme. The proposed works include the provision of new pitched roofs to replace existing flat roofs, the re-cladding of external walls and the upgrading of windows, external doors and external finishes.</P>
    <P>The improvement works programme allows local authorities to improve or extend privately owned accommodation occupied by households which are assessed to be eligible for local authority housing as an alternative to being re-housed by the local authority. This scheme would not normally be used to upgrade an entire estate but this is considered to be an exceptional case and my Department has agreed in principle, since 2002, to have the improvement works carried out under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, the householders will be required to make repayments for the cost of the works to the local authority based on the ability of households to pay. I understand extensive discussions have been held between the county council and local residents and that 27 out of 35 households in private ownership are fully supportive of the council's plans for refurbishment in the manner proposed. I also understand that at this time the remaining eight residents are not interested in having refurbishment work carried out on their homes. <Col N="567"/>The plans as they now stand are for works to 27 private residences and eight local authority-owned residences.</P>
    <P>Drawings and a cost estimate were received in my Department from the county council on 29 January 2004. These are now under technical examination in my Department and I expect that Limerick County Council will be informed of the outcome of this examination in the near future.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, for coming to the House to deal with this motion regarding problems at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, of which I am sure he is aware. It is almost ten years since the health board and the Department of Health and Children convinced the members of Dublin County Council, as it then was, to rezone the lands at James Connolly Memorial Hospital in order that they could be sold off to generate funding for its redevelopment. That decision was taken reluctantly and money was raised which the Department was to match pound for pound, as it did. It has taken almost ten years to get to a stage where phase 1 of the hospital is built and it has cost a lot more money than was originally anticipated. The shame is that while the hospital is built and furnished, and beds and blankets are in place, we do not have a key to open the door.</P>
    <P>On 10 December last, Deputy Olivia Mitchell asked the Minister for Health and Children on my behalf when the hospital would open. His reply stated that phase 1 of the hospital &ldquo;is now complete with the exception of some snagging work which is being carried out by the contractors.&rdquo; It went on to state that &ldquo;The further commissioning of this development will need to be considered by the ERHA and the Northern Area Health Board having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2004.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We hear of other areas crying out for hospitals. In this case, a furnished hospital is in place and I ask the Minister to get it opened. The excellent staff at the hospital are working in terrible conditions. Last night, as with other hospitals in Dublin, the James Connolly Memorial Hospital was overcrowded with up to 20 people on trolleys in accident and emergency whereas the new accident and emergency unit in the new hospital would greatly improve working conditions. Day cases for elective surgery are being cancelled today because of patient numbers.</P>
    <P>Other issues arise in regard to the hospital but they relate to the fact that the matron and accident and emergency consultant have not been replaced over the past year. I must repeat what I have heard from many members of staff which is <Col N="568"/>that there are concerns that the hospital will be downgraded. There is no confidence in the Minister among staff or confidence that the hospital will be upgraded and retain all its services. While a fabulous new hospital is in place and the lights are on, it is empty. I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell me why the facility is empty and when it will open. I hope there will be a positive response from him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Terry for raising this matter. Responsibility for the provision of services at James Connolly Memorial Hospital rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The hospital provides acute medical and surgical services to the catchment area of Dublin north west, north Kildare and south County Meath. With a population of 256,000, it is the fastest growing catchment area in the eastern region. There are currently 348 beds at the hospital, 110 of which are extended care beds, and some 1,000 staff. Accident and emergency services are provided at the hospital on a 365 day, 24 hour basis, as part of the eastern regional network.</P>
    <P>The major development at the hospital is being funded jointly by the Northern Area Health Board, through the sale of surplus lands, and the Department. The projected full project cost is &euro;101.4 million. This includes &euro;5 million approved last year to facilitate refurbishment works at the hospital, which are necessary as part of the transition process to the new hospital, and to facilitate a land transfer in line with the project development arrangements. My Department is advised that the construction of phase 1 of the new development at James Connolly Memorial Hospital is now complete and the first phase of the transition to the new development has been completed.</P>
    <P>The coronary care unit, formerly located in unit 7, has moved to the new building together with 35 medical-cardiac beds. In addition, the therapeutic treatment centre has moved to its new location on the ground floor of the new facility. The day hospital and the rheumatology service have also transferred to the new building. I understand the cost of transferring the remaining existing services to the new hospital is approximately &euro;5 million in a full year. These costs arise because of the additional overheads, for example, cleaning, lighting, heating, security and maintenance of additional equipment associated with the new facility. The further commissioning of the development is currently being examined by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department.</P>
