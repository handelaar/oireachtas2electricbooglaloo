	<P>I have received notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the measures he can take to allay the serious concerns of broiler producers in County Limerick because of uneconomic prices paid for chickens which threaten their viability as business units and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kenneally of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that an urgent review be carried out of the current operation of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the progress to date on the extension at Scoil Mhuire, Convent of Mercy, Strokestown, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to report on his recommendations following extensive consultation regarding the need to increase the height of the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address the imminent cessation of the F&Aacute;S social economy programme involving the Inishowen Sustainable Community Development Association and to consider establishing a pilot social economy sector for all of Donegal.</P><Col N="530"/>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Finucane, Kenneally, Morrissey and Feighan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Finucane, Kenneally and Feighan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator McHugh as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. Senator Morrissey may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re discharge of a member from the Committee of Selection and appointment of a member in substitution; No. 2, motion re change of membership of Fine Gael members on committees, which will be moved by the Leas-Cathaoirleach; No. 3, motion re the abduction of Mrs. Margaret Hassan, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 for 30 minutes and each group will have five minutes speaking time; and No. 5, statements on the Report on Seanad Reform (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of No. 3 until 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not to exceed 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We agree to the Order of Business. I thank the Leader for placing No. 3 on the Order Paper as it will allow us to debate the matter in the House. I appreciate the swiftness with which she responded to the debate on the matter in the House yesterday.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Office of the Ombudsman celebrated its 20th anniversary. Since it was established, a number of very distinguished people have held the office. Two suggestions were made by the current Ombudsman, Ms O&rsquo;Reilly, to which the Government should respond. She suggested that the office should be written into the Constitution to ensure its independence and, more importantly, that the remit of the Ombudsman legislation should be extended to include semi-State non-commercial bodies and the voluntary hospital sector. This immediately drew fire from lawyers and hospital consultants who objected to her suggestion.</P>
      <P>We need to extend the remit of the Ombudsman. Moreover, a commitment was given by the Government in 1997 that the remit should be extended. It is important that professionals should come within the remit of the Ombudsman in the same way as Departments and Ministers. It would help the process of accountability and transparency in the State if the duties and performance of bodies which currently have the power to self-regulate, were also regulated by the Ombudsman. The suggestion should be debated in the House and a proposal made to the Government because we have a responsibility to ensure the legislation in respect of the Office of the Ombudsman is fully used to the advantage of all citizens.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="531"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>As well as the anniversary of the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman, it is worth noting a very important anniversary in Irish literature. Today is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Patrick Kavanagh, a man who was never really appreciated in his own lifetime. He was treated very badly when he arrived in this town. People witnessed the pathetic sight of him being dragged through the courts on the grounds of his autobiography by an arrogant bully who has thankfully almost been forgotten, while Kavanagh lives on in Irish literature. It is worthwhile expressing our appreciation of his contribution to Irish literature and marking his anniversary today.</P>
      <P>I recently raised with the Leader the issue of public private partnerships. I also raised with the Minister for Finance the possibility of discussing the matter and he indicated that he would respond favourably to requests from the Leader to do so in a number of weeks, once he had read himself into the brief. Such a debate is crucially important given the current discussions about roads, schools and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on public private partnerships, as well as the issues previously raised in the House by Senator Ulick Burke and me. We need the full story so we can make a political as well as an economic judgment, which has already been made by the Comptroller and Auditor General, about whether PPPs constitute good value or practice.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House referred yesterday to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board of which I am vice-chairman. By coincidence, yesterday morning, before the Order of Business, the PIAB had a board meeting at which the extraordinary profits made by insurance companies were discussed. The attempts by lawyers to undermine and emaciate the work of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board are continuing apace. I ask Members of the House to support and argue the case in favour of the operation of the board. I believe it will work. If it does not work we will all be losers and will still be talking about high insurance premia at some future point. This board can work but it needs support and people need to be reassured that it will help in every way possible. It offers a win-win scenario for everybody involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality of suicide in this country is a difficult issue to face not least for the families who are suffering because of it, but for society as a whole and that contributes in no small way to the under-reporting of suicide. Yesterday in Belfast, Youth Suicide Prevention, a joint initiative between the Health Development Agency and Institute of Public Health in Ireland, held a seminar and released details of a report they carried out in this area. They assert that suicide accounts for one third of all deaths in the 15 to 24 age group. More young people here are dying as a result of suicide than were killed in road traffic accidents. That is a harrowing reality.</P><Col N="532"/>
      <P>In the report, the organisations identified a number of recommendations they want taken on board by Governments North and South of the Border. The report identifies key risk factors that need to be addressed when developing future youth suicide prevention programmes. Those recommendations touch on a number of areas including, a history of suicide, a history of depression, substance misuse, poor family communications and certain characteristic traits such as poor problem-solving ability. This is a sensitive issue that needs to be debated and highlighted. I would appreciate if the Leader could arrange for this issue to be debated in the House.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio programme concentrated on the crisis in our accident and emergency services. I am not suggesting that radio chat shows should be used as a measure to gauge the crisis in accident and emergency services or any other sector. However, by the end of the show enough health professionals had phoned in to advise that there was capacity for in excess of 230 beds, which matches the number of people currently lying on trolleys in hospital corridors. The mismanagement of accident and emergency services was again highlighted by that programme.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. I am glad the board is up and running as a result of the recommendations of Dorothea Dowling and the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. However, exorbitant premia are still being quoted to young motorists for motor insurance. There has been a decrease in the cost of motor insurance premia in general, but the increase in public liability insurance premia and the exorbitant profits insurance companies are making are frustrating for many ordinary decent motorists. I know of a 19 year old serving an apprenticeship who lives in a rural town who is paying over &euro;5,000 for his motor insurance. That is scandalous and the issue needs to be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Some two weeks ago I requested that we might have a debate with the Minister for Transport on Aer Lingus following Willie Walsh&rsquo;s appearance before a joint Oireachtas committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if names were not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise. I called for such a debate following a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport. Yesterday, a further presentation was made to that joint Oireachtas committee, which I can only describe as a whinge. People who came before the joint committee yesterday asked a basic question. Given the basic nature of the question the Minister must come to the House to outline the function and role of Aer Lingus. That is the question the unions asked yesterday.</P><Col N="533"/>
      <P>If they have a problem with that, so do I. From what I heard yesterday and at the previous presentation, there is a divergence of views. Management seems to think its role is to provide customers with a competitive price to fly on aircraft. From their presentation yesterday, the unions seem to believe Aer Lingus is no more than a job retention rather than a job creation agency, and certainly not an agency that should look for customers from which employment would follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>We require the Minister to come to the House to outline the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a whinge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>In the programme for Government a commitment was given that the Government would improve accident and emergency waiting times and that senior doctors would be available at all times. Yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste apologised to the people who were on trolleys and said there was no quick-fix solution to the problem. As Senator McCarthy mentioned, on the Joe Duffy programme it was highlighted that beds were available that could be used as step-down facilities.</P>
      <P>Everybody is saying that the T&aacute;naiste is new to this Department but she has been in Cabinet for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, Hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>There is collective responsibility in Cabinet. The crisis in our accident and emergency services that was highlighted yesterday was known last winter. We are now facing such a crisis again. Is the Government serious in its intent to implement what it said in the programme for Government. Urgent action is required. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to do something about this problem and get on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from the issue of high insurance premia that was raised, I have recently heard of another related issue. Young motorists who take out insurance pay probably two thirds of the premium up front and the balance in instalments over five to six months. Two people recently told me that they had missed their final payment on the fifth month and their insurance was cancelled. That means they have lost six months&rsquo; insurance cover for the sake of &euro;70 or &euro;80 because they failed to make their final payment. This matter should be seriously examined and addressed because many people are being caught in this trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, said earlier. I am glad he brought to the attention of the House the centen<Col N="534"/>ary of the birth of the poet Paddy Kavanagh. He is somebody of whom we can all be proud. I have no doubt whatever that he will have a growing international reputation. I slightly dissent from what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about who I take to be Oliver Gogarty who was a former Member of this House. He was a fine poet, a talented doctor, a courageous supporter of democracy, but he did have an arrogant and bullying side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not fair to that man for the Senator to discuss him in that manner. We need to be consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised that point but like all of us, Gogarty was a mixed event. I ask the Leader to suggest to the appropriate Ministers that they take a sophisticated view of the row currently going on inside the European Commission because attempts are being made to suggest that difficulties of Mr. Barroso concerning Signor Buttiglione are because he is a Roman Catholic. However, it has nothing whatever to do with that or with his private views on homosexuality, women or anything else.</P>
      <P>He has a track record within the Italian Parliament of attempting to reverse precisely the kind of non-discriminatory measures that we are expecting him to supervise as a European Commissioner. It is a complete farce and a nonsense. I would defend his right to be a Roman Catholic and to hold whatever views he wants but in terms of policy he has a very bad and dangerous track record not only in terms of gay people but on women and immigrants. We should look at his record. His faith is a private matter. Let us not fudge that issue.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Cathaoirleach will find this point relevant. I would like to know when we can take No. 19, motion No. 13 which deals with the Order of Business. I must compliment the Cathaoirleach on playing a valiant role in trying to control us but we are avoiding the reality. The reality being that this is the most interesting, vital, covered and relevant part of the day. We all know that. Why try to cover up that reality by giving us a little squib here, two minutes at 11.30 a.m. and another minute at some other part of the day? Let us extend the Order of Business and see where it goes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the business of the day because I have put it down on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree that it is the business of the day. One cannot introduce any matter of public concern; there are other ways of doing so. The purpose of the Order of Business is to decide on the business of the day and it should remain so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have made a decision on the matter and the House ruled on it earlier in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the matter can be reconsidered because the Cathaoirleach heard very clearly the response of Members on all sides of the House.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Morrissey in calling for a debate on the future role of Aer Lingus, which should be held at the earliest possible opportunity. There is certainly a divergence of views on this issue among the public, as there is between Senator Morrissey and me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have a healthy debate on it. I believe certain members of senior management of Aer Lingus hold the view that this is just about profiteering within a commercial sector and they do not recognise that Aer Lingus is still a State-owned company and has a duty to the country, particularly in terms of the delivery of balanced regional development, which is a cornerstone and plank of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned that management is in no way attempting to deliver in that regard and therefore I am seeking a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>On the earlier point on the transfer of long-term patients from accident and emergency units to nursing homes, can the Minister for Health and Children be invited to the House to clarify how this will work in practice? Is she trying to increase the level of subvention for nursing homes considering that the current level presents a real problem? There is a great need for more step-down and convalescence facilities around the country.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my call of last week for a debate on wireless technology in advance of its becoming a major problem. It will become such if antennae are to be placed on buildings in built-up areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Morrissey spoke about the whinging at the transport meeting yesterday. <Col N="536"/>The public will not take kindly to that remark and would prefer if the Senator got on with the business of organising and promoting our transport system and delivering on the transport programme.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to debate the condition of our national secondary and primary routes throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The level of co-operation between the Department and local authorities should also be considered, as should the elimination of the many very serious and dangerous blackspots on our national secondary routes. The latter have been neglected for a number of years. The issue of pedestrian lights in most of our towns and villages located on main national secondary and primary routes needs to be addressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make those points in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to try to free up the traffic on these routes. Road signage also needs to be addressed, particularly where major repairs are being carried out on particular routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>All of those matters can be raised in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>These are issues that need to be addressed urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s call to the Leader regarding the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, to which I referred recently. She has made reasonable recommendations regarding extensions of powers to her office.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on the PIAB. I raised this issue yesterday in regard to seeking a fair and proportionate reduction <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the profits the insurance companies are making.</P>
      <P>Members will have been disturbed to have read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning that stealth is stealing our people&rsquo;s wealth. Of 23 countries, Ireland last year had the third largest increase in the tax burden. What are the Leader&rsquo;s views on this? Will the Government make a commitment that there will be no further increases and that this will bring about a serious reduction in the forthcoming budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s comments on stealth charges. This issue was prominent in some of the newspapers this morning. Most people would be very disturbed to see that we had the third highest increase in stealth charges of the OECD countries. The new Mini<Col N="537"/>ster for Finance, Deputy Cowen, would do well to investigate this.</P>
      <P>Let me raise an issue I raised with the Leader last week. Will she invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to the House to explain the seemingly new Government position on the future of the community employment schemes and other related schemes? We have heard mixed messages in this regard over the past two or three weeks.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport to the House, if at all possible, to discuss the roll-out of the national roads programme, particularly the difficulties that have arisen in different parts of the country, such as the Tara incident and the incident in Waterford that is delaying the bypass of Waterford city? Have we not learned anything in recent years from the major delays caused by choosing routes that directly involve sites of historic or archaeological interest? We should surely be ensuring that future routes will not pass through areas of such significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This side of the House would welcome a debate on economic and budgetary matters at any time. We have the lowest tax rates in the EU and the OECD and the lowest tax rates on people of low income. We have been commended by the EU Commission many times in that regard. If there is a need for debate, it is perhaps between putative coalition partners on the other side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader make contact with the new Minister for Agriculture and Food on the item in today&rsquo;s press indicating that imported free-range chickens have been contaminated with traces of a potentially cancer-causing veterinary drug? The chicken is imported into all our major stores, including Dunnes Stores, Tesco and Superquinn. It is time that we, as a food producing country, had greater monitoring of imported food products. We do not know their origin or the method of production in many cases, nor do we know what has been used in their production. It is very important that we protect Irish food products against dangerous imports that are probably cheaper. Thanks to the Food Safety Authority, the contamination of the chicken has been discovered and the products have been withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Ross to return to his seat.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="538"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He did express his wish to be Cathaoirleach on one occasion when he was bringing us into the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, said that the Ombudsman, Ms O&rsquo;Reilly, had stated her office should be included in the Constitution for the sake of its independence. He was equally concerned about expanding the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman. That is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to him.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated it is the anniversary of Patrick Kavanagh about whom there were lovely programmes on RTE. Well done to those concerned. BBC2 also showed an older programme by RTE.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Senator also raised the matter of public private partnerships. I understand that the Minister for Finance is keen to discuss this once he has read into it. The Senator said we should give our vocal support to the PIAB because it will result in cheaper insurance. It may be too early to review the work of PIAB, but it will be useful when the time is right.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy raised the reality of suicide and the North-South seminar. The statistic which indicates that one third of all deaths among people between the ages of 15 and 24 are due to suicide rather than traffic accidents is a salutary one. The Senator asked for a debate on this issue. He also referred to &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;. I have admiration for the way Joe Duffy runs his programme. Finding spare beds was a useful exercise and fair dues to the researchers and all those who unearthed this fact. I am sure there is much more involved than just finding beds and putting people into them. There are a myriad of factors involved, but certainly yesterday&rsquo;s exercise was useful. The Senator also raised the issue of motor insurance for young people. I am sure the PIAB is giving the issue detailed consideration.</P>
      <P>Senator Morrissey asked for a debate on Aer Lingus, which will be useful, but we will not discuss the people who came to the meeting. Senator Dooley also echoed that request.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane referred to the T&aacute;naiste. I am sure she is preparing the ground for an initiative on the accident and emergency issue, including other matters.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Scanlon&rsquo;s request, I did not realise that one could pay one&rsquo;s insurance premium by instalment. I thought one had to pay when one got the bill. Perhaps this is something the PIAB could examine.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to Patrick Kavanagh. He did not just bring fame to his native county of Monaghan, but also to Dublin. He is regarded as a Dublin poet, given that he spoke so well of the city. The Senator did not support Oliver St. John Gogarty but, as the Cathaoirleach said, we cannot speak badly of people who cannot defend themselves.</P>

      <P>Senator Mansergh, in his pursuit of the finance spokespersonship, said that we have the lowest tax rates in Europe and asked if there should be a debate on the opposite side as to whether there is a need for more revenue raising measures if promises are to be kept.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to the Northern Ireland chicken firm. We all think that if we buy organic products we are getting the best products.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I value this opportunity to address the Seanad on this very difficult and distressing situation, the abduction of Mrs. Margaret Hassan, a very dedicated and widely admired humanitarian who was kidnapped in Iraq a number of days ago. As Senators are aware, the D&aacute;il yesterday unanimously passed a resolution condemning this appalling act and calling for Mrs. Hassan&rsquo;s immediate release. This unanimity and the deep concern expressed by all sides of the D&aacute;il and Seanad reflect the deep concern of all our people. I welcome and applaud the decision of the Seanad to have an early debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach and I stated that the Government would do everything in its power to assist the safe return of Mrs. Hassan to her family. In my statement to the D&aacute;il I said that I had contacted her husband and her immediately family in Ireland, as well as governments and organisations in the region that might be of assistance. Overnight, we have been in discussion with the Egyptian and Jordanian Governments and also our Arab League contacts. Later today we will continue these efforts. I will be discussing the case in detail with the Foreign Minister of Palestine, Dr. Shaath. I know he will share my strong view that Mrs. Hassan should be released immediately.</P>
      <P>I know I do not need to emphasise to Senators the great sensitivity attaching to the efforts to have Mrs. Hassan released. In this regard, we will be guided by the views and advice of those on the ground in Iraq. They are best placed to advise us on further efforts.</P>
      <P>I spoke with her husband and her family in this country. They appreciate the efforts Ireland is making and emphasised the need, in this country, for privacy and space so they can come to terms with the situation. Her husband also emphasised, and was proud of the fact, that he holds an Irish passport. He regards his wife as an Irish citizen and regards our efforts as possibly the best currently being made. He emphasised the best way to secure her release is to use contacts on the ground, in particular NGOs and especially Care International and Iraqi personnel.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s position on abductions and the taking of hostages has always been crystal clear. Such acts are deplorable and can never be justified. In this instance, it has happened to a person who has devoted her life to providing humanitarian assistance to the neediest people in <Col N="542"/>a country devastated in recent years by war and deprivation. At the Baghdad office of Care International, Mrs. Hassan and 30 Iraqi staff do everything possible, on a daily basis, to provide emergency relief, medical aid and assistance in restoring access to clean water.</P>
      <P>Care International is one of the world&rsquo;s largest independent global relief and development organisations. It is resolutely non-political and non-sectarian, and operates in over 72 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and eastern Europe. Of its approximately 10,000 employees, more than 9,000 are nationals of countries where the programmes are run. Margaret Hassan is the leading member of that group of 9,000. She is an Iraqi citizen working in an all-Iraqi office, doing everything she can to help Iraqi people. It is therefore all the more shocking that such a dedicated person should be subjected to this inhumane treatment. My officials are in close contact with the chief executive of Care International and we will continue to review all aspects of the situation with him.</P>
      <P>Public opinion reflects this sense of outrage. The Seanad brings its own distinctive contribution to public debate in Ireland, and it is right that it should also take this opportunity to address the issue.</P>
      <P>In my statement yesterday, I noted, with concern, the erosion of respect for humanitarian personnel as witnessed in recent conflicts. Other speakers in the D&aacute;il echoed this concern. It is particularly disturbing. In my discussions with Kofi Annan last week regarding the possibility of UN personnel returning to Iraq following the murder and maiming of some of their staff in August of last year, he illustrated the difficulty the organisation has in going back in to that situation. The security required to protect personnel must be resolute. Before the abduction of Margaret Hassan, efforts to return UN staff to Baghdad were unfortunately put back because of explosions in the Green Zone, where it was intended these personnel should go. These explosions and the abduction of Margaret Hassan will further delay the possibility of UN staff returning to Baghdad. It is reprehensible and will ultimately lead to worse conditions for the Iraqis.</P>
      <P>Margaret Hassan&rsquo;s abduction highlights the enormous dangers facing those who engage in providing humanitarian services in Iraq. In my appeal to those who abducted her to set her free, I pointed out that her abduction could serve no purpose whatsoever. On the contrary, it can only damage and disrupt the valuable work done by humanitarian organisations in Iraq and directly harm the lives of thousands of Iraqis in need of help.</P>
      <P>When I spoke to Margaret&rsquo;s husband yesterday, to convey the concern and solidarity of the Government, the D&aacute;il and the people of Ireland, he was deeply appreciative of our support which he emphasised was extremely important to him and his family. This is a dreadful time for the family, friends and colleagues of Margaret <Col N="543"/>Hassan. I hope the widespread concern and outrage felt by us all at this appalling act will be widely heard and have some effect. The family are deeply grateful for our efforts, and they are equally appreciative of the respect shown for their privacy. In order to assist them, a senior official of my Department has travelled to Kerry and will act as a liaison support to the family. The Garda has also been asked to assist and has been helpful and supportive.</P>
      <P>I assure the House we will continue with our diplomatic efforts to secure Margaret&rsquo;s release. I thank the Seanad for taking this timely and valued opportunity to show our concern and solidarity on behalf of the Irish people. As some Senators may have heard on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, a close friend of Margaret Hassan confirmed the unanimous support of the D&aacute;il was something her friends cherish and believe will be significant in possibly securing her release. Equally, I thank the Seanad for giving us the opportunity to be able to say that both Houses of the Oireachtas, as representatives of the people of Ireland, speak with one voice against the abduction of Margaret Hassan. Hopefully all efforts will bring about her early release.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for presenting the motion, and the Minister for attending. I wish him well in his endeavours to bring whatever degree of progress he can to this sad situation. I would like to add to what he has said, but we all speak with one voice. We are so far removed from the situation in Iraq it is difficult to know what to say and more difficult to know what to do. I take on board his point that those working in Iraq with local knowledge are the best people from whom to take advice. I wish him well in working with such groups.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult issue for us to address because we must know our limitations in what we can say or do. It must be an awful time for the family of Margaret Hassan. Her abduction, while not the first such abduction in the past number of months, is a new low in that the person has given a lifetime of work and service to the people of Iraq.</P>
      <P>Kidnapping and abductions are appalling and dreadful acts. This is even more shameful because of her background. She has deep links with Iraq and holds Iraqi citizenship. We must recognise she has Irish citizenship, but also that she Iraqi citizenship. It is important that we try to listen to what her colleagues and friends in Iraq say.</P>
      <P>This abduction is a major news story, not just in Ireland and Europe, but also in Iraq. There were pictures in the past 24 hours of patients at a Baghdad hospital protesting against her abduc<Col N="544"/>tion. They obviously knew her track record and were trying to send their own message. It was a powerful image to send to her captors. They wanted Margaret released immediately.</P>
      <P>We do not know who is responsible for her abduction. Over the past couple of months, various organisations have been involved in kidnapping. Some of the kidnappings have resulted in tragic murders. Fortunately, on a few occasions, people have been released. Let us hope and pray this is one of the cases where the result will be successful and happy.</P>
      <P>Margaret&rsquo;s career in Iraq has been outlined by the Minister and many speakers in both Houses. Her work with Care International has provided significant help to the citizens of Iraq on a daily basis. It is a tragedy that as a result of this abduction the work of Care International is suspended. Our hopes and prayers are with Mrs. Hassan and her family. The message is sent from this House that Mrs. Hassan, a humanitarian worker who has given her life to the people of Iraq, should be released immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the call of other Members, thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for coming to the House and add my support to the motion. Having attended some of the Order of Business in the D&aacute;il yesterday, I felt it extremely important that the two Houses of the Oireachtas should combine to voice an appeal for Mrs. Hassan&rsquo;s immediate release. Nobody who has seen her on television could fail to be moved by her fine face and demeanour as she went about her business. She clearly took the welfare of the Iraqi people to heart in her work on behalf of Care International.</P>
      <P>Abduction is a heinous crime and, as the motion states, we condemn all instances of hostage taking. In this case in particular, it is wrong that a woman who worked constantly for the Iraqi people and had their care at the heart of her work should be so abused. One can only imagine how her husband, sister, other family members and her colleagues must feel. There is not much we can say only to add our voice to the international voices which have been raised. It is of great value that Mrs. Hassan was born in Ireland and holds Irish citizenship. Her husband is an Iraqi and she is combined with him in that citizenship. The work she has done serves to make her name an international one.</P>
      <P>It is worrying that no information has been received as to the group responsible for her abduction and its purpose. The group responsible for the abduction and murder of Mr. Kenneth Bigley and his American colleagues claimed its purpose was to secure the release of Iraqi women prisoners. What can one say if it is the same group which has abducted Mrs. Hassan? It cuts no ice anyhow and serves no purpose. I can only imagine Mrs. Hassan going to work each day in her business-like manner, distributing care to the people of Iraq, whom she clearly loved. That work has been suspended because of this heinous <Col N="545"/>crime. All Members join with the Minister, Taoiseach and Government in sending our prayers and solidarity to those who wish to secure Mrs. Hassan&rsquo;s release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share my time with Senators Ross and Norris.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and support this motion, which is broad and generous, involving a Government commitment to contribute in any way possible to secure the release of Mrs. Hassan. From what we have heard of Mrs. Hassan, it is clear she would like us to emphasise that we are not just calling for her release but for the release of all hostages in Iraq. The motion emphasises this by condemning the practice of hostage taking for any purpose or cause. Sadly, we have experience in Ireland of this type of crime. Paramilitary groups have taken hostages in the past and, on some occasions, murdered them. It is all too real and relevant to us and we understand it is a terrible situation.</P>
      <P>That such a good woman who has given so much to Iraq should be abducted indicates the terrible chaos into which that country has descended. We should ask the occupying forces to redouble their efforts to restore law and order. I understand it is almost impossible for women civilians to go anywhere in safety. I was disturbed to hear that Mrs. Hassan&rsquo;s Iraqi driver and assistant were both beaten up during her abduction. This demonstrates the lack of concern of her hostage takers for anybody&rsquo;s welfare. The House should emphasise that all hostages are important, not just Mrs. Hassan with her important Irish connections. A parliamentarian friend from the Turkish Parliament told me recently that every day one or two coffins are returned with the remains of Turkish lorry drivers who have been murdered while trying to deliver supplies for people like Mrs. Hassan. Supplies cannot be distributed until they are delivered. These people are being murdered by criminals who want their loads, insurgents who are fighting the occupying forces, and others. It is important to bear in mind the chaotic situation in Iraq and encourage the occupying powers to redouble their efforts to guarantee the safety of civilians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to the unanimity behind this motion. It is difficult for anybody to say much in this situation. I am doubtful of the value of having a debate not because of any wrongful intent, but because, by making public statements, we may add to the appetite of the kidnappers when they find they are having an effect around the world. I feel slightly ambivalent about this entire business because international political leaders, this House, houses of parliament around the world and so on are prepared to publicly highlight the activities of these evil people. This affords some degree of efficacy to the latter.</P>
      <P>Anything one says could be interpreted as being inflammatory and encouraging of the per<Col N="546"/>petrators so we should be reasonably circumspect in what we say and regard this as something outside the normal political area of jousting. It certainly has been so today and I commend Members on that attitude. I appeal to anybody involved in this to restrict what they say and be careful they do not exploit it for any political motives. They must ensure everything they do will help Mrs. Hassan. It is obvious the perpetrators of this kidnap will take some pleasure that they have drawn worldwide attention to their crime. People must exercise responsibility on this subject.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to know where humanitarian aid will come from in the future if these types of crimes continue. We must look to the future after the appalling situation of Mr. Kenneth Bigley and others and consider whether we do in some way tolerate or unwittingly assist the cause of the kidnappers. Where in the future will we find those brave people who for no personal reward will go to places like Iraq where it is absolutely chaotic and where nobody, however good their intention and however partisan they may be, is safe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the opportunity with other Members to express my solidarity with the family of Mrs. Hassan at this dreadful time. I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs wholeheartedly on his endeavours in this situation and in the recent case of Mr. Kenneth Bigley where, upon assuming office, he immediately entered into negotiations to seek the release of that unfortunate hostage. I share the concern of Senator Ross with regard to our helplessness in this situation. These kidnappings take place for publicity reasons. For parliaments around the world to supply more oxygen to that publicity may be just what the kidnappers wish. With our support, our Minister for Foreign Affairs will continue his valiant efforts in seeking Margaret Hassan&rsquo;s release.</P>
      <P>It is more important that we express our solidarity with this humanitarian aid worker. Ireland is renowned for its humanitarian aid around the globe. Therefore, it is important we express solidarity with all those great people who have left our shores to provide humanitarian aid to the most needy. Our voice will be heard in this area and will give those people the support they need, especially at this difficult time. I wish the Minister well in his endeavours. He has the support of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their sentiments. I empathise and agree with what Senator Ross said. From my contact with the members of Margaret Hassan&rsquo;s family in Ireland, I know they have been upset by the invasion of privacy, especially at a time when it is difficult for them to get their heads around what is going on and what they can do at so far a remove. From that point of view the Senator is correct in what he says. He is also correct with regard to the global reaction.</P><Col N="547"/>
      <P>There was some criticism of what we endeavoured to do in the case of Kenneth Bigley. However, I felt we had to do what we did. We had to make every effort within our power. In that instance, by providing him with a passport we were only providing something to which he was entitled. A passport is only a document. He was entitled to Irish citizenship under our laws. Therefore, whether he did or did not have a document made no difference. We, as we do in emergency circumstances where, for example, people have lost passports abroad, cut through the red tape on that occasion. Unfortunately, that was not successful.</P>
      <P>In this instance, the initial view, as outlined to me by both her family here and her husband, might be that the fact that Margaret Hassan is so widely known in Iraq and that she worked with and helped ordinary Iraqi people, which does not in any way reflect on other people who were kidnapped and murdered, may mean that the best people to judge the type of contacts that should be made are those people on the ground. Having spoken to Mr. Hassan yesterday, I know he hopes to speak to a number of key people in the area whom he believes have significant influence. This belief was exemplified by the statement of one of Mrs. Hassan&rsquo;s friends to the media. Another friend who worked with her for a number of years in Iraq also confirmed the same to me privately. However, they very much welcome the support the Oireachtas is giving and believe it will be key in the release of Margaret Hassan.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Some years ago the former Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Ken Whitaker, stood for election to the educational panel of the Seanad and he got what was considered to be a derisory vote. He had been a distinguished Member in 1981 having been appointed by the then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald. He was not re-appointed but he felt later that he would still like to serve in the House. He stood for the panel and did not get elected or even get a competitive vote. I wonder what that tells us about the House because Dr. Whitaker was awarded a somewhat token but significant award as the greatest living Irishman of the 20th century a little later. If someone who is awarded such an extraordinarily elevated status by an independent panel is unable to be elected to this House of 60 Members, it does not necessarily mean there is something wrong with the election of the House but one of the two bodies is unrepresentative.</P><Col N="548"/>
      <P>When he was a Member, Dr. Whitaker played an independent role, despite his nomination by a partisan Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald. I do not say that in a pejorative way because all Taoisigh are partisan. Dr. Whitaker could not get the requisite number of votes for election to these panels because of the system of election to the House. A total of 43 Members are elected to these panels. I am not being critical of other Members&rsquo; form of election as I am equally critical of my own. However, one of the great problems is, despite the laudable aspiration that nominating bodies should elect people to the House to give it a vocational aspect and it works in many cases, the electorate is nakedly party political. An informal party political whip is imposed on the election of those 43 Members. They are elected through their own parties because they are not able to fish in the pool of other parties, if at all. They seek the votes of county councillors, outgoing Senators and Deputies. The result is that if one is non-party, it is almost impossible to get into the House unless one is a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee or is elected to a university seat. That is not necessarily good or bad but it should be highlighted.</P>
      <P>I challenge anybody to name a Member elected to those 43 seats who was not a committed party member. There may have been one or two but I do not recall any in my time here. The system was devised to ensure the Government had a majority in the House. The Seanad should not in any way thwart the democratic wishes of the D&aacute;il. That would be utterly wrong and it would be a case for abolition. That is why the House cannot defeat or amend financial legislation but it can amend and revise other legislation and bring forward extraordinarily novel ideas. However, it can also play a different role and my criticism of the House is that it plays a similar role to that of the D&aacute;il. If it is to be taken more seriously, it should do different things and, therefore, it should not automatically reflect the party political balance of the D&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>The division of seats in the House was thought up by someone obsessed with ensuring Governments had majorities, Oppositions were in minorities and there was one or two Independents. The nominating bodies are a cover for the vocational aspect of the House. While these bodies nominate a significant number of people who have great expertise, the second ingredient, which is absolutely necessary, is that they should have party political allegiances and can, therefore, be elected by councillors, outgoing Senators and newly elected Deputies. That is a flaw because the result is two Chambers, a bicameral system, which are too similar to each other. They have similar roles and they are clones of each other. There is a lack of a non-political input or people from a left-wing background. That could be a useful role for the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I am guilty of using the House to get into the D&aacute;il. I thank God I failed abysmally and I will always thank the people of Wicklow for the rejection they inflicted on me because I no longer have <Col N="549"/>such ambitions. However, it was an abuse of the House in that I was holding on as a Member in anticipation and hope of becoming a Member of the D&aacute;il and, when I failed, I returned to this House as a second choice. That was not a noble thing to do. Now that I have no such ambitions, I can say that with a great deal more purity but, at the time, I could not do so. I was constricted in my contributions in the House during that time by that ambition. The House is, unfortunately, a second choice for many. It is not to the benefit of the House if those of us who wish to be Members of the D&aacute;il make it obvious. It means our performances are constricted by our ambitions.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Senator Bannon stated he had been speaking to a constituent in the morning. What he means by a constituent is someone in Longford-Roscommon but that is not his constituency. His constituency is fellow Members, Ministers and others but he does not look on it like that. He thinks of his constituency as where his ambitions lie rather than where he is. That is a flaw which we must reflect on and we must decide what is the Seanad&rsquo;s role, as many Members think of it this way.</P>
      <P>I made a suggestion to the sub-committee that I have been making for 20 years but constitutional reform, in particular, takes a long time. D&aacute;il and Seanad elections should be held on the same day. That would thwart a significant number of ambitions but it would also make people decide which role they want to play. If one had to say one was standing for the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, one would immediately have a different perspective because one would not have a fall back position. Once one failed to be elected to one Chamber, one would be unable to go for the other. There would be many unemployed and redundant Deputies and Senators and, therefore, it would be a difficult measure to get through the Oireachtas but it would be a method of redefining the role of these Houses by forcing people to make the choice. While it is not to say I am necessarily his great advocate, such a process would also mean that people of Dr. Whitaker&rsquo;s calibre would not have to compete with those with obvious ambitions to enter the other House. While that is the main reform I identify in the context of the 43 Members who are elected in that way, it does not mean I think this should be a non-political House in some puritan way. It should be a House, however, in which people have perspectives and ambitions other than to get into the D&aacute;il. Candidates should be nominated and elected by people who are not necessarily politicians first and foremost.</P>
      <P>The university seats are rightly and frequently criticised. Among the criticisms made against those of us who hold them is that we are elitist, which is a pretty glib term and a very convenient one. It is not true. People who make such charges do not realise what the circumstances are. While the constituency is certainly discriminatory, Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Ryan and Quinn have an electorate of approximately 120,000, a figure on which <Col N="550"/>I am open to correction. It is larger than most D&aacute;il constituencies although all members of the electorate happen to have degrees. My constituency at the last count was approximately 40,000 people, all of whom have degrees also. Its members come from all types of backgrounds and professions. While they are drawn from those who have what remains the great privilege of a university degree, the constituency is not elitist in the way it was when the electorate was 3,000 or 4,000.</P>
      <P>As history shows, it is useful to have in this House representatives of the universities provided the electorate is large enough and not too elitist, but it is indefensible that any university should not have the franchise. If we reform this House, we must give the franchise to all universities and all people with degrees. It is quite wrong that for traditional and political reasons and a failure to prioritise reform, graduates of other universities should not have votes. In the package of reform whenever it comes, these graduates must be given votes in the same way as graduates of the University of Dublin and the National University of Ireland. On the other hand, the university constituencies do not want to be the soft target in the reform of the Seanad when it comes. The university Senators would welcome and will initiate moves towards these reforms ourselves. To claim some of the credit, I suggested when I chaired the first meeting of the House at the beginning of the session that such reforms should be a matter for the Seanad.</P>
      <P>While the university Senators do not wish to be a soft target, we want to see democratic and fair reforms in our home patch. We do not want to see the political parties agreeing that while Seanad reform is positive, it should be a gradual process starting with those guys in the back row who make something of a nuisance of themselves. We do not want to see the political parties sitting back and observing how reform of the university constituencies works for 50 years before being ready to move on to themselves and the particular problems they have.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that resistance to Seanad reform will come from everywhere. One cannot blame anybody given that this is a House in which patronage is particularly prevalent. With the best will in the world, one cannot ask people to sacrifice a seat for which they have fought very hard and which they believe, in many cases correctly, they merit. One cannot ask people to give away half of the seats from which they are making a great contribution and vote themselves out of office. As that does not happen in political life, it will be extremely difficult to get reforms through. Reform must be pushed through each of the parliamentary parties, all of whose members see themselves as D&aacute;il Deputies who may become Senators by accident or as Senators for life who are coming back to the Seanad in difficult circumstances. While it would take great political courage by parties to tackle this problem, we must <Col N="551"/>have an overall package to ensure the university seats are not the only target for reform.</P>
      <P>While reform is absolutely essential in the university seats and the issue should be tackled, the matter must be considered very carefully. One does not want to lose the independence of the university seats by changing the constituencies too much. I hope it is fair to say the seats have had a value in their independence whatever one feels about the individuals who held them, given that they have said things political parties found difficult to say for obvious reasons. If one changes the constituencies too radically, one might find that the political parties take them over with their machines. It is always a temptation and I see a real danger that it might happen. It would take courage on behalf of a Minister to prevent this.</P>
      <P>Among the suggestions made is that the six university seats should be placed in one constituency. With the new universities, that would create a constituency of over 200,000. I cannot envisage that many independent individuals could afford to circulate 200,000 people. I am not referring to free postage but to maintaining contact in other ways. Independent candidates would not have the manpower to cope with the logistics of treating such an electorate as a constituency and getting around to each of its members. In such circumstances, I can envisage political parties moving into the constituency with great professionalism having agreed to keep the seats and expand the electorate to 200,000 meaning no independent candidate could be elected due to expense, difficulty and lack of support, manpower and machinery.</P>
      <P>When, as they should be, the university seats are reformed and the franchise increased, I hope the matter will be treated sensitively and with a great deal of thought. If that is not the case, all that will happen is the political parties will take over our seats in a constituency too large for us to manage re-election. I say that with a very obvious vested interest. I intend to stand for re-election to this House and do not wish particularly to do so in a constituency of 250,000, which I would find extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees constitute, in principle, the worst aspect of this House, although in practice they have not proved to be so. Providing the Taoiseach with the capacity to impose lobby fodder is utterly wrong. While it gives him the majority, it also provides him with the opportunity to include people he blatantly wants to promote, patronise or reward. That has happened and it is an insult to the House. I say that, but think immediately of some of the really great Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees we have had. Charles Haughey showed fantastic imagination in nominating Seamus Mallon, John Robb and &Eacute;amon de Buitl&eacute;ar, none of whom could be regarded as politically partisan. John Robb was subsequently nominated by Garret FitzGerald who also nominated Dr. Ken Whitaker. Gordon Wilson was another distinguished Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee and <Col N="552"/>among the current Members is Senator Maurice Hayes, also from Northern Ireland.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The appointment of such people showed great imagination and enlightenment by Taoisigh at the time. However, such appointments can only be made when the Government has a majority. It is only then the Taoiseach of the time appoints those he or she believes can be afforded. On the whole, it is a principle that should be abandoned. Overall reform of the House takes place when one removes the nakedly political nature of it. If the House does not have the power to obstruct and thwart Government legislation and includes people who regard their role as vocational and legislative but to never frustrate the Government&rsquo;s wishes &mdash; that idea of this House obstructing the will of the D&aacute;il for any length of time is unacceptable, absurd and totally undemocratic &mdash; then the principle of Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees can be discarded.</P>
      <P>This House should not suggest piecemeal reform. One of the disappointing aspects of the submissions was the lack of an overall vision in terms of the role of this House as a direct contrast to the D&aacute;il &mdash; what we ought to be doing for the bicameral system. There were all sorts of specialist interests expressing views on little changes here and there. We should have a new vision of a Seanad which is less political and where elections to it are held on the same day as the general election so as to remove as far as possible the party political element and to take account of the fact that some of us have ambitions to move between one House and the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The first thing that comes to mind in terms of Seanad reform is, if it is not broken do not fix it. There are elements of this House which work exceptionally well as they were well thought out. The creation of a legislative arm that reflects the vocational groupings in the country was a far-sighted and wise undertaking. It also incorporates the universities. It is important to bear in mind that it would be impossible to run a Parliament without a Government majority in both Houses. It is a contradiction in terms because there would be no Government without a majority in both Houses because it would be impossible to get any work done. That is a practical application.</P>
      <P>The Seanad is made up of five panels, Labour, Cultural and Educational, Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial and Administrative, a practical and wide-ranging system which has worked successfully to date. Those who serve in this House are provided with a wonderful opportunity to raise matters of immediate national and international concern on a daily basis, which is a unique privilege.</P>
      <P>However, some change is necessary. Having a directly or partially-directly elected Seanad is not a good idea. A proposal was made earlier that 20 seats be directly elected. That would be similar to election to the European Parliament given the <Col N="553"/>constituency would be so wide. The overlapping function, with elected Deputies, would be a difficult task and would be unnecessary. It would be a most difficult task given that we have a clientalist system of politics. The need to look after such an extensive constituency would take from the work of the Seanad in terms of its necessary legislative process and its role in debating issues.</P>
      <P>The issue of holding Seanad elections on the same day as general elections was discussed earlier. One can only smile at that idea. Getting around the country as it is and hoping to meet the electorate is difficult. The electoral college works successfully and it allows us to meet our councillors and Oireachtas Members. Can anyone imagine trying to meet them during election time? What hope would one have of meeting them in an effort to secure election to the Seanad during the three-week canvassing period before a general election? There may be merit in the University Panel holding its election on the same day.</P>
      <P>At the time the University Panel was set up, it was apposite that there would be three seats for representatives of Trinity College. However, that time and need is gone; there should be one electorate. I have no doubt the same people would be re-elected. However, the need for special representation from Trinity College is not necessary. It harks back to a time when there was a perceived need to extend a special place to such representatives. There is now a need for only one University Panel which would include all third level students.</P>
      <P>The appointment of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees is necessary. The Government must have a majority to ensure legislation is not delayed. It is not feasible that the Government would not have an in-built majority in the Upper House otherwise the constitutional provisions governing the House would have to be changed to remove its blocking power. It would be a pity if that were to happen.</P>
      <P>There is a practical and obvious need for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees. However, reform is needed in terms of membership numbers. When the D&aacute;il first met, it had approximately 120 Members and the Seanad had 60 Members. Membership of the D&aacute;il has increased to 166. It would be entirely appropriate that there be 80 Members of the Seanad, at a minimum. We need to increase membership of the Seanad. It is unfortunate the level of debate &mdash; I do not include myself in this &mdash; and high standard of contributions by Members of this House are not reported more often. However, the solution to that is in our hands.</P>
      <P>I believe former Taoisigh and Presidents should have an automatic right to sit in the Seanad and contribute. We can only imagine the contributions they might make. I include in that those whom I would not have supported. Former President, Mary Robinson, would provide the House with an excellent account of human rights throughout the world. That would be of benefit to this House. It would also have the double-<Col N="554"/>edged effect of focusing the media on what is done in the Seanad. Much of what is done in the Seanad goes unreported and that is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, we should not seek to fix that part of the Seanad which is not broken. It is important that councillors and elected representatives from the electoral college have an opportunity of making a direct input into Government. This is their fora and we, along with the greater electorate, represent them.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to constituents. As elected representatives we have a responsibility not alone to the electorate but to the wider community, just as Deputies have a responsibility to others outside their constituency. It is up to the individual whether or not he or she takes up that responsibility but I would like to believe any request made of a Deputy would be undertaken. I believe such tasks would be undertaken by the vast majority of Deputies and Senators. We have a wide role which could be expanded upon.</P>
      <P>The Seanad is a great House in terms of debate, the introduction of legislation and its ability to take on board different views while at the same time holding fast to one&rsquo;s own. That is well reflected in this House. I suggest that membership of the Seanad be increased, that former Taoisigh and Presidents be allowed to sit in the House and that there be one constituency for universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the House. He is a former Member of this House and this is his first visit since his elevation, on which I congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with those comments. I was not aware that the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, is a former Member of the House but I wish him well in his new job.</P>
      <P>Two years ago I knew very little about the Seanad. I am certainly much wiser now, having been a Member of the House for that period. I suppose my knowledge reflects that of the general public, who ultimately know little about what goes on in the Seanad. Thankfully that is changing and I suppose we have ourselves to blame for that. This Seanad has quite a high profile and that is due in no small part to the current Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who has certainly ensured that we have received good coverage and publicity at times. That is good for the democratic process because it has made people aware that there is a second Chamber and of the useful work we can do.</P>
      <P>I agree with some points raised by Senator Hanafin on having the election to the Seanad on the same day as the election to the D&aacute;il. Speaking selfishly, this would not necessarily be good. The abolition of the dual mandate has suddenly forced politicians into a tricky scenario. For example, if, following the next general election, people do not get elected to the D&aacute;il or Seanad, <Col N="555"/>they are finished in politics. A Member cannot be a county councillor or town councillor, unlike previously, and one&rsquo;s political career can come to an end very quickly. It is no harm to have options for people who invariably sacrifice their personal and business lives to go into politics. A previous speaker described politics as a rat race and I suppose it is an uncertain career. I do not think introducing more uncertainty into it would do anyone any good and it certainly would not attract people who have good, solid careers behind them.</P>
      <P>We all know the long hours we put in and the fact that our work is, in effect, never finished. We work from early morning until late at night, we are constantly on call and there is always the danger of an election looming over us. At least if people want to contest a D&aacute;il election and they do not succeed, there is an option of standing for the Seanad election. Without such an option, if a snap general election were called tomorrow morning, for example, we would have to wait until 2009 to return to the political race. That would be a long time to wait, especially when there are young people with families in politics. If we want to go the route of America where people are quite old and have their money made and their families reared before they go into politics, then politicians will be able to afford to take years out. However, if we want to encourage into politics young people and those who have something to offer, we must introduce some degree of certainty and security into the job and provide them with options. Otherwise we will lose those people. They will walk away from politics and politics will be poorer for it.</P>
      <P>The idea of inviting former Taoisigh and T&aacute;naist&iacute; into the House is quite a good one as obviously they have considerable experience. The likes of Deputy John Bruton, who was elected in 1969, even before I was born, have a wealth of experience that few in the House would match and it certainly would be worth inviting him into the Seanad every so often to make a speech or a contribution. Even the Taoiseach, who is a Member of the D&aacute;il since 1977 and has served in numerous Departments, would have a considerable contribution to make although I might not agree with his policies. It is a pity that when politicians retire, they literally are forgotten. Ms Olivia O&rsquo;Leary wrote about that in her recent book. Politicians, when they leave the Houses, are literally shunned by their colleagues. The aforementioned invitations would provide an opportunity to bring former politicians who have a wealth of experience into the House to make contributions to certain debates.</P>
      <P>I am impressed at what the Seanad can do. The matters raised on the Adjournment are quite good, although it is an area which can be developed further. At times we get bland replies to specific matters raised on the Adjournment. It is regrettable when a Minister comes into the House with a prepared response. No matter what a Senator says in the five minute contribution, he <Col N="556"/>or she gets the same response anyway and perhaps wonders whether raising the matter is a waste of his or her time. Invariably the Minister can be curtailed in what he or she can say, even though some Ministers, to be fair to them, give extra information afterwards and deviate from the script. If we are to make the Seanad really meaningful, the Adjournment should become far more specific. Senators should get proper replies they could use and not just some bland response stating how much money the Government is spending on the national development plan, etc., which ultimately is no use to us.</P>
      <P>There should be a facility for a question and answer session in the Seanad. One was held here previously with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. Senator O&rsquo;Toole, in particular, and a few others engaged in a robust and informative exchange of ideas and it certainly worked well. This is something that should be looked at as it might benefit everyone involved.</P>
      <P>Senators should also have the option of tabling parliamentary questions. It is daft that we invariably end up working through our colleague Deputies, which is unfair to them. We should be allowed to table parliamentary questions on behalf of our constituents.</P>
      <P>I would disagree slightly with Senator Ross when he spoke about using the word &ldquo;constituents&rdquo;. If one looks carefully at the Constitution, the constituency of those Members elected by the county council system covers the Twenty-six Counties and therefore includes everybody. While we might understandably concentrate on particular geographical areas, we are right to make representations on behalf of people and it serves democracy well.</P>
      <P>I welcome the idea in the Seanad reform report that envisages an enhanced role in EU affairs. That should be developed further. I also welcome the suggestion that the Seanad should scrutinise public appointments. At present we are seeing this in the European Parliament, where the proposed EU Commissioners are being put through their paces. Perhaps we should have put the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, through his paces too before he was appointed as a junior Minister to see what qualities he would bring to the role. No doubt he would have passed with flying colours.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Government has not replied to a proposal by my colleague, Senator Jim Higgins, who is now an MEP, that he would give up his seat to a representative of an emigrant group. Several letters were written to the Taoiseach on that issue. It is a good idea. However, I would deviate slightly from it and recommend that, because of the considerable non-national population in Ireland, we should look for somebody living and working in Ireland to represent the different communities. Even in Carlow, there is a significant non-Irish population working, paying taxes and contributing to Irish life. It is important that they would have a representative. I am aware that Ennis in Senator <Col N="557"/>Daly&rsquo;s county has a town councillor from a non-Irish background working on behalf of the people. Perhaps the Minister of State might bring to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention that he should make a decision on the sensible proposal by Senator Higgins. It would be a great opportunity to make the Seanad more reflective and inclusive of society and that would be welcomed.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>The next Seanad will be very exciting. As a result of the abolition of the dual mandate, we will see a significant turnover of Senators. Fianna F&aacute;il, more than likely, will lose about five seats based on the local election results. We will see smaller parties, like Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party, coming into the Seanad. This is a good development. It will be more reflective of society. It might also lead to better debates in the House. One criticism I have of the House at present is that perhaps it is too conservative and invariably there are no major ideological differences in the House on key debates. That does not necessarily augur well for the future. The next Seanad will be an exciting Chamber of which to be a Member because all the political parties will be represented, along with the Independents.</P>
      <P>I compliment the media for the coverage they have given the Seanad. In particular, I compliment <i>The Irish Times</i> and Mr. Jimmy Walsh, who every week ensures that we get coverage. It is much appreciated by the Senators. &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; gives a fair amount of coverage to the Seanad also. Other newspapers may not give the House the coverage it deserves but perhaps that is a reflection on ourselves and we are not pursuing them enough. Other media should cover the Seanad as well as it is covered by <i>The Irish Times</i> and &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One criticism I have of the Seanad relates to the delay in passing Bills. Years ago most Bills were initiated in the D&aacute;il but now half the Bills are initiated in the Seanad and then go on to the D&aacute;il. There can be a long gap between a Bill being passed in the Seanad and going to the D&aacute;il. In some cases the gap is two years. For example, the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill has suffered a long delay. That is regrettable as there should be a smooth transition for Bills between both Houses.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is good in that we have more latitude than our colleagues in the other House. It allows us to raise topical issues and we can seek debates on issues. One difference between the Seanad and the other House is that of having statements on topics. I find them good because, generally speaking, Senators put forward good ideas. It also allows Ministers to listen and be better informed and, perhaps, put some of those ideas to good use. The danger with Bills is that one can be political and, perhaps, the public do not benefit to the same extent. The option of statements on different issues is beneficial, such as we have today.</P><Col N="558"/>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the mandate for graduates will be extended. My sister, who got eight As in her junior certificate, does not have a vote in the Seanad elections because she went to DCU. She has a degree. I know the vote will be extended to such people. Given that there are more people in higher education we should not leave the remit to a select few colleges but should widen it. There will be a difficulty in deciding to whom to give the vote. At a minimum it should be those who have undertaken a two-year degree course; otherwise people would qualify having done a one-year course and that would be unmanageable. The remit should be extended to include the institutes of technology and some of the universities that are currently excluded.</P>
      <P>The report is good and contains plenty of information. I question whether its recommendations will be implemented. Will it be like many of the reports to the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, that are still on a shelf gathering dust? It is important to pick at least three or four key themes from it. I agree with Senator Hanafin in regard to the timing of elections. If the elections were held on the same day as the local and European elections it would be a nightmare because those we are meant to be canvassing with would themselves be canvassing. We need to think carefully about that issue before embarking on it.</P>
      <P>The Seanad has many advantages and should not be a miniature D&aacute;il. The Seanad should be a different Chamber and have a different method of election. I would not apologise for the political parties playing a major role in it. It allows people an opportunity to be elected who might not otherwise get elected. For example, the former President, Mary Robinson, was elected to the Seanad but she could not get elected to the D&aacute;il. However, she ended up being President. We have to increase the opportunities available to people. The D&aacute;il is not the be-all and end-all. There are other options and we should allow people to look at different political routes from local to national or European levels. Ultimately, there is not much wrong with the Seanad but it needs some improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and wish him well in his onerous task in the Department. He is bringing with him much experience, having been a Member of both Houses. I am sure he will make a valuable and distinguished contribution to the development of the issues that affect the Department. He is welcome here and I wish him well in his new office.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker wound up by saying he would like assurances that some of the issues raised in the report will be implemented. I agree with him on that point. I find these debates artificial in the sense that this report now joins 11 <Col N="559"/>other reports on Seanad reform since the foundation of the State. One thing I do not like doing is wasting my time and that of other people. My wish is that if action is to be taken on this report, it should be taken speedily. In that regard I thank the various members of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the volume of work it put into the preparation of the report, the detailed analysis of the current situation and for looking at the various reports prepared during the past 30 or 40 years. They have made some very definite recommendations, some of which I agree with. While each of us will have our particular views, it is important that some reform of the Seanad is undertaken because the general consensus of the public is that it needs to be reformed.</P>
      <P>While the committee indicated there were 161 submissions from the public on reform of the Seanad, that is a small number. The vast majority of people would not bother to make submissions as they believe the Seanad is irrelevant. That is not a view I hold but it is the view of the public who are not familiar with the workings of the Seanad. In the main, the public know absolutely nothing about the nominations system. Many of the young graduates feel disenfranchised even though a constitutional change was made in 1979. I recall that very clearly as I had just become a Member of the other House in 1973. The constitutional change was made to allow the vast majority of third level institutions to have a vote and take part in elections to the Seanad. That has never happened. Those Members who represent the universities should account for that as they do not represent the vast majority of third level graduates. In fact, the vast majority of third level graduates did not have a hand, act or part in the election of this or any other Seanad. Would it be possible to have the constitutional amendment implemented to allow the other institutions to have representation in order to bridge the gap between the younger intellectuals and graduates and the public at large? That would be a start.</P>
      <P>The public view, in so far as it is expressed, is that the Seanad should be more democratic and more relevant to what is happening in Ireland as a whole, even though, through some of the changes made under the existing Standing Orders, it has become more relevant in recent years than when I first became a Member in 1992. Some of those changes allowed for commissioners from the European Commission to address the Seanad on regional policy and other matters. For example, the President of the European Parliament had the opportunity, before he left that office, to address the House. In that regard there is a great opportunity to involve the House in the activities of, for example, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the various institutions and especially in relation to <Col N="560"/>dialogue between Members and the social partners.</P>
      <P>All of us would agree that the success of the economy in recent years has come about, by and large, because of the partnership approach of unions, employers, farmers, social partners and the Government in developing economic polices. As the Minister of State will be aware we had the opportunity at Inchydoney to have some discussions with Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy on social issues. There is the view that the social partners do not have an adequate opportunity to voice their opinions on some of the social issues. We need to amend that and it may be possible to do so by means of some legislative changes. If we took account of the changing economic environment and social issues which affect Ireland, the scope of this House could be broadened enormously within existing parameters. If the representatives of NGOs were more involved in the deliberations of this House, as was the case in respect of the European Parliament regional offices, it would give the public a better understanding of the role and responsibilities of Senators, which principally involve the scrutiny of legislation.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a raft of committees of the House does not take account of the manner in which the Seanad operates. It may be advisable to bring the chairpersons of the various committees before the House to get assessments of their work because it involves dialogue between the social partners, public bodies, semi-State organisations and others. Therefore, it may be possible, without having a representative of every organisation before us, for the chairpersons of the committees to give the House regular reports on proceedings. The committees publish reports at the end of each year but I do not remember any being debated in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>I represented Ireland on the Council of Europe for some years. As the Minister of State is aware, the Council of Europe is responsible for what is probably the world&rsquo;s largest body of legislation governing human rights, justice and the rule of law, at the centre of which is the European Court of Human Rights. During that entire period, Ireland&rsquo;s representatives had no forum in which they could express the Council&rsquo;s views on some of the major issues of the day such as stem cell research and euthanasia. These issues occupy much time in the Council of Europe&rsquo;s social and political affairs committees.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe has a broad membership of almost 50 countries, among which Ireland is a founder member. The deliberations of the Council among its members at assembly and committee meetings take place but Irish representatives are not afforded an opportunity of addressing the D&aacute;il or Seanad on the Council&rsquo;s important and far-reaching work, other than through the European and foreign affairs committees.</P><Col N="561"/>
      <P>It may be necessary to change legislation to broaden the scope of the activities of the Seanad to include European affairs matters, social partnership issues or the North-South bodies, which everyone in the House hopes will be restored when a new agreement is reached on Northern Ireland, all of which will open up a new dimension to the work of the Seanad. In that context, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, was in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery yesterday and appeared to be very interested in the work of the Seanad. I am sure we could invite him to address the House at some stage.</P>
      <P>The sub-committee has envisaged areas which the Seanad could address such as European affairs, social partnership, the North-South bodies and the scrutiny of public appointments, which is coming more into the public arena as people demand that those appointed to public office should be given an opportunity to explain their backgrounds, experience and expertise before a select committee of this House or the Seanad itself. We have met some of these people already and it may be opportune to carry out an assessment of whether any of these functions can be carried out under existing standing orders without the necessity for Government decisions on legislation or constitutional change.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the work of the sub-committee has been on the issue of the vocational committees, the role of the Seanad in modern Ireland and whether that role has been fully explained and expanded upon in a way that meets the changing circumstances. The sub-committee had discussions with the Taoiseach and his predecessor about whether elections to the Seanad should be direct, a combination of direct elections and panels or a list system, all of which are detailed in the report so there is no need for me to expand on it.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, if we are to make the Seanad effective there must be changes. The vocational system has not worked satisfactorily. Unless candidates have party political connections their chances are limited. The point was made that people who could not get elected to the Seanad were elected as President. The Minister of State will be familiar with the case of a representative of disabled people who could not get elected to the Seanad but was elected to the European Parliament. The system of election is not as democratic as the public would like. If we reform the system, it could be reorganised on a provincial or regional basis, which would entail people from the six counties of Northern Ireland being represented as part of Ulster in the Chamber. The four provinces could be elected by the people in those areas, although it would likely require some constitutional and legislative change.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to waste my time with debates of this nature if this report joins the other 11 in <Col N="562"/>splendid isolation in the Minister&rsquo;s office in the Custom House. If we are to be effective, perhaps we could start by making some changes almost immediately. It is important that we bridge the gap between the public, who feel this place is irrelevant, outdated and useless, and the general view held by most of us that this is a very important place which should be protected in the context of any future changes in the governance of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. After many years as a Deputy, he deserves his place in the sun having been appointed as a Minister of State and I wish him well. His popularity extends beyond his party throughout Leinster House, which says a great deal.</P>
      <P>The issue before us has been debated at length in the House. I respect the great work that was done by the committee that was established which produced this document. Its members carried out wide-ranging research which was interesting. One often hears people outside the House make a simplistic argument for abolishing the Seanad. The Progressive Democrats wanted to abolish it. I had the experience of being a candidate in the last general election and on being unsuccessful, I traversed the Twenty-six Counties in order to get elected to this House. In the process I met councillors which was an enriching experience. The four Progressive Democrats Senators were appointed directly by the Taoiseach and gladly accepted the nomination. Sometimes it rings hollow when they say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s abolish the Seanad&rdquo;, because they gladly embraced it.</P>
      <P>Senators who get an easy route into this House by way of a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nomination should know the heartache of travelling around the Twenty-six Counties as we all did. When one loses one seat in a general election, it is difficult to pick oneself up and re-motivate oneself and face the country. However, having done so, I found it a worthwhile experience. Councillors are often criticised but we should not forget that they are elected by the people. Their decisions reflect people&rsquo;s thinking. When people talk about the narrow base of the elected representatives who elect Senators to this House, they should be mindful that those councillors were elected by the people.</P>
      <P>Comparisons can be drawn between the workings of this and the other House. Having had the experience of being a Member of the other House for 13 years and witnessing reform of the Seanad, consideration should be given to reform of the D&aacute;il. There is a great deal of rhetoric in the other House, often made up of 20 minute speeches by Members which is not covered by the media and in which nobody appears to be interested. When the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> did an analysis of the other House at the end of the last year, it reported <Col N="563"/>Members who rated number one, two and three in terms of the number of contributions they made rather than the quality of their contributions. While there are only 60 Members of this House, there is a degree of camaraderie among all the Senators which does not exist in the other House. Such camaraderie has probably developed because this House is a smaller unit.</P>
      <P>The composition of people elected from the vocational panels and from the universities has probably enriched the type of debate in this House. When one wishes to raise a pertinent issue, one often finds this House a better vehicle, so to speak, for doing so than the other House. I put that forward as my analysis from the perspective of having been a Member of the other House.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note the submissions and research carried out in respect of other parliaments which operate a bicameral system. In most cases those parliaments were seeking certain reforms. There is probably not a unique model with which we can draw a parallel.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly was correct in pointing out that 11 such reports have been produced and this is the 12th. Based on the recommendations in this report, one would anticipate that some reforms will emanate from it. While such reforms may not be in parallel with what is recommended in the report, we should examine and change the system.</P>
      <P>There is constructive merit in how this House has been used in recent times when MEPs made submissions on their work in the European Parliament. That was a useful exercise, which I do not believe has taken place in the D&aacute;il Chamber. The report embraces that type of exercise which provides for accountability of MEPs through the Seanad. If anything, such submissions in the House enhance the European profile. The ordinary voter views the European Parliament in a detached way and considers that he or she is quite removed from it. Such submissions enhance the credibility of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I would like a change to be made regarding how we deal with business in the Seanad. I would like 20 minutes to be provided so that Ministers can answer questions in the House. If Ministers were to do that, they would be on top of their brief. They would be prepared for any questions they might be asked. Such a facility would be enriching and preferable to a Minister and a Member having prepared speeches. It would enable us to address the serious business at issue and would be almost akin to enabling a cross-examination of Ministers. They might not want that or to be subject to that type of forensic approach, but it would be much more beneficial than what happens at present. It would also be in their interests. If anything, it would mean they would have to research their briefs more comprehensively and be less reliant on civil servants for <Col N="564"/>briefing notes. I put forward that constructive proposal which I believe would help improve the operation of this House.</P>
      <P>Most of the Members present would have been elected from the vocational panels. Those panels were probably drawn up a long time ago and they have served the House well over the passage of time. I do not know how that system could be changed to broaden or reduce it, but such change is merited on the basis of the report and the research into this area.</P>
      <P>There are many good proposals in the report. I compliment the people involved, the leaders of the various parties, the Cathaoirleach and the people involved in producing this document. We have spoken at great length on this issue over a considerable period. I do not have much more to add because most of the other points I might make have already been made.</P>
      <P>There is much merit in the workings of this House. If anything, the Leader has enhanced the respectability of the House. During the time I have been a Member of the House, a number of Bills have come directly to it and then gone to the other House. I have spoken privately to Ministers, who I will not name, but they have often said they would prefer legislation to take this route because the debate in this House has enhanced the legislation and they have picked up various constructive pointers which helped them in the other House. Bringing legislation directly through this House has enhanced its profile. The Leader has timed her entry to the Chamber well and I compliment her. If any criticism is made of the House outside it, she has always tried to portray it in a constructive light. I appreciate that. There are many good points about the House, but like everything else, changes are required. I wish good speed to the implementation of this report. As it is the 12th such report, I hope its recommendations will be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for agreeing to take this matter under Standing Order 30 and I thank the Leader for coming to the House to reply to it. A recent report from the west Tallaght area entitled, How are our kids?, was compiled by the Tallaght Childhood Development Initiative, a group of service providers for children in the west Tallaght area and the Darlington Social Research Institute.</P>
      <P>This is an important report because it deals with the real life experience of children on the ground. This is a community with a population of 21,000. It is larger than Tuam or Ballinasloe, yet if some of the facts known of the children&rsquo;s experience in those towns were heralded as they have been in this report, there would be a national outcry. We are talking about real instances of poverty. In the matter I have brought <Col N="565"/>to the attention of the House, a particular problem highlighted in the research is that 90% of the children have experienced fear or anti-social behaviour with 50% reporting that their families were personally affected by local crime. We have a significant job to do to put to one side the blight of urban poverty in some well-defined communities throughout this city, Cork, Limerick and Galway. We must do everything in our power to put more resources into these communities, particularly to improve policing.</P>
      <P>We need more young police officers from the community and living therein. We need to ensure that the police change their attitude to the community and that the community changes its attitude to the police. The key to tackling problems of anti-social activity and disaffection is a better policing service.</P>
      <P>I hope this report will stimulate a much wider debate at Government level on how children&rsquo;s lives are blighted and affected not just by poverty but also by anti-social activity and the onslaught of crime in some of our urban communities. I hope the report&rsquo;s excellent recommendations will help to inform Government over a myriad of Departments with a view to improving the service of care and delivering a quality police service to these communities, which have such a high preponderance of crime.</P>

    <Title>Report on Seanad Reform: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the House. It is great to see him sitting in that chair. I thank the Leader for continuing the debate on Seanad reform to allow all Members who wish to contribute to do so.</P>
      <P>Page 38 of the report states:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . . it is striking that very few public submissions received by the Sub-Committee called for the abolition of the Seanad. The vast majority wished to see it reformed, to allow it to make a more meaningful contribution to the political process in Ireland.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This sums up the objective of any reform process. Despite the fact that Members have said they hoped this report would not sit on a shelf and gather dust, I believe that if we do not achieve, through reform, the objective of allowing the Seanad make a more meaningful contribution to <Col N="566"/>the political process, we should not do anything until we get it right. We have a great opportunity to consider how we can make the Seanad better.</P>
      <P>I have many views of the possible role of the Seanad which I would like to share with Senators and the Minister of State. First, let me concentrate on the method of election and the number of Senators. I entered this House in 1997 and have enjoyed my time here wholeheartedly. It has afforded me a great insight into the workings of the Irish political system, the workings of the Government and the opportunities that exist to allow ordinary people become involved in the legislative process. However, we could do more. I would like more Senators to be elected. I know the report suggests an increase in the number of Senators but the number should be increased to as much as 70 or 75.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see a reduction in the number of Senators elected by councillors. I do not wish to appear like a turkey not prepared to vote for Christmas but the role of councillors in electing Members to the House is vital and represents a very important power. It makes Senators accountable to members of local authorities and, ultimately, to the people who elected the local authority members.</P>
      <P>When talking about reforming the electoral system we should consider the geographical spread of the constituencies. Perhaps it is not appropriate to have a group of would-be Senators travelling the entire country looking for votes from county and city council members. Perhaps we should consider the European constituency model whereby only councillors from a particular constituency would vote for candidates for that constituency.</P>
      <P>I would also like to see greater formal interaction between councillors who elect Senators and more transparency and accountability. It is not desirable to have a model whereby one Senator would do one thing and another would do another. There should be a clearly defined method of communication between Senators and councillors.</P>
      <P>At a recent seminar in Geneva, the Irish Government reported on the success it had had in the area of equality and on the greater involvement of women in Irish politics. Speaking as a member of a party in Government, I believed the Government was joking when it said the number of female representatives in both the Seanad and D&aacute;il was okay. It is not okay, there are not enough women involved in the political life of Ireland. We need more women involved and the only way we will achieve this is by making a very conscious decision to introduce some sort of positive discrimination. We only need to do so until such time as the playing pitch is levelled. If we do not do so, we will again have a slow decline in the number of women in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</P><Col N="567"/>
      <P>Everybody agrees that we need more women involved at this level and that they have a significant contribution to make. It is important for balance in all our deliberations. We do not have such a balance at present. When considering the reform of the electoral system, let us try to ensure, on a pilot basis, that a designated number of seats &mdash; they can be extra seats if not existing ones from the various panels &mdash; will be safeguarded so we can achieve the objective of having more women involved in the decision-making process at governmental and parliamentary levels, as supported by all political parties.</P>
      <P>We have not yet had the opportunity to hear the Minister of State working on legislation in the House, but I have the greatest respect for the Ministers who come to the House to listen to the points we make which they take them board. Very often the points are made equally as well by the Opposition side as the Government side, yet some Ministers return to their Departments, listen to their officials and do not make any of the recommended changes. We sit and talk for hours, research our business and take on board the points of the groups that have lobbied us and argue those points which we feel are worth arguing. However, certain Ministers do not change anything, although they may take copious notes. How many Ministers, particularly Ministers of State, have been told to come into this House under instruction to &ldquo;take no prisoners&rdquo;? I believe this is the phrase used. This means they will not accept any amendments. They do so because it might upset their schedules when they return to the D&aacute;il given that they may have to complete the business by a certain date. That is one reason people believe the Seanad is ineffectual.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, represents a prime example of what I would like to see happening. When he was in the House dealing with the recent maternity legislation in his former capacity as Minister of State, we put a number of points to him which had previously been ruled out by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and the then Attorney General, who is now the Minister. Our proposal was in respect of the compulsory requirement on women to take four weeks&rsquo; leave before giving birth. The Minister came to this House, listened to the arguments put forward and made the change. He has now created a much better system which reflects what is happening and the way women want maternity leave to be available to them. Expectant mothers no longer have to run around to doctors and employers telling lies about the date their baby is expected because they do not want to take four weeks off before the baby is born. That is an example of a Minister being smart enough to listen and overrule officialdom.</P><Col N="568"/>
      <P>With all due respect to the officials, they have their job to do. However, we are a political grouping, regardless of whether it is a Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il Government, and it is our job to ensure that the legislation reflects the political ethos and policies put to the people during the general election campaign. I would like the Seanad to play a much stronger role. There must be accountability from Ministers who must give clear reasons for not accepting amendments. Some of the suggestions about question and answer sessions and so on would make the Seanad more relevant and give Senators much more influence.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>An interesting aspect of the report is the recommendation that the Leader of the Seanad should have the right to attend Cabinet meetings. This is salient from the point of view of the influence of the Seanad. If the Leader of the Seanad is allowed to sit at the Cabinet table, he or she should have the same rights as all the other members, not a glorified right to attend without the right to vote. The Constitution states that the Taoiseach can nominate a senior Cabinet Minister from the Seanad. This should be a Cabinet position with all the attendant rights, which would give the Seanad influence. The current Leader issued the proviso that she was not interested in this aspect. This was smart of her because it is not about self-promotion, it is about promoting the Seanad and its influence.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>On the interaction between Members of this House, their constituents and councillors, what I find very lacking in the Seanad is the dearth of continuing professional development available to Members of the Houses. We should force people, as happens in many jobs, to undergo some sort of continuing professional development. We benefit from the best advice through the reports that arrive in our office on a daily basis. We have a responsibility to our constituents and the country to do our job as well as we possibly can. There should be a formalised opportunity to do so, because some people are better than others in this regard. There should be a requirement for continuing professional development, as happens in accountancy bodies or HR bodies. Any professional organisation has this need. This could be introduced into the Seanad as a test scenario. If it works and makes us all better, that is great, and, if not, we can review it. As was said earlier, some of the reforms made here may be replicated in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</P>
      <P>On the point made about legislation being brought to the Seanad first, I have taken part in many debates which began in the Seanad. Ministers will accept that the level of debate in this House is far removed from the argy bargy that takes place in the D&aacute;il Chamber. It allows them to deal with the points made, consider them after Second Stage, prepare for the D&aacute;il debate and <Col N="569"/>come back to us with changes on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The maternity legislation, parental leave legislation and copyright legislation, to name but three, were all initiated in this House. All the legislation was changed significantly between Second Stage and later Stages. The Seanad has a worthwhile contribution to make. However, the challenge is to make it even more worthwhile. There should be greater accountability to our constituents and greater accountability from the Ministers&rsquo; point of view when dealing with legislation here. We are not a rubber-stamping House. We need to stand up for ourselves more and say we will not rubber stamp legislation. If the legislation is wrong and deserves to be stopped, then that is what should happen.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for listening to all the points that were raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before calling on the Minister of State, I would like to congratulate him on his appointment. Someone expressed delight to see him in that chair. He was in another seat here on one occasion. I was in another seat on that occasion too but we are in different seats now. As my colleague from west Limerick, Senator Finucane, said, the Minister of State&rsquo;s appointment is most deserved and I wish him every success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very pleasant to be back in this House. I enjoyed my stint in the Seanad from 1989 to 1992 and I look forward to the interaction we will have in the Chamber in the future. I commend you, a Chathaoirligh, on the even-handed and progressive way in which you direct the proceedings of this House.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to my predecessor and Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. He said at the beginning of the debate on Seanad reform in June last that the Government&rsquo;s objective is to listen to the views of Members of the House on the many issues dealt with in the sub-committee&rsquo;s excellent report. Now that we have reached the conclusion of the debate on Seanad reform, I want to thank the Members of the House for giving me and my ministerial colleagues, who listened attentively to Senators&rsquo; comments in June and September, an opportunity to hear their many varied views at first hand.</P>
      <P>The whole question of Seanad reform is a core element in the wider debate on democracy and the political process in Ireland as we chart our course for the 21st century. The approach of Senators in evaluating the role of the Seanad, advocating and embracing reform and developing new roles for this House, while at the same time maintaining its integral character and status as part of our modern democracy, is to be com<Col N="570"/>mended. The Government welcomes all the contributions from across the House, which reflect the wide range of issues to be addressed. Senators can be assured that their views are the key to the future of the reform process.</P>
      <P>Senators may be aware that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, will be chairman of the cross-party parliamentary group to be established imminently. Its aim is to advance, with consensus, the recommendations of the sub-committee report. The Minister intends to proceed immediately with the establishment of the group and will arrange, in consultation with the eminent Leader of this House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, to keep the Seanad informed along the way.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by thanking the Cathaoirleach and Senators for their warm welcome, very kind words and good wishes to me as a new Minister in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, for his attendance. This is an issue which will concern him as he too comes from west Limerick.</P>
      <P>The industry in Castlemahon and Kantoher, now Kerry Foods, is involved in the production of chickens. It is synonymous with the west Limerick area where it continues to provide valuable employment. We want this industry to thrive into the future.</P>
      <P>There is concern regarding the supply of broiler chickens to the processing unit. There was a peaceful picket outside the gates last week by concerned people involved in poultry production in the area. Several councillors and Oireachtas representatives were also there in a show of solidarity with the current plight of the industry.</P>
      <P>Those involved have formed the West Limerick Co-op Poultry Producers Association Limited, which has approximately 28 members. In most cases, they have stopped supplying the factory unit, which is a matter of concern. The producers have not done this lightly; they felt pressurised into it.</P>
      <P>The nub of the matter is the importance of getting a viable price for broiler chickens. Currently, they receive 30.85 cent from Castlemahon Poultry Products Limited. The cost of catching and transporting the chickens is factored into this amount, <Col N="571"/>together with feed costs. However, the 30.85 cent does not yield any significant profit. If it did, there would be no protest. There are also variable costs, which include electricity, gas heating, bedding, cleaning, maintenance repairs and medication. Taking these into account, the producers estimate the profit margin is approximately 5 cent. This is uneconomic if a producer is making repayments on a poultry unit. It is out of sheer frustration that many of them find themselves in this situation. A big part of the problem is that management will not talk to them as a unit in order to discuss their difficulties.</P>
      <P>The risk factor involved in poultry production is never quantified or factored into the profit margin. It is a 24-hour labour unit, because the producer must be available at all times. In many cases it is a family enterprise, either in its own right or to compensate for or supplement another farm income.</P>
      <P>There are many vital components in poultry production. Poultry units must conform to a high standard and are subject to quality audits by the multiples they supply. Everything is known about their product with regard to its quality. Questions have been raised in the House and in the media with regard to where some of the chickens come from. Sometimes questions are asked about chickens coming from Thailand, China, Brazil and other countries. The consumer has a right to know the country of origin. However, in this instance Irish chickens are produced.</P>
      <P>This is probably a delicate matter for the Minister of State. Hopefully, Department personnel can talk to the manufacturing unit involved and see whether discussions can take place with regard to re-establishing supply to the poultry processing unit. It is in the interests of Castlemahon Poultry Products Limited to use these suppliers. Over a period of time, it will obviously affect their production ability.</P>
      <P>On the one hand it is a delicate situation for us as politicians, because we want a resolution to this issue and want to ensure that valuable employment continues. However, we also want to ensure these people operate a viable unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, I thank Senator Finucane for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The dispute between Castlemahon Food Products Limited and some of its poultry suppliers concerns the price paid by the company to the growers of the birds. The practice in the poultry industry is that the processor supplies day-old chicks and feed to the producer and also covers certain other costs. The producer provides the labour and other overheads, such as electricity. A <Col N="572"/>price per bird is paid to the producer and this can of course vary from processor to processor.</P>
      <P>In the Castlemahon case, the producers involved in the protest are claiming the price being paid by the company is insufficient to cover their costs and are seeking an increase. The price paid for finished broilers is a commercial matter for negotiation and agreement between producers and processors. There is no question of involvement by the Department of Agriculture and Food or European Union institutions in the fixing of these prices, as there is a free market in the sale of poultry.</P>
      <P>The picketing of the plant has ceased, which is a welcome development. The Minister urges both sides to again consider all the issues surrounding this dispute and to work towards a resolution that is satisfactory to those concerned.</P>
      <P>Interruptions to the supply chain, and any form of disruption of the smooth operation of a business, do not serve the sector well. This is particularly true for poultry, where there is an elaborate network of breeding farms, hatcheries, rearing farms and processors involved in the finished product. A dispute anywhere along the supply chain can have widespread repercussions. It is vital to such an industry that the integrated nature of the producer-processor relationship is recognised as being of fundamental importance to the future success of the industry. It is important that margins be available for all parts of the industry, both at production and processing level, and that quality of product be encouraged and rewarded.</P>
      <P>Castlemahon is a major poultry processor. It is vital to the west Limerick economy and the rural economy, both in terms of the considerable level of employment at the processing plant and the contribution to the incomes of poultry growers in the area. There is also a strong cross-Border dimension to the Castlemahon corporate structure and business operations, which is very welcome.</P>
      <P>While the issues between Castlemahon management and their producers are matters that relate to the commercial operations of the company, it is in the interest of all concerned to ensure there is no resultant disruption to the level of poultry supplies in the country as a whole. The Minister is concerned that any lost market share may fall into the hands of importers and risk a more permanent loss to the indigenous industry.</P>
      <P>The poultry and egg sector is an important part of the overall agrifood industry. The sector has a farm gate value of &euro;150 million and provides valuable employment throughout the country, supplying quality products to the domestic and export markets.</P>
      <P>Last year 66 million chickens and 10 million birds of other species were slaughtered in Ireland, maintaining a high level continuity of production in the face of increased competition from <Col N="573"/>imported products. Despite increased import penetration, the poultry sector is a net exporter. Taking into account the valuable processed products sector, the poultry sector out-performed imports by 22,000 tonnes last year and contributed some &euro;244 million to our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>Increasingly the industry here, in common with other sectors, must continually face up to the pressures of severe price competition to lower cost producers from abroad. This is a fact of international trade. Its implications are felt right across the chain, where costs of production are constantly scrutinised and must be kept tightly under control.</P>
      <P>Higher costs of feed, compliance costs associated with welfare and environmental legislation, economies at slaughter level and downward price pressure from the retail sector are major factors impacting on the poultry industry. While the retail sector is dominated by Irish-produced poultry, all other aspects of the business at catering and wholesale levels are mostly supplied by imported product. There is strong competition right across the EU and in other countries at this level of trade and Irish processors have performed extremely well in maintaining their strong share of the domestic retail market while these competitive pressures grow.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food will urge both sides to consider again how they might find a compromise that will continue to bring economic benefits to the entire poultry chain and, in so doing, demonstrate the industry&rsquo;s capacity to respond effectively to the wider competitive challenges in the market.</P>

    <Title>Disabled Person&rsquo;s Grant Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, for his attendance.</P>
      <P>The disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme has been successful over the years and particularly helpful to some of the most vulnerable in society. Like all schemes, however, there comes a time for <Col N="574"/>review and that time has arrived. There should be less bureaucracy in the operation of the scheme and more funding is required. I have encountered cases in both Waterford County Council and Waterford City Council where bureaucracy is being used to drag out the process until more funding becomes available the following year. I would welcome if additional funding were afforded to the many worthy projects in operation.</P>
      <P>One of the more extreme cases of excessive bureaucracy I encountered was the situation of an 80 year old woman who applied to have certain changes made to her home. These changes were eventually carried out when she was 90 and she died a few weeks later before she could attain any benefit from them. This is an extreme case but these types of situations are occurring in the system.</P>
      <P>An occupational therapist&rsquo;s report is sometimes impossible to get. In Waterford, for example, the South Eastern Health Board is no longer providing this service. I learned recently of a case where a person went to a private occupational therapist but the latter was unable to do the work. This person cannot proceed because of costs. There is a problem with builders because they are not prepared to quote for minor jobs. The onus in on the applicant to obtain quotes from builders and submit them to the local authority but, in many cases, they are unable to do so.</P>
      <P>It is the elderly who have no contact with family, in particular, who suffer most because they generally do not know how to set about getting quotes from builders and drawing up designs. It is also difficult for people on low incomes and perhaps there is a case in certain areas for the introduction of a means test whereby those who cannot afford to pay the 10% contribution would be exempt. I do not advocate that applicants should either qualify or not qualify for the additional 10% but it should be tapered according to means. I understand some local authorities are already applying a means test to this scheme. People who have the means and the wherewithal know how to source architects and builders and so on. We must focus on helping the more vulnerable.</P>
      <P>Under the operation of the scheme, the medical officer initially visits applicants and produces a report. An occupational therapist then visits, if one can be found, and, upon his or her approval, the applicant is told to produce drawings. Planning permission may occasionally be needed. Once the applicant has obtained quotations, the application is sent back to the local authority where the architect or equivalent will ascertain whether the prices are right. The work is then carried out and inspected and, upon approval, the money is finally paid out. This constitutes a significant layer of bureaucracy which is holding up the entire process.</P><Col N="575"/>
      <P>A different system must be devised and I hope the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can bring about an improvement. We should set down specific standards with regard to the requirements for varying degrees of disability. A general practitioner or medical officer might be able to do the work of the occupational therapist if such standards were set down. Perhaps a technician might be designated in each local authority to do the drawings. Such people would gain expertise over time because much of the work will be repetitive. This would help to reduce costs significantly and resources could be directed to areas where they are most needed. Perhaps a builder or panel of builders could also be appointed by local authorities to reduce costs in a similar manner. These are only suggestions and there may be a better way to improve the operation of the scheme. I ask the Minister of State to consider how best the changes can be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kenneally for the opportunity to speak about the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme. A review of the scheme is being finalised in the Department. On its completion, it will be possible to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme to ensure the funding available is directed at those in greatest need of such assistance. This is the fundamental objective of the scheme. The Government is aware of the importance of this grant in helping to meet the accommodation needs of disabled persons. As a consequence of significant improvements to the scheme in recent years, there has been a major increase in demand for assistance. Some &euro;65 million was allocated under the scheme at the beginning of the year and more recent allocations have brought the figure to &euro;71 million for the current year.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues Senator Kenneally mentioned are part of the review, although matters such as bureaucracy are not. The Department operates the overall legal framework and I do not envisage the involvement of the local authorities in providing, for example, drawings or builders. If they wanted to do so informally, such action would operate at local level without departmental involvement.</P>
      <P>The Department is concerned with those most in need, means testing, needs testing and so on. Some local authorities get over the problem of the lack of availability of occupational therapists. In many cases, it is the local authority which sets down the rule that an occupational therapist is required. Some local authorities hire an occupational therapist for a day or two a week and <Col N="576"/>manage to avoid the delays associated with the health boards.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant was doubled from &euro;10,158 in 1997 to &euro;20,320 now and there has been a significant increase in the number of applications. The recoupment rate from the Department to local authorities in respect of grants paid has increased from 50% to two thirds. The value of grants allocated and the increased number of recipients are an indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that the operation of the scheme at local level is the responsibility of the local authority and I have no direct control in the matter. Authorities operate within the framework laid down in statutory regulations as devised by the Department. This is designed as far as is practicable to give authorities an appropriate degree of flexibility in administering the scheme. It is for them to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their areas from within the combination allocation for the disabled person&rsquo;s extension grant scheme and the essential repair grant scheme. It is the local authority which decides the division of resources between these two schemes. My Department&rsquo;s involvement in the scheme relates to the recoupment to authorities of two thirds of the expenditure. The balance of one third of the cost is funded from the authorities&rsquo; own resources, for which they must provide in their annual estimates. This balance will be maintained. In some cases we might like to give a higher than 90% grant, but there are equally a number of cases where people have substantial means and do not need a 90% grant. Needs testing, based on medical and income needs, is required.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned resources, which are important. We allocated approximately &euro;65 million to the scheme at the beginning of this year. Many local authorities have sought extra resources and in recent weeks we have allocated just under &euro;6 million extra funding. If the Senator&rsquo;s local authority has a problem or wants more resources, it should send in a formal request. I will consider that favourably.</P>
      <P>The amount allocated to the scheme, &euro;65 million, is up approximately &euro;10 million on last year. During the year we allocated a further &euro;6 million, bringing the total to &euro;71 million. In September we wrote to the local authorities and asked them how matters stood and whether they needed extra money. It was at that stage that we allocated the further &euro;6 million. Some authorities said they did not need more. However, Members come to me and tell me their constituents cannot get their applications or grants processed in those same areas. Much depends on the priority given to projects by individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council, which was recently allocated over &euro;7 million, did not reply in September <Col N="577"/>when asked whether further funds were required. Now, late in the year, that council has told us that it does not require more money. Not alone does it not want more, it cannot spend what it was given. It was allocated &euro;7.3 million for its three administrative areas, but of that it will not spend more than &euro;3 million. This is appalling. The council should have told us this earlier. We want to know what resources are available and whether the resources committed are being spent. On the one hand we have Members saying their local authorities could do with extra resources and, on the other, I find out at the end of October that a Cork authority with an allocation of &euro;7.3 million thinks it will not even spend &euro;3 million of that. However, we still get representations from people saying they cannot get a disabled person&rsquo;s grant allocation.</P>
      <P>Waterford received an extra allocation in early September. However, if it wants more, I will consider that request favourably. A fundamental part of the scheme is that local authorities must provide for a third of the grant in their estimates. Some local authorities have made changes and prioritised this.</P>
      <P>Some of the items mentioned by the Senator will be considered in the review. Some local authorities use the requirement of an occupational therapist report to drag out the application process. This does not have to be the case. There are ways of fast-tracking the process where this report is required. Fundamentally, these grants are for work on private houses and the people involved would be in touch with the district nurse or health board agency. Therefore, there should be a system in place which will provide them with help.</P>
      <P>There is also a direct health board scheme, housing aid for the elderly, to which we allocated over &euro;4 million extra this week. The Senator&rsquo;s health board got approximately &euro;500,000 of that figure. Money is available for this work to be done. I wish local authorities could cut out the bureaucracy, streamline the process and get the work done. They also need to become more efficient. They need to inform people early in the year that their applications have been approved and they can get on with the work. There is no point in writing to people early in November telling them to go ahead with an extension because they will not get it done in the time. However, as I already mentioned, extra resources have been provided.</P>
      <P>The review will touch on some of the items mentioned by the Senator. We are trying to get best value for the funds available. We also want standardised costings as we have found that not alone do we get different prices from different builders, but we get different prices from different counties for standard products. Bureaucracy should be cut from the process. It is up to each local authority to provide one third of the money. <Col N="578"/>However, if the Senator&rsquo;s county wants extra funds, that can be considered.</P>
      <P>It is annoying that local authorities such as Cork, to which moneys were allocated early in the year, do not inform the Department that they cannot use half of it. This does not make sense.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I also thank the Cathaoirleach for accepting this matter on the Adjournment today.</P>
      <P>I have outlined the need for the Minister for Education and Science to report on the progress to date on the extension at Scoil Mhuire, Convent of Mercy, Strokestown, County Roscommon. When I was invited to visit this school I was taken aback by the standard of accommodation and the problems in the school. There is a lack of sports facilities and students must tog out in dressing rooms that are only containers. Staff have their offices and must meet in what were once corridors. The only way I can describe the science rooms is to say they are not state-of-the-art.</P>
      <P>As chairperson of Roscommon VEC over two years ago, I oversaw the development of a new school in my home town of Boyle. Once decent facilities were provided in that school, the confidence of the pupils, teachers and parents was transformed. The Convent of Mercy school in Strokestown has over 420 students. While the quality and level of expertise of the teachers and the attitude of parents and students are excellent, they are working in a difficult situation and with facilities that are far from ideal.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Education and Science the necessity to have this school extension fast-tracked so that the students can compete at the highest level and have facilities of which they can be proud and which they deserve. Strokestown has a large catchment area. The school results are a credit to it and it deserves to have the same facilities as are available in other schools.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State will bring this matter to the attention of the relevant Department and I thank him for his attendance here.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to outline the proposals of the Department of Education and Science regarding the proposed extension project at Scoil Mhuire, Convent of Mercy, Strokestown, County Roscommon. The Department received an application from the school authorities for the provision of an extension to the existing building at Scoil Mhuire. The proposed extension project for the school is at the early stages of architectural planning and has been assigned a band 2 rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising projects.</P><Col N="579"/>
      <P>When publishing the 2004 schools building programme, the Department outlined that its strategy going forward will be grounded in capital investment based on multi-annual allocations. Officials from the planning and building section of the Department are also reviewing all projects that were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme, including the project at Scoil Mhuire, with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual programme from 2005. The Department <Col N="580"/>expects to make a further announcement in this regard later in the year.</P>
      <P>I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s comments to the Minister for Education and Science. It very much depends on the allocation in the Estimates, which will issue in the second or third week of November. Within a few weeks of their publication, the Department will roll out its proposals for next year.</P>
