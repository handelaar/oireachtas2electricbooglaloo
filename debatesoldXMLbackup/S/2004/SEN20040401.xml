	<P>I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on the position regarding the planned secondary school for Adamstown, County Dublin.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to explain the reason St. Mel&rsquo;s training centre, Longford, has experienced drastic funding cuts in the past 12 months; and the steps that can be taken to restore their numbers and to keep this valuable scheme going.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the high level of alcohol consumption by young people, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 12.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons at 15 minutes and other Senators ten minutes, and Members may share time. The Minister will be called upon to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 2, Private Security Services Bill 2001 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 1 or at 12.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 2 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We agree with today&rsquo;s Order of Business. Is the Leader aware of a report from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, which made two clear recommendations in 2001 concerning the timing of a referendum? <Col N="98"/>The first recommendation was that every Deputy and Senator should be entitled to speak without a guillotine on any constitutional change that comes from Government to the Houses. The second recommendation was that a minimum of 30 days, but preferably 90 days, should occur after the passage of the Bill so the people can debate the matter in a national campaign.</P>
    <P>Neither of these conditions will be met if the Government continues to pursue its plans for a constitutional referendum limiting the rights of citizenship on 11 June. What is the latest Government position on this matter? Will legislation come before the House on this issue shortly? Does the Leader agree the case has not been made for constitutional change in respect of limiting citizenship rights of non-nationals or anybody else?</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>The notion that a constitutional provision as immense as this could arise from such flimsy <Miles com="ch"/>evidence as that obtained at a meeting between a Minister 18 months ago and four masters of the Dublin maternity hospitals, or from unsubstantiated figures concerning the number of non-national births in those hospitals, is not the way to do business. Does the Leader agree the way to approach this matter is through the establishment of an independent commission which would examine the issue of citizenship on an all-party basis and produce proposals in Green and White Papers which could be debated nationally in a calm and reasoned fashion as opposed to the type of rushed approach being put in place by the Government? This House has a role to play as a House with a long tradition of standing up for the rights of all citizens and all people who come to this country. Will the Leader make a statement on the Government&rsquo;s intentions on this matter?</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>I congratulate the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on yesterday&rsquo;s report on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Senator Jim Walsh was a member of the committee. The report is an example of how the committee structure in this House can deal with complex matters and complete its job in a tight timeframe. The committee deserves credit and praise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Hayes on both matters. On the matter of the constitutional amendment, the Government side of the House has indicated strongly that it does not think the referendum should be held on the same day as the European and local elections, which is right.</P>
    <P>Members of a group of people in the House yesterday handed me a document which indicated that the most courageous and most difficult decision they ever took was to come to this country. They did not come in any mean-spirited way nor did they intend to use the fact of birth in order to gain citizenship. We need to examine this issue.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the Senator on the matter of the report on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. It is an appalling vista. However, unlike that old <Col N="99"/>nincompoop, Lord Denning, I believe appalling vistas must be faced. They must be examined and brushing issues under the bed is of no use and only makes the matter worse.</P>
    <P>An Taisce has been repeatedly attacked in this House and I have been a lone voice in its support. It has been accused by various Ministers and people on the Government side of the House of doing nothing about Powerscourt among other issues. That accusation was answered by the former president of An Taisce, Michael Smith. He indicated that An Taisce had been under attack over this matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, asked why it did not appeal. The answer is perfectly clear; An Taisce in Wicklow was taken over in a kind of coup by various business interests, many of them with connections to Fianna F&aacute;il, including a gentleman who was convicted subsequently of illegal dumping.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on An Taisce during the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something we need to take into account. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, attacked An Taisce because it did not give membership to five applicants in the west who all had links with one-off holiday home developments. I should correct what I said earlier. It was one of those individuals who had a conviction for illegal dumping. It is absolutely absurd to attack a group which subsequently successfully opposed the development in Powerscourt because it had become dormant due to the take-over by people who support Fianna F&aacute;il. I say this because An Taisce was recently named and attacked.</P>
    <P>I call for a debate on hospitals on foot of a letter I received from a gentleman whose aged aunt was kept in an accident and emergency unit for several days in a situation where there were drunks and drug addicts. Although we previously debated the issue, Members on all sides would welcome a further debate. I am not attacking the Government on this but we all feel this is an unsatisfactory situation. I respect the Minister for Health and Children but we have to address this matter.</P>
    <P>I was also informed of an 80 year old man who sat on a chair in the corridor for five days. He had to shave and so on in full public view. An elderly couple, one of whom was on a drip, were also seated on plastic chairs. This increases my fears about the closure of the TB facility at Peamount Hospital. There is talk of transferring this service to accident and emergency units. That is a guaranteed recipe for spreading this disease, of which there are now drug-resistant strains. It is a highly dangerous proposal.</P>
    <P>I am the only one here from my group so perhaps the Cathaoirleach will indulge me a little.</P>

	<P>I am very generous to the Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that early in the new session we would debate the motion in my name on Tibet because of the increasing closeness to Tibet and the unjustified and illegal change of policy. On 29 March, the Chinese authorities arrested three relatives of those killed in Tiananmen Square. We should take care, particularly as we hold the Presidency of the EU, to prevent France and Germany having the arms embargo lifted because it was related to human rights.</P>
    <P>A most interesting statement from the Chinese representative at the United Nations human rights conference reads: &ldquo;The realization of the right to national self-determination is the basis and pre-requisite for the enjoyment of other human rights and fundamental freedoms.&rdquo; The statement was made by Qi Xiaoxia, alternate representative of the Chinese delegation. I apologise for my Chinese pronunciation. No doubt that mandarin of the Civil Service, Senator &ldquo;Qi Xiao&rdquo; Mansergh would be better able to pronounce it. She also stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">The bullying of the weak by the strong and interference in the internal affairs of other countries is a gross violation of the right of other peoples to national self-determination.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Hear, hear. Let them leave Tibet. Finally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the metro.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has elaborated sufficiently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the metro in light of the leaked report from O&rsquo;Reilly Consultants which comes out four square in favour of a metro. The debate on a metro began in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not stretch the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s patience. I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on the referendum. I also seek clarification from the Government, through the Leader, as to what its intention is in the matter. We should know from the history of the past 20 years that changing the Constitution requires the most careful consideration.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>A great deal of thought should be put into it. We should also be aware that using the Constitution for political purposes is a recipe for disaster.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>There can be no question of holding a referendum on 11 June and it is <Col N="101"/>absolutely essential that the Government states this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I add my voice of thanks and congratulations to the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for its sterling work on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings issue. I ask the Leader to suggest that the relevant Minister would address us about the merits of holding a public inquiry. If one is to be held, it needs to be effective. It is also important that it would have the support of the families of victims.</P>
    <P>Anybody who saw the photographs or television coverage of yesterday&rsquo;s events in Faluja in Iraq would be greatly concerned about the utter chaos that is evident there and the total breakdown of law and order.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to be concerned about that. To some extent we feel helpless and hopeless in terms of dealing with this matter. However, as a sovereign State and member of the European Union, particularly in our Presidency role and against the background of the proposed visit by President Bush in the coming months, we must be cognisant of what is happening there.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Ryan, asked the Leader yesterday to ask the Department of Finance why it was necessary for 20 staff to be here for the Finance Bill. If she has a reply, I would like to hear it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with previous speakers in congratulating the sub-committee on its report on the Barron inquiry. It proved that committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas could work effectively and produce a detailed report in a short timeframe.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly refer to the situation in Iraq and the horrific images we saw on television last evening. We have called for an ongoing debate on this situation. I ask the Leader to facilitate such a debate in the near future. When we are selective in the House about reporting on certain events in Iraq, it would be remiss of us not to highlight the barbaric images we saw last evening. We saw four civilians whose bodies were shot, burned, mutilated and hung from a bridge minus their arms and legs. The head of one body had been removed. That is not the behaviour of any civilised people. Even in war there is respect for the dead. It does not do any good to the human race when we see people behaving in such a manner. It would be remiss of the House not to refer to those events.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to the House for a debate on the directive and guidelines issued to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on the sale of properties by its elected board. It is important that we are given an update on the conditions for tendering and the criteria used in the evaluation of tenders. We need to examine whether tenders have been properly advertised to the public and whether valuations were sought on those properties. These are issues of great concern to the public in light of the sale to the third highest bidder of some properties in the west. It is important that we have a serious debate and bring about transparency in this area.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, explains to the House how prepared we are for a terrorist attack, a major emergency or catastrophe. There is much public concern that we are ill-prepared for such an attack. It is the Government&rsquo;s duty and responsibility to show what measures are in place in the event of a catastrophe.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to say in defence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; I know this from my Qi Xiao days &mdash; that the proposal for a referendum covers concerns that have existed for a number of years and was not provoked by a meeting of the masters of hospitals. However, I support the view that the issue should be thoroughly discussed in this House and in the country before the referendum is held. I support what Senators said and second the compliments paid to the committee looking into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. There should be a debate on the report in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point made yesterday, and without pre-empting the events of the day, I express my gratitude for the work of the Labour Relations Commission, which indicates the importance of the industrial dispute machinery. It has been strengthened in recent years by being embedded in social partnership.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Last weekend we were treated to the Progressive Democrats annual conference, which I did not see.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Political conferences cannot be discussed on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Apparently there was an announcement about selling off land around psychiatric hospitals. Perhaps the Leader will arrange for a debate on the matter. Almost every county has a psychiatric hospital. While there is some merit in the proposal, there is grave difficulty with it. If it is a Government proposal, there should be a debate on it because it will affect almost every county. Many psychiatric hospitals are fantastic historical buildings and I do not believe they would facilitate development. St. Dymphna&rsquo;s Hospital, Carlow, is a magnificent building and I would not like to see the land around it being developed. I am aware that other counties might lend themselves to the proposal. The Leader might organise a debate on the issue if it is Government policy.</P>
    <P>A success of the last Government was the levy on plastic bags and another issue which could be looked at is that of chewing gum. Technology now exists to make chewing gum less sticky. There is a huge amount of chewing gum on footpaths. The Presentation College in Carlow did a young scientist experiment recently. The students studied one square metre of footpath and the amount of chewing gum found was amazing. Many pavements in towns throughout the country are now in the form of a slab on sand which is no longer concreted in and modern machinery cannot be used on them because it would pull up the pavement. During our Presidency of the EU, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should use his role, following his predecessor&rsquo;s example, and put pressure on chewing gum companies to make it less sticky. This would save local authorities thousands of pounds each year which could be put to good use by helping to clean up towns even further.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>It is timely to have an update on the broadband issue. I ask for a debate on the matter because the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources last week launched its report on broadband. One section of the report deals with future proofing of broadband. It states that when infrastructural projects are going ahead the ducting and casing should be put in. It has come to my notice that in the current construction of an enormous ring road in Waterford ducting for broadband is not being put down. This means that in a year or two the road will be dug up to put down ducting and casing. I am not referring to just that road, but to other projects throughout the country. This work should be carried out when roads are being constructed. The Department has not yet <Col N="104"/>provided funding in this instance. The Minister should come to this House to debate the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is great concern in Kenmare that it may lose or have its ambulance service amalgamated with another area. The area is remote in that it covers stretches from near Coolea on the Cork border, to Ardgroom in the Beara peninsula and as far as Castlecove on the Iveragh peninsula.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter would be suitable for an Adjournment debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Chathaoirligh, you can read my mind, because I have already asked for an Adjournment debate on the matter. The area is mountainous, remote and the roads are poor. We all know the importance of getting to a patient within the first hour. I would like the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to debate the issue.</P>
    <P>Recently there were banner newspaper headlines in Kerry about a case involving an alleged theft of &euro;80 worth of clothing which will cost taxpayers &euro;10,000. This is ridiculous and a more efficient way must be found to deal with such issues. This was the subject of much comment, including an editorial in <i>The Kerryman</i>. The Leader said she will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to this House on more general items.</P>

	<P>It is fine for Carmel Foley to go on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to explain the good work of her organisation, but she is a toothless tiger as she can do nothing about the issue. What is the point in exposing this rip-off and naming and shaming people when she cannot impose a maximum price order on a pint? Prices ranged from &euro;4.95 to &euro;3.25.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is whether we should introduce a maximum price order and what action should be taken in regard to soaring prices. The exploitation of customers which took place during the rugby international is quite evident. I ask the Leader to provide an opportunity for the Government to ensure the matter gets a further airing in this House. This House has provided more opportunities for debates on consumer affairs issues than the Lower House. I commend the Leader of the House for providing time for these debates. However, I would like to see more action in regard to Ms Foley. I commend her for taking on my good example.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to the House in view of the fact that during the week Teagasc, at its seminar in the midlands on rural development and rural decline, indicated the serious situation in regard to agriculture and the declining income from agriculture. In the 1990s, 14% of the population was solely dependent on an income from agriculture. This has fallen to just 5% since 2002. The Minister is responsible for rural development but he has done nothing other than administer slush funds in his own constituency. He has failed to indicate any policy to stem the flow out of agriculture. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to outline his policy on support for rural populations and agriculture before it is too late. In County Galway, the pilot study area, there was a serious decline in population and we must tackle this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the call for a debate on rural development. Major rationalisation is going on in the agriculture sector and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has established good programmes, such as <Col N="106"/>CL&Aacute;R and RAPID, and he is engaged with those programmes to address the problems we now see. He has visited the south east and many organisations there welcome his input in the area.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the NRA roads programme under the national development plan? The south east and parts of the midlands are now the most disadvantaged areas in the State and the roads into those regions are poor. There must be an injection of funding because when the second river crossing in Waterford is completed there will be a major bottleneck on the N25 at New Ross and currently there are delays of up to 45 minutes. There is a need for funding in those areas. The south east was not named by the Minister as a priority area and it is up to those of us from there to make the argument and ensure we are not left further behind.</P><Miles com="cl" par="115"/>
    <P>I support Senators Mansergh and O&rsquo;Meara in their call for a debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights Sub-Committee on the Barron Report. The sub-committee gave comprehensive consideration to the issue and its report should be debated. The Dublin and Monaghan bombings were the most serious atrocity in the history of the State and it is interesting the report should issue the day prior to an announcement by the British Government of public inquiries into at least three of the four cases in Northern Ireland &mdash; the murders of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson, Robert Hamill and Billy Wright. We should support the calls the committee has made so the families of the many victims of the worst atrocity on this island during the conflict can find some closure.</P>

   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to come before the House. Every time he has been here, he has been anxious to engage in debate on rural issues and that is why many of those issues are now centre stage. Many aspects must be discussed, particularly the interaction of the agencies on the ground. People who want to have their livelihoods in rural areas must have the opportunity to stay there. CL&Aacute;R has proved itself worthwhile because it reaches areas where there are difficulties. I am sure the Minister would like to bring us up to date on progress in those areas and a debate would also give us the opportunity to make an input.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come into the House as we approach the end of the two month period for submissions on the new guidelines on rural housing. An excellent debate has taken place with many submissions. There is an opportunity for us, without having to make direct submissions, which would not be correct, to respond to the guidelines and reflect on what we heard about <Col N="107"/>them. It was a courageous step by the Minister to bring those guidelines forward. There is a partnership involved because even when the guidelines are implemented we must interact with local authorities and planners. It would be worth our while to discuss the structures involved.</P>
    <P>There has not been any blanket criticism of An Taisce. People are entitled to comment on specific issues and if other people feel they are above criticism, particularly when they have statutory standing, they are acting in an undemocratic manner.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Unbalanced blanket criticism came from the Senator&rsquo;s side of the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which advised that if there was to be a referendum, all Deputies and Senators should have the opportunity to speak if they so wished and that there should be 30 days&rsquo; prior notice, and asked about the position of the referendum. No Government decision on the date for a referendum has been made. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform favours holding it on the same day as the European and local elections but many of us, including myself, think this would be a bad idea. It would not be the correct way to go about it. That is, however, a personal opinion and not that of Fianna F&aacute;il, which is yet to take a position. Senator Brian Hayes stated there should be a Green Paper and a White Paper and said this House has a role to play. I fully agree that the Seanad has a role to play in such an important issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also mentioned the referendum and then raised the issue of An Taisce, saying there had been a coup in the body. Coups are regular events in political and social groups and there is nothing remarkable about them. Anyone has the right to assume a position and make a criticism.</P>

	<P>Anyone has the right to defend a body as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator also raised the situation in accident and emergency departments and the cases of elderly people who had to wait a long time to be admitted, coupling that with the closure of some of the facilities in Peamount Hospital. As soon as the Minister for Health and Children has time, we will request that he attends a general debate in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris has also been asking for some time for a debate on Tibet and the motion on the Order Paper is in his name. I will be happy to arrange such a debate as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara warned against using the Constitution for political purposes in any <Col N="108"/>referendum and congratulated the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights Sub-Committee on the Barron Report. On behalf of all Members, I congratulate the one member of the sub-committee from this House, Senator Jim Walsh. I know from speaking to the Whip and to the Senator that the sub-committee did a huge amount of work over very long hours. The committee must have had a heavy workload. It involved listening to people telling their stories and working through the ramifications of all that. I am not making a party political point in saying we were well served in the Seanad by the Member who served on the committee.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara also raised the terrible and graphic events of what happened in Iraq. It reminded me in a macro way of the <i>Lord of the Flies </i>in the way that the people relished what they were doing. It was terrible. One wonders if invasion is ever worth it when that is the outcome. Senator Minihan also raised the matter of the horrific images from Iraq of the four civilians in particular and what was done to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon wants the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to come into the House to talk about the property sale of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. He also wants the Minister for Defence to come to the House to talk about our level of preparedness in the event of a terrorist attack.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh called for a debate on the report of the Sub-Committee of the on the Barron Report. He also called for a debate on the proposed referendum, a matter on which we need debate.</P>
    <P>It was good to hear on the news this morning that the Labour Relations Commission is active and involved in the social partnership, as everybody wants it to be. I hope there will be a successful outcome to the An Post dispute.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne called for a report on the matter of the land surrounding psychiatric hospitals. He also raised the question of whether the banning of plastic bags could lead to an initiative to make chewing gum less sticky, something we would all like as the problem is quite bad.</P>

    <P>Senator Kenneally called for a debate on broadband projects. He also raised the matter of <Col N="109"/>the ring road around Waterford not having ducting for cabling. The Senator is aware that legislation in which cover for such provision was included was passed prior to the end of the term of the previous Government. There must be some non-communication among officials of the county council, the NRA and the Department. I agree with the Senator that such work should have been done.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s points were very much on a Kerry theme. He spoke about Kenmare and concern there regarding the ambulance service. As the Cathaoirleach said, that matter would be ideally suitable for raising on the Adjournment. He also raised how the theft of clothes, which were worth &euro;4,000 or perhaps it was &euro;400, led to a bill in civil legal aid for &euro;10,000. The system is in place and this can be followed up.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden called for a debate on consumer affairs and he rightly said that his campaign led to a later campaign by a particular political party.</P>

	<P>It is difficult to drink around. If one goes into a pub to have one drink, I imagine one is inclined to stay in the same pub, although I do not drink pints.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke wants the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to come to the House to debate the decline in rural areas. Senator Jim Walsh called for a debate on rural development and the roads programme of the NRA in the south east and the midlands. He also sought a debate on the report which the committee of which he is a member has issued.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; supported a call for the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to come to the House. The Senator contacted me on this and advised me that he understood the Minister was keen to come to the House. I hope we will be able to follow through on that next week. The Senator also wants the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to come to the House to discuss the guidelines on rural housing.</P>

 </MainHeading>
 <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="High Level of Alcohol Consumption" RHead="by Young People: Statements">
   <Title>High Level of Alcohol Consumption by Young People: Statements.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I last spoke in <Col N="110"/>this House on the high level of alcohol consumption on 11 December 2002 and listened to the very comprehensive and interesting debate which followed. Since that time the trial of four young people following the death of a young man, Mr. Brian Murphy, outside a nightclub in this city has tragically highlighted the extremes of what can happen as a result of the excessive misuse of alcohol. Subsequent newspaper articles on teenage drinking identified a pattern of under-age drinking, with binge drinking becoming the norm and with an increasing number of pupils arriving at school with hangovers.</P>
    <P>As I stated in the House previously, binge drinking and drunkenness by young persons lead to a wide range of problems. Poor school performance, accidents, relationship and delinquency problems are common in young binge drinkers. A study among the school-going Irish reports that 35% of the sexually active respondents said alcohol was an influencing factor in their engaging in sexual activity. Alcohol misuse has also been identified as one of the main risk indicators in regard to teenage pregnancy. Unprotected sexual activity can give rise to an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. During the past decade the incidence of sexually transmitted infection has increased by 165%.</P>
    <P>Alcohol related offences committed by juveniles, such as assaults, public order offences, intoxication and possession of alcohol in a public place, have increased. In 2000, 3,800 alcohol related offences were committed by minors. This figure rose to 6,400 in 2001. What is also very worrying is the sharp increase in the number of young persons, especially young males in the 15 to 35 age cohort, who commit suicide. As has always been acknowledged, many factors can contribute to the act of suicide, but it must be acknowledged that alcohol misuse is a significant risk factor in the causation of suicide.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the misuse of alcohol is not restricted to those underage or young categories. It affects all age groups within Ireland, which has had the highest increase in alcohol consumption among member states of the European Union in the past ten years. We have experienced a massive 41% increase in <i>per capita</i> alcohol consumption between 1989 and 1999. While this debate is focused on the issue of young persons drinking, it is important to point out the example for that drinking comes from the older generation. It is the practices in which we engage and the habits we form that influence the younger generation coming up.</P>
    <P>Drinking by young persons is influenced by society as a whole. International research has demonstrated that the beliefs of young persons about the effects of alcohol and the desirability of those effects are acquired through observation, vicarious learning and the assimilation of cultural stereotypes. These messages are given to children <Col N="111"/>before consumption of alcohol begins. Children have observed and vicariously learned and assimilated the cultural stereotypes that exist in this country about alcohol before they have any personal experience of it. This is a fundamental point. Research has shown that for those under 15 years of age, the most common sources of alcohol are taking it from the drink supply at home, being given it by their parents or having older siblings or friends buy it for them.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has just completed a three year alcohol awareness campaign which has been very successful in developing media attention and generating public awareness on the issue. A new alcohol awareness campaign is currently being planned by the unit in association with the National Children&rsquo;s Office.</P>
    <P>A strategic task force on alcohol was established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, in January 2002. The remit of the task force was to recommend evidence based measures to Government aimed at reducing and preventing alcohol-related harm. The main thrust of its report, which was published in May 2002, was to protect health and public safety as well as creating an environment that enables people make healthy choices. Key areas included protecting children and reducing pressure on adolescents to drink, preventing and limiting harm in the drinking environment and preventing alcohol-related road accidents and deaths.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group has been established to co-ordinate responses to the recommendations and is due to report to the Minister for Health and Children shortly. The task force is finalising its second report which will contain further recommendations aimed at reducing harm.</P>
    <P>A responsible server training programme has been developed by the health promotion unit in association with the drinks industry group. The aim of the programme is to limit harm in the drinking environment by not serving to intoxicated customers and those underage and promoting alternative strategies to reduce drink driving. This programme is now being delivered by the hospitality training body, F&aacute;ilte.</P>
    <P>The school, youth sector and college settings are the focal points for targeting young people to enable them to increase control over and to improve their health. Within the school setting, the introduction and implementation of the social and personal health education programme has been the focus of the past three years. Among the overall aims of this programme is the promotion of self-esteem and self-confidence, to enable students to develop a framework for responsible decision making and to promote physical, mental and emotional health and well being.</P><Col N="112"/>
    <P>The national youth health programme is a partnership between the National Youth Council of Ireland, the health promotion unit of my Department and the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science. This programme continues to support youth organisations in becoming more health promoting through both topic-based training and comprehensive organisational training and development through the health promoting youth service initiative.</P>
    <P>A framework for the development of a college alcohol policy has been produced by the health promotion unit, in association with the heads of the colleges and the Union of Students of Ireland. The framework provides guidelines which include measures on controlling promotion, sponsorship and marketing on the college campus, providing education and support services, as well as alternatives, and limiting harm in the drinking environment.</P>
    <P>A number of research projects on alcohol related matters have been commissioned by the health promotion unit, including a survey to examine the impact of alcohol advertising on teenagers. The findings indicate that alcohol advertising has a strong attraction for teenagers as it portrays lifestyles and images which are part of their social setting.</P>
    <P>In addition to these developments, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 has responded to certain recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the strategic task force on alcohol which address the problem of underage drinking. This includes an obligation on those aged between 18 and 20 years to have an age document with them in a bar after 9 p.m. This should assist licensees in complying with provisions in regard to underage consumption and the garda&iacute; in enforcing the law. The Act has also enabled the progression of the recommendation relating to the restriction of children at certain times and circumstances from licensed premises where it prohibits, subject to a number of exemptions, persons under 18 years of age from the bars of licensed premises after 9 p.m.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some of the many ongoing initiatives and projects initiated by the Government. However, I must stress that the process of changing the attitudes of young people to binge drinking and getting drunk depends on the attitude and intolerance of society in general to this behaviour being considered socially normal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to point out that the Order of Business, as agreed to 15 minutes ago, was that the Minister of State would be asked to conclude the debate at 12.25 p.m. Many Senators are anxious to speak on this matter and, as spokespersons have 15 minutes, they should <Col N="113"/>consider sharing time. Although it is up to the spokespersons themselves to decide, it would be fair to the Chair and other Senators if they did so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already offered to share time with my Fine Gael colleagues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important issue about which I have called for debate for some time. I welcome the Minister of State and note he is representing the Minister for Health and Children as opposed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, although the issue comes within the remit of both Departments. Therefore, it is good the Minister of State is here because he deals with both.</P>
    <P>The issue of binge drinking and the spectacle of teenagers and young adults on our streets in a drunken state is of huge concern to all of us, particularly parents. How can we tackle this and what can we do? The Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution makes very good points. However, I would have liked to have seen more action in respect of what the Minister proposes to do. There is an onus on the legislators to do something to tackle this huge problem.</P>
    <P>The proceedings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children of 20 March 2003 also make for interesting reading. A number of consultants from various hospitals around the country were invited before the committee. Dr. Eamon Brasil from the Mater Hospital stated that in October 2001, his staff performed an audit of 1,500 consecutive attendances to the accident and emergency department over a 24 hour basis to see the effects of alcohol on patients. Some 76% of the forms were returned from 1,000 people. Alcohol was a factor in 24% of all attendances and 13% of those presenting were deemed by medical or nursing staff to be clinically intoxicated. Consumption of alcohol was the direct cause of the presentation to the emergency department in 10% of cases and was indirectly involved in approximately 14% of cases.</P>
    <P>Therefore, alcohol affects not just the people who present in a drunken state to accident and emergency departments but also those who suffer at the hands of those who are in a drunken state. People who are drunk are also a danger to themselves in terms of falling over and receiving injuries. Dr. Mary Holohan of the sexual assault treatment unit of the Rotunda Hospital stated that a total of 60% of the clients they see have ingested alcohol. She went on to state: &ldquo;The worrying aspect is that between 1998 and 2002, there was an increase from 6% to 27% in the number of cases where we were asked to evaluate the possibility of a sexual crime because the person concerned could not remember what had happened&rdquo;. The Minister of State alluded to such issues. It is extremely worrying that our young <Col N="114"/>people are at such risk, particularly young girls, who drink so much that they do not know whether or not they have had a sexual encounter.</P>
    <P>Dr. Chris Luke of Cork University Hospital stated that the majority of cases of child abuse and domestic violence and most cases of public disorder and violence on the streets of our cities are associated with drunkenness. He went on to state that more than 50% of domestic violence cases against females are alcohol related and at least 20% of inappropriate ambulance call outs are due to alcohol intoxication. It makes interesting reading. The cost of all this to the State through the health services is enormous.</P>
    <P>The drinks industry has a huge responsibility in terms of how it advertises and presents its drink to all of us, but particularly in respect of its influence over young people. I have carried out some research on this matter and discovered from RGDATA that the off-licence market in Ireland is worth &euro;1.2 billion, of which the multiples, including Tesco, Dunnes Stores and Superquinn, have two thirds of the market. I am concerned at the aggressive marketing being undertaken by some of these companies, particularly Tesco. These companies are selling drink at cost price to encourage people to come into the stores. We cannot stand over such aggressive marketing. The Director of Consumer Affairs is taking a case against Dunnes Stores for selling drink below cost. We must target these areas and ensure that drink is not being sold at cost price, or below cost price, to our young people. This is one of the reasons they drink so much. Supermarkets are not selling drink below cost for the good of their customers&rsquo; health. They are doing so for profit. Nevertheless, while making profit they must be cognisant of the damage they may be doing to young people. The Groceries Order covers the drinks industry and I am glad the Director of Consumer Affairs is keeping a watchful eye on this area.</P>
    <P>The issue of advertising must be tackled. Supermarkets think nothing of taking out four page advertisements in Sunday newspapers, admittedly not only for drink. Aggressive marketing is influencing young people to buy drink at low prices.</P>
    <P>One of the doctors who spoke at the Joint Committee on Health and Children referred to the danger of stimulant drinks, particularly to young girls, among whom they are popular. Stimulant drinks quickly make people very drunk. He said:</P>
    <P LI="1">I am especially worried about stimulant drinks, especially those taken by young girls. Heretofore, people drank a certain amount, got drunk and began to lose control. Stimulant drinks allow them to drink more, keep going and get ossified. They are also in control and do a lot of damage if they want. A drunk with a stimulant drink can engage in an assault <Col N="115"/>whereas a drunk without it would probably miss and fall over.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We often wonder how young people who have had a great deal to drink can be so aggressive. According to the doctor this is due to the effect of stimulant drinks, which make the drinker aggressive.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister for Health and Children speaking about banning drink in certain places and banning alcohol advertising. We are, more and more, becoming a nanny state. I do not wish to see more laws enacted. I want to see the laws we have being enforced. The Intoxicating Liquor Act makes it an offence for any person to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger themselves or any other person in the vicinity. How many people have been arrested under that provision? The Act also prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons by licensees, as well as drunkenness in the bars of licensed premises. How many licensees have been prosecuted for serving drink to people who are already in a drunken state? Another provision states that a drunken person shall not be allowed into a bar, and where a person is drunk on leaving the licensed premises it shall be presumed that the person was drunk while on the premises unless the contrary is proved. How many licensees have been prosecuted under that provision?</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act requires that any drink sold in an off-licence must show the name and address of the licensee. That measure has not been enforced, although it would be extremely helpful. Young people are drinking in parks and other public places which is, of course, illegal. Last weekend, I informed the Garda of anti-social behaviour by a number of young people who were openly drinking in a public place. The garda&iacute; did not come; I presume they had more serious business to attend to.</P>
    <P>I outline a number of provisions already in place which, if they were enforced, would make a difference. We must not always target young people. Some of the older members of our community do not give good example in this regard. We need to see garda&iacute; on the street arresting people who are in a drunken state and a danger to themselves and others. People will then see there is no point in getting drunk. We have seen the effect of penalty points on motorists. Enforcement is the answer. We know that young people are drinking to excess and arriving in hospitals as a result. Why are garda&iacute; not enforcing the laws which are already there?</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear of prohibition from the Minister for Health and Children, as has happened in the case of cigarettes. The message of enforcement must go back to the Minister. The <Col N="116"/>issue of selling drink at cost price, which is unacceptable, must be tackled. I hope these matters will be addressed by the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>May I share time with Senator Kitt?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it. Bh&iacute; s&eacute; anseo cheana nuair a pl&eacute;adh an &aacute;bhar seo. T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil suim mh&oacute;r aige ann.</P>
    <P>This topic commands significant public attention at present, of which the number of Senators wishing to speak is indicative. Much of Irish society revolves around social drinking, and there is nothing wrong with that. No matter what country one visits in Europe, throughout the world and in places as far away as Shanghai and Beijing, one comes across a traditional Irish pub. This is an aspect of our culture which we have exported to other countries. There is much to be said for social drinking.</P>
    <P>However, moderation is the key and our record in this area flies in the face of moderation. A recent EU report states that the percentage of Irish people who drink alcohol on a regular basis is more than double the EU average. When alcohol consumption rates across EU member states were compared it emerged that regular consumption was highest in the Republic of Ireland, where 52% of the population drink regularly. This compared with rates of 44% in Denmark and Great Britain and 43% in the Netherlands. The lowest consumption rates were in Italy, at 12%, and Spain, at 19%. Overall, a quarter of EU citizens regularly drink alcohol, ranging from 6% of women and 19% of men in Italy, to 40% of women and 64% of men in Ireland. When different age groups were looked at, Ireland had the highest percentage of regular drinkers in all but the 55 to 64 age group. Obviously, it takes us some considerable time to realise that moderation should be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>In the 15 to 24 age group, 52% of Irish people are regular drinkers compared to just 10% in Italy, 16% in Portugal and 18% in France. In the 24 to 34 age group the pattern is the same. Some 66% of Irish people are regular drinkers compared to 10% in Italy, 20% in Austria and 45% in Britain. Some 40% of women and 64% of men drink compared to the EU average of 25%. We should aim to reach the EU average. That shows us the scale of the challenge. However, it is not only the Government and State agencies which should tackle this issue. Each person has free will and we are all masters of our own destiny to some degree. People must exercise self-discipline and play their part. I do not subscribe to the notion that everything is the responsibility of the State and that people do not have <Col N="117"/>individual responsibility. This problem affects all age groups.</P>
    <P>A report published in 1999 showed that more than half of young people had experience of alcohol before the age of 12, which is alarming. Senator Terry mentioned teenage drinking habits and their wide-ranging social effects. That must be highlighted. I spoke to a friend recently who is my age and who owns a hotel. He said that when we were young we only had enough money to buy a few pints, but we enjoyed having a drink. He said he was amazed at young people today who go to his premises not to drink, but to get drunk. That is a significant difference.</P>
    <P>Alcopops play a part in this regard. A recent survey found that the consumption of alcopops among girls has more than doubled, from 3% in 1998 to 8% in 2002. Consumption of spirits among girls has also increased, from 3.8% to 6.8% over the same period. There was a huge outcry from the drinks industry when the Minister for Finance put additional taxes on alcopops in the second last budget. Any moves which act as a disincentive will be opposed by the drinks industry. It is a powerful lobby and we should be conscious of that. However, it is up to the Government and to us as legislators to have the courage of our convictions and to ensure that our society is regulated in such a way as to benefit all citizens.</P>
    <P>Binge drinking is a serious problem, particularly among young people. It is a factor in alcoholism, which is a disease. It should be avoided by young people who are starting out in life. It is both socially and medically damaging. It is accepted that people who drink to excess will have serious health problems in the future. It also contributes to poor school performance and to an increased number of accidents on the roads. We have had numerous debates about road traffic legislation. One major contributory factor to accidents, which is targeted by the garda&iacute; and in legislation, is drink.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry correctly alluded to the breakdown of relationships and the number of domestic violence cases, many of which have their roots in alcohol excess. As heavy drinkers or alcoholics know, this problem does not only affect themselves, but their spouses, partners and children. It impacts on a number of people. There are many good reasons for trying to regulate it. Teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, to which Senator Terry referred, are also problems associated with drink. Parents should engage with their children more than they do at present and point out the dangers and risks and the life changing effect it can have on people.</P>
    <P>We have seen, as the Minister of State pointed out in his speech, the unfortunate consequences of drink, such as assaults, fights and, in some cases, deaths. Alcohol is also a significant factor in suicide. Our casual attitude to drink, both at <Col N="118"/>home and elsewhere, must be tackled. Advertising was mentioned. The relationship between drink and sport is being addressed by the Government and by sporting organisations. A greater part must be played by schools and parents.</P>
    <P>One factor which contributes to excessive drinking is the rounds culture we have in this country. People who go out for only one or two drinks often find themselves drinking five or six drinks because they become socially involved with other people. That is odd, although I do it, like everyone else. If a person is standing beside someone in the supermarket who is getting groceries, he or she will not offer to pay for them. However, if that person goes into a pub and someone is at the bar, he or she will buy him or her a drink. Perhaps a campaign should be started to end that culture. It might have some beneficial effect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Jim Walsh for sharing time. I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments. This debate is welcome and I hope we return to this subject on another occasion. The Minister of State mentioned other issues related to the population in general, rather than just young people. We should talk about the abuse of alcohol generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Many good organisations have tried to assist young people through leisure activities, such as the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, which organises many cultural, sporting and musical events. D&oacute;thain, the Irish for enough, is an organisation in County Mayo which was pioneered by Dr. Michael Loftus. It promotes many leisure activities at which alcohol is not served. The best known organisation is the No Name Club, which was started in the south east but which has branches nationwide, including a strong presence in Galway. These organisations do good work. I despair when I hear young people saying they have nothing to do except drink because that is not true. Organisations such as the No Name Club organise a range of activities at which soft drinks are served. The only problem is that enough help is not given to these organisations. I was amazed to discover that the Department of Education and Science does not give much funding to the No Name Club, an issue I have raised previously.</P>
    <P>The position regarding discos has been debated in this and the other House. There should be a better way of organising them so young people can go to a bar and order soft drinks rather than having the bar closed down and being given a soft drink on paying their admission at the door. This also brings into focus the regulation under which people under the age of 18 years have to leave a licensed premises at 9 p.m. I have been concerned about this because it is better to have families together instead of sending 17 and 18 years olds <Col N="119"/>out onto the streets at 9 p.m. However, that is a debate for another day. In defence of the rural pub, it should be borne in mind that a huge amount of fund raising takes place in these pubs on behalf of schools, sports clubs and so forth. It might be a table quiz or a race night and it is unfair that people aged 16 or 17 must leave the premises at 9 p.m.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators, I also object to the aggressive marketing of alcohol and to drinks promotions, whether it is by supermarkets or the drinks companies. I saw it occur again with the smoking ban. As soon as the smoking ban was announced, there was the same type of marketing by the drinks companies for new drink promotions in the pubs. I do not agree with that. I am appalled at the concoctions which are now being sold in pubs, particularly in the cities. One drink, which is known as a &ldquo;fat frog&rdquo;, costs &euro;15. Senator Walsh mentioned the practice of buying a round but if &euro;15 is the price of one drink, one can easily imagine that young people will not have that type of money. Such high prices for drink can lead to other problems.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to poor school performance, delinquency problems, unprotected sex and the risk of sexually transmitted infections. These are directly related to the issue of alcohol consumption. An education programme in this regard should be considered. The other unfortunate problem is the violence that occurs, and it has been well reported, outside nightclubs and takeaways. These are matters which the Minister should consider, particularly the fact that nightclubs can remain open so late compared with the ordinary public house and that takeaways can open late under the planning laws. This is where much of the violence occurs and it is associated with drinking, especially binge drinking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Cummins. I compliment the Minister on his brief, clear and logical speech. It is not necessary to repeat the figures but it is worrying that Ireland is how head of the EU table in terms of alcohol consumption. This is not civilised, sophisticated drinking where one enjoys a glass of wine or a liqueur but binge drinking.</P>
    <P>This debate is on alcohol consumption by young people. The problem is caused by three factors. First, young people have a much higher disposable income than previously. Second, there is greater availability and greater visibility of drink products. Third, there is huge promotion of drink by multinationals. This is no longer Uncle Arthur but Diageo and other such companies. In their board rooms in New York and London, they look at a graph and realise they can squeeze the Irish market. They do not give a damn about the young people. There are decent pub owners and <Col N="120"/>a decent way to drink but they do not reside in the board rooms of these companies.</P>
    <P>I have put my money where my mouth is. Recently I was offered a fair amount of money to do work which would involve this type of promotion. However, I felt it would be dishonest since I had campaigned against this and raised the issue many times in the House. I did not do so in antagonism to civilised drinking but because I am concerned about the problem. I warned on previous occasions that there would be deaths in the O&rsquo;Connell Street area if something was not done about it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the issue of sexual behaviour was raised. We have heard a great deal about date rape drugs such as rohypnol. Unfortunately, in many cases it is not rohypnol. It is due to young women being so blind drunk they have no idea what is happening. I have seen them, and they have been shown on television, emptying the contents of their stomachs on the sidewalks of central Dublin. It is a most unattractive sight. I hope they feel ashamed and awkward about it afterwards. I do not wish them ill but there is almost no shame involved in it. We must try to change the culture for this reason.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Kitt referred to the organisations dealing with this. People used to laugh at them. Fr. Matthew&rsquo;s Pioneer Total Abstinence Association did tremendous work and was necessary in the 19th century. These organisations are equally necessary now and they should be encouraged. People should not be told that they are not alive if they are not drinking alcohol. The advertising is terribly dishonest. It is also difficult to deal with because there is penetration of the airwaves by satellite television stations broadcasting from other countries. Almost universally the message is that one will have a fantastic sex life if one drinks as much as possible. That is as bad as telling young people in the Middle East that if they blow themselves up, there will be 71 virgins waiting for them on a cloud.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on the community. I salute Dr. Mick Loftus. He is a former president of the GAA and he led a campaign, which cannot have been popular, to limit the promotion of drink at sporting events. He saw the dangers of linking sporting prowess with drink.</P>
    <P>This Government had a remarkable success, and was courageous, in attacking the issue of smoking. It can do the same by taking vigorous action, even if it is unpopular, with regard to drink. It sometimes is unpopular. I have raised these concerns on many occasions and sometimes I have spoken intemperately. About 18 months ago I spoke twice on television on this subject and particularly about the way licences seem to pop up all over the place. I cannot say much about it because a member of the Judiciary, of whose existence I was completely unaware, believed I <Col N="121"/>was referring to him personally and initiated proceedings against RTE. He received a substantial settlement before the matter went to court but because I did it again a few weeks later, another case is pending.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. However, I have no intention of speaking about it. As this matter is <i>sub judice,</i> it would be dishonourable of me to say the same things and I do not intend to do so. That person is entitled to protection from the immunity that I receive. I am being circumspect but when this is over I might be able to look at some of the other issues involved in the two cases.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, that there is an inadequate relationship between the Judiciary and the Oireachtas. Judges criticise us and sometimes it is difficult if we criticise them in return. However, there should be a channel of communication. I am aware of situations where, for example, in an application for a licence, the public, police and the local authority objected but the licence was still granted. I am not criticising the judge. It may well be that there is a lacuna in the law and the judge is compelled to grant licences because of the way we drafted the law. We should examine this.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>I am more worried than ever about this situation. I mentioned something yesterday on the Order of Business and I am repeating it today because of the Minister of State&rsquo;s presence. I came home from speaking at a dinner in the Weston Hotel last weekend. I walked through Westmoreland Street and O&rsquo;Connell Street and called into a shop to buy a bottle of milk. I was struck that there were six packs of beer and bottles of wine available in the shop. To my astonishment, there were full bottles of whiskey on the top shelf. I asked the shop assistants about this in several shops. One of them was certainly not an Irish national and had difficulty speaking English. I wonder about his qualification to dispense alcohol at 11.10 p.m. on a Friday. He told me I could have a full bottle of whiskey. That is pouring petrol on an already dangerous situation and it should be stopped. If judges are compelled, because of our stupidity as legislators, to wallop out these licences, then we are remiss and must look at the situation. However, if that is not the case, then we should establish a proper mechanism for civilised communication between the judges and the Oireachtas so that this type of situation is avoided.</P>
    <Miles com="cl" par="115"/><P>I have studiously tried not to apportion blame and not to breach the <i>sub judice</i> ruling even though if I was a mean-minded person, I probably could get away with it. Few sensible people would think it appropriate, when there is already a massive problem of public drunkenness in the city centre of Dublin and of other cities, for <Col N="122"/>supermarkets staffed by inexperienced people to be allowed to hand out, not only six packs, but bottles of wine and whiskey. Everybody would agree there is something wrong with that and I hope the Minister of State will be able to address it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing time. I spoke on this issue in 2002 but have a few other points I would like to raise. There is no question but that the drink culture requires urgent attention. Urgent social change is required which will need tough decisions to tackle major vested interests. A public information plan is also required to deal with the health and educational aspects of alcohol abuse.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>There is no use always blaming young people for the adverse affects of alcohol abuse. We live in a society where almost everything revolves <Miles com="ch"/>around drink. It is no wonder young people are drawn into the drink culture long before they <Miles com="ch"/>reach the legal age at which they are permitted to purchase alcohol. Recently, we saw the ludicrous situation where people sought extensions for holy communions so that drink could be served. It is absolutely crazy. Whether communions, confirmations, weddings or wakes, it is unfortunate that alcohol abuse is closely associated with these life events.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>The links between sporting organisations and the drinks industry are another example of how young people, in particular, are targeted. Sporting occasions seem to be an excuse for open indulgence in alcohol. This is an area where a total change in social attitudes must occur but it will not happen overnight.</P>
    <P>The cost of soft drinks in pubs, clubs and hotels is a disgrace. The mark up on these products cannot be justified. The price of soft drinks is so grossly inflated that one wonders whether this is for profit purposes only or an attempt to turn people off these products and attract them to alcoholic beverages instead. One would pay less for a pint in most places than for two small bottles of lemonade, Lucozade or Coke, which is a disgrace. The No Name Club and several other clubs have been mentioned. What chance do they have when the price of soft drinks and bottled water is grossly inflated?</P>
    <P>Alcohol is an addictive drug and there is a need to educate young people about the destruction it causes. We have spoken about the effect people who suffer from alcoholism have on families. This disease causes problems in homes and beyond them. The health problems caused by over-consumption of alcohol and the damage it causes must be spelled out. It may be difficult to get young people to look 20 or 30 years into the future at the effects over-consumption of alcohol in their teenage years may cause, but we must convey that message. This is a challenge which must be tackled.</P><Col N="123"/>
    <P>It is imperative that children in schools are educated about the effects of alcohol. The Minister of State spoke about greater health promotion in this area, and I fully agree with that. This must begin in the schools but we must also involve all of society in the educational process to achieve the major change which is absolutely necessary. There is no point lecturing young people if adults are not prepared to change their attitudes as well.</P>
    <P>The number of suicides in recent years is dreadful. Each year there are more suicides than people killed on our roads. I urge that additional finance be given to the Irish Association of Suicidology and other organisations dealing with the question of suicide to research the relationship between alcohol and the incidence of suicides. I believe a significant number of people commit suicide because of the over-indulgence of alcohol.</P>
    <P>As Senator Terry mentioned, we have quite enough laws. The enforcement of those laws is necessary. Rather than dwell on the legislation, I would prefer to concentrate on the health promotion and educational aspects of this major problem affecting our country. We must deal with this problem and rise to the challenge, and health promotion is the best way to do this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important and ongoing debate. I too spoke in this debate in December 2002 but there are still a number of points I would like to make. We all agree that social drinking of alcohol is an integral part of Irish life. Alcohol can, and regularly does, lead to problems for individuals and the wider community when it is abused. In recent years, excessive alcohol consumption, especially among young people, has led to increased alcohol-related harm ranging from accidents and injuries to violence on the streets of our cities and towns. It is apparent that drunkenness has also increased to unacceptable levels.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that the changing drinking patterns in Irish society can be attributed to a number of factors. We have experienced economic growth and social change on an unprecedented scale. Our lifestyles have changed, largely for the better. Employment has increased and, as a consequence, disposable income levels have also increased, especially among younger people. These broadly positive developments have been accompanied by a lessening of parental control and personal responsibility among young people and a much stronger focus on consumerism in Irish society.</P>
    <P>This is a point at which a discussion on rights and responsibilities becomes necessary and inevitable. The need for a partnership approach to tackling alcohol-related harm is evident. There <Col N="124"/>was a tendency to point the finger of blame in one direction, whether at the Government, Ministers, the drinks industry, the media or at schools. However, to point the finger at one section is the wrong approach. Everyone has a responsibility.</P>
    <P>Rather than engaging in arguments and counter arguments about who is to blame, we need to identify the different levels at which action is required. We can then identify the responsibilities and contributions of the various stakeholders. The problem of alcohol abuse must be addressed at separate levels. Legislation has a role to play. This Government has already taken action in that regard and we have debated it in this House. The drinks industry cannot be driven by profits alone. It bears an equal responsibility. However, the key to solving this problem is education of all sectors of society. Family values are hugely important, particularly given the increased level of binge drinking among young people.</P>
    <P>It is no good pointing the finger at other agencies when we abdicate our individual responsibility as is the case in Irish society. I recall numerous incidents of drunkenness being accepted as a mitigating factor in behaviour. That day is gone. We can no longer accept drunkenness as a mitigating factor in a person&rsquo;s behaviour. There has been a huge increase in public order offences which are dealt in the District Courts by applying the probation Act. It is time to come down very strongly on what is acceptable and what is not. I am a non-drinker, but I often wonder how I would have been treated if I had had the misfortune to become involved in an altercation and did not have the excuse of having had a few drinks too many. The time has come to address that.</P>
    <P>During my military career there was on occasion excessive drinking, particularly overseas. One chaplain, Fr. Paddy Bresnan, adopted the novel approach of issuing his own form of pioneer pledge which limited people to two, three or four pints. People boasted quite proudly regarding the pledge they had taken that they were a four-pint or a two-pint man. This meant people exercised personal control and personal responsibility. Young people must exercise control and understand their limitations as human beings and in terms of how much alcohol they can tolerate at any one time.</P>
    <P>Simplistic solutions targeted at any one level of society will not work. Effective action at all levels is needed to redress abuses in society. That has already been proven when, in bringing forward legislation, all stakeholders came together in an effort to work together and draft that legislation. However, the State has a responsibility to protect its citizens from the consequences of alcohol abuse and it must lead the charge. This Government is endeavouring to do that.</P><Col N="125"/>
    <P>We must also have regard to the commercial entitlement of the drinks industry to develop new products and to market them and meet the market requirements. However, they too must be responsible in their approach. Particular products on the market, shots and so on, are designed to encourage people to get drunk quickly. That is very worrying and I ask the industry to carefully examine that area. Alcoholic drinks with high alcohol content should be heavily priced to try to reduce that type of alcohol intake.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which gave effect to certain of the recommendations put forward by the commission, was facilitated by the fact that the reforms had been advocated in such a broadly representative forum. We should continue with that approach. The exercise of responsibility in the use of alcohol is not a one-way street. Not only consumers but those who compete for a market share must play their part. There is a wide range of programmes in Ireland aimed at educating people about the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption. They promote a responsible attitude to alcohol. The responsible serving of alcohol programme which is directed at the industry and is run under the auspices of CERT is an initiative to which I hope all retailers involved in the drinks industry will subscribe. The framework for developing a college alcohol programme, initiated by the universities, where there is a high level of alcohol abuse among young people, is also a welcome development. Universities should implement this and work to ensure that a proper responsible drinking programme is available in all universities. There is also the alcohol aware practice study run by the GPs, the advertising alcohol in Ireland programme run by the Advertising Standards Authority, and the No Name clubs that have been mentioned previously. The video shown on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; some months ago entitled &ldquo;Crash&rdquo;, showed the consequences of accidents. I highlighted it in this House and wrote to the producers of the video, and I am very pleased that it has been made available to all second level schools throughout the country. That type of education programme is real. It is not an advertisement. The people are real and the victims are real. That is the approach we need to take.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the various stakeholders to face up to their individual responsibilities and embrace initiatives aimed at addressing alcohol abuse. It is only through people and entities in partnership facing up to their responsibilities that we have any hope of redressing this terrible scourge on Irish society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Minihan for sharing his time. That we are having this debate is a sad reflection on our society. It is high time we as a nation accepted we have a serious problem with <Col N="126"/>alcohol. It is shameful that we have had the highest increase in alcohol consumption in Europe in the past decade. Many of us enjoy a drink and drink sensibly. However, an attitude has crept in that it is macho to go out and get blasted or binge drink on a Friday or Saturday and to boast the following day about how many drinks one had and how well one was able to handle one&rsquo;s drink.</P>
    <P>During the 1990s average alcohol consumption in Ireland increased by 42% per person while in ten of our European partners there was a decrease in alcohol consumption. In 2001, Ireland was ranked second only to Luxembourg in terms of alcohol consumption &mdash; we were consuming 11.4 litres per person of pure alcohol when the average in Europe at that time was 9.1 litres.</P>
    <P>The problem stems from the fact that people here start drinking at a very early age. Drinking patterns have been influenced by a number of factors. Children now have more money in their pockets and more disposable income. There is a stronger focus on consumerism, and the marketplace and the consumer are well and truly hand in hand. It would appear 18 to 25 year olds are most influenced because they are more likely to engage in binge drinking. We are told that binge drinking for a female is drinking five drinks in a row and for a male it is seven drinks. People who have been drinking all their lives can go out and enjoy a social drink a number of days during the week. In binge drinking, people lose total control of themselves. They empty the contents of their stomachs on the streets of the city or town wherever they are, and fall over. They engage in rows and suffer alcoholic poisoning. In the following days I suppose they boast about how much they drank and how well they held it. We saw a shocking example some months ago on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; of a young girl falling around not knowing where she was. What could or might have happened to her is only for others to<Miles com="jy"/>know.</P>
    <P>This type of drinking is bad enough but we also have a serious problem with 15 and 16 year olds drinking. Almost three quarters of them have drunk alcohol at least once a month, one third admit to binge drinking on three or more occasions a month and a quarter will have drunk on three or four occasions in any month. That is a shocking statistic. Adults, particularly, must now address this problem. There is widespread reluctance to do so because we fear being known as killjoys. Young people are afraid of being called wimps if say they will not drink at this rate because it is not good for them.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, parents underestimated the damage that alcohol does. Many say they do not mind their children having a drink because they think that is better than taking drugs. It is high time we realised this is a drug and it is being taken in a more widespread and acceptable way than other <Col N="127"/>drugs. The Government has made some progress but needs to do more, for example, by establishing the strategic task force to study the problem. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 and the Public Order Bill have been introduced to tackle the problem of drinking and its aftermath. We must take our heads out of the sand as parents and teachers, and accept that as a nation we have a serious drinking problem and do something about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Tuffy has three minutes to speak.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise my point as quickly as I can. One measure the Minister introduced was to ban children from public houses and hotel pubs after 9 p.m. although that was not necessary to deal with the problem of young people drinking. I have no relationship of any kind with hoteliers, apart from going to hotels occasionally on holidays, as I did in Castlebar for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</P>
    <P>The Irish Hotels Federation has made a reasonable suggestion on the basis that much hotel business comes from young parents whose children are often with them in the pubs in hotels, not drinking alcohol but because the parents do not want to leave them in the bedroom. It is relaxed and generally does not offend people. If people do not like the policy of one hotel they can go elsewhere. It is a part of hotel business and should be encouraged because like everyone else, parents need holidays and this is one way to relax where the children are in a protected environment. They can be with their children and enjoy the hotel facilities. At the recent Irish Hotels Federation conference the outgoing president of the federation said he had received substantial feedback from his members that this was affecting tourism and business. He added that parents do not feel comfortable leaving children unsupervised in bedroom areas while they enjoy a meal or entertainment elsewhere in the hotel.</P>
    <P>The relaxed pace of life with little bureaucracy attracts visitors to Ireland but these restrictions present a different face. The outgoing president of the Irish Hotels Federation proposed the introduction of a children certificate system similar to that in the United Kingdom which would allow garda&iacute; to grant suitable hotels permission to have children with their parents in the bar areas after 9 p.m. where food was being served or where there was family entertainment. He called for that to be introduced before the tourism season begins. It is important for visitors and for Irish people who cannot go abroad on holidays because of their stage of life or finances. I hope the Minister of State will listen to this reasonable point.</P><Col N="128"/>
    <P>The Minister should perhaps consider tackling the problem of young people drinking through an agency similar to the drugs task forces. He could implement projects in pilot areas where there is a high proportion of people in their early teens and provide them with alternatives activities for their spare time and measure the results. He also could provide them with the necessary finance and resources.</P>
    <P>We always call for debates on this issue near St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, Easter or Christmas because the problem is exacerbated at these festive times. The Garda and other bodies could make a more concentrated effort to deal with that. I was in Castlebar on St. Patrick&rsquo;s night and the place was covered in litter. I mean no disrespect to Castlebar, where I enjoyed my time. No doubt the problem was the same in Dublin. The litter wardens should be out on that day. Councils should put in extra resources and pay people overtime or whatever is necessary to cover those events. They should also fine those who drop litter. Likewise, the garda&iacute; should be on the street on those occasions in particular. Even if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a shortage of resources it can at least make a concerted effort at these times.</P>
    <P>There have been widespread reports about club events, for example at the Point, where 14 and 15 year olds take drugs. That is far more serious. I query event organisers who admit young people, claiming they can be supervised. It is hard to believe that they do not somehow permit alcohol to be given to these people and turn a blind eye to drug-taking or fail to take enough action. A great deal needs to be done in that area. At least we know something of the effects of alcohol whereas the use of drugs is a great unknown against which we need to protect our young people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for a constructive contribution to a very interesting debate. When someone seeks counselling for a drink problem the first advice is that he or she must face up to the problem. I am glad that the Seanad has recognised this morning in the light of contemporary statistics that as a nation we have a drinking problem that we must acknowledge. All counsellors advise that the first step is to recognise that the problem exists. I am not satisfied, however, despite all the contributions this morning that we have fully faced up to the problem because when one looks at the statistics it is very serious.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s concerns about drug-taking but alcohol is by far the most commonly consumed drug in Ireland and the abuse of other drugs often follows a period of abuse of alcohol. How many serious drug abusers did not start by abusing the primary available <Col N="129"/>licensed drug? I am not saying it should not be licensed.</P>
    <P>It is 1 April and there was a news report this morning to the effect that the Government would limit the number of pints a person could drink. Such a story can be published on 1 April because during the day one realises it is untrue. Although we must, we are not being careful in our use of this drug. All Senators recognise that. Senator Kett was vehement on that point. Senators also gave graphic descriptions of the effects of alcohol.</P>
    <P>It is more useful to start by looking at the causes of alcohol abuse. Senator Norris made the point, echoed by a number of other Senators, that the huge increase in the disposable income of teenagers has a crucial effect. This change has come about because of increased employment opportunities. In our work as public representatives we see an increasing number of young persons working in licensed premises, retail stores and many other areas. To describe, as legislation does, a person under the age of 18 years as a child is to miss the point. These children who pay taxes and pay-related social insurance are entitled to the protection of labour legislation and follow an adult lifestyle. We must face up to the fact that this is the Ireland in which we live and whatever policies we devise to address the problem must respect this.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cummins that it is impossible to separate the worlds of children and adults in the context of this problem. Children now live an adult life and adult form of existence and have disposable income much of which is, regrettably, spent on alcohol. This is where habits begin to form and characters begin to change. No amount of perception through the schools, or worthy literature circulated by the Department of Health and Children will affect that.</P>
    <P>This change has occurred in the context of great social and cultural change. The traditional control mechanisms and moral codes have weakened; several Senators referred to the dominance of consumerist thinking. It will become the State&rsquo;s obligation to devise measures to ensure that sanctions exist and that we have real deterrents. We cannot escape the issue.</P>
    <P>There is no public debate on this matter. I am concerned by some of the types of sanctions being used in other jurisdictions when the problem becomes serious. Senator Terry spoke about the serious consequences of the abuse of alcohol on the accident and emergency wards of our major hospitals. Why are non-medical card holders not billed with the full cost of their stay in a hospital unit when it is a result of self-induced intoxication? Health boards must address this.</P>
    <P>In other jurisdictions child benefit has been examined. We pay child benefit in respect of people who come before the courts. These people whose parents are in receipt of child benefit have used their money to become drunk. We need to <Col N="130"/>examine this issue and have a rational all-party debate on it. Unless deterrents are built into the system, we will not make progress on the issue.</P>
    <P>Some county councils have adopted excellent by-laws which prohibit the consumption of alcohol in public places and empower garda&iacute; to seize the liquor if found. Such by-laws are desirable and I am sure we will see more of them adopted. In order to make them a real deterrent, county councils will have to set up staff to collect fines and impose the regulations. Otherwise they will remain a worthy aspiration.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;nanny state&rdquo; was used by some Senators. This phrase has gained a certain currency lately but I do not accept the argument made. We have had a big nanny for decades, namely the church, whose influence has weakened substantially. If the State is not prepared to give a moral lead, nobody will. We must face up to that. If it is nanny behaviour to suggest to people that they should not get blind drunk and to introduce sanctions with regard to the consequences of becoming blind drunk, I am happy to admit that I support the nanny state. We must foster&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The current laws must be enforced, rather than bringing in a load of new ones.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current laws do not provide sufficient sanctions to deter this type of conduct. Reference was made to the Judiciary. I wish to salute a member of the Judiciary in County Clare who insists when a person is convicted of a public order offence related to alcohol that the person produces at his or her own cost an alcohol-free urine sample to garda&iacute; two or three times a week. This measure has had a substantial impact on improving the position in Ennis. We must examine more initiatives of this type. If individuals are not prepared to take responsibility for their behaviour, the State must intervene. The argument that this is the<Miles com="jy"/>nanny state is too glib and I do not accept it. There are, of course, some measures I would not support.</P>
    <P>We must be careful on the issue of the licensed trade. Many suggestions made revolve around imposing further restrictions on publicans and licence holders whose job of running their premises and maintaining order is already difficult. It is clear from the statistics that much of the increased consumption of alcohol stems from home drinking and from off-licence purchases. Much excessive consumption, as we well know, also takes place in night-clubs. Therefore, to exclusively target licensed premises will not lead to great progress in this area. The State must remind individuals of their responsibilities, irrespective of their age.</P>

	<P>As has been explained to the Senators involved, because of the unusual circumstances applying I have allowed amendments which were not substantially discussed on Committee Stage to be retabled on Report Stage. I emphasise that this will not be a precedent for future proceedings.</P>
    <P>I remind Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage except for the proposer of an amendment, who may reply to the discussion on the amendment. Each amendment must also be seconded.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 7, lines 24 to 26, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;but&rdquo; to &ldquo;service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I thank the Cathaoirleach for his ruling which allows me to re-table this amendment. Due to leaving the Chamber for a few seconds yesterday I was unable to move it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I received an explanation yesterday from a member of the Minister&rsquo;s staff but I wanted to move the amendment to clarify the issue. This amendment is in the interest of ensuring that we are precise about the definition of a supervisor and the remuneration that person would get for his or her work. I want to ensure that the remuneration of a door supervisor would not include drink for the night or take-home drink. Remuneration should be confined to pay or, at the end of the night, refreshment in the form of a drink. However, a person should not be supplied with drink for the night while on duty.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The definitions of various kinds of security service in section 2, for example, door supervisor, security guard and the like, are confined to those who provide the service for remuneration. That term was specifically included in the definition in order to exempt from the licensing requirement volunteers who might be helping out with security duties at a local show or festival, or perhaps assisting with crowd control at a sporting fixture or pilgrimage. In the select committee discussions on Committee Stage, concern was expressed that the use of the term could inadvertently open the way towards payment in kind by means of, for example, a television, holiday vouchers etc. I took these genuine concerns on board and brought forward an amendment in the form of a definition of remuneration. The definition includes a benefit-in-kind but excludes a meal or refreshment. It is reasonable to exclude from the definition of remuneration, a meal or refreshment provided in accordance with the security service. Otherwise <Col N="132"/>those who willingly volunteer to provide a service at local events would be prevented from accepting food or refreshments from the organisers of such an event unless they held a licence. I think that would be excessive and mean spirited by any standards. I am not willing, therefore, to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The issue of whether somebody providing a security service should be permitted to consume alcohol while providing that service is separate. This could, if necessary, be dealt with by the authority in regulations under section 51 concerning standards to be observed by categories of licensees in the provision of security services. I believe it would be appropriate for the authority to do so because, as Senator Terry said, it would be a sad thing if people acted as doormen in exchange for a rake of pints, which would result in the quality of their service deteriorating during the course of an evening. The spirit of what Senator Terry proposes is, effectively, capable of being dealt with under section 51. There is provision in the legislation for achieving the end with which her amendment proposed to deal. It would be appropriate in those circumstances to leave it to the authority to use section 51 to arrive at the same result.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and accept what he has said. Can we be sure the authority will do that? Does the Minister issue guidelines to it as to the type of regulations required and would this be one of them?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I can undertake to the Senator that, in addition to my views, I will draw to the attention of the authority the views of the House. It would be wrong to allow people to operate these services while consuming alcohol and doubly wrong for a person for whom such a service is being provided to give alcohol to security staff.</P>

  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 11, to delete lines 29 to 32 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(7) At least 40 per cent of the members of the Authority (and of the Appeal Board or an advisory committee) shall be men and at least 40 per cent shall be women.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Labour Party has tabled this amendment as we consider subsection (7) to be too weak. I am not sure what its effect would be if the Minister is to have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented in its membership. Would it be sufficient to have a person of each gender on the board? It is my understanding that it is Government policy to try and achieve a minimum of 40% of either gender, which is not the case at <Col N="133"/>present if one looks at the figures for various State boards. Why does the Minister not make the provision clear-cut by specifying 40%?</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of gender quotas when it comes to the electoral process, because people have to choose to put themselves forward. However, I favour them in the case of boards where a person has the power to appoint people. It is important that this type of requirement is in place. Perhaps in future it will be required to ensure men are adequately represented, but at present there are not enough women on State boards. There may even be cases where the balance goes the other way. We should also do something about that. The legislation is balanced equally between favouring men and women being represented on different bodies. That is a general principle which should also be applied in many other areas of life. We should be careful to ensure that both genders get to participate equally in different areas of life. It is possible for the Government to do this. It is supposed to be an objective of the State. Why does the Minister not spell it out fully and properly in the legislation? This would ensure that both he and the boards will comply, as well as those who put forward nominations to the boards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the thrust of what Senator Tuffy said. It is important that gender balance is achieved on all boards. It is Government policy and it has been the policy of successive Governments to try and achieve that. We are specifically aiming at having greater involvement of women. However, I am not convinced that a prescriptive 40% is the best approach to the matter. It will work better as an aspirational target. There are some areas where it is more difficult to achieve balance. It is important that those who are appointed have the expertise to fulfil the functions and responsibilities they are given, but I accept that there should be a bias in favour of ensuring a greater participation of women on these boards. The ideal would be to achieve a 50:50 balance. While boards may vary according to their nature and function, people wish to see greater female participation. However, I do not agree that we should prescribe the percentage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s policy is that at least 40% of State board members should be women and at least 40% should be men. There is no disagreement on that issue in terms of policy. The question we need to ask is if the present policy of the Government should be incorporated in rigid formula in any particular statute.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>In this case, we are dealing with a small authority of ten members plus a staff representative. The body should be representative of various <Col N="134"/>interests as provided for in section 8(2). A situation could arise where a good combination of people representing the relevant interests and with the relevant expertise has been identified and the Minister would wish to appoint a board with more than 60% female or male members.</P> <Miles com="xh"/>
    <P>I consider that a rigid formula would be too inflexible. The Government&rsquo;s approach to this is correct. In making appointments to the authority, which is provided for in subsection (7), the Minister shall have regard to the extent of which each sex is represented in its membership and shall ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained in this respect.</P>
    <P>This was extensively debated on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, particularly on Report Stage. The debate gave rise to a few interesting points. Let us suppose that the 60:40 mark had been achieved and the staff representative of the board resigned for whatever reason. To say to the staff that it can only lawfully appoint a man or woman, as the case may be, is a bit tough. They may have somebody they really want to appoint and since it would only be for a short period of time until the authority would next be selected <i>in toto</i>, this would prevent a free choice of candidate in one particular circumstance. Various other scenarios occur to me which I will not go into now as I discussed the matter at great length in the D&aacute;il on Report Stage. The appropriate thing to do is provide for a general obligation of the kind set out in section 7(7) and to leave it to the Minister of the day to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Deputies Costello, Deasy and &Oacute; Snodaigh dilated far and wide on this matter in the D&aacute;il. I reminded some parties in the D&aacute;il which are not represented in this House that since they had no women among their Members in the D&aacute;il, they were in a poor position to lecture me on the subject.</P>
    <P>The House should be aware of the following figures in regard to State boards. Currently, as a total percentage of serving membership women constitute 30%. Women represent 36% of serving Government ministerial nominees, and the figure is 40% in the case of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We have achieved that percentage in regard to the appointments I make. The difference between the two sets of figures is interesting because it is 30% of total board membership and 36% of total Government nominees. This indicates that it is the non-governmental organisations which have the most to achieve, not the Government. It should be taken on board that non-governmental organisations are lagging behind most in achieving balance in their nominations. To remedy this &mdash; I said this on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il &mdash; I am considering asking all the nominating bodies that put up short lists of people to put up a gender balance list so that I <Col N="135"/>can achieve adequate gender balance rather than having to do all the compensating myself when others have failed to do so.</P>
    <P>On the question of women as a percentage of the total number of chairpersons, 18% is the total across Government, which is disappointing. In the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, 45% of chairpersons are women. This indicates, as one would expect, that the Department is well advanced in the matter. The rigid formula is too prescriptive and could in certain circumstances tell the staff association it cannot produce a male or female candidate because I cannot make that appointment. It would be better to leave it as currently drafted. I will give an undertaking to this House, as I did in the D&aacute;il, that Members will be surprised by the amount of equality achieved on foot of the Government&rsquo;s approach.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his statistics. If there is a problem with NGOs, surely this would give him the power to say to them that they must be balanced. The Bill should be definitive in that regard. How many State boards comprise more than 60% of women or have the freedom to have that percentage?</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason it is proposed to delete subsection (5) is that it may be constitutionally dubious, first, because of the reversal of the burden of proof contemplated by the section in a criminal matter and, second, because of the recent High Court ruling in the bin tax case regarding the need to show that contempt was committed intentionally. The wording states that something may be treated for all purposes as if it were a contempt in the face of the court. Contempt of the court is contempt in the face of the court. What the legislation describes is not contempt in the face of the court, which means misbehaving in the courtroom. The legislation is trying to create something which does not exist and for this reason it should be deleted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The section deals with an important function of the proposed authority, that is, investigation of security services on its own initiative. Subsection (4) of the Bill provides that if a person does not comply or comply fully with the request by the authority, the authority may apply to the District Court for an order requiring compliance by the person concerned within a specified period. Subsection (5) provides <Col N="136"/>that in the event of non-compliance, the authority may apply to the court and, if it appears to the court that the person concerned has, without a reasonable excuse, failed to comply or comply fully with the order, the court may treat it as a contempt of court.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy said that either it is a contempt of court or it is not a contempt of court. As the Senator will be aware, the canons of construction require that every section be given a constitutional meaning, if possible. It appears that a constitutional interpretation of this is that if the authority applies to the District Court, and if the District Court is to deal with the matter constitutionally, it would have to inquire of that person before it dealt with them as a contemnor. It would have to give people an opportunity to explain themselves and argue, for instance, that any failure to comply with an order was reasonably based or something which was not within their capacity to do. As courts are bound to administer justice under the Constitution, that standard would be applied by operation of law and by constitutional doctrine to the application of this section. It appears unlikely that anyone would be dealt with other than entirely fairly and in circumstances wherein they would be given an opportunity to explain themselves and argue their point. After all of that, the court would have to say this is wilful breach of a lawful direction without a proper lawful excuse. In those circumstances only, we would punish that as though it were wilful breach of an order of this court. I do not see anything unconstitutional about that. I know there was case law to the effect that certificates of bodies where people had not complied with orders were regarded as <i>prima facie</i> contempt, which was regarded by the courts as dubious. I accept that if we were trying it here it would be a dubious thing. However, this is a different situation. A jurisdiction is effectively conferred on the District Court, which must proceed on evidence and on the basis of natural and constitutional justice. That jurisdiction confers on the District Court the ultimate right to say that a person who is failing to comply with the direction in regard to an inquiry is to be treated in the same way as if he or she had been guilty of disobeying the District Court order. This is a reasonable and practical way of dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to say these people are guilty of a criminal offence. That would mean that unless one went through the criminal process, one could not force one to comply with the reasonable requests necessary to keep an investigation going. In some cases, perhaps it would involve people delaying the whole procedure by simply pleading not guilty or whatever, and having a trial at a later stage. Given the constitutional principles of construction that apply and the fact that the <Col N="137"/>Constitution enjoins upon the District Court an obligation to proceed in accordance with natural and constitutional justice and in accordance with constitutional norms, there is no danger of the kind outlined by Senator Tuffy.</P>

	<P>I request the Minister to accept the amendment in order to ensure the Government of the day is accountable. It will ensure that when Deputies or Senators request information the Minister will be in a position to provide them with the information without having to refer<Miles com="jy"/>it to the authority. In the case of other State agencies, replies must be sent to them. This will make the Government accountable. It is a simple amendment and if the Minister is not prepared to accept it today, will he give us an assurance that he will answer questions about the operation and functions of the authority when he is asked them?</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The existing wording of section 16(5) is sufficient when it states that the authority shall give to the Minister such other information regarding performance as he or she may from time to time require. That is a broad and unqualified right that includes information for the purpose of debate and answering parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>There are certain functions when the statute provides that the authority is independent and the Minister cannot be accountable for those any more than the T&aacute;naiste would be accountable for the decisions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal. There are certain decisions which, if the authority is to be independent, cannot be issues of accountability.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are, however, subjects where the Minister of the day should be accountable. I explained to Deputy Deasy in the D&aacute;il that the old fashioned notion that because a body was outside the remit of a Minister, it should not be the subject of parliamentary questions because he is only responsible for his own Department is not sustainable. If a Minister has the right to ask for information, and is responsible for overall policy, he cannot escape parliamentary accountability by pointing out that the body is a distinct legal agency. The implication of that would be that the more agencies we create, the narrower the focus of parliamentary accountability. That may have been convenient to Ministers of all sides in the past, but it is contrary to the spirit of the <Col N="138"/>Constitution that the Government should narrow the obligations imposed on it by hiving off areas of responsibility to separate legal bodies. There is also a provision in law for the members of the authority to appear before committees and no Minister should refuse to answer a question where the information for a reply is readily available, especially under statutory powers.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This amendment would ensure that giving information under the section will not interfere with the disclosure of documents under the Freedom of Information Act.

	<P>This matter was debated at length in the D&aacute;il. The Freedom of Information Act provides for the extension of the Act to various bodies and states that it is a matter for the Minister for Finance, who is charged by law with this function. A decision on the application of the Act will have to be taken in accordance with normal procedures and I see no reason to depart from established procedures in this case.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act will have to be carefully applied when that happens because data in possession of the authority will consist of information on convictions, proceedings pending against applicants, sensitive information supplied to the garda&iacute; or others on criminal convictions or alleged criminal links and sensitive information that might have a bearing on State security, such as paramilitary involvement in the private security industry. One must tread carefully in all those areas and I prefer that the ordinary process envisaged by the Freedom of Information Act would be followed rather than making a decision on this matter today that might have a negative effect.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I raised this issue on Second Stage and the Minister said it would cause difficulties if every door man had to advertise in a newspaper but we think nothing of requiring people who apply for planning permission to do it. We could do it in such a way that it would not be costly, with a nominal fee. It is important, however, that there is accountability in the applications. The public have an interest in the granting of licences because those who get them will enjoy significant powers and financial gain. The public should have a right of objection.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 21 already makes extensive provision for the supply of information on an applicant&rsquo;s character, competence and financial situation and the verification by affidavit or otherwise of such information. A Garda certificate can also be demanded under section 21(3), while under section 34 the garda&iacute; may be requested by the authority to supply further information. Where a licence is granted, the provisions of section 26 and 39 will permit the authority to investigate complaints and, if necessary to protect the public, to suspend the licence for the duration of the investigation. Given those procedures and safeguards, the question to be asked is if requiring applicants to advertise their intention to apply for a licence would be justified and effective. There are sufficient safeguards in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>There would also be practical difficulties with an advertisement requirement along the lines set out in the amendment. Checking that each application had been advertised properly would create additional work for the authority without any guarantee of effectiveness. Such a requirement would encourage those with something to hide to advertise in local newspapers in other parts of the State or in a manner that would not attract attention. Transparency would best be achieved by the authority deciding to post on its website details of applications and unless there was some reason that should not be done in a particular case, that would give the requisite degree of transparency.</P>
    <P>The problem with advertising in local newspapers is that it is of little or no interest to me or to a person applying for a position of doorman in a premises in Ranelagh what is in the <i>Kiltimagh Observer</i>. It is of no assistance to me that the people of Kiltimagh have had notice of this application. Likewise, to ask every person applying for a position as a doorman to advertise in our national newspapers, which is the only way in a city such as Dublin that these matters would come to attention, would be an onerous responsiblity.</P><Col N="140"/>
    <P>In the case of people acting as stewards at the Curragh, for example, are they to be required to place advertisements in newspapers to announce they are applying for such a position? That could happen in an ideal world, if money were no object and if there were an army of officials to check that such a requirement had been complied with. It would be different if there was a way of deciding which is the appropriate newspaper and whether a person living in Kerry who proposes to be a security man at Croke Park should place an advertisement in a newspaper in Kerry or in a newspaper in Dublin. What appears to be a plausible idea seems to fall through one&rsquo;s fingers when one examines it closely. The proposal I made to the effect that the authority would adopt, as a matter of administrative transparency, a system whereby it would put up on its website details of people who apply for jobs would be sufficient public notification. I do not believe that advertisements in this respect in the <i>Kiltimagh Observer</i> would be much help to people in Dublin. It would give a false sense of security and the matter would be better dealt with in a different way.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This is an amendment to section 21(3). If the Minister is allowing the authority to require the type of verification listed in the subsection, he might as well make it a mandatory requirement. It is important that all the facts and details contained in the application should be verified. On the requirement to supply a Garda certificate, similar certificates are required for other purposes as a matter of form. When people wish to go on the supplemental register they are required to obtain a certificate signed by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Many such certificates will be required coming up to elections. I do not see why this requirement should not be made mandatory in this legislation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is preferable to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. I am sure the authority will demand a Garda certificate wherever it considers it appropriate and reasonable to do so. To require a Garda certificate in respect of each and every renewal would be excessive. As this industry is unregulated, we crudely estimate, taking account of part-time and full-time employees, that some 15,000 people provide security services in this State. The imposition of some 15,000 transactions annually on garda&iacute;, even if a chief superintendent or a superintendent were to take ten minutes per <Col N="141"/>transaction to provide the material which is not a significant amount of time to devote to each certificate, would take up a colossal amount of time. I am trying to free garda&iacute; from paperwork, firearms renewal work and fine collection work. To impose 15,000 annual transactions on senior Garda officers, which are unnecessary in many cases, would be excessive. Whereas I agree with Senator Tuffy that some transactions regarding passports and voting registration require Garda verification, that is not done at a senior level within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, it is envisaged that this certificate will be verified at senior level. I cannot lightly condemn senior Garda management to spending all their time handing out certificates every year to people in respect of many of whom they will be unnecessary in that they will have come to no adverse attention during the year.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I raised this matter during the Second Stage debate. It can be difficult to ascertain the beneficial owners of companies from the details provided by companies. It could happen that people behind the scenes who have records that are unacceptable could creep through because they have set up a company to hide them. I accept that is not the case in the vast majority of companies. This proposal does not impose a requirement, as initially suggested, to show the beneficial owners, but would allow the authority, if it is satisfied that this information is not available, to refuse to grant a licence, which would be an important power for it to have.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 2 defines a director as including any person occupying the position of director, by whatever name called, any person who effectively directs or has a material influence over the business of the body corporate, any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the body corporate are accustomed to act, unless the directors are accustomed so to act only on the basis of providing professional advice and, where the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its members, any of the members who exercises such functions of management. In effect, all persons who have a direct or a material influence over the business of a body corporate fall within the broad <Col N="142"/>definition of director, even if they are not registered under the Companies Acts as being directors of the company.</P>
    <P>Under section 21, the authority may require an applicant who is a body corporate to furnish information in respect of the character, financial position and competence of all persons who are covered by the definition of the term &ldquo;director&rdquo;. These provisions will ensure that the authority will be able to obtain information on the character and competence of shadow directors and persons who <i>de facto</i> control the company.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, the obligation on the authority under section 22(3) to refuse to grant a licence in respect of the character of directors and its power to require information are quite sufficient to ensure that anybody who is effectively pulling the strings behind a body corporate will be fully identified and that if an applicant is acting as a front for someone else, he or she will be at risk of misleading the authority and committing an offence or, alternatively, of losing his or her licence if he or she has in any way misled the authority. It is sufficiently strong as it is.</P>

    <P FLI="0">On Second Stage, the Minister agreed with me that garda&iacute; should not work in the security business in their spare time. Therefore, by inserting this provision we will strengthen the legislation. It is not good enough to state that other rules dictate that garda&iacute; cannot take part in this type of work.</P>
    <P>To use a phrase the Minister himself used, we are using a sledge hammer to crack a nut by using members of the Defence Forces in this context. These people are highly trained in combat and to have them working as door supervisors is inappropriate for many reasons. I ask the Minister to reconsider and accept this amendment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not changed my mind since the earlier debate in this House on the subject. The position in respect of the involvement of garda&iacute; and members of the Defence Forces in providing security services is as follows. In regard to the Garda, any such off-duty activity is already prohibited. Garda <Col N="143"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na discipline regulations define prohibited spare time activity as including, among other things, any activity which is prohibited by the Commissioner as inappropriate for members to engage in. Acting as directors or secretaries of security firms or being in any way engaged in security work as a spare time activity is so prohibited. Section 16 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, which is before the House, makes provision for statutory codes of conduct and on balance it would be more appropriate to deal with the off duty conduct of garda&iacute; in the context of such codes rather than the Bill we are discussing.</P>
    <P>Defence Forces regulations provide that involvement in off duty employment may be terminated or limited where such employment is likely to be prejudicial to the best interests of the service. I do not believe off duty soldiers should be told they cannot act as marshals at the Curragh races. I see no reason or basis for my saying that, in their own spare time, they cannot engage in such activity. I do not believe their involvement in dealing with violent situations with firearms and in self-defence makes them ineligible to act in places in which they could or might be required to use their skills in the course of their duty. The fact they are trained, disciplined and lead a disciplined life makes it less, rather than more, likely that they would abuse someone in a violent way compared to someone who has no such training or disciplined lifestyle.</P>
    <P>I differentiate fundamentally between members of the Irish Prison Service and the Defence Forces who, so long as they do not do something which is egregiously inconsistent with their main terms of service to the State, should be free to provide security services of this kind. That notwithstanding, it is inappropriate for garda&iacute; to do this because garda&iacute; will be involved in the enforcement of this legislation. In this case, such people would be dealt with by colleagues. For example, if garda&iacute; are working as doormen or are providing security services and are being recommended and certified by superintendents, everyone will start shouting and roaring that there is a conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>The nature of security functions are analogous to Garda functions but are not analogous to prison officer functions, except in a very loose manner. They are likely to be in situations in which members of the Garda will have to deal with them one way or another. In those circumstances, it is reasonable to say to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this type of work is off limits. The appropriate place to state that is in the Garda code, which is the position now. Garda&iacute; are not allowed to engage in this kind of behaviour as a matter of Garda discipline, provided for by Garda regulations, through which <Col N="144"/>the Commissioner may be in a position to state that members may do some things but not others.</P>
    <P>The code of conduct for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is to be incorporated into the Garda Bill which is already before this House, envisages a code of ethics which will be well worked out in advance and be subject to prior consultation with the representative associations, the Equality Authority, the Human Rights Commission and the Ombudsman Commission. In those circumstances, that code of conduct and the disciplinary regulations open to the Garda Commissioner under Garda legislation are the appropriate instruments to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>As currently advised, garda&iacute; may not provide any security services envisaged by this Bill, which is an appropriate and proportionate response. Whereas I accept that Senator Terry is acting in good faith in this matter, I do not see it is fair to put members of the Defence Forces into the same category and disqualify them from providing security services in their own time. The Defence Acts, as I remember from my days in the FCA, provide in section 168 or 169 that conduct prejudicial to the good order and military discipline of the Defence Forces is punishable under military law. Therefore, if someone does something which is prejudicial to good order and military discipline, which includes behaviour while off duty, it is capable of being dealt with under military law. My view is that it is not necessary to include the specific amendments being sought by the Senator.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We now have a European Convention on Human Rights law which requires every State agency to carry out its activities in a manner compatible with the convention. However, before there ever was a European Convention on Human Rights, there was an obligation under Irish law for everyone to comply with the constitutional values and for every organ of the State to discharge its functions in a manner compatible with the Constitution. Therefore, due process in all of these matters, which is implied by the Constitution and the convention as a matter of domestic and international obligation, requires that people be given an adequate opportunity to confront any case made against him or her. I have no doubt the procedures involved in the operation of this Bill will fully comply with constitutional and international human rights norms. It is not necessary to provide for detailed provisions of the kind mentioned in the amendment. We have the underlying guarantee that the security authority, being an organ of the State to which the European Convention on Human Rights Act and the Constitution already apply, will discharge its function in a manner which fully respects natural justice, the obligations of fairness and the entitlement to hear any party in respect of any decision to be made against him or her in a manner which allows him or her fully to confront any objection, subject to the ordinary rules of law in this matter. Therefore, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>The Bill has received good scrutiny here and in the D&aacute;il. The Minister must be complimented on bringing forward this legislation. This area has given rise to public concern and the need for regulation was evident. I compliment the Minister on dealing with the legislation in a comprehensive and fair manner. The Bill will reassure the public as to the manner in which security services are provided and that those involved in the industry are people of character who can be relied upon to do their jobs with integrity.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and his staff for coming to the House to debate this Bill. I welcome the Bill, although I would have liked to have had my amendments accepted.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On my own behalf and on behalf of my officials, who have dealt with this matter so efficiently, I thank Members for their kind words.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been a long time coming. It arises out of a 1997 report and was first published in 2001. Since becoming Minister I have regarded its passage as a priority, although it may seem otherwise. It is not simply that this sector needs regulation. There is a real and present danger that security functions are being abused by malign sectors of our society to act as extortionists and blackmailers in certain circumstances. Therefore, its passage is a matter of considerable urgency. When the matter was finally brought before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, I indicated that I regarded its passage as a priority for my term of office. I have put considerable emphasis on having the Bill enacted.</P>
    <P>Senators Tuffy and Terry have both remarked that they wish to be sure the Bill is effective. I share their wish. If the Bill is found to be ineffective I will not hesitate to act quickly to remedy any defects in it. It has been thoroughly debated in both Houses and has been carefully scrutinised by my officials to make sure it works. Significant amendments have been made to the Bill as it went through the legislative process and I must now bring the amendments made by this House to the D&aacute;il for its early approval so the Bill can become law.</P>
    <P>The point has been made on a number of occasions that the resourcing of the authority, especially in the preliminary stages, is a matter of significance. That is a point with which I agree. I have stated in both Houses that the legislation will be implemented on a phased basis, starting at the point where it is most necessary to make early progress, so the new authority is not overwhelmed by a mass of documentation that suffocates it completely and prevents it from getting on with the work.</P>
    <P>The Bill will significantly transform the security industry. It will prevent the small minority of participants from damaging the image of the industry and its standards. It is important legislation.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their co-operative and reflective debate on this measure. I join them in expressing the hope, not only that it will be passed very soon but that it will be implemented with equal dispatch.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister for Education and Science to consider fast tracking the opening of the Adamstown secondary school to cater for the growing number of children in Lucan primary schools.</P>
    <P>The land in question was rezoned in 1998 and has not yet been built on. When the local authority drew up the first strategic development zone plan for the area it set aside a site for a secondary school. More than that, there is a mandatory requirement that a permanent school building be put in place at a specified stage of the plan. If the builder does not fulfil this and other requirements he cannot move to the next stage of development. This requirement was an important step in planning and is an example for future development in other areas.</P>
    <P>When councillors were drafting the plan we were conscious of the problem of school places in Lucan and we felt the Adamstown secondary school could cater for the needs of the current school age population of Lucan as well as the future requirements of Adamstown itself. That was the intention of the council when the plan was drawn up.</P>
    <P>There has been a shortage of primary school places in the area and the Government has acted on this shortage. However, a bottleneck has now developed at the secondary school stage. Primary school principals in the Lucan area have a growing number of students who are coming to the end of their primary school careers and face the difficulty of finding secondary school places. Lucan Community College operates a lottery for places and other local schools, including St. Kevin&rsquo;s Community College which is just outside the Lucan area, are similarly full to capacity.</P>
    <P>Some local politicians have proposed that another school site should be identified. That is not what is required. Action must be taken on the Adamstown secondary school. The Government should take the initiative on this matter and not leave it to parents, who very often are left to push these issues. A committee is being set up by parents with children in the primary schools to deal with the issue of secondary school places. They are concerned that their children might not be able to find a place in the local secondary school.</P><Col N="148"/>
    <P>Rather than waiting until this issue reaches crisis point, the Government should start planning now for the secondary school in Adamstown. I am sure the developers and the council will work with the Government, the Minister and the Department in that regard. I have received replies from the Minister on this issue, which suggest that the Department thinks a site will be set aside. However, more will be done for the Department. The developers will build a school for it under the terms of the plan. This is an opportunity for the Government to act rather than waiting until there is a crisis and then responding by announcing in its construction programme for a certain year that it will do a number of things. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for providing me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position relating to post-primary provision in the Lucan area. At the outset it must be made clear that the educational infrastructural needs of the Adamstown strategic development zone, as it develops over time, are separate and distinct from those of the Lucan area and cannot alleviate any current difficulties that may exist in Lucan. The Senator did not suggest they could do that. It may be useful to expound on this statement for the House.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced strategic development zones to facilitate specified development of economic or social importance to the State. The aim of strategic development zones is to create sustainable communities rather than just housing developments. The schemes adopt a holistic approach to development and mixing land usages to ultimately provide amenities, facilities, services and employment and to enable the community to work, shop and recreate locally.</P>
    <P>Under the Act, the Government designated 223.5 hectares or between 400 and 500 acres of land at Adamstown to the south west of Lucan as a site for a strategic development zone for residential development. There is a minimum of 8,250 dwelling units and a maximum of 10,150 units permissible in the Adamstown zone. The population of the area is expected to be approximately 26,000. It is expected that this population will yield a demand for approximately 3,000 primary pupil places alone. At post-primary level, the demand is likely to be for a 1,000 pupil place school.</P>
    <P>All development within the zone is subject to a schedule of phasing. The purpose of the phasing is to ensure that infrastructure, services, facilities and amenities are provided simultaneously with residential development. To ensure flexibility, the proposed phasing schedule is sequential rather than time specific. There are 13 sequential phases <Col N="149"/>with the first phase being split into two phases and all but the last comprising 800 dwelling units. A post-primary school is required to be delivered as part of phase four of the plan.</P>
    <P>The zone plan, as prepared by South Dublin County Council and endorsed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, reserves a total of three separate sites for educational provision. Two separate primary sites, each of 1.2 hectares, are designated and a further primary school is envisaged to be part of a multi-school campus development on a four hectare site. The plan envisages that each of the 1.2 hectare sites can accommodate a school of up to 32 classrooms. On the four hectare site it is envisaged that the site can accommodate a post-primary school of 1,000 students alongside a primary school of 32 classrooms. It is clear from the projected school going population of the zone and from the general principle of sustainability underlying these zones that the planned educational infrastructure for the area is not intended to accommodate pupils from outside the defined zone area.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that Lucan is among one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country. At the 2002 census of population, the population in Lucan Esker had increased by 192% to reach a figure of 21,785. As a result of this huge growth in population, there have been some difficulties in providing school places. Such difficulties have been largely addressed by the Department of Education and Science, which worked with the school authorities in the Lucan area, and by a programme of substantial capital investment in the educational infrastructure of Lucan. Within the past five years a total of &euro;19 million has been invested in providing and upgrading educational provision in Lucan, of which &euro;12 million has been provided at primary level and &euro;7 million at post-primary level. This expansion is set to continue with three new schools due to commence construction this year &mdash; two at primary level and one at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>As regards post-primary provision specifically, there are four post-primary providers operating in the Lucan area. In total the four schools have a current enrolment of 2,420. Three of the four schools will receive major capital investment this year to significantly boost capacity. Capacity at one of the schools will be increased by 300 pupil places with the completion of a major extension project. A further extension project at a second school will also be completed this year, which will provide an overall capacity of 725 pupil places. This is deemed sufficient to meet demand from pupils in its catchment area. In addition, a project to provide a new building for a developing all-Irish college will proceed to tender and construction later this year. The new building will comprise 4,565 sq. m. It will cater for 600 pupils, <Col N="150"/>which is 400 additional places relative to existing capacity.</P>
    <P>A fourth school in the area appears to be at capacity with an enrolment of 827 pupils. While this is a popular school of choice, as the figures demonstrate, there is adequate capacity in the area to cater for overall demand, which is the primary concern of the Department of Education and Science. In addition, four schools in the adjoining areas to Lucan, namely, Palmerstown, Leixlip and Clondalkin have experienced a significant decline in pupil numbers over the past five years. The accommodation, freed up by this decline provides an option in terms of facilitating any further growth in the Lucan area.</P>
    <P>On foot of an unprecedented level of recent and continuing investment in schools in the Lucan area, pupil places will be increased by 25% over a period of five to six years. That demonstrates that the Department is tackling the issue of school provision in Lucan in a sustained and comprehensive manner and it will continue to do so into the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am unhappy with the response from the Minister for Education and Science. It is totally at odds with the intentions of the framers and adopters of the Adamstown strategic development zone plan who intended that the school would cater for the present population of Lucan and then for the people from Adamstown as it developed. It is typical of the Department of Education and Science to be bureaucratic about everything. It shows its inability to think outside certain parameters.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to respond, except to deny that the Department of Education and Science is bureaucratic. It seems from the figures I have imparted to the Senator during this debate that the contrary is the case. The Department is well aware of the problems and is providing for them in a sustained way. However, it cannot throw up buildings and create schools without looking to the long-term interests of the area. As the Senator is aware, it appears that the secondary schools in three of the adjoining areas have falling attendance numbers. When one is dealing with institutions which are up and running, one must bear in mind that resources are limited and that we must cut our cloth in accordance with available resources.</P>

   <Title>Training Centre Closure.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this matter on the Adjournment which relates to the closure of St. Mel&rsquo;s training centre in Longford. I thought we would have a celebration in Longford today as this is the proposed starting date for the refurbishment of the courthouse. The Minister saw the plans for that recently. However, the date <Col N="151"/>seems to have passed without anything being done. Perhaps that is not surprising given that it is April fool&rsquo;s day. I hope it will start in the coming week.</P>
    <P>The cuts in funding for St. Mel&rsquo;s training centre in Longford over the past 12 months have been in excess of the national trend of funding withdrawals for community employment schemes. These cuts have resulted in the schemes being reduced from 11 participants and supervisors to six participants and no supervisors. This situation is most unfortunate given that the cutbacks and the resultant threat to the future of this centre affect one of the most disadvantaged groups in our society, namely, the Travelling community.</P>
    <P>St. Mel&rsquo;s education and training centre opened on 1 September 1987, under the management of the Travellers Resettlement Committee, and had an initial group of 24 participants &mdash; 12 boys and 12 girls. At that time it was operated under AnCO, as F&Aacute;S was then known, and the emphasis was on skills or vocational training. The centre was one of 30 similar ones nationwide. With the improved participation in national schools by the Traveller community, the emphasis in the centre moved towards education. The takeover of the centre by County Longford VEC and the setting up of the further education section within the Department of Education and Science reflected the change, as did the setting up of FETAC, the Further Education and Training Awards Council.</P>
    <P>St. Mel&rsquo;s centre has evolved over the years and taken on a number of large scale projects, chief among which was the building of Michael Neary Park. This was undertaken in conjunction with Longford County Council, which provided the site, and in partnership with F&Aacute;S. During the course of the construction of the dressing rooms, showers and meeting room, a group of trainees, all Travellers, received training and certification in construction skills. This facility was opened in 2002 and provides a centre for Longford Wanderers FC, the local Travellers team, and is also used as a centre for homework clubs and so forth for the Traveller community. The striking monument on the Dublin Road roundabout at Kilnasavogue is notable for three black steel figures which greet the traffic approaching the town from the Dublin direction. It was entirely designed and made in St. Mel&rsquo;s and erected by the students and teachers.</P>
    <P>Up to 2002, the centre had a community employment scheme of many years&rsquo; standing. However, at the end of this year the scheme was vastly reduced. In fact, the scheme was subsumed under a much larger scheme known as Longford town suburbs. This arrangement lasted a mere 12 months up to last December. When the scheme <Col N="152"/>was renewed in late January 2004, it was reduced to six participants.</P>
    <P>This is a valuable and worthwhile project, which gives hope and dignity to one of our most vulnerable groups. Funding is the lifeline of any scheme but in this case it is the lifeline of a culturally and historically much marginalised section of our society. I ask the Minister to restore and enhance funding for this vital scheme. To see the work of years destroyed for lack of financial input is heartbreaking for the people who have given so much of their time and expertise to creating such a worthwhile endeavour and to those whose futures depend on their expertise.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the huge input of Sean Stakum, Josephine O&rsquo;Donnell, the county manager and my colleagues on Longford County Council. We have wholeheartedly supported this scheme for a number of years. It is a huge blow to those seeking progress for our county to see cutbacks of this nature occurring. The Minister has a big soft heart, so I am sure he will ensure that funding is provided for the continuance of the scheme. It is important for the people of Longford and particularly for the most marginalised in society. I would appreciate a positive response.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Bannon for raising this matter. I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who has responsibility in this area. The Department of Education and Science and Longford Vocational Education Committee provide core funding for St. Mel&rsquo;s training centre in Longford. The project in question is also supported by F&Aacute;S under the community employment programme.</P>
    <P>Community employment or CE was introduced in response to a sustained period of high levels of long-term unemployment. It is a temporary employment measure whose primary purpose is to provide temporary opportunities for unemployed persons whereby they can develop their skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience with a view to taking up employment in the open labour market. When CE was introduced in 1994 there were over 128,000 people or 9% of the workforce out of work on a long-term basis. This is no longer the case. At the end of 2003, the long-term unemployment rate was 1.4% or 25,900 persons.</P>
    <P>At its height, up to 40,000 people were employed in temporary positions on CE. In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s decision in 1999 to restructure the programme, participation levels have gradually been reduced over time to the current level of 20,000 places. This reduction is in line with the reduced levels of unemployment and a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports from which there is a greater level of <Col N="153"/>progression to employment. In addition to CE, in the region of 2,300 places have peen provided on the social economy programme and a further 2,200 places are available under the job initiative. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs plans to introduce a new rural social scheme during 2004 with up to 2,500 places, which will provide additional support for low income farmers and fishermen in rural communities.</P>
    <P>The allocation of CE places to individual projects is a matter for F&Aacute;S locally. F&Aacute;S is attempting to allocate available places as equitably as possible. Certain services are ring-fenced and places on these projects have been maintained, for example, CE health related services, child care and drugs task force places. Projects in RAPID areas are prioritised. The ring-fencing and prioritisation of certain services has resulted in the level of participation on other projects being reduced at a higher than average rate.</P>
    <P>A number of CE projects in Longford and, indeed, countrywide have been required to amalgamate with neighbouring projects due to the reduction in participation levels. The supervisory position is dependent on sufficient numbers of participants being employed on a project and it is not possible to retain every position of supervisor under these circumstances. St. Mel&rsquo;s training centre has already benefited from CE funding for over ten years. While it will not be possible to maintain the same level of funding in 2004, F&Aacute;S has indicated that eight participants have been allocated to the centre for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The total funding allocation for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at &euro;351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes &mdash; community employment, job initiative and social economy. F&Aacute;S is being given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services. This allocation of &euro;351 million is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003. Accordingly, there will be no further reductions in participation levels this year.</P>
    <P>The commitment to fund a continuing pool of up to 25,000 places across the three schemes brings clarity not only to the levels of activity which can be supported but will enable F&Aacute;S to give a clear commitment to the support of local community services over an agreed period of time. The future structure of the community employment programme is currently under review by a group of senior officials and F&Aacute;S, and this group is expected to report to Ministers on the outcome of its deliberations in the near future. The outcome of this review will inform any future adjustments in the structure and the <Col N="154"/>terms and conditions of participation on community employment.</P>

	<P>It is coincidental but I have been involved in the historical society that was instrumental in moving a motion at a council meeting in 1995 which ensured the courthouse would be preserved for court facilities. We did this because we did not see funding coming from any other quarter for the retention of a fine historic building constructed in 1798 in the centre of Longford town. I appreciate the great work the Minister has done to ensure that has come to fruition.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am a little disappointed with the response to this matter. The people involved in the scheme achieved great dignity through a sense of belonging to the community and through their involvement and participation over a number of years in training at St. Mel&rsquo;s. It was a worthwhile project. There are isolated projects throughout the country which should be looked at separately and maybe some funding should be sought to ensure their continuance. There are 30 such projects in the country and they are important to rural communities, for inclusivity and to provide for the involvement of people, irrespective of creed or status in society. A vulnerable section of the community which always felt marginalised was being supported by this project. Perhaps projects of this type should be looked at differently from the overall community employment schemes. It is something the Minister might take on board at a Cabinet meeting.</P>

	<P>The Senator raised one possibility and has tried to assist it by appealing to my well-known generosity. If there is any way a portion of the work to which the Senator paid tribute, which is work with marginalised sections of the community, could be assisted under the guise of equality and through any of the <Col N="156"/>programmes the equality section of my Department operates, I would look well on any application which could be stood up in that area. That is something the Senator might consider.</P>
