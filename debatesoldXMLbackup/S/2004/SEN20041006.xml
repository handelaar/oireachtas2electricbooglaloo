	<P>I have received notice from Senator Terry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report on the efforts made to date by his Department to identify and secure a more suitable location in Dublin 15 for the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the plans in place to provide extra funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the provision of new trains and carriages on the Dublin to Sligo and Dublin to Westport lines.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide disabled parking permits for children with autism so their parents can park in disabled parking slots.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Terry and Feighan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Browne, as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am requesting any Senator who asks the Leader a question on the Order of Business to remain in the Chamber until the Leader has replied. I appreciate that in some cases this may not be possible due to committee meetings being held at the same time but, where possible, Senators should show this courtesy to the House and to the Leader.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the House that I have received correspondence dated 29 September 2004 from the Secretary General to the Government regarding the appointment of members of the Government and Ministers of State. The notification will be included in the Official Journal of the House.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, a motion of referral whereby No. 19 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for discussion. It concerns an increase in the aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund from &euro;254 million to &euro;550 million, pursuant to the provisions of section 12(5) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001. The motion will be taken without debate. No. 2 is a motion of referral, to be taken without debate, whereby the subject matter of No. 18 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for discussion. This concerns the implementation of the increased entitlement to adoptive leave which was approved by Government on 14 October 2003 and arises as a result of the reduction in the compulsory pre-confinement period of maternity leave as introduced by the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004. No. 3 is a motion of referral, to be taken without debate, whereby the subject matter of No. 20 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Education and Science for discussion. This provides for the addition of 13 institutions to the 128 institutions already set out in the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. I have a list of the 13 extra institutions which are being added to those already in place. No. 4, Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business until 5 p.m., to resume after Private Members&rsquo; business and to conclude not later than 8 p.m. If remaining Members wish to speak on the Bill, I would be very anxious to facilitate them. We will watch the debate and count the numbers. With the permission of the House, I may propose an amendment to the Order of Business if we need to prolong the debate past the time allocated because many Members wish to speak on the Bill. The contributions of spokespersons are not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all Senators not to exceed ten minutes and Senators may share time. No. 21, motion No. 19, is to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>During the course of evidence given yesterday in the Special Criminal Court information was put into the public domain concerning documents found in the possession of individuals outlining the activities and move<Col N="115"/>ments of a number of Members of the Oireachtas over a period of time. While I do not wish to comment on the case currently before the courts, the matter is very serious in that some group of individuals or a self-styled organisation, in this case &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, has taken it upon itself to track the activities and movements of Members of the Oireachtas, gather information and put it into a document.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what this group intended to do with the information. It is crucial that the Members of the Oireachtas referred to in the evidence before the Special Criminal Court yesterday are informed of this fact. A committee of this House, probably the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, should examine this matter when the court case is resolved and a verdict given.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution, the duties and responsibilities of Members of the Oireachtas are fundamentally clear. No organisation, either illegal or legal, has a right to gather information on Members of the Oireachtas and do with it what it wishes. I ask the Leader to comment on this matter and to ensure that Members referred to in the document before the court yesterday are informed of that fact as soon as possible. It is a very serious matter and it should be treated as such.</P>
    <P>The second issue concerns the activities of the former chairman of Aer Rianta, Mr. Hanlon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should be careful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should watch it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand he has handed back the watches but he has not handed back the Merc he received from the semi-State company. I am not sure if the Leader appointed him as chairman of Aer Rianta&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
<P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Leader did not get a watch. Does the Leader agree that we need to review the entire procedure for appointments to semi-State bodies in light of this latest incident highlighted in the Aer Rianta case? In fairness to Senator Ross, he referred to the matter in this House last year and we had a good debate. This House has some role to play in putting forward a reform procedure for appointments to these bodies. I point out to the Leader that, as she well knows, in the dying days of a number of Cabinet careers, 73 appointments were made in the last two weeks by five Ministers. Is this what we really need for our semi-State sector?</P>
    <P>Does the Leader agree that a full debate on the question of the accession or otherwise of Turkey into the EU would be timely and useful? There are many voices in this House opposed to that proposition. A debate on this issue is required as is a full report from the Minister for Foreign <Col N="116"/>Affairs as to the position of the Government in respect of these accession talks.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first opportunity I have had to welcome Ms Jody Blake back to the House. I am delighted to see her in full health and back with us.</P>
    <P>I agree with the leader of Fine Gael, Senator Brian Hayes, in the expression of his concern about the seriousness of subversive groups gathering information about the movements of Members of the Oireachtas. In the past, this has always had very dangerous and serious implications in, for example, Northern Ireland and Britain. It is regrettable and it would be a good idea for a committee of the House to look into this. Free and unimpeded access and movement for Members of the Oireachtas in pursuit of their duties are at the very heart of democracy. It would be very dangerous if this were threatened so I support Senator Hayes in this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the watches, this type of thing is more or less inevitable. This is what happens as we move from a commitment to semi-State bodies to the market. In business, I am afraid, one gets this type of occurrence and we seem to be moving away from the commitment to the semi-State towards more entrepreneurial ways of dealing with these organisations.</P>
    <P>I ask for a debate on the situation in the Middle East, including the involvement of the United States in Iraq, the continued killing and injuring of civilians, the alleged precision bombing which often hits women and children and the continuing worrying situation in Israel and Palestine with the incursions into the northern Gaza Strip.</P>
    <P>Human rights are being violated in the Middle East. I have had contact over the last couple of weeks with people in south Hebron, about whose situation we hear nothing. It was described in detail to me and it is a direct parallel, only much worse, of the situation that obtained with the school children in Holy Cross convent in Belfast. Children are being terrified and attacked by settlers armed with bats and daggers while the police stand idly by. Conscientious, decent Israeli Jewish people who are trying to act as a buffer are also being attacked while the police stand by doing nothing. I would be grateful for a debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>I agree strongly with what the Cathaoirleach said about the discourtesy of Members leaving during the Leader&rsquo;s reply. I have had to do this on occasion to attend committee meetings, to which the Cathaoirleach also referred, and I have always tried to go over to her and explain. Time and again I have pointed to the disrespect shown to this House by almost all the committees which treat us in a cavalier fashion and which do not take into account that the Order of Business is one of the most important times in this House. The Cathaoirleach and the Leader should make representations to all the committees to stop this practice. One way to stop it, which I have suggested previously, would be the refusal of <Col N="117"/>Senators to attend committee meetings until the Order of Business is over. Those meetings would then not obtain a quorum and could not meet. That would be one way of putting manners on the committee organisers and I recommend it strongly. As I speak, I am supposed to be attending or be represented by my able colleague, Senator Ross, at the Joint Committee on Transport. However, I cannot be there because of the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, it emerged that 100,000 fewer people have medical cards now than seven years ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Incomes are higher.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>There are more jobs now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting to note that some Members think that is good. The chorus from the Government side suggests Fianna F&aacute;il approves of the reduction in the number of medical card holders. If Fianna F&aacute;il Members believe that people on &euro;142 a week can afford to pay &euro;50 to a doctor, we know the reason they got hammered in the local elections, namely, they do not know how the ordinary people feel. The figure of 100,000 fewer people with medical cards does not include the 200,000 with which Fianna F&aacute;il bought the election.</P>
    <P>Since last week, US immigration authorities operating in this State photograph and fingerprint people. Will the Leader establish on what legal basis this is being done? What they do in their country is their business, but what they can do in this State is written in legislation. There is nothing in our legislation about the taking of fingerprints or photographs. Garda&iacute; cannot ask citizens for their fingerprints unless they have a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. On what legal basis are Irish citizens in the sovereign territory of this State being asked to supply fingerprints to the agents of another state? Have we simply rolled over and invited George Bush to tickle our tummies, while we pretend it is not happening?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first time I have heard anything so succinct from Senator Norris. Normally his comments would run to at least three sentences.</P>
    <P>On successive occasions I have asked for a debate on inequality and poverty in this State. It is particularly appropriate to have this debate now that we have a new dynamic and committed Minister for Social and Family Affairs. One hopes the machismo the Minister showed in his trains, boats, bridges and cars regime will be displayed towards the greater problem of poverty and inequality in society.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal of Senator Norris for a debate on the situation in the Middle <Col N="118"/>East, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and on the slaughter of Palestinians. It would be worthwhile having this debate as soon as possible because it is an emergency situation. We should invite the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the House to outline his views and policies in this regard.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to consider arranging a debate on the issue of undocumented Irish people in America. This issue is related to what Senator Ryan said about the fingerprinting of people travelling to the United States as and from 1 October. This makes it extremely difficult for people without proper documentation in the United States to return home for funerals, weddings or other events.</P>
    <P>I came across a case during the summer where a person from Roscommon had to go through Canada where she was arrested and sent back to Ireland because she did not have the proper documentation. She had to return home with her boyfriend. She came to visit her father who was going for an operation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The authorities here are pretty good at sending people home too.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not need to go into such detail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand. On 14 July, we almost unanimously passed a motion on such undocumented people. We should have an all-party united approach on the issue because we all have a role to play. The matter affects every county and constituency. The Leader of the House raised the matter with the Taoiseach in July and he discussed it with President Bush at the time. Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue with the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, as it would be worthwhile?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s comments. It would be worthwhile finding out what authorisation the Americans had to introduce the recent changes at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>RTE recently broadcast a good programme on undocumented Irish immigrants in America. They are caught in a twilight zone because of restrictions introduced in the name of homeland security. Shannon Airport has been used for a considerable period as a stopover for the US military with the tacit approval of the Government. What has President Bush offered the State by way of recompense other than a series of restrictions on Irish people working in America, which have been reinforced by the recent changes introduced at Shannon Airport? What authorisation have US officials received for these changes?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the House for a debate on the <Col N="119"/>BreastCheck programme. Her predecessor, Deputy Martin, recently allocated &euro;20 million for the BreastCheck programme in the west and north west. However, the implementation of the programme will take at least two more years and, in the interim, more than 200 women in that area may die from breast cancer. It is neither fair nor good enough for the women of Ireland if there is a failure to put an interim strategy in place to address this problem. I ask that the Minister, Deputy Harney, come into the House to discuss this issue so we can put our ideas to her.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Ryan on the issue of the new photographing and fingerprinting procedures put in place by the Americans since 1 October.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the new, caring Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not acceptable in a democracy such as ours that we should be asked to stand like cattle in front of an American immigration agent and have our photographs and fingerprints taken when we have done nothing wrong. It is not good enough if the Government does not say that to Mr. Bush and the United States. It is not fair and I should not be asked to do it if I am travelling to the US. I would rather have a visa than travel and be treated like that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would point out, especially for the benefit of the next speaker, that 13 Senators are offering and I would like him to be brief.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the issue of watches raised by Senator Brian Hayes. Many served but few were chosen for favoured timepieces.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should raise issues relevant to the Order of Business. I do not like time wasting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always brief. There have been many differences between the Departments of Finance and Transport. Recently, there was a famous case of a severance package that had been approved by the Department of Finance but not by the Department of Transport. The Taoiseach assured us Government policy has not changed. He was referring to some of the more important issues and I accept that assurance. However, following the appointment of the new Dublin Airport Authority, how quickly will the badly-needed new terminal proceed?</P>
    <P>Does the Leader agree, given her experience in this area, that there might be clarity on the question of the Great Southern Hotels whereby the Dublin hotel will remain under the control of Dublin Airport and similar arrangements will apply at Cork and Shannon Airports? Does she think decisions will be clear-cut and the remainder of the hotels will be sold individually, as expected?</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made by Senator Norris regarding the issue raised by the Cathaoir<Col N="120"/>leach before I spoke. I will explain to the Leader privately what happened on a recent occasion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to consider arranging a debate on a form of abuse which, according to UNICEF, has affected approximately 140 million young women over the past ten years. Annually, 2 million women and young girls are at risk of female genital mutilation. This problem has arisen in many western countries with the influx of immigrants but is not usually discovered until something serious happens. The United Kingdom recently introduced legislation to address this matter. Perhaps we could broaden our debate to include discussion of suttee, honour killings and female infanticide. This important area is one we could do something to tackle. I hope any debate we hold will lead ultimately to the introduction of legislation to ban such practices.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>A recent court decision has brought the closing time of many more Dublin nightclubs back to 2.30 a.m. and resulted in the presence of increased numbers of people on the streets at one time with a consequent increase in conflict. It is therefore time to discuss once more the issues of violence on our streets and anti-social behaviour in general. We should also discuss, in light of recent events, other matters relevant to the Intoxicating Liquor Act, particularly decisions on whether to allow young children in pubs after 9 p.m. I ask the Leader to arrange such a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Sunday, 30 school children from Drogheda got into severe distress in the Mourne Mountains. Luckily, nobody died. While I am not here to assign blame, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to explain why there appear to be no guidelines in this area. Very strict guidelines exist in this area in Northern Ireland about the ratio of teachers to pupils, the training of guides, clothing and other matters. While one does not want to wrap kids engaged in outward bound activities in cotton wool, it is important to put guidelines in place.</P>
    <P>I advert to the issue raised by Senator Ryan in case he thinks my voice was part of the chorus which appeared to approve the reduction in the number of medical cards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it was not the Senator.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It may be a good thing but, then again, it may not. We should be aware of the poverty trap whereby people who go marginally over thresholds suffer great losses. Perhaps we could ask the Minister to address the matter on some occasion in the House as part of a discussion of a broader issue than that of medical cards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of the debate on the transfer of tried and sentenced persons on 23 June last, I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if he had any know<Col N="121"/>ledge of untried and unsentenced persons transiting through Shannon Airport. The Minister said that while he did not, if such people were transiting through the airport, they would be subject to the Constitution. He said I should contact him if I had any further news on the issue. I am sure some Members read an article by Fintan O&rsquo;Toole in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 28 September in which he detailed the activities of a Gulfstream jet which takes people from Kuwait, Egypt, Pakistan and so forth to Guantanamo Bay. The article stated that the aircraft has been seen at Shannon Airport, a contention corroborated by subsequent letters to the newspaper.</P>
    <P>Kofi Annan has said the war in Iraq is illegal and the courts in the United States of America have ruled that the detention of persons from that part of the world in Guantanamo Bay is illegal also. To avoid involving us in any illegality, which I am sure the Government would wish to do, I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this topic.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>A ship bearing plutonium has just arrived in France and we were very careful to ensure it did not enter Irish territorial waters. While I am aware this House has no influence on the progress of legislation through the other House, perhaps the Minister would give the new Chief Whip a little nudge to ensure the Law of the Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill 2001 which passed through this House three years ago, is addressed. That legislation is extremely important in the context of attacks by terrorists on such ships.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must ask a question appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise this in the context&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator may ask a question appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have ruled on the matter and that ruling applies to everybody.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with regret I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling. Perhaps the Leader will make time available in the near future for a debate on women in sport, an area in which they are often treated as second class citizens, particularly in the sport of which the Cathaoirleach is <Col N="122"/>fond. I would like at some stage to have the opportunity to pay tribute to the great Catherina McKiernan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s call last week for a debate on public private partnerships given, as he pointed out, that instead of a reduction of 6% in terms of costs, there is now an overrun of 20% in a number of schools selected for public private partnerships. Most people believe public private partnerships involve the use of somebody else&rsquo;s money. However, such funding is paid for by the taxpayer. It is time we had a full debate on the workings of public private partnerships for the provision of schools, roads, water services and so on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of nomination to the office of President is currently causing some controversy. Will the Leader provide time for a discussion, under any guise, on how the President is elected? Members will be aware that in the past week the President was re-elected. I believe it is unfair that a President can re-nominate himself or herself while all other candidates must secure 20 signatures from Members of the Oireachtas, something which no candidate was able to do. It is an issue on which this House cannot introduce legislation as it is a matter for the Constitution but we could provide some leadership lest this matter, like that of Seanad reform, disappears from the agenda from one election to another.</P>
    <P>The second matter I wish to raise relates not to the specific issue of the semi-State company which has caused so much controversy in the past 24 hours but to the lesson we must learn from it. The real difficulties we have with political nominations &mdash; although not in terms of their individual behaviour &mdash; relates to the instinct of a group of nominees loyal to one party or, particularly, to one Minister to thwart the wishes of future Ministers, thereby making it almost impossible for the semi-State body to function. It would be useful if this House could take a leading role in considering the abolition of political nominees and the introduction of new standards and structures to ensure new appointees carry out the wishes of the Government of the day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader intervene with the Minister for Education and Science as a matter of urgency following the result of the court case yesterday that leaves a family facing costs of over &euro;1 million, having unsuccessfully sought adequate help and educational facilities for their child through the Minister and the Department of Education and Science? It is unusual for the Minister to seek costs in such cases and I do not know why she would do so in this instance. Is this a new era or are we already implementing recently published legislation in which the previous Minister suggested court cases should be avoided in all possible instances? This is a serious case and I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister to allow the family, who have a child <Col N="123"/>with attention deficit disorder, to live their lives and provide for the child as best they can without this crippling debt.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have gone beyond time and I have five other Senators who wish to speak.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief. Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss endowment mortgages? Many people with such mortgages are in a frightful situation where the insurance policy will be inadequate to pay off the mortgage when the policy matures.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent weeks farmers received an outline statement of their provisional entitlements under decoupling and the EU single payment scheme. Some farmers got a bad deal, particularly those who were sick or had outbreaks of TB, brucellosis and other diseases on their farms. They were told that if they were not satisfied, they could submit an appeal or contact a lo-call query line, but many of them ran up against a brick wall when they tried to do so. As a result, the IFA will be coming to Dublin tomorrow to lobby Senators and Deputies on this and other farm-related issues. I am calling for the new Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the House to debate this issue, particularly when a minority may have been treated unfairly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The limit of &euro;317 on the back to school allowance has been in place for 11 years and it should be adjusted immediately. I was amazed to find out that there was a &euro;4 million underspend in that area. The Minister for Social <Col N="124"/>and Family Affairs should be called to the House to confirm an increase in that limit so families can benefit from this payment. It is ridiculous that it is so low.</P>

	<P>A pub in Galway was fined &euro;7,000 this week. While the proprietor might have deserved a fine, questions could be asked about its fairness. People are getting away with assaults in our streets but this pub has been severely punished. This House should debate over-regulation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators Norris and Leyden who asked for a debate on Iraq and on the situation in the Middle East and Israel. Those are reasonable requests and the House should respond with urgency. Another international situation exists where the scale of killing, death, destruction and slaughter is even greater and sadly does not seem to be the subject of major public outcry or numerous letters to <i>The Irish Times</i>, namely, the situation in the Darfur region of Sudan. It would be important to have a full debate on this issue so that a House of the Oireachtas and the country could condemn the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in that province.</P>
    <P>The House debated Seanad reform last week at the same time as the new Cabinet was being put in place. I ask the Leader to invite to the House in the next few weeks each of the new Cabinet Ministers to outline their policy proposals for the next 12 or 18 months. We could have the same type of discussion we had with the MEPs. Members of this House are spokespersons in various fields. It would be an opportunity for the House to hear what the Ministers are planning and for the political parties to respond in debate with them.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the new Minister for Education and Science to the House to outline her plans regarding school transport for children with special needs. I am aware of a special needs child in my constituency who has not taken up her place in the new college yet because the college cannot find suitable transport for her. This is a disgrace in this day and age. The Department of Education and Science should act sooner rather than later.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, raised the issue of the alarming situation yesterday where documents referring to movements of Oireachtas Members were discovered. I agree with his suggestion that this matter be discussed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. He asked about the chairman of Aer Rianta and the watches and what <Col N="125"/>happened the Mercedes car. I do not know what happened it; I was never the recipient of such generosity.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the review of Seanad reform. The Taoiseach has informed me that the new Minister has now received the letter instructing him to set up the committee. We have suggested a procedure whereby candidates for public office could enter into a scrutiny process and I hope this suggestion may be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes also asked about the potential accession of Turkey to the European Union. I understand the debate on the potential accession of Turkey is being held in the European Parliament today. It would be useful to have a debate in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris welcomed Ms Jody Blake, Clerk Assistant to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, back to full participation in the work of the House, as do all of us. He referred to the debate about Aer Rianta and asked for a debate on the situation in the Middle East and Gaza. The Senator referred to the practice of Members leaving the Chamber to attend meetings of joint committees. Senator Norris and I were in agreement not to attend meetings of joint committees when they clashed with the Order of Business in this House. Another Senator did not agree with our decision, thinking it high-handed. I thought it was quite a proper procedure. One cannot have a joint committee without Members from both Houses of the Oireachtas and meetings should not clash with the Order of Business in this House. I will make another request to the committees.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan stated that the number of people without medical cards has risen by 100,000 since 1997. While this is true, it is also true that there are far more people in employment. However, this does not take away from the fact that there are people on the margins of eligibility who, by reason of a few euro, do not qualify for a medical card.</P>
    <P>I am sure the new Minister for Health and Children intends to address this matter. It is all very well to say so many more people are in employment, and thankfully they are, but the eligibility limits for a medical card are far too low. Every Member of this House comes across one or two such cases each week. It is difficult for people on low incomes to manage a visit to the doctor and then to get their prescription. I hope the budget this December will alleviate this problem for many of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also asked about the legal basis on which Irish people will be photographed and fingerprinted in this country. What they do in the US is their own business. We must get answers to this and I will seek them. I will also seek a debate on inequality.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden requested that we ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, about the situation in Gaza. He also raised the situation of the undocumented Irish in the US. At the Senator&rsquo;s behest, we sent a letter <Col N="126"/>to the Taoiseach who replied that he had informally discussed the matter with President Bush, but nothing has come of it. We should have an all-party debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane supported Senator Ryan in terms of what rights the Americans have over Shannon. They have put in place a series of restrictions which are allegedly causing discomfort for all.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox spoke about BreastCheck. The Minister for Health and Children has extended this programme countrywide, but it will be two years before it is fully in place. Senator Cox was not here when you made your ruling earlier, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Why do you say that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I say it because I looked around and she was not there. I wondered about it.</P>
    <P>Several women have contacted me about the BreastCheck programme. Why should the service end for women once they turn 65? One is not about to collapse and die or be put away at the age of 65. Why should the BreastCheck service end for women at that age? In the UK the service is available for women up to the age of 70 and they are considering extending it. I do not understand why 65 is the cut-off point, as if to suggest, &ldquo;You are of no use after that age. Go back home and sit with your misery.&rdquo; I do not understand why people are not talking about this issue. There is no reason for a cut-off of 65 because in some cases, apparently, the incidence of particular types of cancer in women goes up after that age. That is something we could address.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Coghlan, the Dublin Airport Authority is in place. The Senator and I have had some jousting between us about the hotels. On all the occasions that we used these hotels, we paid our way like everybody else.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not offered them so it does not matter. However, it is odd that members of a board receive largesse but the Minister responsible is not offered any. However, I did not want to be offered any.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan asked what is to happen to the hotels and I will inquire.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon spoke about the issue of female genital mutilation and said there should be worldwide legislation against it. Some countries are <Col N="127"/>already bringing in such legislation. The UK has a population of many different races and we are approaching that in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Terry&rsquo;s point, on Monday I received a letter from Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Dardis, Brian Hayes and Ryan requesting an all-party debate on the report of the strategic task force on alcohol, which has just been released. The Senators would like such a debate to be placed on the agenda of the House as an all-party motion and I will do so. Hopefully, it will address some of the points Senator Terry raised.</P>
    <P>There will be a short Bill before the House next week concerning a loophole in the law. It does not address the issue of adolescents accompanied by their parents but the holding of discos in a hotel or bar at which no alcohol is served. Apparently, such events can still be challenged and the Bill will close this loophole. However, I will arrange an all-party debate on the task force report.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes raised a matter concerning 30 school children from Drogheda and the need to issue guidelines for children on school trips. I am aware that guidelines are in place in the North and the United Kingdom but not here. The Senator also raised the issue of medical cards, particularly the position of people with incomes marginally above the eligibility threshold. Income limits need to be raised and the issue of margins must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on a matter she raised with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in June. She also referred to ships transporting plutonium to France and a Bill the House passed three years ago which remains on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>Senator Wilson called for a debate on women in sport, which provided a good opportunity to mention the fine person he wished to praise.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I understand a Senator may not introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution.</P>

	<P>That is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will seek advice on the matter and get back to Senator Ross.</P>
    <P>The Senator also called for the abolition of political nominees. There is nothing wrong with having political beliefs and it is silly to believe that those with none have a halo. It is admirable to have political beliefs. To exclude everybody with a political persuasion from appointments and insist that everybody must be holy, whiter than white and declare they have no political beliefs would be rather odd. I have always believed it is good to hold, display and discuss one&rsquo;s political beliefs.</P>
    <P>We have had a media fracas about events in a particular semi-State company. Many other issues arise regarding such companies. There are vested interests which remain hidden but wield influence in many telling ways, as I know well. These interests are to be equally abhorred but people appear to be afraid to discuss the issue or bring it into the open. I am aware of instances of vested interests exercising considerable influence over various people in authority. They are reckoned to be wonderful, assertive, abrasive and dynamic &mdash; all highly charged adjectives &mdash; and are not condemned.</P>

	<P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to a court case involving a family. I understand certain facts which have not yet emerged will emerge shortly, although it appears dreadful on the face of it. I am indebted to Senator Minihan for that information. Senator Burke also asked for a debate on endowment mortgages. This would be helpful.</P><Col N="129"/>

On the Senator&rsquo;s request that each of the new Cabinet Ministers be invited to the House in the next few weeks to outline their policy proposals for the next 12 to 18 months, I made such a proposal last week. I said we would have each new Minister before the House on a rolling basis to lay out his or her stall and state what he or she wants to do. I am delighted the Senator agrees with me.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan asked that the Minister for Education and Science be invited to the House to debate school transport for children with special needs. If the Senator has a particular case in mind, it would make a very good matter on the Adjournment.</P>

   </Speaker><Col N="131"/>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators. I am very pleased to present this Bill to the Seanad. It marks the realisation of an important political commitment to establish a new statutory office of ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces ombudsman will effect an historical transformation of current military redress procedures. The ombudsman will, in most cases, replace the Minister for Defence as the final point of appeal in the statutory Defence Forces redress procedures provided for in the Defence Act 1954.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that the late John Lucey, the former General Secretary of PDFORRA, was a most committed and articulate advocate of the case for a statutory Defence Forces ombudsman. He had campaigned tirelessly for the establishment of such a position over many years. I trust that this legislation will act as a fitting memorial to him.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the key role played by my predecessor in office. Deputy Michael Smith was personally committed to the concept of the Defence Forces ombudsman as a specific policy objective during his term in office.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House differs in certain important aspects from the legislation as originally initiated in the D&aacute;il on publication in January 2002. In the immediate aftermath of publication, there were very positive and constructive consultations with the representative associations, PDFORRA and RACO. In the interests of promoting the widest possible consensus in support of the legislation and of the new ombudsman, a number of important substantive ministerial amendments to the published Bill were brought forward on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il by my predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith. These important ministerial amendments were accepted by the D&aacute;il and I will describe them after a brief review of the more general purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of the office of the Defence Forces ombudsman and for the appointment of an individual to that office by the President upon the recommendation of Government. The Bill defines the functions of the ombudsman and sets out the general right of Defence Forces personnel to make a complaint to the ombudsman. The limited circumstances in which the ombudsman shall not investigate particular defined types of complaint are also specifically set out.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the ombudsman with considerable independence and autonomy in the discharge of his or her statutory functions and in the conduct of investigations. Military personnel are assured of complete independence from the Minister, the Department of Defence and the military authorities in the investigation of complaints.</P>
    <P>Senators may find it helpful if I briefly outline the nature of the existing statutory mechanisms for redress within the Defence Forces. There is an existing system of complaints inquiry which is available to all serving military personnel. Section 114 of the Defence Act provides for application <Col N="132"/>for redress by military personnel who believe that they have been wronged by another member of the Defence Forces. In 1996, this system was modified administratively with the introduction of an external complaints inquiry officer, CIO, appointed directly by the Minister to act in an advisory capacity. The advisory role of the CIO was introduced into the redress procedure on an agreed basis following extensive consultations with the representative associations at conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>Individual complaints brought before the Minister could be referred to the CIO at the discretion of the Minister for independent review. The CIO then made recommendations to the Minister. At that time, in 1996, it was agreed that the question of a statutory Defence Forces ombudsman could be considered at a later date, in light of practical experience with and in the context of a subsequent review of the operation of the informal CIO system.</P>
    <P>That review commenced towards the end of 1999. The CIO was then dealing with some two dozen cases a year on average. The review identified a continuing demand among enlisted personnel at Private and junior NCO level for a more transparent, independent and statutorily rigorous procedure, which would be clearly seen to be independent of the Defence Forces chain of command, of the departmental secretariat and of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There have been other more recent developments which have again highlighted the importance of ensuring that military personnel have faith in grievance procedures. The Doyle report surveyed perceptions and experiences of unacceptable workplace behaviour in the Defence Forces. During the course of her detailed investigations, Dr. Eileen Doyle found a serious lack of confidence in the existing internal military complaint procedures. This lack of confidence was found to be widespread and particularly so among enlisted personnel.</P>
    <P>The Doyle report was published in March 2002. While the Bill providing for the new ombudsman was by then already published, the findings of the Doyle report were indeed very disturbing. These findings were based upon extensive research undertaken by Dr. Doyle and her expert team. Dr. Doyle&rsquo;s report showed real and widespread perceptions of bullying and other forms of unacceptable behaviour within the Defence Forces. The report underlined the need for an independent statutory mechanism for the investigation of complaints. Dr. Doyle&rsquo;s report and recommendations were fully accepted. The military authorities responded decisively.</P>
    <P>An independent monitoring group chaired by Dr. Doyle herself has been overseeing the implementation of fundamental reforms in the period since 2002. This major enterprise involves the top military authorities, the Department and the representative associations. The follow-on progress report, Response to the Challenge of a Workplace, was launched on Friday, 24 September by <Col N="133"/>my predecessor. This latest document details the significant degree of progress made so far and sets out an agenda for further action for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been accomplished over the past two years since the original Doyle report. This process of change will be continued and developed into the future. Indeed, a further detailed survey and review of the Defence Forces&rsquo; working environment will be carried out by 2007, as recommended by Dr. Doyle in her recent progress report. The findings of that study will also be made public.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have demonstrated a genuine commitment to the difficult process of cultural change within their organisation. The representative associations have also committed themselves fully to the process. Their role, in particular, is crucial. We are all well aware that securing fundamental and irreversible changes in workplace culture and attitudes is never simple or easy. However, real leadership can establish and maintain the proper environment throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Seen within the wider context of these other developments, it will be appreciated that the appointment of an independent statutory ombudsman will be of major importance in developing a positive working environment for members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The new Defence Forces ombudsman will investigate complaints with a view to ascertaining whether an action complained of may have been unreasonable, arbitrary, improperly discriminatory or otherwise inconsistent with sound and fair administrative practice. The ombudsman will be statutorily independent in the course of investigations and in the performance of his or her duties.</P>
    <P>At present, a complaint may be finally brought before the Minister for Defence, where an applicant so wishes, after the various levels of appeal within the military system, up to and including the Chief of Staff, have been properly utilised. The present right of referral to the Minister for Defence will be now replaced, in nearly all cases, with a right of referral to the Defence Forces ombudsman.</P>
    <P>However, the published Bill was amended on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to ensure that the right of referral to the Minister will be now retained in those clearly defined circumstances in which the ombudsman is specifically excluded from access under the Bill, but where there would be access to the Minister under current arrangements.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I would refer Senators to the entirely revised text of section 13 of the Bill as now amended. These specific sets of circumstances relate to security or military operations, as defined in the Bill; matters relating to the organisation, structure and deployment of the Defence Forces; and matters relating to the administration of military prisons.</P><Col N="134"/>
    <P>The Bill also provides that any complaints concerning actions predating the commencement of the legislation will continue to be dealt with by the Minister on a transitional basis. Generally, the ombudsman will become involved in examining a complaint where a complainant has had full recourse to the internal military redress system, up to and including the level of the Chief of Staff; those procedures have been exhausted; and the ombudsman forms an opinion that the complainant has an apparently bona fide and justified cause of complaint or grievance, which in the opinion of the ombudsman has not been satisfactorily redressed or resolved.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman will also be accessible to former members of the Defence Forces, subject to the specified time limits. The present redress procedures are confined to serving members and to persons serving at the time of initiation of their complaint. Conversely, it will be entirely for the ombudsman at his or her own discretion to refuse any trivial, vexatious or manifestly unreasonable or foolish complaints, or to refuse complaints where the internal military redress system has not been properly utilised.</P>
    <P>The military environment poses quite specific challenges to the traditional concept of an independent ombudsman. There is a delicate balance to be drawn between the need to provide appropriate rights of access to the ombudsman on the one hand and the need to safeguard military lines of authority on the other.</P>
    <P>From the outset, great emphasis was placed on minimising the level of restriction upon the remit of the new ombudsman. Nevertheless, in order to ensure that this intention would be fully realised in practice, a major ministerial amendment was made to the definition of &ldquo;military operation&rdquo; on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>While military operations will be excluded from the ambit of the ombudsman, the substantive redefinition of the term &ldquo;military operation&rdquo; by ministerial amendment on Committee Stage now clarifies the term with some precision. The term &ldquo;military operation&rdquo; should only encompass actual operations in the field. The new definition of &ldquo;military operation&rdquo; will thus maximise the remit of the ombudsman to the greatest practical extent as regards the type of circumstances falling within the scope of the new ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The original definition in the Bill as published was the cause of some serious concern to PDFORRA. The association was of the view that the original definition was potentially open-ended and could be interpreted as covering a vast range of every day routine military circumstances, thus greatly perhaps impeding the effectiveness of the new ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Some other exclusions are, of course, self evident. For example, the ombudsman will not be able to investigate a complaint where a legal action has been initiated. The ombudsman will not become involved in matters within the remit of the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme and the representative associ<Col N="135"/>ations. Matters relating to the organisation, structure and deployment of the Defence Forces, and matters relating to the administration of military prisons will also be excluded from the remit of the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Security matters will also be outside the remit of the ombudsman and the Minister will retain the right to request the ombudsman to desist from an investigation in such an area. The ombudsman may, however, apply to the High Court and seek a direction from the High Court if such a situation should ever arise. I am confident that the number of complaints falling outside the statutory remit of the ombudsman will be very small indeed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to submit this legislation, as amended by the D&aacute;il, for the consideration of the Seanad. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide access to a statutory Defence Forces ombudsman marks a development of major significance for the Defence Forces. This important legislative measure will serve to assist in the cultivation and maintenance of a modern working environment which will benefit all ranks within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe this Bill represents above all a sensible and practical model for the operation of the Defence Forces ombudsman. This is a real response to a widespread desire for modernisation and reform of the redress procedures among military personnel themselves, and particularly so among those in the enlisted ranks. I look forward with anticipation to hearing the views and contributions of Senators in their deliberations and reflections on the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on his well-deserved promotion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his elevation to ministerial rank. I wish him well and I have no doubt he will do an excellent job as Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I broadly welcome the Bill, the provisions of which are important. One criticism I have is the long delay in getting the legislation through the House. It will soon be three years since the Bill was first published. It should now be progressed with all due speed.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces personnel, on whom we all rely, should have the protection of a dedicated ombudsman without any further excessive delay. The debate this afternoon is timely. At the opening of the annual conference of the association representing Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service personnel, PDFORRA, it was claimed that Defence Forces personnel are being coerced into serving on overseas missions. Speaking at the event, the association&rsquo;s vice-president claimed this was a move away from the principle that volunteers would be considered for service first <Col N="136"/>before others are requested to serve on certain missions.</P>
    <P>In line with these concerns, it is right and proper that we should consider the working conditions of our Defence Forces personnel. We cannot expect our enlisted personnel to serve under regulations, conditions and codes of discipline drawn up in another time and age, when the emphasis on fair and decent working conditions was not as stringent as it is today. These days we properly place a high value on human rights and fair employment regulations. The employment conditions governing our Defence Forces must be subject to these high standards and must adapt to modern requirements and acceptable codes of practice.</P>
    <P>When appointed, the ombudsman for the Defence Forces will fulfil a crucially important role. The legislation clearly states that the ombudsman shall be independent in the performance of his or her functions and may investigate any action that is the subject of a complaint made by the person affected by the action. In clearer terms, this should allow the ombudsman to investigate any form of bullying, abuse or bad treatment meted out to a member of the Defence Forces. The function of the ombudsman is, therefore, of great importance to Defence Forces personnel. We should not forget the findings of the 2002 Doyle report which examined harassment, discrimination, bullying and sexual harassment in the Defence Forces. Some 20% to 30% of soldiers surveyed experienced difficulty in each of these categories, which is unacceptable. Soon after the publication of this report, the then Minister for Defence stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">I would like the message to be loud and clear that the practices identified in the Doyle report should have no place in today&rsquo;s Defence Forces. They are contrary to the best interests of the men and women who are the Defence Forces and to the organisation as a whole.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I wholeheartedly agree, but I must say that for a Government which claims to have the best interests of Defence Forces personnel at heart, the delay in progressing this legislation is to be deeply regretted.</P>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces must be able to bring their concerns and grievances to an independent forum such as an ombudsman. The Doyle report also revealed that 75% of those surveyed believed they could get away with bullying in the Defence Forces. An independent ombudsman would be very effective in dealing with these serious problems. If an ombudsman for the Defence Forces is not created, these trends may continue and create further serious difficulties. The State has both a legal and moral responsibility to provide members of the Defence Forces with a working environment that is safe and meets 21st century standards. Therefore, allowing unacceptable types of behaviour within the Defence Forces to go unchecked is not an option. Every person has the right to work and serve <Col N="137"/>their country without having the appalling spectre of abuse or harassment hanging over him or her. Such people must have access to a fair and impartial office that can offer them assistance in the resolution of their grievances. To allow this type of behaviour to continue would have a dreadful effect on morale in the Defence Forces. We cannot expect our personnel to serve with the type of courage and excellence they have displayed time and time again unless their morale and confidence in the forces is maintained.</P>
    <P>Given the vital role the Defence Forces play in our society, their members operate under some unique working conditions. Their own representative bodies have the right to negotiate remuneration, working conditions and similar matters. However, they cannot recommend to their members that they should adopt strike action in the event of a serious grievance with the Government. Given the importance of the Defence Forces, this is an understandable restriction, but it also means that we must put in place different procedures that will protect the members from abuse. The appointment of an ombudsman to the Defence Forces will be an important step in this direction.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns about the specific provisions of the legislation in certain areas. For example, the Bill as drafted gives the Government considerable sway over the ombudsman, including setting the length of his or her term. For some reason, the Government in this legislation has seen fit to depart from the provisions applied in the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. As with the Defence Forces ombudsman, the President appoints the Ombudsman for Children. However, a major difference between the provisions of this legislation and those establishing the previous three ombudsmen lies in the age of retirement. In the previous three Bills, the age of retirement is set at 67 years of age, whereas in this Bill the Minister for Defence may set it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill, the Government will have the power to dictate for how long an ombudsman may serve, and there is no restriction on a person serving for longer than two terms. This is a departure from the previous legislation and Fine Gael will table amendments at the appropriate time. Similarly, I have concerns that the ombudsman should not only have the authority to investigate matters referred to him or her, but should also have the power to instigate an investigation of his or her own volition. This power is essential to the independence and effectiveness of any ombudsman of this kind.</P>
    <P>We should compare what is being proposed in this legislation with the type of procedures that exist in other countries. For example, the ombudsman for the Canadian defence forces can hear complaints from a much larger range of people than the proposed Irish Defence Forces ombudsman. In matters relating to the Canadian forces, those eligible to file complaints with the Canadian ombudsman include current and <Col N="138"/>former cadets, members of the Canadian forces, employees, applicants to the Canadian forces and family members of any of the preceding. The legislation we are debating today could benefit from the lead taken by the Canadian ombudsman by expanding the range of those eligible to file complaints. Currently, the Bill places strict limits on who can file complaints. Expanding this right to other people related to the Defence Forces, whether cadets, families or members of the Defence Forces, would help guarantee that the rights of these groups are protected.</P>
    <P>Taking action against bullying or harassment in any working environment is very important. However, with the codes of discipline and chains of command that are commonplace in any modern defence force, highlighting bullying or harassment can become even more difficult. Currently, there is a clear perception that when it comes to the defence forces, both here and abroad, it is difficult to have a personal grievance investigated objectively. For a person with a grievance, it takes considerable courage to bring it to the attention of higher ranking officers. This results in many grievances and complaints being buried and overlooked.</P>
    <P>The role of the Defence Forces is critical to the functioning of the State. Members of the forces have served with courage and considerable honour with the United Nations. They serve today on one of their most challenging deployments yet, in Liberia. Our Defence Forces personnel deserve the protection of an independent, dedicated ombudsman and I hope this legislation will progress through the House without further delay.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, to the House and congratulate him on his elevation to the Cabinet. Members have worked with him and seen his work in many Departments as Minister of State and his commitment and dedication in those roles will bear fruit for him in his new position as Minister. I wish him well. As a neighbour of the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, I thank him for his dedication in pushing this legislation forward and for his outstanding work for the Defence Forces. I also mention, as the Minister did, the late Mr. John Lucey, the former general secretary of PDFORRA, who was a committed and articulate advocate of the case for a statutory ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which is the purpose of this Bill. We must recognise his outstanding work.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish the office of ombudsman as an independent, statutory entity to which complaints can be forwarded in cases where a person is not satisfied with the responses obtained from the military authorities to a formal complaint under the Defence Act provisions for the redress of wrongs. In this area, it is timely that the Minister has come into office to move this important legislation forward. The Bill clearly sets out the functions and staff of the ombudsman and amends the Defence Act 1954, setting out the <Col N="139"/>terms and conditions under which the office of the ombudsman shall operate and detailing the framework and nature of the complaints that may or may not be investigated by him or her. The new ombudsman will be provided with clear and precise statutory powers of independent inquiry and investigation, closely modelled on those of the original ombudsman legislation of 1980 but reflecting somewhat the unique circumstances and demands of the military environment.</P>
    <P>The legislation has the potential to offer members and former members of the Defence Forces a truly independent forum for dealing with complaints and related injustices. No organisation has the capacity to deal effectively with all complaints involving people at different levels within the system. The Defence Forces are no different in this regard. Can the Minister confirm whether the legislation also covers voluntary members, such as those of the FCA? Perhaps he might come back to that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The important issue of bullying and harassment in the Defence Forces has long needed to be tackled. Thankfully, the day of bullying or harassment in any organisation is long gone. I am delighted that this issue is being addressed. An independent, confidential helpline and counselling service was launched earlier this year and an independent body will design, administer and analyse an exit interview questionnaire to establish the views of Defence Forces personnel on their experience of military life. This must be welcomed and, alongside the improvements that have taken place in the Defence Forces over a number of years, will give a good incentive for young people who are interested in joining and a real opportunity for them to feel that they have a chance to be part of the forces in the confident knowledge that all steps are being taken to ensure that they will be safe in that working environment. The message must go out loud and clear that bullying and harassment will not be tolerated anywhere. The Minister and other Members have made this point. The Bill will enhance the position of the Defence Forces as one of the best in the world. There may be many points about the Bill which Members will want to raise on Committee Stage and I am sure that the Minister will explain these points in detail.</P>
    <P>Most people have had some experience of dealing with members of the Defence Forces or have served in some capacity within the forces. I spent five years in the FCA, an experience I enjoyed. We took part in an annual camp every year, sometimes in Finner Camp in Bundoran. I never experienced problems with any members of the Defence Forces. We enjoyed our times there and participated Sunday after Sunday, shooting on the rifle ranges, and we visited other places, such as the Curragh. My own division, C company, 16th infantry battalion, in Tullamore, held the all-Army rifle shooting championship on many occasions. As is said in the midlands, we had some crack shots in that battalion. Some people <Col N="140"/>seem to enjoy disparaging our Defence Forces but I emphasise that in my time in the FCA I dealt with thorough gentlemen who were highly trained and skilled and possessed of a great sense of care for those assigned to their tutelage. I also wish to mention the members of the Defence Forces I have known who have made a major contribution in their communities, whether to sport or to the many other voluntary organisations in their areas.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister mentioned the in-depth analysis contained in the Doyle report which considered the role of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces. People in charge in the forces took on board the views expressed in that report by Dr. Eileen Doyle, as outlined by the Minister. That report put in train what the Minister is now progressing with this Bill. His concluding remark was that the Bill represents above all a sensible and practical model for the operation of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces. It was a response to a widespread desire for modernisation, reform and redress procedures and also of military personnel, particularly those in the enlisted ranks. I compliment the Minister and the officials who were party to the drawing up of the Bill and look forward to hearing the contributions of other Members. I also thank the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator O&rsquo;Meara.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the speed with which the Government has brought forward this Bill. We were all alarmed at Dr. Eileen Doyle&rsquo;s report. We are glad it has been dealt with so rapidly and that she is monitoring the situation. We have great respect for and pride in our Defence Forces and it was sad to see such a large proportion felt they were subjected to bullying and harassment, sexual or otherwise. It is good to see Government has taken such quick action on the issue.</P>
    <P>The definition of military operations was expanded in the D&aacute;il, but I am not in a position to say whether it is satisfactory. Therefore, I take great interest in what members who have served in the Defence Forces say. We must recognise that there is a vast change in what we expect our military personnel to do. The role of being in charge of State security was clearly laid out, but now the forces have a major role in human security. We have congratulated our forces on what they did, and are doing, in Liberia and I spoke in the House to welcome the fact that they were going. I was particularly glad they were going out to work with an African contingent from Nigeria. It was something to go to Liberia to try to deal with an army of children, especially since there are serious problems there involving voodoo. I <Col N="141"/>have been to West Africa and know that large numbers of the population believe what they are told by witch doctors, such as, for example, that bullets will pass through them. We can imagine the perils faced by our forces and how matters might have worked out when faced with a hail of bullets going into mobs of children. I congratulate the forces on the work they have done in Liberia.</P>
    <P>I was very taken by a report I read some time ago by Mary Kaldor, a professor of global governance in the London School of Economics. She was the convenor of a study group on European security capabilities. The group examined human security in particular and commented that this was what armies were increasingly being called upon to protect rather than state security. It pointed out how much more difficult this could be.</P>
    <P>We frequently hear about the Congo and its difficulties and the difficulty of dealing with child soldiers. Professor Kaldor refers in her report to the emergency in Ituri, where various militias, including thousands of young children, were involved in the laying waste of towns, looting, raping, carrying out massacres and the uprooting of tens of thousands of people. The UN-backed mission that went there did not stay for long and its follow-up was slow. The mission succeeded in stopping massacres and created security on the ground. However, we know the problem is recurrent in such places. Therefore, we must have trained troops that can go into such areas and deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the major change in the types of missions on which our troops are sent abroad. I was sorry to hear PDFORRA report on radio this morning from its meeting in Donegal that some of those sent abroad were not volunteers, because I always thought we only sent volunteers. Some people who have specific training that is urgently needed in some areas are sent out on further unsought tours of duty. Perhaps the Minister will address that matter on the conclusion of this debate. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation so rapidly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his recent appointment. I note that he acknowledged the commitment of the previous Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, to this legislation, which, following amendment in the D&aacute;il, bears his stamp.</P>
    <P>The legislation is welcome. The principle of establishing an ombudsman for the Defence Forces is welcome. We hope this will usher forward a new era for the forces. The Doyle report, the basis on which this legislation is being brought forward, was disturbing. It showed there was an unacceptable level of sexual harassment taking place within the Defence Forces, and not only of female members. We know women are not the only victims of sexual harassment. In recent years we have had too many disturbing reports indicating there is a culture of bullying and harassment within the Defence Forces. This is unacceptable <Col N="142"/>to the Oireachtas and does not reflect society&rsquo;s view of what is tolerable or acceptable in the forces. This legislation, together with other initiatives based on the recommendations of the Doyle report which the previous Minister was not slow in bringing forward, will ensure we encourage a new culture within the Defence Forces of which we can be proud and which will reflect society&rsquo;s aspirations.</P>
    <P>The principle of an ombudsman as a pillar of accountability is well established and the role has become important. The establishment of that role for the Defence Forces sends an important signal which I hope will be accepted by members of the forces, particularly those with a grievance. The office will be independent and will provide an important resource outside of the system. The Defence Forces need to maintain a culture of discipline and obedience and the ombudsman will face a delicate balance in ensuring that discipline is maintained.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s proposals with regard to amendments put forward and accepted in the D&aacute;il. They have strengthened the Bill and show the level of openness with which the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, accepted the views expressed by Members of the D&aacute;il, particularly the Opposition. I appreciate in particular the definition of military operations. It is when we examine the exemptions that we can see how the legislation will apply. While the principle is important, it is important that we examine the nuts and bolts of where the ombudsman will or will not have power. I look forward to doing that on Committee Stage. I hope the legislation before us will be further enhanced by our consideration on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment. I wish him well in the challenges facing him in the changing environment of the Defence Forces and pay tribute to his predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, who presided over major changes therein. While we may not always have seen eye to eye and locked horns on numerous occasions, I acknowledge the tremendous work he did during his term as Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I approach the debate from a unique position, having been a member of the Defence Forces for 21 years. The legislation could not have been contemplated when I enlisted in 1975. While considering it, I wondered whether I was bullied or whether I engaged in bullying. That is the magic question. It is terribly difficult to apply civilian standards and rules to a military force and there is a fine line. All Members can speak with the mind of a civilian about the role of an ombudsman in addressing wrongs and bullying, in particular as it is straightforward and easy to do so. We are all aware of the plethora of welcome, necessary Bills that have been introduced to address bullying in the workplace, which I fully support. However, one cannot apply such legis<Col N="143"/>lation to the armed forces. The legislation can be adapted, modified and made to fit because it is needed but it should be examined in detail.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the legislation, I wish to highlight its uniqueness. No chief executive or manager has command or control over a lethal force. The legislation applies to military institutions, procedures and operations. I accept military operations have been defined under the legislation but if I am engaged in a military training exercise and I must deal with a scenario which ultimately could lead to the saving of lives, and I shout at and harass a soldier or his colleagues, am I bullying? We must be careful about such issues.</P>
    <P>I refer to a comment made by Senator O&rsquo;Meara. The level of bullying and harassment in the Defence Forces is not disproportionate to that which takes place in civilian organisations. We should not think a bullying culture within the Defence Forces has gone unnoticed and unchecked for many years, thereby necessitating this legislation, because that would be unfair.</P>
    <P>A system for redressing wrongs has been in operation under the Defence Act and it has served the military well. I have been involved in administering, processing and adjudicating at various levels within that system and, on occasions, we found in favour of the complainant. The rank structure within a military organisation is unique and the responsibilities and control mechanisms provided to ensure a military force operates efficiently and effectively are also unique. At times the manner in which directions and orders are dispensed is not similar to that used in a civilian organisation and that must be acknowledged. The legislation, as drafted, and the Committee Stage debate in the Lower House reflect that point. However, I ask Members to consider the uniqueness of the legislation and ensure it is adapted.</P>
    <P>I refer to the history of the Defence Forces since the foundation of the State. When they were founded, there were questions regarding whether they would be overly politicised. We owe a major debt of gratitude to the founders of the Defence Forces and those who served in their formative years that they remained outside the political system when it would have been easy for them not to do so given the climate of the time.</P>
    <P>Developments within the Defence Forces since the late 1980s such as the introduction of representation should also be considered. Representation was unheard of in the mid-1970s. I was serving at the time and people said it would not work but it has worked effectively. It took time and we had difficulties and problems in defining the demarcation lines but we got it right. We did not know what to do when females were permitted to join the Defence Forces. Were we to open the door for them or <i>vice versa</i>? I did not know what to do and it was totally confusing. According to the culture of the Defence Forces at the time, there was no way we could adapt to the presence of female personnel but we did. Women <Col N="144"/>members have been effective and have enhanced the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The command structure of the Defence Forces is unique and that must be borne in mind in applying the legislation. I am wary that, in bringing it forward, there could be an over-civilianisation of the Defence Forces, which would prevent officers from carrying out their duties in a proper and effective manner. Ultimately, a commander in the Defence Forces has responsibility for the safety of his troops and he must direct operations so that their safety is ensured at all times.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation operations involving personnel serving overseas who are under the command of the members of other defence forces will be exempt. Will the Minister clarify whether this is the case? On occasion, when I served overseas, I was the only Irish soldier present and my boss could have been a Finn, a Norwegian or a Swede. If I were seeking redress now, would I use the UN system or the system provided under the legislation? We should have a full and clear understanding of this.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the late John Lucey. He was a champion of this legislation for which he fought and campaigned. He died tragically but he would have been a happy man to see us debating the legislation.</P>
    <P>We are not only addressing the administration of the Defence Forces through legislation such as this. There is also a significant need to maintain the movement to reorganise them not only through modernising their procedures but also by investing in equipment and implementing the White Paper, which reduced them to the required strength and will address the rank structure within the forces. I ask the Minister to be conscious of barrack closures. I do not wish to make a political point but the reduction of ranks and structures will require political decisions, which will also involve barrack closures. Decisions on both issues must be taken in tandem, otherwise we will end up with a housekeeping army minding a number of deserted barracks. That issue must be examined. Given the percentage increase in the defence Vote in recent years, there has been a significant saving through the disposal of lands. It was agreed that money from that source would be reinvested in the Defence Forces to improve them, which was a welcome development. However, such money should not form a substitute for increases in the defence Vote in line with increases in other Departments. Were that to happen, there would be no great gain. I ask the Minister to consider these matters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am delighted as a former Army officer to speak on a matter pertaining to the Defence Forces. I record my gratitude for the 21 years I served in the Defence Forces here and overseas. We should never underestimate the calibre of person serving in today&rsquo;s Defence Forces. They are the true ambassadors for this country, operating in very hostile environments and doing us proud. A colleague of mine with absolutely no experience of <Col N="145"/>the Defence Forces, the then Lord Mayor of Cork who visited our troops in the Lebanon a couple of years ago, told me on his return that he had encountered &ldquo;the best kept secret from the Irish people&rdquo;. It should not be a secret, rather we should fly that banner proudly.</P>
    <P>We are all indebted to our Defence Forces and not only for their service to the State from within. While some question the value for money of the Defence Forces, I always claim they are the greatest insurance policy we have. If on one day over their lifetime the Defence Forces uphold the democracy of the State, they will have served it well. On top of this consideration is the service they have contributed on the world stage in so proud a manner. I congratulate all members of the Defence Forces on such service.</P>
    <P>The person who is appointed ombudsman will have a major responsibility to cross the line I have spelt out from civilianisation to military command. The person will have to be uniquely qualified and the process will take time. I am glad we are maintaining the existing structures of redress within the military system. If the Defence Forces fulfil their role properly and embrace this legislation as I expect they will, the ombudsman will have a quiet job in terms of the number of cases with which he or she will have to deal.</P>

	<P>He hit the crossbar a few times, but eventually the Minister got there. I pay tribute to him and wish him well.</P>
    <P>The body which nominated me to the Seanad is the Irish Conference of Professional and Services Associations, of which PDFORRA is an integral part. It is therefore fitting that I should make a contribution to the debate on this Bill. It was also fitting that there was a speech by a former member of the Defence Forces, Senator Minihan, who laid down the parameters of the legislation as he saw fit and provided the House with the benefit of the vast knowledge gained from his experience. It is very important to hear such contributions when we have Bills like this to discuss.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a definite advance for the Defence Forces. My colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, has outlined my party&rsquo;s position in detail and will address the matter even more closely on Committee Stage. I join previous speakers in mentioning John Lucey who did so much over the years to encourage the appointment of a Defence Forces ombudsman. The legislation is a fitting reminder of John&rsquo;s work within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I was concerned to learn of a matter raised at the PDFORRA conference. Dozens of soldiers are being coerced to join overseas missions despite the availability of volunteers for service abroad. The matter will probably <Col N="146"/>be raised with the Minister if he attends the conference this evening. If volunteers are available and we are changing the manner in which things are done, an explanation is necessary. If the system has worked well, why are changes being made, especially with regard to Liberia, the dangers of which have been alluded to by other speakers? I hope the Minister will address this issue. I share the Minister&rsquo;s confidence that very few complaints will fall to be dealt with in the number of areas which will be outside the statutory remit of the ombudsman. I hope the legislation will cover the vast majority of complaints which come before the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>We would be remiss if we neglected to pay tribute to the work of the Defence Forces since the foundation of the State. As has been stated, the Defence Forces played a vital role in the formation and defence of democracy. We should never forget that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the forces for that work. The Defence Forces are recognised throughout the world for their work on peacekeeping missions and the excellent rapport members have established with people wherever they have gone. We should not be slow to praise the work of the Defence Forces on these missions as well as at home. This is a period of transition in which barracks are being closed. I join Senator Minihan in requesting the continuation of the reinvestment programme for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. The money which accrues from the sale of barracks must be reinvested to allow the members of the Defence Forces to see that funds are being ploughed back into a system which needs investment at this time.</P>
    <P>I hope this necessary Bill will pass speedily through the House, having taken some time to get to this point. Fine Gael will do everything it can to expedite its passage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to speak about this Bill and I join other Senators in wishing the Minister well with his new remit. He will make a great go of it coming from an Army town himself, the city of Limerick. I speak as someone from Athlone, the headquarters of the Western Command, which has an extensive complement of personnel at all ranks from the enlisted to the top. I was born and brought up 100 yards from Custume Barracks whose Army community has been very involved in the town of Athlone. The members of the Defence Forces, their wives, children and extended families form an integral part of the work and social lives of the town.</P>
    <P>The Bill is overdue and I am very happy with it. I pay tribute to Deputy Michael Smith, the previous Minister, who put great care into the legislation. His five-year guardianship of the Defence Forces was a model as he worked through cutbacks and obtained money from all sorts of places. He had an amicable relationship with PDFORRA and all ranks of the Army. The Minister&rsquo;s speech made interesting reading. My late brother, Brian Lenihan, as Minister for Defence in the late 1980s, began the consultation process. <Col N="147"/>An alarming incident involving Army wives which occurred in the lead up to 1989 election caused a great deal of friction at the time. It was following that incident that former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, appointed my late brother, Brian Lenihan, Minister for Defence. He worked with former Senator Brian Hillery who had a doctorate from UCD and was very strong on personnel matters. PDFORRA was established at that time providing the Army with a union-type organisation to represent it.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of PDFORRA, the CIO was established to deal with specific complaints. I was aware all my life that it did no good for a private or corporal in the Army to use the redress system. I handled many cases of redress none of which was of value to the enlisted person. Such complaints got nowhere because armies have hierarchies and when the hierarchy moved in, the enlisted soldier obtained no redress much as he or she tried. I have been involved in many such cases down through the years and I am not aware of one complaint that was upheld. However, things are different now.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to captains, lieutenants, commanders and so on; that is the structure of armies. However, it was impossible to properly investigate complaints because the hierarchy always won out. Those who brought such complaints were usually enlisted soldiers and matters were loaded in favour of those in command. The CIO helped in particular cases and worked effectively within its remit. Dr. Eileen Doyle, whom I know very well, was, during my term as Minister for Education and Science, very high up in educational managerial status. She was a nun who, on leaving her order, set herself up as a consultant. The Doyle report produced by her was an important milestone for the Army. It set out what could and could not be done and much flowed from it. Dr. Doyle who undertook further reports for the Army is a brilliant, clever and strategically able woman. A commitment was given to the establishment of an ombudsman for defence following the publication of her report.</P>
    <P>My final letter to former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, set out my intention to deal with this legislation during the first week of the Seanad&rsquo;s return. However, that was not possible given the reshuffle and it is being taken today. The Minister travels to Letterkenny tomorrow to meet PDFORRA.</P>
    <P>Many important amendments were made to the Bill on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il including the retention of personal appeal to the Minister in specific cases not covered by the ombudsman&rsquo;s remit. That is good. The scope of the ombudsman&rsquo;s remit is laid out and rightly so. I notice with alarm the use of the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; in the context of all references to the ombudsman. I presume the ombudsman does not have to be male.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker><Col N="148"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot understand why the ombudsman could not be female given that a brilliant woman, Dr. Eileen Doyle, produced this report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is covered by the Interpretation Act.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I know that. However, I do not like the Minister&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; throughout his speech. I presume the position of ombudsman will be publicly advertised. It is right and proper that it be completely independent of the Army. The CIO system did not always work well.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a fertile field ahead of him in dealing with the Defence Forces. There are currently many rumblings regarding the extension of the 12 year period for enlisted men and women. The Minister should agree to the extension. It is an issue of which the Minister will get an earful tomorrow in Letterkenny. I am sure he is aware of it and will take it on board. I am aware of it through my contact with Army personnel in Athlone.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not take forever to fill the position of ombudsman. The position of Ombudsman for Children was not filled for two or three years. I hope the Minister can advertise and fill the position as quickly as possible. There is much riding on this legislation for Army personnel and I believe it will bring about change. It is interesting to note how the legislation evolved. It began following action by Army wives in 1989-90. Each stage marked an increase in transparency, hope and help for Army personnel. This legislation will put the seal on matters. I understand the Minister will be visiting Athlone in approximately two weeks time. I look forward to welcoming him there.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend a warm welcome to Deputy O&rsquo;Dea to this House on his first occasion as a member of the Cabinet and Minister for Defence. I welcome also the staff from his Department to deal with Second Stage of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002. The Minister has served as a Deputy for the constituency of Limerick for some time. As far as I am aware, he has been a Member of the House for 22 years and as such has gleaned tremendous experience as a public representative. His qualification as a barrister and other qualifications <Col N="149"/>make him suitable for appointment by the President on the recommendation of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Minister follows in the steps of an extremely capable and confident Deputy Michael Smith who took on difficult issues during his term as Minister in the last Government, particularly in terms of the Army deafness claims. The Minister now has a clear mandate from Government on the Defence Forces. Like Senator Cummins, I wish to declare an interest in this issue. I, too, was nominated by PDFORRA and RACO through the Irish Conference of Professional and Services Associations of which they are composite members. PDFORRA and RACO exercise their nomination rights with great discretion. In that regard, I am interested in the legislation and in defence issues as is our spokesperson, Senator Moylan. I have free association and contact with those organisations on issues related to their work with the Defence Forces and in that regard was anxious that the Bill be dealt with today. The Minister will attend the annual PDFORRA conference in Letterkenny tomorrow. We will not be able to attend the annual dinner in Letterkenny tonight because this Bill is going through the House but it is more important that the Minister is here on its behalf to pass this Bill. I have taken the liberty of faxing the Minister&rsquo;s speech to Letterkenny to let the organisation know that he has brought the Bill to the House and inform it of the Minister&rsquo;s great work.</P>
    <P>Both RACO and PDFORRA were involved with this Bill and they are delighted it has reached this point. Before the summer recess, it was planned that the Bill would be completed in this House last week but it was not possible to achieve that because of the reshuffle. It is now here and next week Committee and Report Stages will be taken as quickly as possible. The Bill has already been passed in the D&aacute;il, where the former Minister accepted amendments. I know from the new Minister&rsquo;s experience of legislation that if any area of the Bill can be improved, he will not hesitate to table an amendment in this House.</P>
    <P>There are 10,500 members of the Permanent Defence Force, of whom 1,200 are officers, with 930 members of the Air Corps and a further number serving in the Naval Service. That is a strong force with many people to work with, placing a tremendous responsibility on the Minister. Few Ministers, however, in their first week in office would hand away so much power. It reminds me of the late Se&aacute;n Flanagan, who proposed the abolition of the Land Commission just as he had been appointed to it. The Minister, however, has a lot of work to do in the Defence Forces and this disciplinary work should be given over to an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>There are 12,000 people in the Reserve Defence Force, 7,000 of whom are very active. The Reserve Defence Force is being reorganised. I brought delegations from Boyle in County Roscommon to discuss that reorganisation and I ask the Minister to look at the reports on this <Col N="150"/>issue. It is important that there are offices for the Reserve Defence Force in Roscommon town, Castlerea, Boyle and Strokestown. The force plays a key part in civic ceremonies, marching for pride at events such as the Easter and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parades. Involving local people in the Defence Forces creates credibility and goodwill.</P>
    <P>Since I became a public representative in 1977, I have found there is a high regard for the Defence Forces. I had the pleasure of working in Bosnia Herzegovina in 1998 with the OSCE to monitor elections. I was very impressed by the ability and training of the Irish Defence Forces compared to any other army in western Europe involved in those events. They were extremely well trained and disciplined; the Minister is taking over an extremely competent force. They are lean and well equipped, and they will be better equipped after the Minister&rsquo;s tenure in office because he will bring a new and refreshing approach to this task. It is interesting that the Minister&rsquo;s first portfolio is defence, the first of many. Over the next three years I have no doubt he will make a success of that job.</P>
    <P>This House appreciates the contribution of the Defence Forces in UN peacekeeping missions and the sacrifices made by those men who have died in the cause of peace. They sacrificed their lives for the people of this State and we owe them a great debt of gratitude, particularly for their defence of the realm.</P>
    <P>PDFORRA headquarters are named in honour of John Lucey. I met him in 2002 when I was canvassing for the nomination to the Seanad and I regret his demise. He was a marvellous advocate for PDFORRA, as is Gerry Rooney, the current general secretary, and Commandant Brian O&rsquo;Keeffe, general secretary of RACO.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his portfolio and his visit to Letterkenny. He will get a tremendous welcome and the issues raised by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke will be looked at afresh. Deputy O&rsquo;Dea&rsquo;s appointment is a marvellous step forward. I recall the election in 1989. That was a very difficult period and the genuine issues raised were resolved by the incoming Government. I hope to see the Minister in this House on many occasions dealing with issues on behalf of the Defence Forces. His is a well-deserved appointment and the Defence Forces are delighted with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The appointment of Deputy O&rsquo;Dea to the defence portfolio is a timely recognition of his Trojan service to the people of his constituency as a Deputy and as a Minister of State. On many occasions they have given him a resounding mandate to represent them and I have no doubt he will reflect the success he has achieved to date in representing them in the new portfolio he has been given.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to say that I was sad to see the previous Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, leaving because in the last Seanad I was the Government spokesman on defence. When <Col N="151"/>the Army deafness legislation was being debated, it was a trying time for the Department of Defence and the Minister but he handled it very well.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which is a milestone. In my capacity as spokesperson on defence in the last Seanad, I met PDFORRA and RACO on a number of occasions. In addition, I am from Mullingar which is a military town. We are proud of our barracks and the personnel who serve in it. Mullingar has been well served, not alone in the security that Columb Barracks gives the town, but the community as a whole benefits from the great service the Defence Forces personnel give across the board. They are involved in every organisation and always leave their mark.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Government for introducing this Bill. The previous Minister introduced it in the D&aacute;il last year and this is a fitting tribute to Deputy Michael Smith and his remarkable tenure and achievements in the Department. The late Frank Aiken may have served longer than Deputy Smith in the portfolio and I am sure the new Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, will be nipping at their heels.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, the former Minister successfully revitalised our Defence Forces and maintained the policy of continuous recruitment that he introduced in 1998.</P>
    <P>As a long-standing member of Westmeath County Council, I spoke many times on motions about recruitment. The age profile of the Defence Forces was totally unacceptable. Many people, including former Ministers, said that action should be taken but it was Deputy Michael Smith as Minister who actually did something about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith also delivered a significant programme of investment in new equipment and infrastructure in the Defence Forces. He left his mark in the Department of Defence. His most enduring achievement was the first ever White Paper on Defence which sets out the blueprint for the future development of the Defence Forces to the year 2010. It lays out an investment programme that gives members of the Defence Forces the modern equipment required and a military organisation that is second to none. He also brought about a number of significant changes in reducing the overall level of cost to the State on the issue of Army deafness which have received widespread publicity. I am confident the taxpayer will be very grateful to him. As the Minister admitted in this Chamber, there was a need to have this matter addressed but it had to be addressed in a balanced and cohesive manner and he found the right balance and formula.</P>
    <P>In congratulating the new Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, I remind him that Deputy Michael Smith is a tough act to follow, but then Deputy O&rsquo;Dea is a tough act himself. I am glad of the opportunity to speak in the debate on the Bill. Although the legislation has been in development for a long time, as other speakers have pointed <Col N="152"/>out, it received a welcome from all interested parties. It is never too late to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred in their contributions to the late John Lucey. I met him a number of times and there is no doubt that he was a king among men in his work on behalf of the Defence Forces and especially the representative body, PDFORRA. May he rest in peace. He campaigned tirelessly for the appointment of an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to create an office of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces, to provide for the appointment, functions and staff of the ombudsman and to amend the Defence Act 1954. When this legislation has been enacted, it will have the potential to give members of the Defence Forces a genuinely independent forum for dealing with complaints and any injustices that may emerge. No organisation has the capacity to deal efficiently with all types of complaints involving people at different levels and this should also apply in the case of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as spokesman on defence, I received a number of complaints. I freely admit that I had no basis on which to act on those complaints because there was no formula in place to deal with them. This Bill is a step in the right direction. It is taking the proverbial bull by the horns and bringing to task those in positions of responsibility and command. It is always preferable to command respect rather than demand it. In the management of human resources, whether in terms of factory employees, members of the Defence Forces or whatever, it is important that the people in charge administer their responsibilities in a fair and even-handed manner but, unfortunately, that has not always been the case.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements provide for remedies in the informal mechanism of an external civilian complaints inquiry officer who can investigate, examine and make recommendations on individual grievances which are submitted to the Minister by members of the Defence Forces. Under the arrangements, the Minister has the power of discretionary reference of a complaint to the complaints inquiry officer. A revaluation of this process carried out towards the end of 1999 indicated that the officer was dealing with between 20 and 25 cases per annum. It was found that a specific demand existed at private and non-commissioned officer level.</P>
    <P>The process used was autonomous of the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and the then Minister. The new office of the ombudsman will be a fully autonomous statutory entity to which complaints can be forwarded in cases where complainants are not content with the responses obtained from the military authorities, to former complaints under the Defence Act provisions for the redress of wrongs.</P>
    <P>The new office of the ombudsman will function as an entirely independent entity, which is to be welcomed. It will have clear statutory powers of independent inquiry and investigation, closely <Col N="153"/>modelled on those in the Ombudsman Act 1980. The powers of the new office will, however, take account of the singular circumstances and the demands of the military environment. Other speakers have referred to the fact that the military environment is different from any other working environment. The concept of military activities is based on a person being in charge and the men and women under his or her direction obeying reasonable orders. We expect the highest standards from the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have proven to be outstanding models in the community, whether in Mullingar, Athlone or further afield. In the context of overseas service, there have been no better flag bearers than the members of the Defence Forces. They have shown that Ireland, even as a minuscule nation on the periphery of the EU and the Atlantic Ocean, can produce men and women who have excelled in the even-handed manner in which they deal with difficult situations.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new position and wish this legislation well as it is much needed. The issue of female membership of the Defence Forces needs to be addressed. I would like to see more women serving in the Defence Forces. I ask the Minister to ensure the continuation of the recruitment campaign initiated in 1998 by the then Minister, Deputy Michael Smith. There was a haemorrhage of good people from the Defence Forces in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The age profile of the Defence Forces was undesirable and unacceptable. I ask the Minister not to allow that situation occur again but I am confident it will not happen under his stewardship.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister to the House. It is very fitting to have such a Minister. Last Wednesday I heard Opposition Members jokingly say to him that the country was safe. That is no joke; the country is very safe with Deputy O&rsquo;Dea as the Minister for Defence. It is fitting that the Minister comes from the county he comes from which has one of the biggest military barracks in the mid-west. He is very aware of the problems faced by the military.</P>
    <P>Much of what I wanted to say has already been said and I will not go back over it again. I wish to highlight a few issues. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the significant debt of gratitude we owe the Defence Forces since their inception. We have been well served by them. I live in Sligo which has a large Army population, although not quite as big as that in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency in the mid-west. Sligo&rsquo;s Army population serves out of Finner Camp. We in the north west are very proud of our men and women who at times put their lives on the line in order to serve us.</P>
    <P>It is very fitting that this legislation is passing through the Upper House. The Bill is a significant tribute to the late John Lucey. As far back as ten years ago, he examined the subject. At the time there was some opposition within the Defence <Col N="154"/>Forces. They were a little afraid, and perhaps rightly so, of outside interference. The Defence Forces normally look after everything to do with themselves and do so quite well. I spoke to both PDFORRA and RACO this morning. They are both singing from the same hymn sheet and are of one voice. They are happy with the legislation that is coming through and they say it is an important leg in the anti-bullying and harassment policy that is now in place. This is as a result of that good report of two years ago.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The late Mr. Lucey was a great man. Somebody once described him as a king, a giant of a man. It is a testament to him that so many people have talked about him in this Chamber today. Speaking as a widow, it is a source of great comfort to his widow and family to hear their loved one spoken of in such tones.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Committee Stage of this excellent Bill. I intend to ask then how the Bill will reflect on the reserve forces and I look forward to debating the issue with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I rarely get a chance to inform my eminent colleague, Senator Leyden. I was listening to a debate on RTE just before the European elections last June. One of the candidates was talking about the word &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo;. She informed the listenership that it was a Swedish word for a conciliator, someone who brings things together. I do not think there is a word in any vocabulary for &ldquo;ombudsperson&rdquo;.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in view of the political interference in respect of the decision of the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s College of Education, Sion Hill, calls on the newly appointed Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to rescind this decision forthwith.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Education and Science to the House. I congratulate her and wish her well following her elevation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Minister to the House. I congratulate her on her elevation and wish her luck. She has been credited with the characteristic of being a bridge builder. Following on from the previous Minister, she has many bridges to build. However, I wish her luck and every success. I hope her days in the Department of Education and Science will be beneficial to all at every level of education.</P><Col N="155"/>
    <P>The decision of the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to close this long-established college without consultation with the relevant parties involved, namely, the staff, governors and students, is deplorable. His continued refusal up to the time of his departure to discuss his decision clearly indicates that it was not based on educational grounds. He completely ignored the professional advice of his own Department&rsquo;s senior personnel, including Mr. Jack O&rsquo;Brien, former assistant secretary general at the Department of Education and Science, who he appointed as a consultant to report on the options for the future of the college. He later ignored the advice of Mr. Paul Kelly, assistant secretary general at the Department of Education and Science. Taking this into account, how can anyone believe the decision to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s and relocate all teaching facilities in one centre, St. Angela&rsquo;s in Sligo, was anything but politically motivated?</P>
    <P>It is important to note the terms of reference set out by the Minister for the consultant&rsquo;s report. These were to examine the options for the future of St. Catherine&rsquo;s in light of the decision by the trustees to withdraw from involvement in the college; to examine the implications of this for the staff; to examine and assess the capital and recurrent cost implications of the various options; and, most importantly, to prepare a report and recommendations for consideration by the Minister for Education and Science in terms of the most appropriate way forward which would ensure the continuation of quality home economics teacher education.</P>
    <P>In September 2003, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, announced the closure of St. Catherine&rsquo;s and stated that St. Angela&rsquo;s in Sligo would become the only teaching college of home economics in the country. There was obvious dismay in St. Catherine&rsquo;s at this announcement. In view of the recent substantial investment in upgrading and refurbishing, including the Department&rsquo;s investment of approximately &euro;1.5 million in recent years, together with the Dominican Sisters resources and other loans guaranteed by the board of management, one was led to believe in the Department&rsquo;s continued commitment to the future of St. Catherine&rsquo;s as a teacher training centre.</P>
    <P>The Minister ignored the terms of reference and, on 28 September, in reply to concerns raised by past graduates, he cited his reasons for closure, &ldquo;having carefully considered the options for the future of the college&rdquo;. These included the national spatial strategy, relevant costs in a time of financial constraint, a Government decision to restrict public service numbers and the need to secure value for money and a better allocation of resources. All four are typical &ldquo;Dempsey-speak&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the trustees to withdraw, the Department appointed Mr. Jack O&rsquo;Brien as a consultant to liaise with all relevant parties and to advise on the future options open to the Minister. The study on the future of St. <Col N="156"/>Catherine&rsquo;s College of Home Economics was prepared by Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and completed on 4 July 2002. The report noted that &ldquo;an air of uncertainty has hung over St. Catherine&rsquo;s for a considerable time. This has caused great anxiety amongst the staff and has inhibited development of the college&rsquo;s activities.&rdquo; In the conclusion of his report, Mr. O&rsquo;Brien stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">I do not favour moving the home economics teacher education provision out of Dublin in view of the personnel and industrial relations problems that would arise in the context of St. Catherine&rsquo;s staff. These difficulties, allied to the additional current cost which would be involved, are significant and should not, in my view, be countenanced if more satisfactory alternatives are available.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Furthermore, he recommended, &ldquo;that the Department, through the Higher Education Authority, would engage with TCD, UCD and DCU with a view to securing the incorporation of St. Catherine&rsquo;s in one of these universities. I believe further that a merger with UCD would be the most beneficial for the staff and students of St. Catherine&rsquo;s and would be welcomed by them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The higher education colleges section and the third level building unit made submissions to the Minister in May 2003. This submission noted that, &ldquo;the question of how to deal with the staff in St. Catherine&rsquo;s would be the most challenging issue to address&rdquo;, with regard to the possible merger with St. Angela&rsquo;s.</P>
    <P>Mr. Paul Kelly, assistant secretary in the Department, having regard to the submissions made by the colleges section and the building unit, recommended that St. Catherine&rsquo;s remain open and that a merger with UCD be sought. He specifically identified the recommendations already made in the O&rsquo;Brien report as well as recent expenditure on refurbishment at the college, the long lead-in time to the transfer of students and the very major industrial relations issues associated with the closure of the college. Why was the secrecy and deliberate exclusion of the staff and governors of St. Catherine&rsquo;s College from the decision-making process necessary?</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the closure by the Minister, the college had to seek access to the consultant&rsquo;s report through the Freedom of Information Act to ascertain the reason for the decision. In a ruling on the matter, the Information Commissioner, in response to Ms Madeleine Mulrennan&rsquo;s appeal as president of the college, severely reprimanded the Department for failing to take public interest provisions into account in refusing the college&rsquo;s request for information. In this regard, the commissioner wrote: &ldquo;I regard this as a significant omission and a serious defect in the decision making process in this particular case.&rdquo; She also noted that while it had asserted that the release of the documents would have a significant effect, the Department of Education and Science had not specified what would be the adverse effect. She added:</P><Col N="157"/>
    <P LI="1">The records sought concern a decision to close a third level college and it is a decision which has very significant implications for existing staff and for potential future students; it is a decision, also, which seems likely to have significant financial implications into the future. In these circumstances, I believe the public interest arguments in favour of openness and accountability are particularly strong.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The former Minister&rsquo;s refusal to meet the staff of St. Catherine&rsquo;s College shows complete disregard for the magnificent contribution of the Dominican Order since 1910, the continued contributions to education of highly qualified, excellent teachers, the recommendations of a consultant appointed to advise on the best options for the future and the advice of a senior Department official. The Minister can reverse this appalling litany of disregard by agreeing, as a matter of urgency, to meet all relevant parties at St. Catherine&rsquo;s with a view to allowing for the continuation of teacher training. as recommended by the reports available to her in the Department. There are no educational, economic or other reasons which support the decision to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s College.</P>
    <P>At a time when it is Government policy to increase awareness of food science and hygiene, good nutrition and the need to tackle the growing problem of obesity, the continuation of training sufficient home economics teachers would surely assist in achieving this goal. Why is it not possible to have two centres of excellence? St. Catherine&rsquo;s College could, as recommended in the O&rsquo;Brien report, be incorporated in a third level university to maintain the status of its qualifications, while St. Angela&rsquo;s College in Sligo could be the second such centre. Both could continue to operate successfully.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister immediately offer to meet the board of governors, staff and management of St. Catherine&rsquo;s College so that her predecessor&rsquo;s decision, which has no educational basis, can be reversed and quality home economics teaching can be allowed to continue without disruption? We have had enough disruption in recent years. The Minister must not embark on her period in office by allowing this matter to fester.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. I welcome the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to the House. It is usually a bad idea to appoint teachers or doctors to the positions of Minister for Education and Science and Minister for Health and Children, respectively, but I make an exception in the case of the current Minister. I wish her well in the years ahead in this challenging portfolio.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is not in favour of the decision to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s College, which she would not have taken if it had been her decision to make. Those employed in the Sion Hill educational facilities, who have done so much for the country and, in particular, education <Col N="158"/>in Dublin, are very proud of her and her immense contribution to the college over the years.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, I hold out an olive branch because I have no regard for the trite amendment tabled in the Minister&rsquo;s name &mdash; I suspect it emanated from a brusque Cabinet meeting held yesterday. If she agrees to meet the board of governors, management and staff of St. Catherine&rsquo;s College and reviews the decision taken by her predecessor, the Fine Gael Party would consider withdrawing the motion. The college is proud of the Minister and she of the college, which is important in terms of her educational contribution.</P>
    <P>The motion is not concerned with pitting schools against each other. My colleagues from the Sligo area should be aware that the notion that this is some kind of ferocious debate between St. Angela&rsquo;s and St. Catherine&rsquo;s is pathetic. The purpose of the motion is to achieve excellence. Who says we must centre all work and academic excellence in home economics in one area?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the position we are changing because everything is centred in Dublin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not refer to the freedom of information request, about which the Senator may have something to say later. When we ask Ministers to do a job, we should be cognisant of what they say. In this case, two educational experts have come down fairly and squarely on the side of St. Catherine&rsquo;s College continuing as a school of excellence for home economics education. We cannot put their views to one side due to electoral considerations or loyalty to former Members. We should focus on what the experts have told us is in the interests of home economics education. If the Minister were to ask the Department&rsquo;s inspectors of home economics education, they would tell her a different story from that told by her predecessor.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated she wanted happy teachers and fairness to schools. Is it fair that two days before the start of the academic term, St. Catherine&rsquo;s College, with its distinguished record over the past 90 years, should receive a call informing it that the game was up? Is it fair that at no stage in the course of the consultations between the college and the Department was a face to face meeting organised between her predecessor and the college or that, at one fell swoop, one stroke of a pen, an entire educational institution was set aside? It is not fair and I believe the Minister appreciates that because it runs contrary to all the statements she has made since her appointment to Cabinet last week. I ask her to reconsider the decision.</P>
    <P>I represent a working class area of Dublin. Day in and day out, nutritional questions are among the most important issues to arise as regards the care of families and children. For example, what food are children bringing into schools? What knowledge would help many single parent families make the right choices as regards what <Col N="159"/>to put in their children&rsquo;s lunchboxes and what is eaten at home? The Minister is aware that this is a major problem in areas of deprivation in this city and elsewhere. The notion that Dublin will have no school of home economics flies in the face of the real poverty in many of our estates. This area of education needs to expand because it has so much to offer in terms of teaching young parents in particular the rights and wrongs as regards diet and how to manage one&rsquo;s income to ensure the best possible use of one&rsquo;s budget. These are the kinds of skills we need to impart to many lone parents who are in a vulnerable position. Therefore, the notion that we should simply send all our educational experts in this area to one part of the country is flawed.</P>
    <P>The way in which the management of the school has been treated is very shoddy. I understand the Department has offered those involved voluntary redeployment. To where are those concerned to be redeployed? All of the 24 full-time members of staff, who have given their lives to education in one part of our country and produced in excess of 1,800 graduates all over the country, are being told they will be redeployed in one fell swoop. That is not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a fair person and I know that if this decision had been hers initially she would not have taken it. Therefore, she should, even at this late stage, offer some hope to St. Catherine&rsquo;s and re-examine the decision. She should ensure not only the future viability of St. Angela&rsquo;s in Sligo but also the viability of St. Catherine&rsquo;s.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the support of the House if she is courageous on this matter. A face-to-face meeting with the board of management and staff should be held and a commitment should be made to review the decision. It is now time for politicians to listen to the teachers, school management and the very people to whom the Minister said she wanted to listen last week. If she does so, they will tell her this decision is wrong.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus is mian liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh l&eacute;i ar a ceapach&aacute;n mar Aire Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta. Gu&iacute;m rath ar a cuid oibre. I warmly welcome the Minister and congratulate her on her elevation to the Ministry of Education and Science. I have no doubt but that her Ministry will be a testament to a great commitment to education. She has tremendous experience in education and many insights based on a long career both here in Leinster House and in the educational field in the past. She is passionately committed to education. I know this as I had the <Col N="160"/>privilege of spending a few years with her on an educational forum in another place.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;confirms the decision to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s College by concentrating the provision of home economics teacher training in St. Angela&rsquo;s College, Sligo; and rejects the contention that this decision by the previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was made as a result of political interference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P FLI="0">The issue before us is the decision to close the college of education for the training of home economics teachers and to concentrate its provision in one campus in Sligo instead of both Dublin and Sligo, as was the case prior to the decision. There are three fundamental questions at issue. Is the decision in pursuit of educational excellence? Is it good value for money? What are the implications for staff and students? The controversy that has surrounded the decision relates to the reasons for closure, the manner of the announcement, regarding which there is sensitivity, and the withholding of a consultant&rsquo;s report by the FOI unit of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The decision to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s College and consolidate the provision in St. Angela&rsquo;s in Sligo was made on its merits. I am quite clear on this having examined all the facts and documentation. The closure of any college with a long and noble tradition of service to education is regrettable at any time. As a Dublin politician, I regret the closure of a college in Dublin, as I am sure do all my Dublin colleagues. The proud record of achievement of St. Catherine&rsquo;s, Sion Hill, is legendary. It was founded in 1910 and served the country well and with great distinction over many generations thereafter. Its highly-qualified graduates brought the science and skills of home economics to every corner of Ireland, mainly, although not exclusively, through our second level schools.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute to the Dominican congregation and the staff who worked in the college down through the years for the invaluable legacy they have bequeathed to the country over successive generations. That mantle will now have to be carried exclusively by St. Angela&rsquo;s College in Sligo. Given its track record to date, I have no doubt that it will fully justify the confidence the Government has placed in it to do the job required of it.</P>
    <P>The decision to concentrate the provision of home economics teacher training in one campus was not taken lightly by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey. It followed a long process of meetings, consultations, reviews and investigations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;into the future development of higher education. The issue first surfaced in the 1980s. The question of the closure of one or both colleges of home economics arose during this period, having regard to the demand for home economics teachers into the future. A report was prepared by a steering committee on the future development of higher education in June 1995. The president of St. Angela&rsquo;s College was a member of that committee. Although the specialist teacher requirements were part of the committee&rsquo;s remit, the examination of future needs was not completed and the committee referred the matter back to the Department and the HEA. An advisory group was then reconvened and following a report in 1996, it recommended the maintenance of the <i>status quo </i>in June 1998.</P>
    <P>A significant development subsequently occurred. The Dominican congregation, the trustee of St. Catherine&rsquo;s, decided for personnel and financial reasons that it was no longer in a position to fulfil its role as trustee. Consequently, discussions began with the Department with a view to transferring this role and the associated responsibilities. A consultant was appointed to prepare a report on the options available for consideration by the then Minister. As we know, that report was published in July 2002.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was what?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It was presented in July 2002.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was buried.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand corrected. What happened subsequently has, in some cases, given rise to wild and unfounded allegations of political interference, cover-ups and ministerial intervention to suppress information from Deputy Andrews, the Information Commissioner and the chairperson of St. Catherine&rsquo;s, whom I understand is in the Gallery and whom I welcome. However, the known facts clearly prove that these allegations are unfounded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The known facts. What about the underhand ones?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>They simply do not stand up to close scrutiny.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no alternative.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal allegation is that the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, simply binned or, at best, ignored the consultant&rsquo;s report. The then Minister has stated repeatedly in public that the report was thoroughly examined and that the options for the future of the college were set out for his consideration. However, some important aspects of this have not been articulated properly, one of which is that the report was commissioned long before he came into office and in a slightly differ<Col N="162"/>ent context. Second, if one looks at the terms of reference given to the consultant who drew up the report, one will note they were based on the assumption that St. Catherine&rsquo;s would be kept open.</P>
    <P>Very soon after the presentation of the report to the then Minister and the outlining of options to him, a significant presentation was made by St. Angela&rsquo;s College in Sligo. This presentation made a very convincing case for designating that college as the sole centre for the training of home economics teachers in the country. While the consultant&rsquo;s report dealt with the option of linking the existing facilities at St. Catherine&rsquo;s to one of Dublin&rsquo;s third level colleges, the proposal by St. Angela&rsquo;s College offered a new and additional feasible option. It was at least of equal merit educationally. I have heard some references to the contrary across the floor today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I thank my colleague Senator Fitzgerald for allowing me to share time with him. He has many points to make and I am sure he could speak on the subject for hours and every minute of his contribution would be of value.

    <P>I wish to heartily welcome the Minister to the House. She has had a distinguished career in politics as well as a distinguished career in teaching. I have no doubt she will make a fine Minister. I hope she will start by addressing this matter in a sensitive way, although not in any sense by criticising her predecessor &mdash; we will be able to do that for her &mdash; but by taking an intelligent and open decision in a situation which requires this kind of approach.</P><Col N="163"/>
    <P>I disagree with what my two colleagues on the Government benches have said; it does seem to me that there is an element of gombeenism in this. There was a substantial attempt to conceal information. The Minister formerly responsible, for whom I have generally speaking a high regard, was pretty strongly rapped over the knuckles by the Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, who made it plain in her report that he had transgressed by not taking into account public interest and by only taking into account matters such as management relations and the fact that people might be upset if they knew they were going to be sacked. Those were the reasons he gave and I quote, &ldquo;It could have a significant adverse effect on the performance of my Department in its functions relating to management, including industrial relations. Furthermore it could disclose positions taken, or to be taken, for the purpose of negotiations&rdquo;. Those concerns were put above the public interest.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Senator quote the Information Commissioner?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I can. I have it here in writing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>She did not say that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris, without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>He should draw a distinction.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is really quite extraordinary and the sequence of events is so clear. A consultant was appointed by agreement between the school and the Department. That consultant reported and made a clear recommendation, which is not what the Minister decided to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>A second group was appointed which made exactly the same recommendation. It is like poor, unfortunate Pope Paul VI and the contraception debate: establish a commission of experts, listen to them report unanimously and then say, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m infallible&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Bin the report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. This is what happened but we have not had any satisfactory, educational explanation. I speak as a former teacher and a member of the Irish Federation of University Teachers. All the experts, including IFUT, came out clearly on this issue, yet we were just given this kind of blanket comment, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry, we are transferring this over to Sligo&rdquo;. Of course, there was a degree of political lobbying.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="164"/>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with that and there is nothing disgraceful in it. Perhaps Senator MacSharry, his father or other local people were lobbying for their own interests. Let us not pretend that there is anything sinister in this; they are perfectly entitled to do so but at the end of the day it is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to make up his or, in this case, her mind as to what is in the best interests of the country and the entire educational community. In this case, I believe that decision was not made on those grounds.</P>
    <P>What is happening is a precursor because we will get much more of this kind of thing, although not in exactly the same situation. We will get problems thrown up by the fact that the religious orders are contracting in terms of their financial capacity and the numbers of personnel involved. This is really what happened in this case. There was a degree of contraction and the trustees, in their original form, found they were not able to continue with the valuable service they had given. There have been tributes from both sides of the House to the work that was done at Sion Hill.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made by the authorities of that excellent educational establishment to reach agreement with the Minister. They agreed to the appointment of a consultant to produce a report. Its recommendations were that the Department, through the Higher Education Authority, should have discussions with TCD, UCD and DCU with a view to having St. Catherine&rsquo;s College of Education, Sion Hill, incorporated into one of them. He also indicated that a merger with UCD would be the most beneficial for staff and students, and would be welcomed by them. Nothing could be clearer than that recommendation, yet in terms of a Government that has committed itself to openness, transparency and accountability, it is astonishing that no such discussions were held. That suggests that minds were made up already, which is regrettable because the discussions should have been held.</P>
    <P>I echo Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s plea that, at this stage, the Minister should be prepared to meet with representatives of the college. I hope she will be in a position to give us this undertaking. It seems extraordinary that no such discussions took place and that staff were kept in the dark until the last minute. Moneys were spent, including public funds, on refurbishing the premises at St. Catherine&rsquo;s College during the time this process was going on. That could be regarded as a substantial waste. If an arbitrary political decision had been made to cut off the school at that point, why go on wasting money?</P>
    <P>Although we fought during debate on the Universities Bill to ensure universities retained their autonomy, and Senator Ross and myself nailed our banners to the mast on this matter, it looks as if we have been subverted. An important university course leading to the conferral of degrees has been closed down, not by the university but by departmental intervention and the arbitrary action of the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="165"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me. I welcome the Minister to the House. I am sure she will make a splendid contribution to education in this country. I agree with what Senator Norris has said. I too am concerned that Sion Hill graduates who, for the past 25 years have received Trinity College degrees, will now apparently have that degree abolished. Under the Universities Act, universities were in a position to establish degree courses with autonomy, but apparently the Minister can now take them away. This seems to be an extraordinary situation and I can see that the Minister looks puzzled herself. I do not think this has been taken into account. It was suggested that the merger should be with UCD but TCD, after all, has a long association with Sion Hill, so I wonder why that option was not considered further.</P>
    <P>Students said the move to Sligo would deny them any semblance of a third level campus, which was suggested as being important in the consultant&rsquo;s report. The relevance of that fact should be noted. It is hard to accept what has happened, given the importance of the recent all-island report on nutrition. That report stated that in the ten years from 1992-2002 adults gained, on average, six kilos. I only gained three in that period so many people must have gained nine kilos to get an average figure of six. We have a problem with nutrition in this country and a task force on obesity has been established. We need to have more people involved in home economics and nutrition, yet two such colleges are now to be combined.</P>
    <P>We have not taken into account the fact that there may be different approaches to home economics within these colleges. On an island of this size it is important to have diverse courses and points of view. The Minister should do her utmost to get this decision reversed. St. Catherine&rsquo;s College is in her constituency and I am quite sure she has received plenty of representations about it on a personal level. As Senator Norris has said, I would like to see this matter examined from the point of view of the Universities Act. To breach that Act in this way would be truly dreadful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to join with other Senators in congratulating and welcoming the new Minister for Education and Science to the House. We look forward to working with her over the coming years. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that this is not a Dublin-Sligo issue. I pay tribute to the Dominican Order and all the staff at St. Catherine&rsquo;s College. I am delighted that some of them are present in the Gallery to hear the points of view from both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to them and the excellent work they have done since the college was founded in 1910. The degree course was introduced in the 1970s. However, the Dominican Order decided due to falling vocations and available private funding that it would withdraw, as a result of which the college must close at its current location and be transferred elsewhere.</P><Col N="166"/>
    <P>As we heard already, there were numerous reports and much talk about this since the mid-1980s, when the Dominicans first mooted the possibility of ceasing to be trustees of the college. Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s report stated that Government decisions of the late 1980s led to the establishment of a working group in the Department to consider future requirements for home economics teachers. The group, working on the basis of a total annual intake of 32 trainee students, recommended that provision be made for this number in St. Angela&rsquo;s College, Sligo, as the sole college providing teacher training in home economics. From this, we can see it was not unheard of that St. Angela&rsquo;s would be considered as the location. Throughout the compilation of his report, Mr. O&rsquo;Brien consulted widely with St. Catherine&rsquo;s, the various Dublin colleges listed in the report, including TCD, DCU, UCD, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire college, DIT, etc., and St. Angela&rsquo;s in Sligo. Based on all the facts available to him, he drew up what was the best outcome in his opinion, which is but one interpretation of the facts. When I hear people say how the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, ignored the report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I will come to the FOI request in due course. If the Senator had the manners to be here earlier in the debate, he would have heard that I will touch on it. This report facilitated the Minister&rsquo;s decision to transfer St. Catherine&rsquo;s to Sligo. It is interesting that the report states a transfer anywhere other than St. Angela&rsquo;s in Sligo would require varying amounts of capital investment. To transfer it to Sligo requires none, despite the briefing document, of which I got wind today, which stated it would require &euro;500,000. This is incorrect. It would need an additional amount of in the region of &euro;400,000 per annum to facilitate the college in Sligo. The students are already in place. I am amazed that Senator Burke is involved in the motion.</P>

	<P>We have consulted with everyone. We have seen no capital outlay to go to St. Angela&rsquo;s, minimal changes in terms of additional staff and the students are already in place. This represents great value for money. There is no doubt the consultant recommended going to UCD and people in the Department agreed with that. It is the Minister&rsquo;s prerogative and duty to examine the entire picture and make an informed objective decision without being clouded in any way by any vested interest.</P>
    <P>He certainly did not ignore the reports. In fact, the reports helped to facilitate the best and most <Col N="167"/>logical outcome, one that is in line with Government policy in terms of the national spatial strategy and balanced regional development. There is no third level institution in the NUI north of the line from Dublin to Galway except for St. Angela&rsquo;s College. In a report which I notice did not come under the freedom of information but was commissioned by a Sligo group, PKS Consultants, it is estimated that to build a greenfield site to facilitate the students on an annual basis would cost in the region of &euro;12 million. Many of the facilities needed are in UCD. The report states that specialist kitchens would be required. One is in the multi-million dollar area in terms of putting these facilities in place. Better value for money means going to St. Angela&rsquo;s.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris said that an amount of money was spent on St. Catherine&rsquo;s and asked how it could be closing when money had been spent to bring it up to a particular standard. If people took the time to read the report from beginning to end, they would see the works had to be carried out to bring it up to the required health and safety standards in order to go forward for the following three years.</P>
    <P>I am not long in this House and am probably politically naive and ill-informed about many matters. I can only aspire to the greatness and fluency in the political system of Senator Ryan and others. However, as far as I know, if a freedom of information officer is asked to give out something, and if it is appropriate to do so, he or she should give it out. I used this facility once or twice in my previous occupation. I lobbied and made extensive representations based on the facts and the Minister made his decision based on the facts and value for money.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a lot of heat but not so much new light. The Information Commissioner&rsquo;s report makes interesting reading. It is astonishing that five years after the Freedom of Information Act came into force the original decision maker in the Department of Education and Science could ignore, we are assured without any political interference, the public interest provisions of section 21 of the Freedom of Information Act when making a decision about the disclosure of information. It is extraordinary that a civil ser<Col N="169"/>vant, presumably whose promotion to a degree at least depends on the goodwill of the Minister, would forget a major section of the Freedom of Information Act in order to come to a conclusion, which just happened to be the same view as that of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The former Minister refused to disclose the same information to his own party colleagues and to the new and perhaps naive Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy for D&uacute;n Laoghaire, whose name I cannot mention because Senators are not supposed to name Members of the other House. It is an extraordinary coincidence that the former Minister came to exactly the same conclusion and used almost exactly the same language to refuse access to information as that used by the independent freedom of information officer in his Department.</P>
    <P>Another strange matter arises from the freedom of information disclosures, rather than the consultancy report about which many people were immediately suspicious once the refusal to disclose it arose. We have all watched Fianna F&aacute;il in particular wriggle under the exigencies of the Freedom of Information Act and its shameless filleting of it because the party decided to wriggle no more on certain matters. The strange matter in the disclosures, and one assumes and accepts that everything relevant has been disclosed, is the absence of one document which one would think central to this issue. That is the document upon which the former Minister based his decision. He decided to ignore his own officials and consultants and to do something different.</P>
    <P>We are all now used to the mantra that advice is advice and Ministers make decisions, which is a tenet with which I do not disagree. However, we are entitled to expect that decisions are rational and reasonable and are documented in a manner which allows others to make a judgment about them. In the whole mass of documentation about this issue, there is no document which explains why the former Minister made his decision. There is a press release about the national spatial strategy but there is no mention of intensive lobbying by eminent members of Fianna F&aacute;il, including former Ministers and EU Commissioners. There is no letter from any former Commissioner among the documents disclosed although the name of such a Commissioner appears in the report. One assumes that the telephone must have been used for the purpose of this vigorous lobbying.</P>
    <P>Separate from the merits or demerits of the case, this is a scandalous piece of odiferous decision-making by a Minister who has nothing documented in his departmental files to explain why this decision was made. Future decisions will be made in the dark without any written evidence as to how they were made. This most expansive Government, which spends so much money on consultants and advisers, decided to overrule and ignore an eminent former senior civil servant in the Department of Education and Science and did not condescend to include a document in its own files to explain why. We all know why, <Col N="170"/>however. This was not a decision about educational policy or about the national spatial strategy. Nobody is quicker to ignore the national spatial strategy than this Government when it suits it, as it did in the matter of the botched decentralisation programme, a nonsense which will hopefully be abandoned soon. The Government blissfully ignores spatial strategies in that matter in the interests of much more mundane issues like the question of where votes might be attained. This is exactly the same situation.</P>
    <P>I have no particular axe to grind but I recognise that reports which were written years ago about the number of students doing subjects such as home economics have been overtaken by events and issues, such as those to do with role models and the status of men and women in society. I am concerned that a process of decision making undertaken by a Minister for Education and Science should be based on reason and analysis. In all the documentation I have seen on this matter, there is no reason and analysis, only big name lobbying and politically expedient decision making. If that is the way decisions about the future of Irish education will generally be made, then the future of Irish education is severely threatened. God help us if the entire OECD report is ignored in the interests of political expediency in response to high level lobbying. Is the entire Kelly report regarding capital investment in third level education no more than a document to be considered and then discarded in the light of political lobbying and expediency?</P>
    <P>The situation is clear; a mess has been created of grandiose proportions. The lives of dedicated teachers in St. Catherine&rsquo;s College have been messed up and the future of a fine educational institution undermined and we still do not know why. There is no rational basis detailed in any file in the Department of Education and Science. We know the Department knew the decision stank, however, because the former Minister would not publish any of the related documentation and his officials came to a coincidentally identical conclusion to his own. The Information Commissioner told the Department how wrong it was and so we now know that the reason it did not publish was because the absence of rational decision making would become immediately clear after publication. The rational case was for retention of the <i>status quo</i>; the political case was for the closure of St. Catherine&rsquo;s College. Not for the first time, a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Education and Science ignored rationality and the best advice and went for political expediency. He should be ashamed of himself.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the amendment is peculiarly worded and grossly out of order, and should have been ruled as such. It is not the function of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to confirm a decision to close any institution; such a confirmation forms no part of the Members&rsquo; constitutional role.</P>

   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>

	<P>There is no doubt that St. Catherine&rsquo;s College was a fine college with excellent staff. Nobody can take that away and I congratulate the college on the work it has done over the past 90 years. However, the trustees and the Dominican Order announced that they were not in a position to retain the college in its current form for financial and other reasons. The former Minister for Education and Science had a decision to make. There is no Member who can deny that he or she does not lobby from time to time and I acknowledge that I lobbied to have the facility moved to St. Angela&rsquo;s College.</P>

I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that there should be more emphasis on home economics teachers and the work they do. Unfortunately, however, there are qualified people who cannot get teaching work in this subject. There is probably only room in this country for one college for home economics teachers.</P>

There is no need to ask the Minister to talk to the board and the staff of St. Catherine&rsquo;s, although I am sure she would have no problem with that, and to ensure the staff are facilitated. The decision has been taken and there is no going back on it. It has come as a shock to the people working there and we must have consideration for them. I do not doubt but that they will be treated in the best manner possible by the Minister.</P>

    <P>I have listened to the Opposition and agree with Senator Brian Hayes when he said it is not a matter of St. Angela&rsquo;s versus St. Catherine&rsquo;s or of Sligo versus Dublin. Senator Scanlon put it well when he said there was room for only one home economics college in the country.

	<P>A point was made in the summary of the report we received this morning, and Senator Henry also raised the same matter, relating to the idea of a campus, the lack of facilities and the feelings students have that they are not part of a larger campus such as that of a university. Sligo town has between 4,000 and 5,000 students at Sligo Institute of Technology where there is an excellent campus with the best residential accommodation. Sligo town is almost a campus for the students. St. Angela&rsquo;s is approximately two miles from the institute and both sets of students get on very well.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>One would not need to be from Mars to observe the significant lack of transparency in the Minister&rsquo;s decision or to see that political interference influenced that decision. This is what we are talking about. We are not here to pit one college against the other. There is no doubt that St. Angela&rsquo;s is a wonderful college. That is not in question. What we are doing is questioning and trying to establish how the Minister came to his decision.</P>
    <P>Senator Feeney said that he made his decision based on sound economic and educational reasons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>But he did not write them down.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no proof that those were the reasons for this decision. What happens when there is no transparency is that people lose faith in the political system and their Ministers. We all become tarnished by that, not just the Government of the day. I do not like this system. I like to see decisions taken for reasons over which a person can stand. I do not like to see a Minister appoint a consultant who makes a decision which is then disregarded by the Minister. On other occasions Ministers like to hide behind consultants&rsquo; decisions or recommendations. However, we cannot find the reasons the Minister made this decision.</P>
    <P>Why did he stand over an investment in St. Catherine&rsquo;s and then on the day following completion of the work make the decision to close the college? This reminds me of the &euro;13 million spent by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about three years ago on a building in Mountjoy which still lies empty. Senator Feeney spoke about value for money. Did the <Col N="174"/>taxpayers get value for money from the &euro;1.3 million spent on St. Catherine&rsquo;s? Did they get value for money from the &euro;13 million spent on the school in Mountjoy which still lies empty? Staff who were employed to go into that school are being paid although they are not carrying out their duties in the empty school.</P>
    <P>When we have a process that does not show sound reasons for a decision and which does not include consultation with the interested parties before a decision is arrived at, we must be suspicious and lose faith in the system. The decision to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s showed total disregard for the Dominican Sisters and for the staff of the school who served the students so well over the years. Treating them in such a shoddy fashion undermines our political system and is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I can understand why the local politicians lobbied to have the school in Sligo. However, was that the only reason the Minister arrived at his decision? If so, he did not look at the overall picture to see how he could deliver the best education for those who want to study home economics. It would make sound economic and educational sense to keep a school of home economics in Dublin where we have one third of the population. I have young student children and live in an area in Dublin where there are many students. People resident in Dublin would prefer to stay in Dublin.</P>

	<P>If they must make a choice between travelling to Sligo to take up the courses of their choice or taking another course in Dublin, they may well opt for their second choice, stay in Dublin and not do the home economics course. This decision was arrived at in an undemocratic fashion.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I did not welcome the new Minister when I began but I do so now and I wish her well for the future. However, her first visit to the House concerns a serious issue, which she must take on board. I ask her to examine how the decision was reached and to review it in a transparent way. I expect she will examine the issue from a practical perspective, taking account of all the merits and demerits of the case, and will arrive at a decision. Whatever the decision, it should be transparent and she should inform us of on what her decision is based. We will then see whether that is acceptable. People cannot be treated in a shoddy fashion. If, at the end of the day, everything has been done to save the school and we can see the correct decision was made to move to Sligo, so be it, but the process has not evolved in a transparent way. I hope the Minister will ensure this is the case.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas dona Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; uilig as an bhf&aacute;ilte cro&iacute;&uacute;il a chur siad romham anseo inniu. I thank Senators for their warm wel<Col N="175"/>come and I look forward to working with them over the next two years and nine months in my new role. I was chuffed that, on my first day as Minister of State in February 2000, my father was in the Seanad to welcome me and it was particularly nice that my brother was present today to welcome me.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the topic we are discussing is close to my heart. I wish to address a misunderstanding, particularly in light of comments made by Senator Brian Hayes. He kept referring to the school and area with which I am associated. My association for a long number of proud years is with the second level school at Sion Hill and there is absolutely no threat to that school. The decision relating to the third level college has no implications for that school.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the safest school in Ireland.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>People can get the wrong impression in this regard based on media reports and so on and I am anxious to clarify that in the interest of an excellent second level school. St. Catherine&rsquo;s is also an excellent third level school.</P>
    <P>I reject the notion that the decision was reached on the basis of political interference. We are all politicians and we make representations. The public is entitled to make representations to us and we, as politicians, are entitled to make representations to Ministers. That is a valuable part of the political process. Representations were made to my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in the normal course of events but the decision taken was not based on them. The system of access to politicians and Ministers which operates in the State should not be jettisoned by the criticism of the valid role of political representation.</P>
    <P>St. Catherine&rsquo;s College has a long tradition of providing an excellent quality of education. It is a private institution, owned by the Dominican Order in the same way St. Angela&rsquo;s College is owned by the Ursuline Order. It has provided training for home economics teachers for years. Both are small colleges but they are centres of excellence. Reference was made to the amount of money spent on them. The annual grant to St. Catherine&rsquo;s to cover the bachelor of education training course, which is not met from the college&rsquo;s income, was &euro;1.973 million in 2003 but the majority of the funding comprised State grants and the remainder comprised free fees to students. A total of &euro;1.3 million was spent in recent years on necessary health and safety improvements. It did not matter when a decision was made because wiring and so on had to be done and, therefore, the money had to be spent.</P>
    <P>The number of home economics graduates needed has been the subject of ongoing debate for a number of years. A steering committee on the future development of higher education was established in the 1980s and it issued a report in 1995. The committee examined a number of <Col N="176"/>issues but had not completed its work. It recommended that the necessary review and analysis should be pursued further through a joint approach between the Department of Education and the Higher Education Authority. That was taken up in 1996 by the then Minister, who requested the HEA to reconvene the advisory group on the supply of and demand for second level teachers with revised terms of reference focusing,<i> inter alia</i>, on the determination of specialist teacher needs outside of the higher diploma programme. The terms of reference also sought recommendations on the required intake of students by subject area.</P>
    <P>The review was concluded in 1998 and it was recommended that the intake of 53 students annually by both colleges should be maintained. It was assumed that number would satisfy the need for home economics teachers in the education system not only then but in the future, taking into account retirements, increases in student numbers and changes in the number of schools offering the subject. It was significant that the group decided there was no need for additional teachers.</P>
    <P>There was no question of the Department seeking to close St. Catherine&rsquo;s or to transfer the students to St. Angela&rsquo;s but for the Dominican trustees indicating that they were no longer able to fulfil their role. This was understandable because the Dominicans have made a strong, positive and significant contribution to the area and to the State. However, because of their numbers, they could no longer fulfil their long-standing role in second and third level institutions. When they said they could not continue as trustees of the college, the question had to be asked regarding what would be done. All the options had to be examined. The trustees engaged in discussions with the Department to ascertain whether their role should be transferred and so on.</P>
    <P>My predecessor was faced with a number of questions such as whether to buy the college, buy another site or transfer the students to different colleges. All these questions were examined. A decision on relocation of such a specialist college had significant financial implications and different advice was offered based on consultants&rsquo; reports, the spatial strategy, which dealt with finances at the time, the numbers permitted in the public service, better value for money, allocation of resources and so on. It was obvious the Department should have considered where else such a course was being offered at such a high standard. St. Angela&rsquo;s College had spare capacity. It could accommodate the numbers, it had specialist facilities and it could respond to the future home economics needs of schools.</P>
    <P>All the options were placed in front of my predecessor and, bearing all considerations in mind, the decision was taken. It was not based on the recommendation of one particular consultant or report or on political lobbying, but on all the considerations I have mentioned.</P><Col N="177"/>
    <P>Senators have mentioned the report of Mr. Jack O&rsquo;Brien, a senior official in the Department. While he set out some of the advice, there were overarching questions. It is not correct to say, as some Senators have suggested, that people will not travel to undertake a specialist course. People travel all over the country for specialist courses. There are courses which are only available at NUIG, which students are delighted to attend while others can only be undertaken at the University of Limerick to which people will travel from anywhere. There are other courses which are only available at DCU. Where people want to pursue a particular career or course, they are very happy to travel. It is not a persuasive argument to say that everybody wants to come to Dublin or even that Dublin people want to stay here. That is not the case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody said that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Terry said Dublin people might like to stay in Dublin. If one wants to follow a specialist course, one will travel.</P>
    <P>While the decision was taken on the basis of all the considerations, I reiterate that the issue would not have arisen but for the recognition of the difficulties the Dominican trustees were having. We are faced with circumstances in which a decision has been taken and is being implemented. There are no first year students at St. Catherine&rsquo;s while there is a double intake of students in St Angela&rsquo;s. There is no evidence that there is a need to provide extra places. According to the reports we have, the numbers being taken in now are adequate to meet our needs. There does not appear to be any reason to maintain a college in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Many decisions have been taken by previous Ministers and I regret that I am not in a position to reverse them. People are asking me, though not in this House, to reverse the decision of a previous Minister for Education and Science on free fees. While I will not be reversing that decision either, Members would try to make sure I did not do so if I indicated such an intention.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not draw us on that subject.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the job of a Minister to reverse the decisions of previous office holders.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why Deputy Noel Dempsey is where he is today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, I will be more than happy to meet with staff, the board of governors and the board of management of St. Catherine&rsquo;s for whom I have a very high regard. However, I hope it is not in the expectation that I can reverse the decision which has been made but rather that I can help with transitional arrangements, discuss where their future lies and facilitate them in whatever way I can. Should evidence arise in future of a need to train more students at a course <Col N="178"/>in Dublin, I will be open to hearing it. No other proposals have been brought forward to date. Unfortunately, the decision is being implemented and there are now only second, third and fourth year students at St. Catherine&rsquo;s.</P>
    <P>It is opportune to recognise the role St. Catherine&rsquo;s and its graduates have played around the country. Senators are correct in their arguments about the debate on obesity, food awareness, safety and health. A role can be played in this area not just by home economics teachers but by graduates of courses such as that offered at Cathal Brugha Street. All of us can have an influence in terms of our own actions in this context.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry seemed to indicate the degrees which have been granted in the past and those which will be granted to current students of St. Catherine&rsquo;s will in some way not be Trinity College awards or that students will be stripped of them. That is a fabrication and I am surprised that Senator Henry should suggest it. There is no question of any threat to a degree which has or will be granted to students of St. Catherine&rsquo;s. It is important to recognise those graduates and to thank most sincerely the Dominican Sisters for the role they have played in the education landscape and for their <i>veritas</i>, which of course is the motto of the order. It was instilled into us all as we taught there and into many communities in which the order has been involved.</P>
    <P>This decision was made for a wide variety of reasons and based on numerous considerations rather than on any single report or lobby. While, unfortunately and to my regret, I am not in a position to reverse it, I look forward to meeting and working with the staff of the college to find how best to facilitate an easy transition for their futures.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to welcome the Minister to the House in these circumstances. I regret the situation in which she finds herself, which is probably very difficult for her. Good, real and raw politics is being played in this House today. The Minister finds herself locked into and having to back up a decision taken by her predecessor and of which she probably does not approve. As the college is in her constituency, the Minister is on a skewer and must defend with the many weapons at her disposal a decision she feels is indefensible. She is cutting her teeth in Cabinet in a raw manner at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>It was a good thing that the Minister discarded her supplied script as its contents were pretty feeble. Much of it was unadulterated rhubarb irrelevant to the issue and which would have been wasted on this House. If the Minister continues in that vein, she will do well. The script contained a great deal of background which was not relevant to the decision which was taken. In fact, the staff and students of St. Catherine&rsquo;s are the victims of an old-fashioned Fianna F&aacute;il stroke, as is the Minister to a large extent. As a university Senator, I deeply resent that decision. I suppose I have a vested interest in the matter as those <Col N="179"/>with degrees from St. Catherine&rsquo;s have a vote in the constituency represented by Senators Norris, Henry and myself. While I have a vested interest in defending the interests of those degree holders, that is not to say the position does not coincide with what I believe in. On the other side, there is an extraordinary preponderance of people from Sligo popping up to defend the decision.</P>
    <P>While I did not have time to read the local newspapers, it is probable that when the decision was made in 2003 we would have seen all the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives in County Sligo jumping up and down and saying, &ldquo;Hey, we got this one off Dublin and we are responsible for the decision.&rdquo; They came in here today to say the decision was made on the basis of rational considerations by an independent Minister and had nothing to do with geography, Fianna F&aacute;il and public representatives. While Senators MacSharry and Scanlon should be congratulated for pulling a stroke, strokes have victims. The Senators can prance around Sligo and say they are responsible because they are. The evidence has been revealed here. Among the things which have been revealed is that my old friend and adversary, Ray MacSharry, continues to have enormous clout in this country.</P>

	<P>He was mentioned in dispatches.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. MacSharry was mentioned in the briefing in a semi-complimentary way.</P>

	<P>It was hard to get it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The lesson here is that the former Minister, Mr. Ray MacSharry, continues to have enormous influence and can pull a stroke for Sligo. It is quite obvious to anybody looking at the evidence that this decision was made on purely political grounds. The previous Minister wrote a letter confirming the decision on his last day in office to ensure it could not be reversed by Deputy Hanafin. Somebody probably foresaw that she would be the Minister for Education and Science and might reverse the decision as a representative from the constituency in which St. Catherine&rsquo;s College is situated. The previous Minister wrote an unnecessary letter which stated that this particular decision could not and should not be reversed just to lock Deputy Hanafin into it. The Minister is locked into a decision which is politically embarrassing because it relates to her constituency.</P>
    <P>I would like now to put on record one or two thoughts on this issue as it applies first to Trinity College Dublin and, second, to the students involved. Despite the fact that this is a TCD-accredited degree I do not believe the authorities in TCD were apprised of or consulted about the decision. My experience in this House on matters <Col N="180"/>of education has been that this Government, in particular, and the previous Government use them as a tool of political convenience whenever they feel like it. It was quite apparent when the Universities Bill was going through this House that the then Government and the subsequent Government, when the private Bill was introduced, promised consultation with the universities on important issues but did not deliver on it. Consultation is pretty irrelevant in political terms. It is a type of camouflage put out by party politicians to give the impression that there will be consultation but they then reject whatever opinion is given to them if they do not like it. It is apparent from this measure that when the Minister received from the consultant a result which he did not like, the political lobbyists from his party told him to take no notice of it and he rejected it.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, had the educational expertise to make a decision of this type. He had the political nous to know what would go down well with his cohorts in Sligo but he did not know much about St. Catherine&rsquo;s College or any of the other schools involved. He made his decision regardless of the report. He also overruled the decision of a senior civil servant and watched &euro;1.3 million of public money being frittered away willy nilly. It is an extraordinary coincidence that the works were completed just as the decision was made.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to look not just at the interests of the teachers in her constituency with whom she met. She knows as well as I that there is no point meeting them, that is blancmange to keep the constituents happy.</P>

This places an enormous imposition on students, most of whom come from Leinster and Munster, who will have to pay the maintenance and travel costs associated with living away from home. They are the hidden costs which are not considered when political strokes of this nature are pulled. I condemn this decision which was taken regardless of the educational value or the great work done by the staff of St. Catherine&rsquo;s College.</P>

I <Col N="181"/>know the Minister has midland connections and I hope to see much of her there, in particular in County Longford where there are many applicants for school funding, a matter with which I will deal another day. When I heard Senator Feeney refer to the Minister as Senator Hanafin, I thought she had been demoted.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>It was a slip of the tongue.</P>
   </Speaker><?oasys [cl10.5]?>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion and join with my colleagues in calling on the Minister to rescind her predecessor&rsquo;s decision and to restore full status to St. Catherine&rsquo;s College of Education in Sion Hill. Given the Minister&rsquo;s speech this evening, it is clear that even though it would be in the interests of her constituents were she to rescind that decision, she will not make a U-turn in that regard.</P>
    <P>Recently released documentation from the Department of Education and Science under the ruling of the Information Commissioner has shown that the former Minister made his decision regarding the closure of St. Catherine&rsquo;s College against the advice of consultants and officials from his Department. He then compounded his mistake by trying to hide details behind an error of judgment. It is obvious there was no co-ordination within the Department of Education and Science. I again ask the Minister to reconsider the consultants&rsquo; recommendations, in particular the proposals in the O&rsquo;Brien report referred to earlier by the Minister, that St. Catherine&rsquo;s College be merged with a Dublin-based university and to bring some cohesion into a Department which appears to be dangerously out of control. The Department is now in new hands and, hopefully, the Minister will improve on what was there before.</P>
    <P>I would be astonished if the Minister were to hide behind the former Minister&rsquo;s extraordinary muddled and incoherent reasons for closing St. Catherine&rsquo;s College, reasons which strangely related to trustees and, as Senator MacSharry stated, a national spatial strategy. There is no doubt this Government has been a spendthrift one. It has perfected the art of spending by, on the one hand, squandering money and, on the other, taking from the most vulnerable among us. Enormous sums have been spent on building and refurbishing hospital wards which never opened.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should confine his remarks to the motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;1.4 million was spent on upgrading St. Catherine&rsquo;s College which was, upon completion of work, promptly closed by the former Minister. This is not an isolated incident. Dunbeg national school, County Donegal, a fully-equipped school &mdash; a rarity these days &mdash; was recently closed by the former Minister because, technically, it was one pupil short of the required number despite the fact that more students were expected to enrol. I understand my colleague Senator McHugh intervened with the Minister to ensure the school remained opened. The people <Col N="182"/>of Donegal owe a debt of gratitude to him in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>He should not be lobbying the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister will bring her own thoughts to her position. I ask that she imbue our education with all the benefits of a little common sense, something which is important in politics today. I admire the Minister&rsquo;s tone in answering the questions posed today. However, her answer was unsatisfactory to Members on this side of the House and to current and future pupils and teachers at St. Catherine&rsquo;s College. Common sense is lacking in terms of the closure of the school being discussed this evening. Common sense tells us St. Catherine&rsquo;s College is a valuable education facility to its community. It is one of two home economics teacher training colleges, the other being St. Angela&rsquo;s in Lough Gill, County Sligo, which caters for the western and northern regions. St. Catherine&rsquo;s College has traditionally catered for students from Leinster and Munster. Access to a range of second level schools for teacher work placement during their training will be limited and will incur significant costs for students from a Sligo base. Senator MacSharry referred to the cost of student accommodation. The placement of students in other colleges will prove costly. They will have to come back to Dublin, the east coast, the south coast and Munster eventually.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Only six out of 57 are from Dublin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The students feel that a move to St. Angela&rsquo;s will deprive them of a real third level campus experience.</P>
    <P>St. Catherine&rsquo;s College has operated under the ownership of the Dominican Order for the past 90 years and we must not forget the immense debt of gratitude we owe the nuns for their valuable work. We must also remember that the nuns have invested a significant amount of time and money in the college. Can we let that investment go to waste?</P>
    <P>We have all received letters from constituents, concerned students, parents, teachers and past pupils of St. Catherine&rsquo;s earnestly asking us to save this college. With current lifestyles, young people need to be educated to be responsible and well informed in their dietary and exercise choices. Last year, 15,000 students sat the leaving certificate examination in home economics, far higher numbers than in physics or chemistry. The demand for this course exists so we must provide the teachers to meet that demand.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Noel Dempsey was asked to reconsider his decision on the closure and to meet the board of the college, he sent it a letter stating that the decision was final and there was no point having a further meeting on the matter. His door was closed, as it was when he decided to close St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school in Newtownforbes, County Longford. There is significant demand for facilities in this area and it will come back to <Col N="183"/>haunt the Minister because there is a shortage of secondary school places in County Longford. I hope she will be willing to meet teachers, parents&rsquo; groups and school boards of management. To do otherwise would be a bad start to her tenure as Minister for Education and Science. I look forward to meeting her to discuss Lanesborough Community College. I am sure she is aware of the shortage of funding and will deal with the issue.</P><?oasys [cl11]?>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I have no doubt that her style, acumen and manner of dealing with people will stand her in good stead. Speaking from five years&rsquo; experience in that Department, I know it requires partnership with people. It is apparent in every line of the Minister&rsquo;s script that that is the way she is setting out her agenda for her tenure in the Department of Education and Science. Listening, reflecting and responding are vital to the job. There will be 40 files on the Minister&rsquo;s desk every morning, each of them with a problem that must be worked through. There is no problem that cannot be solved by listening and talking to people. Discussion is the panacea to all difficulties. The Minister&rsquo;s speech is redolent of the way in which she intends to carry out her business. That is good for education because it is not a snap, crackle and pop system. The Minister must listen, talk and reflect.</P>
    <P>Even when I was Minister in 1991, this college was on the agenda.</P>

    <P>The Minister stated that she intends to work out the ramifications for the staff now that a year <Col N="184"/>has passed with no intake and as there will be no students after next year, it is important that staff considerations be taken into account. The Minister and I had a brief conversation before we came in and I was surprised by how quickly Deputy Hanafin has grasped the main elements of the Department of Education and Science.</P>

	<P>Staff considerations are important. People have partners, houses, children, mortgages or aged parents. All of those issues must be addressed to ensure a successful working through of the details. I urge the Department to put those considerations to the forefront of its decision making. Young people are adaptable, as I know from my own family, but teachers and lecturers are grown up and have a stake in society. They must see that stake valued and given further consideration. Their role must be affirmed and the Minister will do that.</P>
    <P>I spoke tonight because I wanted to wish the Minister well. I also spoke because progress can be made in this case, not in what is already laid out, but in making arrangements for those involved in the transfer.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and all the Senators who contributed to the debate. I want to repudiate the idea that anyone on this side of the House feels that St. Angela&rsquo;s is in any way inferior, as was intimated. No one on this side of the House implied that.</P>

That is not the purpose of this debate and it never was.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of a fundamental appraisal by the Dominican congregation of their role as trustees in educational institutions generally, the trustees of St. Catherine&rsquo;s decided that, for personal and financial reasons, they were no longer in a position to fulfil their role as trustees of the college. That did not necessitate closure but that is what came through in your speech as I interpreted it.</P>

The reports by the professionals within the Department clearly indicated that there were alternatives, provided the opportunity was given to explore them. It could be the continuation of the current situation by arrangement with the trustees or, as recommended in the report, the college could be subsumed into other institutions, such as UCD, which is preferable because of its geographic proximity and convenience.</P>

I hope that even at this 12th hour the Minister will reconsider that decision.

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, the Minister and his officials to the House. I extend to my neighbour from across the border in Limerick my warmest congratulations on his appointment as Minister for Defence. He has been compared to many people but I would like to make my own comparison. He has a reputation of being a Stakhanovite in that he has worked extremely hard over the years and his appointment is no more than is due to him.</P>
    <P>While I am making a geographical reference, I wish to commend to the Minister&rsquo;s care the Sarsfield&rsquo;s Rock monument in east Limerick, which I have visited a couple of times in the past ten years. Obviously it is a matter for the Minister and for Limerick County Council, but I feel the Army in Limerick should perhaps take some interest in it. Perhaps there should be an annual ceremony. It is not so big and ambitious a monument that it would be too difficult to maintain. It is situated in a very evocative place.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, who did a very good job as Minister for Defence over the past six years in terms of re-equipping the Army, providing leadership and raising the status of the Defence Forces. At the time of President Bush&rsquo;s visit to Shannon, I was almost taken aback, as were many people, by the stream of armoured vehicles photographed on the roads in the region. We did not realise how much equipment was in existence.</P>
    <P>The defence portfolio is an important one. The Defence Forces comprise a very important institution of the State. They serve us at home and abroad and make a valuable contribution to international peacekeeping. The Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, took us back 14 years to when her brother, the late Brian Lenihan, was Minister for Defence. There had been a fair degree of dissatisfaction in the Defence Forces. They are subject to hierarchical discipline but at the same time their members wanted the right to have their voice heard in terms of conditions of employment. The Leader was correct to point out the important contribution the then Minister made, including the establishment of the representative associations. I have been at one or two of their conferences and, by and large, admire the spirit with which they go about their work. The late John Lucey was mentioned and I subscribe to the praise for his role.</P>
    <P>I visited the military college recently and got the impression that the Defence Forces are highly motivated and doing an important and valuable job on behalf of us all. This Bill, which establishes an ombudsman for the Defence Forces, represents a very logical step in enabling one to make complaints. In the last analysis, rather than just having people policing or judging themselves, the Bill provides for an independent office to which an appeal in last resort can be made. This is the way the Office of the Ombudsman for general purposes works. It is really only when all other <Col N="190"/>recourses are exhausted that a case goes to the Ombudsman. This is very progressive legislation and it tackles the problem of how one brings an institution, such as an army, which is one of the oldest institutions in the world, into line with the spirit of the modern age in which people have the right to participate in and, to a degree, co-determine what happens to them and have a legitimate voice without being demoted.</P>
    <P>A topic has been in the news recently because of the conference taking place regarding people going abroad and the degree to which this is voluntary, given that some may have been pressed to do so somewhat against their will. Anyone joining the Army these days would have reason to expect that service abroad would be part of what would normally be expected of him or her. Obviously, soldiers would have the right to opt out or not to volunteer. However, there are responsibilities to be considered. It may be that some places are much less attractive in physical terms than others but I would like to believe that most members of the Army would be prepared to do a stint wherever they are called to make a contribution unless there were very particular circumstances preventing them from doing so. I accept that the ombudsman has quite a difficult task. A previous speaker made the point that if one is a sergeant-major barking out orders on the parade ground and somebody is told to straighten up, then obviously this is not necessarily to be construed as bullying or harassment unless it is way over the top. Discipline is required in a military situation and so judgment, tact and mutual forbearance are needed to distinguish between normal discipline and abnormal bullying and harassment.</P>
    <P>I gather the Minister may be attending one of the Army conferences tomorrow. I am sure that, as well as being in charge, under the President of course, he will act as a good advocate at the Cabinet table in terms of what is needed for the development of the Defence Forces. We take pride in our Defence Forces and take an interest in what they are doing. We also take up whatever opportunities are offered to visit barracks or occasionally to visit them when serving abroad. In 2000, along with the Taoiseach, I was privileged to visit the Rangers in East Timor. They did an exceptionally fine job in a tricky, volatile and vulnerable situation by stabilising the jungle frontier between East and West Timor. In that way, East Timor was allowed to develop without further wrecking or destabilisation. The Rangers did a very fine job in that respect. Nowadays the facilities, including living conditions, are getting much better.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a progressive reform. I wish the Minister well and I assure him of the strong support he will have in this House.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Lydon.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="191"/>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, would like to congratulate the Minister on his promotion and wish him well in the important Department of which he is now the political head. When the office of ombudsman was first established in Sweden in 1806, there were two ombudsmen &mdash; the military ombudsman and the justice ombudsman. It was, therefore, regarded as very important that there should be an ombudsman for military affairs. I am delighted to see that at long last the Defence Forces are being granted some form of modern personnel standards. They are entitled to have an ombudsman. We should commend Dr. Doyle for the work on which the Minister has reported.</P>
    <P>While the new office must be established along with the requisite powers, and while the military ombudsman will be a different office from that of the Ombudsman &mdash; in the same way as the health service ombudsman is different &mdash; there is no reason those positions could not all be held by the same person. Consideration should be given to that possibility. An expertise had developed in the Office of the Ombudsman in dealing with such matters. There is a body of knowledge and precedent there and, after all, it is personnel work. If the various ombudsman roles were held by one person it would minimise the expense of setting up a new office, with people having to find their way around. Over the 20 years since it was established, the Office of the Ombudsman has established itself as an object of public trust. It would be helpful if the various positions were to be held by the same person.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the right of a member of the Defence Forces to complain about unacceptable treatment. However, if members of the public have a complaint against the Defence Forces presumably they have recourse to the ordinary Ombudsman. One could see it happening if the Army was acting in support of the civil power and, for example, roughed up a house. It is something the Minister might consider.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has to amend the 1954 Act, it is a pity he did not take the opportunity to amend that part of the Act dealing with service under the aegis of the United Nations. The wording of that part of the Act will have to be examined sooner or later so we do not again get into a situation in which we were unable to help out in, for example, Macedonia. Increasingly, there is a tendency for the United Nations to sub-contract some of its activities perhaps to an emerging European force. It would be a pity if we had to sit on the sidelines just because our legislation was couched in terms which, if narrowly interpreted, would prevent us from participating in some UN missions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on having presented it to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his well-deserved appointment. I also welcome the Bill. The existing system of invoking redress for wrongs was rightly discredited and the Bill admirably gives effect to <Col N="192"/>principles of fairness and transparency. It is important that the independence of the new office is clear and I look forward to its promulgation within the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In principle, this legislation is long overdue. I am glad to see it covers the Reserve Defence Force, An F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il and An Slua Muir&iacute;. They are going through a worrisome period during their reorganisation, especially in the context of the decision to reassign officers and senior non-commissioned officers to different jobs within the next few months. No doubt the Minister will be with us again in the House on future occasions to debate issues, including the new reserve, name changes, employment protection and overseas service.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that the appointee as military ombudsman cannot be a serving member of the Defence Forces, as this will underpin the perception of independence. I hope that the first appointee, irrespective of whether a man or woman performs the task, is only appointed for one term of seven years. This raises the issue of what the Minister will set as the prescribed age and I look forward to hearing his views on that subject. A person of mature years is needed as the new ombudsman for the Defence Forces and that person must have a track record in human relations. My reason for proposing an initial single term is that the reports made to the Minister and his successor will more precisely define what attributes are needed in a military ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I am pleased an annual report by the ombudsman is provided for and I hope the Minister will share with the House his thoughts on what issues he will prescribe the report should include. I respectfully suggest that when the Minister brings the office of ombudsman into operation, a briefing document should be sent to the home of each serving member of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In these days of decentralisation I hope the office of the ombudsman will not be located in Dublin. If it is not going to be in Limerick, I suggest it should go to Killybegs where at least the navy will always have a warm berth.</P>
    <P>Turning to nitty-gritty issues, will the appointee be full time? I wonder if there is a necessity to have such an independent, standalone ombudsman. I suspect that, after the initial flurry of pent-up demand has been satisfied, a defence force of 11,000 personnel and a similar number in the reserve, should not attract too heavy a workload. Thus, I wonder whether the existing Ombudsman will be appointed to fill that role. If it is a distinctive, separate appointee, how many staff will he or she employ to undertake the initial work? No doubt consideration has been given to that issue by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.</P>
    <P>Though I understand why, I am nonetheless disappointed that the ombudsman will not have the power to investigate complaints retrospectively. I hope that once it is signed into law, the Minister will bring the Bill into operation at the <Col N="193"/>earliest moment. There is a pent-up demand for this appointment, so the earlier it is signed the better.</P><?oasys [cl10.5]?>
    <P>I note that section 4(2)(<i>c</i>) indicates exclusions for military operations. Will the Minister spell out what is meant by a &ldquo;military operation&rdquo;, as I am at a loss to identify, other than purely routine barracks tasks, what will be encompassed by such operations? I feel that guard duties, honour guards, cash escorts, range practices, tactical exercises and overseas operations fall into that exclusion. I wonder what in practice this exclusion will permit the ombudsman to investigate. Will it be the duties an individual undertakes or whether a person is rotated inequitably over weekends? I ask the Minister to clarify in section 5(1) what section 179 of the 1954 Act excludes.</P>
    <P>In summary, I believe the Bill is overdue. I hope it will be brought into force as soon as possible. I welcome the Minister bringing the Bill to the House so quickly after his appointment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed. I thank them in particular for their kind remarks of congratulation on my appointment.</P>
    <P>Each aspect of the Bill has been agreed with both representative organisations. PDFORRA and RACO have been widely consulted on almost each line of the Bill, which reflects the agreement these representative bodies made with the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke raised the question of coercing people to go abroad. Senator Henry and a number of other Senators were also concerned about this aspect. I take Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s point that overseas missions consisted entirely of volunteers prior to 1993. Since 1993, there has been an element of selection, which is being done with the agreement of PDFORRA. For example, if a mission is chosen to go abroad and needs certain specialist staff to operate effectively and those staff are not among the volunteers, by definition there must be an element of selection. Having said that, the Irish troops currently deployed overseas are overwhelmingly volunteers. For example, 428 troops are currently deployed in Liberia, of whom 20 are there by way of mandatory selection.</P>
    <P>The Doyle report was referred to on a number of occasions. The unique aspect of the report in this context is that the Army has admitted bullying is a problem. People will be aware that the initial Doyle report, which purportedly revealed all of this, was published in 2002. To the best of my knowledge, the ombudsman Bill had been published at that stage. Senators will also be aware that on 24 September Eileen Doyle reported on the progress made in the last two years on implementing the original recommendations, which has been considerable. As a result of the press conference held by Dr. Doyle on 24 September, it was further agreed that there were a number of other things to do and that the Department of Defence, the representative organisations and so on would get on with the job of implementing the reforms to combat harass<Col N="194"/>ment and bullying in the Army, and there would be a further progress report in 2007. It was envisaged that all this would be put in place by 2007 at the latest.</P>
    <P>The delay in progressing the Bill was referred to. As I already said, each line and paragraph in the Bill has been agreed with the representative organisations. This entailed the widest consultations, which took time. The latest commitment given to PDFORRA was that the Bill would be implemented by October 2004. We are now in the early stages of October and I am confident that promise will be delivered on.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to alleged Government control over the ombudsman and the terms of his appointment, etc., compared to the Ombudsman for Children Act. In regard to the terms of appointment, the Bill is an enabling one. It provides for an ombudsman to be appointed for an initial fixed term of seven years. A person can be re-appointed for one subsequent term only. This was drafted to allow some considerable flexibility from the point of view of potential appointees. The Bill transfers the fixing of the terms of the initial appointment into secondary regulations, subject to the criteria that the initial term cannot exceed seven years. The actual term will be laid out in regulations but, under the legislation, these regulations cannot provide for an initial term of more than seven years. There is provision in the general legislation for a second and possibly further terms, with the duration of any subsequent term of appointment to be made by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the lack of powers of the ombudsman and felt the ombudsman would be a lesser creature than his or her counterpart in Canada who can take complaints from a much wider range of complainants. The ombudsman for whom we are providing can take complaints from all serving members of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces, including cadets who are enlisted personnel. Former members of the Defence Forces will be able to make complaints subject to other criteria in the Bill. This has been agreed with PDFORRA and it has been widely welcomed by the reserve representative association, which is what the people for whom we are legislating wanted. There is one substantial change. Under the system being replaced, there was no retrospection in regard to the Minister. For one&rsquo;s complaint to be entertained, a person had to be serving at the time the circumstances giving rise to the complaint arose. There will now be an element of retrospection.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara broadly welcomed the Bill and said she would table amendments, which I will deal with in a constructive manner. Senator Minihan said that the military atmosphere is different from a civilian-type atmosphere and what might be considered bullying in a civilian sphere might not necessarily constitute bullying in the military sphere. I am very conscious of this aspect, which is why a small number of matters have been excluded from the ambit of the ombudsman and kept within the ambit of the Minister. I was urged by the Senator to consider the closure of barracks in the context of Army re-<Col N="195"/>organisation and I will do so. The Senator asked from whom Irish soldiers serving overseas seek redress if alleged bullying or harassment occurs while they are overseas. Overseas service falls into the category of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, which means their recourse is to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senators Minihan, Burke and others were anxious that the proceeds of the sale of lands, etc., by the Department of Defence should not affect the ordinary Estimate for the Department. In other words, we should fight for our Estimate year on year and anything extra from the sale of property should be put back into the Defence Forces to provide extra equipment and repair barracks infrastructure, etc. This is precisely how we are operating. For example, this year, prior to my coming to the Department, my predecessor and former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, agreed this year&rsquo;s Estimate. This represents an increase on what was provided for in the budget for the Department last year. This has been done without any knowledge of the amount of money coming in during 2005 from the sale of property, etc. This is how I intend to deal with the matter. I have no intention of allowing once-off windfalls from property sales to substitute for normal provision through the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke raised the question of the 12-year contract, which is in place for people coming into the Army since 1994. This was done with the agreement of PDFORRA. The initial proposal was for a five-year period but this was subsequently extended to 12 after negotiations. I shall be attending the PDFORRA annual conference in Letterkenny tomorrow where I will undoubtedly hear all about this and will listen to what PDFORRA members have to say.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh referred to Sarsfield&rsquo;s Rock, which is close to my heart and is on the edge of my constituency, and I take account of what he said with regard to it. Senator Maurice Hayes is correct that a member of the public who has a difficulty or suffers alleged bullying or harassment from a member of the Defence Forces, whether acting in aid of the civil power or whatever, has no recourse to the ombudsman. Only members of the Defence Forces can take complaints to the military ombudsman. Such members of the public may possibly have recourse to the State Ombudsman. They shall certainly have recourse to civil law and possibly even criminal law if the complaint falls into that category.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes raised an important question about the section of the 1954 Act dealing with service under the aegis of the United Nations. This raises much broader policy issues. The Government has consistently stood over Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in peacekeeping abroad in United Nations sanctioned operations, the Petersberg Tasks, and so on, on the basis that there is a triple lock in operation in such matters. The Government must agree to participate, that decision must be ratified by the D&aacute;il and the operation is only undertaken under the aegis of the United Nations and with its sanction. I understand that the situation in Macedonia was that <Col N="196"/>China vetoed the operation at the United Nations and so it was not a United Nations sanctioned operation. If the Government had changed the legislation to allow our Defence Forces to participate in that operation, it is unlikely they would have done so in any case because of the lack of a United Nations sanction.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, this legislation has already been considerably improved in the D&aacute;il. Senator Lydon asked what is meant by a military operation. Alleged bullying or harassment or other complaints which a member of the Defence Forces can make which happen during what is defined as a military operation will not go the ombudsman. Such complaints will remain within the remit of the Minister for Defence. As a result of representations from PDFORRA, the Opposition parties in the D&aacute;il and others, the term <?oasys [ch?>&ldquo;military operation&rdquo; has been given a very precise definition, as set out in the Bill. To paraphrase, it is defined as any operation in the field. If one considers the new definition introduced as a result of the D&aacute;il debate, it is clear the Government has made every effort to ensure that the remit of the ombudsman is as wide as possible and the exclusions are as narrow as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon also asked about the other matters that are excluded under section 5. A complainant who has already initiated legal action, for example, cannot present his or her case to the ombudsman but must continue to pursue it through the courts. Another exemption applies to cases where the reconciliation and arbitration process is the more appropriate course of action.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their kind remarks and constructive suggestions and for the spirit in which the debate has been conducted. I look forward to Committee Stage, which I understand will take place next Tuesday, 12 October. I will constructively consider any genuine amendments which would improve the Bill, which we are putting in place at the behest of members of the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>I have raised this issue on the Adjournment before and wish to know what advances have been made since the last occasion. The probation and welfare service, of which I am very supportive, is committed to locating a facility in Blanchardstown. I welcome this step in so far as it is always the best policy to bring services closer to people. However, there are concerns <Col N="197"/>about where the facility is to be located. The probation and welfare service has bought a building previously used by the AIB on Main Street, Blanchardstown, which is adjacent to a residential estate. The residents of that estate and some elderly people living in houses beside the old bank have significant concerns regarding the location of the facility.</P>
    <P>Following a number of public meetings some months ago with all the public representatives, it was agreed by Government public representatives that other more suitable locations in the vicinity would be considered. For example, many social services are already provided in the town centre, where some vacant offices were identified and about which the Minister was notified. I expect at this stage that a full evaluation has been made of alternative sites in the town centre where all the services are provided and which is well served by public transport. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, has identified a more suitable premises in the vicinity of Blanchardstown centre, which would allow the old AIB bank to be sold, most likely at a substantial profit and with no loss to the taxpayer. I hope the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, have taken note of the concerns expressed by local people and that the right action will be taken. Blanchardstown village has been downgraded over the past number of years since the town centre was built. I am concerned that social services will only be available on the main street of the village, which does not provide any business life. The concerns expressed by residents are real concerns and the appropriate location is the town centre.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Terry for the opportunity to respond on this issue and I welcome her supportive comments regarding the localisation of the offices of the probation and welfare service, which is a nationwide move by the Department.</P>
    <P>The mission statement of the probation and welfare service is to foster public safety and promote the common good by reducing the level of re-offending. This is achieved through the management of offenders on supervision orders from the courts in their local and/or immediate surrounding areas. The service aims to reduce victimisation of members of local communities by developing positive relationships with offenders in order to reduce and/or eliminate offending. Local service delivery enhances the chances of co-operation from offenders and facilitates contact between service staff, the families of the offenders and the staff of health boards and other agencies which are locally based.</P>
    <P>Currently, the only District Court team working from the probation and welfare service headquarters in Smithfield is the team that covers Dublin 7 and Dublin 15. The location of the team in Smithfield can place considerable financial expense and travel time on both the client and service staff in keeping appointments. All other Dublin District Court teams have been localised. <Col N="198"/>I am pleased they have been successful in localising the offices in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Finglas, Crumlin and Clondalkin. No complaint has been received to date from any member of the public, nor has any complaint been brought to the attention of any officer of the service by garda&iacute; about the behaviour of those attending a local office.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Premises at Main Street, Blanchardstown, were acquired by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the probation and welfare service on 15 April 2002. The total purchase cost was &euro;1.5 million. Provision of a probation centre fulfils one of the commitments agreed under the national development plan. Contrary to what Senator Terry said, the development is taking place after much discussion with groups in the local community. Officers of the service have met with the local authority, the local chamber of commerce and residents to share with them the proposed plans. The Office of Public Works has met with local neighbours and has taken on board their views in regard to the development. The architect has also taken considerable time to provide a building that is in harmony with the surroundings and that brings minimum change to the street vista. The fit-out will be to the highest standards.</P><?oasys [cl10.5]?>
    <P>Before proceeding with the refurbishment project in Main Street, Blanchardstown, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has requested the Office of Public Works to identify, if possible, a more suitable alternative in the Blanchardstown area. Towards this end, the OPW has viewed a number of alternative premises and sites. However, none of those viewed to date has been deemed more suitable by the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform accepts there is considerable urgency attaching to the development of a probation and welfare service centre in the Blanchardstown area. The service will try to provide that centre as quickly as possible.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Last week passengers who took a train from Sligo to Dublin had no food, no refreshments, no heating and poor lighting. They could have been travelling back in time rather than to the capital city. The locomotives and rolling stock on the Sligo-Dublin line are up to 40 years old.</P>
    <P>There is a clear division in this country. The Government is happy to spend &euro;800 million on two Luas lines, some &euro;200 million more than estimated, yet it could not care less when it comes to providing new rolling stock for existing rail lines such as the line to the north west to Sligo, Westport and Ballina. Meanwhile, I wonder what has happened to cause Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to invest in new stock for the Limerick to Waterford line. I have no doubt this was arranged to cover up for the embarrassing accident on the line last year? Does that mean we need to have a serious acci<Col N="199"/>dent on the lines to the west of Ireland? When will we get rolling stock?</P>
    <P>What happened to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to invest in infrastructure in the north west and west of Ireland? The BMW region is supposed to have Objective One status, yet investment in that part of the country has fallen way behind levels in the southern and eastern regions. This Government is happy to leave people in the dark when it comes to taking a train to the west. I have raised this issue on numerous occasions in this House. The people of the west deserve the same facilities as other parts of the country. We must act soon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to address the Seanad on this issue. Strictly speaking, the issue raised is a day to day matter for Irish Rail. Senator Feighan mentioned the food. I was stuck on a train in a similar situation not long ago and I understand it had nothing to do with Government or Irish Rail but that the person who was due to supply the food rang in sick. The Government is blamed for everything.</P>
    <P>I have good news about Government policy and some of the fundamental questions asked by the Senator regarding investment in rail services. The progress made by Irish Rail in recent years and the plans it has for the development of its network in the coming years are good news. We all understand that rail services have suffered from under-investment over a long period, resulting in a deterioration of the levels of services provided. However, the national development plan has changed that. In the period 1998 to 2003, almost &euro;1 billion has been expended by the Exchequer on the upgrade and development of our railways. Thanks to the commitment made by the Minister for Finance in his 2003 budget, this level of investment will continue, at least in the medium term.</P><?oasys [dc14]?>
    <P>Some of the outputs of this investment in the past few years are that by the end of this year, all track on the radial routes serving the regions will have been renewed. Sligo and Westport were completed in 2003 and have, therefore, not been forgotten. By the end of 2007, all signalling equipment, some dating back many decades, will have been replaced by new state-of-the-art computer controlled signalling equipment. Signalling on the Sligo line has also been completed and work on the Westport and Ballina lines will begin in the coming months. Between 2000 and the end of 2007, more than 380 new railway passenger vehicles will have been placed into service on Irish Rail&rsquo;s network. In other words Irish Rail&rsquo;s entire passenger carrying fleet will be new or, in the case of the original DART fleet, completely refurbished to the highest international standards.</P><?oasys [dc0]?>
    <P>The effort that has been put into this massive task by Irish Rail has not been fully recognised. It has gone from being a very under-resourced public transport provider to a highly competent service operator that has proved itself capable of <Col N="200"/>designing and delivering projects to the highest international standards, on time and within budget. This should be a source of great pride to it. I acknowledge the work of all involved in this achievement to date.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the particular rail services referred to by the Senator. Currently Irish Rail uses a combination of diesel rail cars and Mark II locomotive hauled carriages on the railway lines serving Sligo, Westport, Ballina and Galway. The company has on order a new fleet of 67 intercity carriages. These carriages are being built by CAF in Spain and are due to enter into service in December 2005 on services from Dublin to Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The arrival of these carriages will allow the company, in the short term, to cascade the railway carriages currently used on the Dublin-Cork line onto the services to Sligo, Westport, Ballina and Galway lines. However, this cascading of rolling stock, which is a common feature of railway operations throughout the world, is a short-term measure. In order to offer its customers a top-class service on all its routes, Irish Rail has indicated to the Department that it wishes to further enhance its fleet by purchasing high specification interregional railcars. The Department is awaiting a formal proposal from Irish Rail in this regard. The proposal will also allow for the removal from regular service of much of the older rolling stock in the company&rsquo;s fleet. The new railcars will be used on all routes other than the Dublin-Belfast, Cork and Limerick routes.</P>
    <P>Irish Rail&rsquo;s overall policy is to increase the frequency of departures on all routes and to reduce journey times between the main cities and towns. When the examination of the proposal for the railcars is complete, the Minister for Transport hopes to be in a position to announce further details of the implications of the introduction of these railcars on services to Sligo and Westport.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new vehicles will be the last step in an almost complete overhaul of rail infrastructure in this country. I am confident that Irish Rail&rsquo;s customers will begin to see significant improvements in the standards and frequency of all of Irish Rail&rsquo;s services, whether commuting around Dublin, Cork and Limerick or travelling at speed and in comfort to our regional cities. For the first time customers will have a real choice of more frequent services and be in a position to book individual seats.</P>
    <P>Significant capacity increases will be delivered on all routes and the level of comfort, speed, safety and reliability will be vastly improved. Access to and from the regions will as a result be far easier and offer a real choice over the private car.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator again for raising this important issue. I hope I have convinced him somewhat of the significant progress that has been made. Hopefully he will spread the word on the good the Government is doing.</P>
