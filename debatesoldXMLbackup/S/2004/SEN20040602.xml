	<P>I have received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the proposals to transfer the assets of Shannon Development to the new Shannon Airport authority are not proceeded with, in view of the serious economic damage which would be done to the region should this happen.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate when a decision will be made on the band designation for the Presentation College, Carlow, which is currently at stage five in the schools building programme.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, and No. 25, motion No. 20. In addition, an earlier signature motion in respect of the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2004 will be taken at a convenient point, if the Bill is passed by the D&aacute;il. No. 1 is a report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges recommending changes in the Standing Orders relative to procedure in the case of a resolution calling for the removal of a judge for stated misbehaviour or incapacity &mdash; the report has been circulated to Members and this item is to be taken without debate; Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, are motions referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, which has completed its deliberations, to be taken without debate; No. 6 is a motion calling for the <Col N="1450"/>removal of a judge for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 25, motion No. 20; No. 7 is the Health (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Report and Final Stages to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 12.15 p.m.; No. 8 is the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken at 12.15 p.m. and to conclude no later than 1.30 p.m.; and No. 9 is statements on the report on Seanad reform, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. until 5 p.m., with contributions from Members of 15 minutes each. Notwithstanding anything in Standing Order 43, No. 25, motion 20, is to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the avoidance of doubt, I wish to inform the House that I have given permission under Standing Order 25 for the moving of Nos. 1 and 6 on short notice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We agree with the Order of Business as proposed by the Leader and to the taking of these important matters in the course of the day.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Leader might find out from the Taoiseach why, on a recent visit to Colombia, he chose to meet the President of that country specifically to deal with one issue, namely, the three people convicted of travelling on false passports. I would have thought it quite unusual, where someone has been convicted of a rather serious charge in that he has conveniently decided to travel on an illegal and false passport, clearly having shown no fidelity to this State, that the Taoiseach should take up the matter as President of the European Union with the President of Colombia. That is quite strange.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments of Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley of the Progressive Democrats at the weekend concerning the matter. It is clearly serious if people choose to travel on illegal passports and show no sense of loyalty to their own country in so doing. Given the background of those people, with their connections with the IRA, it is most strange and absurd that the Taoiseach should choose to meet the President of Colombia on the issue. I would appreciate some clarity on this point in the course of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments in coming days.</P>
    <P>We have all been struck by the recent revelations in the Irish banking sector. I am aware of comments made in this and the other House over the last few weeks on the matter. I make this point strongly. The greatest power rests in the hands of the Irish people if they wish to show their disgust at recent scandals in one bank. The power they have is to move their accounts. Consumers in this country have power when they show institutions and big, multinational companies that they are totally opposed to their actions. We saw that some years ago regarding Shell. Many institutions in this country have not been fleecing people, the Irish credit union <Col N="1451"/>movement being one very good example. If people are really disgusted at what they see in the Irish banking sector, they should move their accounts to other banks. We need more competition, and banks will cop on to the kind of illegal activity in which they have been engaged and the lack of moral guidance they have shown the country if they lose accounts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also agree to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Leader would take up the following matter. Problems have been experienced regarding medical practitioners giving treatment to patients that has not been to their benefit. However, something can be done regarding those people, as appeals can be made to the Medical Council on their behalf. However, if people are not medically qualified and describe themselves as health professionals, counsellors or social care workers, there is no recourse for patients who feel they have been badly treated. A health and social care professionals Bill has been promised for years. In the Government&rsquo;s spring programme of legislation, it was stated that this would be published before the end of the session. We are now in the summer session, and the programme for legislation once again states that the health and social care professionals Bill will be published before the end of the session. I have been watching this and talking about it for years, and I have been on to the Department on numerous occasions with absolutely no satisfaction. That is not the case with the other Bills which appeared in the legislative programme at the same time, such as the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 and the Health (Amendment) Bill 2004, with which we are dealing today. These will all be passed. However, this important legislation, which is not party political, appears to be getting nowhere in the Department of Health and Children. I ask the Leader to try to ensure a sense of urgency about the issue. It could easily be brought before this House because it is not party political and there are plenty of Members here who could debate it very well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the appropriate Minister to the House to discuss the issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes, namely, the three investigations into AIB. I would like to hear, in particular, what is being done by the Government to ensure a speedy conclusion of those inquiries, co-ordination between the three investigating authorities and public disclosure of the findings. It is important and in the public interest that these investigations take place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the general issue of financial institutions, the Government did not follow up on the view expressed by the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts in the DIRT inquiry that the banking system should be <Col N="1452"/>required to make financial restitution for any complicity in large scale tax evasion and fraud. I ask that the Government reconsider this view. As Senator Hayes said, it is important that the public is compensated for any such wrongdoing by financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The Government survey of 2,000 motorists, one of the largest of its type carried out in Europe, revealed that 68% of drivers tested who were in excess of the alcohol limit also tested positive as regards one or more drugs. There was a particularly high incidence of positive drug readings among young male drivers who were tested. Obviously, this has serious implications as regards fatalities on our roads. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to the House to let us know what the Government is doing to address this problem. It is not a new problem, but it is growing and could have a major bearing on road deaths if it is not addressed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>All of us are disturbed at what has been happening in some of our financial institutions. However, we need to keep matters in perspective. The point about the people who received publicity in the past week is essentially that they got caught. It is not necessarily the case that everything else is all right. I noticed an article in one of the newspapers yesterday headlined, &ldquo;Crocodile tears mask a culture of greed&rdquo;, and today, in the same newspaper, a director of corporate governance talks about the effects of very low standards in public and corporate life. We need to be aware that not all forms of corporate greed necessarily involve either legal or ethical wrongdoing as such. It is shocking that a chairman, chief executive and director of a newspaper should receive annual increases last year of 40%, 50% and 67%. If Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s people put in such claims there would, rightly, be outrage. We need a good example from the top. It is lucky that the little people have more sense.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to highlight the fact that there is now a great lack of trust in some of our financial institutions. I agree fully with Senator Mansergh and what he said. If we cannot have trust in the people who are at the top of these institutions, how can we have full confidence about what is happening to our money? Many customers feel aggrieved at what is going on and I again link that to how pensions are being dealt with for people who pay into occupational pension schemes. The same people deal with the pension industry. We need urgently to widen the investigation into how they deal with this and the connections between them and the remuneration and benefits they gain from that. Many have lost trust in that system.</P>
    <P>In our recent election canvas many of us have heard major concern expressed on the doorsteps about the level of anti-social behaviour on our streets and in our communities. We have often discussed this here but the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1453"/>Equality and Law Reform is taking no action on it. There is a lawless group of people at large in society who believe they can do whatever they wish and no action is being taken. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come here and outline for us once again what he will do to tackle the high levels of anti-social behaviour in our communities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I take a different view from Senator Brian Hayes on the representations made by the Taoiseach on behalf of the three Irish citizens held in Colombia.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew the Senator would.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I do so because it was a strange case from the outset. The prosecution brought forward some questionable witnesses. There are even suggestions that some of those will be tried for perjury. At the same time there were witnesses from the other side, including from our diplomatic service who must be taken into account where credibility is concerned. The Taoiseach did what any leader of a sovereign country would do, namely ensure the safety of citizens of the country when they are abroad. He was very balanced and made two good points, namely that a senior judge could be appointed to examine the situation, or the three men could be allowed home if a guarantee were given that they would return in the event of an appeal. That it took up to eight months to give a verdict reflects on the legal system in Colombia. On the positive side it also suggests that this case has been examined very closely. The men were acquitted of the major charge which is important. I compliment the Taoiseach on his role in this regard.</P>

	<P>A new form of imperialism.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a possibility that when a story hits the headlines, such as the scandals in the financial institutions, it distracts our attention from some other areas on which we should focus. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, yesterday brought Bono to a meeting of EU development ministers to draw attention to our responsibility for reaching the target of giving 0.7% of our gross national product for development aid. Senator Henry has raised this on many occasions. Let us make sure we keep our attention on the issue because an interesting figure was cited for several countries which had aimed at targets but did not realise that as they became wealthier the percentage would involve more money. The point was well made that as a country becomes wealthier its percentage contribution increases in value. That is a good sign because it means that a country is wealthier and is therefore able to afford it. We are falling short. We have set a <Col N="1454"/>target for 2007 but we are only half way there and we must focus our attention on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport spoke about the number of no-shows for driving tests and seemed surprised at this. If one must delay 12 months before receiving an appointment one cannot be expected to remember the appointment. The Minister is taking some steps but he could take more to ensure greater safety on our roads by not allowing so many people to drive without having passed a driving test and on provisional licences. We should take an immediate step on this because something much more urgent needs to be done than has recently been done.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed Senator Brian Hayes has not informed himself properly and in detail about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting on Friday night in Colombia. As President of the EU, the Taoiseach was hosting a meeting with Latin American leaders. He spoke to President Uriba of Colombia and put a very significant proposal to him for the safe return of the men.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise for discussion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes has not allowed me to speak, although I listened to him. The bottom line is that these men have served their time for carrying false passports and should be sent home immediately. That is the opinion of Judge Jairo Acosta. He also accused witnesses involved in the main charge against the men of committing perjury. Those witnesses were put forward by the attorney general who is now appealing the decision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a suitable matter for discussion.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an issue that concerns many people. In the past we were all extensively lobbied about St. John&rsquo;s wort, a medication sold in health shops. The Irish Medicines Board decreed that it could only be bought on prescription and, at the time, there was a furore over it. However, a person could establish a clinic in Killaloe and give out cancer therapy treatment to vulnerable people in the final stages of cancer, for which they paid &euro;10,000. Legislation must be tightened up in this area to prevent cowboy medical practitioners setting up such facilities in future to prey on vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Health and Children has expressed concern and I urge him to expedite the tightening up of legislation in this area. A shocking situation has developed. Media attention has focused on this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek to remind the Minister for Health and Children that legislation is urgently required in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the points raised by Senator Henry regarding the new professional <Col N="1456"/>health care Bill due to come before the House. Semi-professionals, who call themselves professionals, have attended courses that are not validated. These courses are mushrooming throughout the country and there is a strong case for addressing this anomaly. In many cases, people operate as counsellors and we do not know where they got their qualifications.</P>
    <P>This debate should also be widened to include education, to examine courses which produce people who are not suitably qualified to take on any role in the therapeutic area. This issue should be incorporated in the debate regarding professionals and semi-professionals operating within the health service. Such a debate is urgently required and I ask the Leader to facilitate it, as this is a significant issue that is being raised in newspapers, on radio and television. I regularly hear of this mushrooming of counsellors, as they call themselves, who appear from nowhere. We do not know what kind of course they have attended or if the course was validated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Senator Terry&rsquo;s remarks in respect of anti-social behaviour, a matter that is being raised on the doorsteps. There seems to be a great deal of law but very little order in the country at present. That is because the Government did not implement its proposal to provide 2,000 additional garda&iacute;, which has led to the situation with which we are currently faced.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader make time available for a debate on the payment of VAT by charities? These organisations cannot recoup that money when it has been paid. They pay over &euro;18 million each year to the State and cannot get it back. The cost of this for charitable organisations is enormous. Every euro the State collects is one less spent on services to help the elderly, the needy, the disabled and others in our society. The Government must display some political will in respect of this matter and deal with it swiftly. I request a debate on this issue and I hope it will take place in the near future because many people are contributing voluntarily of their time and are obliged to pay VAT etc., into the Government&rsquo;s coffers. That is grossly unfair, particularly in the post-Celtic tiger era.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments made about financial institutions. When the House discussed the naming of people who had offshore accounts, I made the point that the banking fraternity had not been mentioned in any newspaper reports. It is disappointing and disturbing to hear that members of that fraternity were involved in illegal activity. I hope we can have a debate on this matter because issues have also arisen in respect of foreign exchange transactions.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes referred to people moving their accounts. I wish that life was that simple. In many smaller towns, people do not have that option. The opposite is, in fact, the case <Col N="1457"/>because banks are withdrawing their services and closing branches in many towns throughout the country. There is a serious election issue in Carraroe at present because people do not have access to a banking service. We should call on the banks to ensure the policy of closing branches does not continue. While, as Senator Brian Hayes stated, the credit unions have a role in this area, An Post also has a role to play in respect of banking. Banks are withdrawing from our smaller towns and I do not want to see that process continuing. We should have a debate on the issue as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader indicate whether the Minister for Education and Science will be coming before the House before the recess? Reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers indicate there is going to be a change in the variety of assessments used at leaving certificate level and that the NCCA proposes to abolish the transition year and the LCVP. Among the new assessment methods listed by the NCCA are written, oral, aural, portfolio, etc. I do not know what other methods are being proposed as the new way forward. The Minister has wasted &euro;648,000, of which &euro;44,000 was given to guest chairpersons, to promote himself at 17 meetings throughout the country. How can we have any confidence in him?</P>

	<P>I support those who called for a debate on the financial services industry. I am conscious that previously we needed to regulate aspects such as redemption fees &mdash; in some cases couples who wanted to pay off a loan early were charged a six months&rsquo; redemption fee &mdash; or the need to introduce an APR because the industry was hiding costs such as monthly or annual interest repayment charges which were costing the consumer more but were not presented as doing so.</P>
    <P>We need this debate in light of current events, including the foreign exchange difficulties, the mis-selling of life policies to cover mortgages and the selling of non-resident accounts, for which the banks have a huge responsibility. They must shoulder the blame because those accounts were actively sold. Rather than people coming into the bank to look for them, the banks asked them if they would like to open a non-resident account. This must be examined in the context of the people who are now doing so well in the banking industry and earning such large sums. I do not begrudge them a cent of what they earn but they get large salaries, bonuses and preferential rates on loans-&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>On a number of occasions over the past 12 months I have raised the matter of our failure to take any meaningful measures to promote the local elections and to encourage people to vote. Our local elections are only a week away. However, the Minister has compounded the problem by deciding that polling stations should close at 9 p.m. on voting day, Friday, 11 June. This is inexcusable in the middle of summer.</P>

	<P>Polling stations have closed previously at 10 p.m. This is a poor signal from the Government. Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to reconsider allowing the stations to close at 10 p.m. Workers and students returning home should be allowed the extra hour for voting. If we are serious about promoting <Col N="1459"/>democracy, we should take the simple straightforward measure of extending the opening hours of polling stations.</P>

	<P>I support the remarks made by Senator Finucane on the clinic in Killaloe. I was contacted recently by the widow of one of those who died, who related some disturbing facts to me. Whoever said that there are people in jail for less, there is no doubt about it being true in the case of these two doctors who, although they have been struck off the medical register, were practising alternative medicine. There is a legislative void here which must be filled as a matter of urgency. I appeal to the Leader to urge the Minister to come to the House as soon as possible to inform us of when he will introduce the appropriate legislation. This is a terrible situation and I will have much more to say when we have a debate on the matter.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Western Health Board made a decision yesterday to defer the opening of an orthopaedic unit for Mayo General Hospital. This unit has cost more than &euro;10 million, interviews were held for over 70 jobs, advertisements were placed and professional people promised jobs have moved to Castlebar in anticipation of the opening of the unit in July.</P>
    <P>The current position is that a patient who enters Mayo General Hospital for orthopaedic attention is put on a waiting list, supposedly for Galway. However, the patient is never called. This is a scandal. It is outrageous that people are told they are being put on a waiting list but, at the same time, they are never called for orthopaedic attention.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the Leader to call on the Minister for Health and Children to intervene in this case and to ensure the orthopaedic unit for Mayo General Hospital opens as scheduled this July. A considerable amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent on this project.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Minister with responsibility for energy come into the House to debate possible energy alternatives to oil. We realise how vulnerable is the world economy when problems occur in Saudi Arabia and oil prices increase. I am particularly mindful of people involved in the transport sector who have been hard hit of late. Such price increases coupled with the changes in the benefit-in-kind provisions in the last budget will force many of them out of business. Further increases are predicted in petrol and diesel prices.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report, as outlined by Senator Tuffy, on drug-taking and driving. Its findings help to explain why there are many road traffic fatalities at weekends involving young males who <Col N="1460"/>have not been drinking. In that context, there could well be a link between drug-taking and driving. We should explore this matter. I am aware the EU is collating data from all EU member states on this matter this month and that some member states are engaged in positive work in this area. We should invite the Minister for Transport to the House to debate this matter.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in calling for a debate on the financial services sector. The morale among the thousands of staff in the banking sector is at an all time low. We should at least highlight the effect these revelations are having on the staff.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago the Leader complimented me on praising the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the way he handled the May Day celebrations. On this occasion, I ask her to arrange for the Minister to come to the House to ask him why he intends to close rural Garda stations. With the escalating drugs crisis and the failure of the Government to recruit the additional 2,000 garda&iacute; promised, it is high time the Minister felt some heat from Senators regarding this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, asked for an explanation of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with the President of Colombia regarding the Colombian three and the circumstances in which it was held. I understand he met him in his capacity as President of the EU when he visited Mexico.</P>
    <P>The Senator went on to talk about the banking sector and suggested, as is usual in consumer matters, that customers should move their business. However, Senator Kitt raised the point that if one lives in rural Ireland, it is not easy to move one&rsquo;s business. It is easy to move one&rsquo;s business if one is a depositor, but far more difficult to do so if one is a borrower. I accept there is a need for a debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked when a Bill to deal with health and social care professionals will be introduced, given that it is on the legislative agenda for introduction this term. I will make inquiries as the need for the Bill has become urgent. It appears matters must become urgent before we deal with them.</P><?oasys [cl10.5]?>
    <P>Senator Tuffy called for the three investigations into AIB to be debated here and <Col N="1461"/>for the banks which escaped retribution to be made pay. She also raised the matter of the survey of 2,000 motorists, in respect of many of whom there was evidence of drug-taking, and the likelihood that such drug abuse can result in accidents.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh spoke about the financial institutions and corporate governance. What I find dismaying about all of this is that it is never the ordinary man or woman behind the counter, with whom we deal when we go about our business, who is found to have done anything wrong. It appears to me that such wrongdoing is always found at the highest levels and not among the lower ranks. Officials in the lower ranks work behind the counter and are visible when people go to banks to do their business. Every time something untoward and strongly dubious emerges, we are told &ldquo;that is the end of it now, there will be no more&rdquo;. Those involved say they will clean up, wash up and make everybody pure. It does not happen like that, however, as another wave of revelations is always on its way. It is important that we acknowledge that such problems do not start at the lower level of banking activity &mdash; they are found at a much higher level of governance.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Taoiseach for his clear remarks in the D&aacute;il yesterday about the idea that we should not talk about this matter because Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation for probity will somehow be affected and people will be alarmed. Ireland is well able to handle itself. The idea that we should not talk about the matter is erroneous. Only if we speak out to show our dismay and disgust at what has happened will we have some hope of remedying the problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry agreed with Senator Mansergh about the banking issue. She also referred to the pension schemes, about which we will have a debate. She spoke about law and order. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot go to every part of Ireland with a bata m&oacute;r to introduce law and order. The very good public order Acts should be implemented.</P>

	<P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; expressed a different view about the Colombia three and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s behaviour in respect of that issue. The Taoiseach proposed a decent plan which, if implemented, would provide a way out of the impasse.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about development aid. He made the useful point that as our GDP <Col N="1462"/>increases, so does the amount of aid we have to provide to meet the 0.7% target. He also referred to the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s comments about those who do not show up for driving tests.</P>
    <P>Senator White expressed her disappointment at the comments of Senator Brian Hayes.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of St John&rsquo;s wort, about which there was a huge furore when it was decided that it would only be available on prescription. It developed into a big campaign. Legislation is needed to deal with the cowboys who are operating in the pseudo-medical system. He also referred to an episode in Killaloe.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde spoke about semi-professional people who are posing as professionals and adopting titles they have not gained through study, training or the acquisition of degrees. The number of counsellors is mushrooming, as the Senator said. She also spoke about alternative health. There is a clear case for alternative therapies, which are recognised if practised correctly. We should be concerned about the incorrect practice of alternative therapy. Senator Glynn spoke about the legislative void in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon spoke about law and order and the payment of VAT by charities.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt said that the recent events in financial institutions are &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo;. He mentioned that many banks have withdrawn from small towns. I recall attending many public meetings on the matter, in Kilbeggan and other areas. When we forced the pace, the banks said they would retain limited services on certain days. There is an arrogance in the banks&rsquo; lack of a public service ethic. They do not consider that they have a duty to serve their customers. The Cathaoirleach will recall that if one went to see one&rsquo;s bank manager many years ago, one did so in trepidation. One wondered what he might say, but now he wonders what one might say to him. It is a useful reversal.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke asked whether the Minister for Education and Science will be coming to the House to discuss the NCCA. I have heard about the alternative methods of assessment, which the Senator favours. I established the NCCA, which is a great body. It sometimes has wild  notions and pushes out the frontiers so that perhaps lesser measures are accepted. It is proper in that it leads us to think about educational issues. However, there is no way out of examinations because they are the best test of people and how they perform. Senator Ulick Burke also asked about the meetings, 15 out of 17 of which I understand the <Col N="1463"/>Minister for Education and Science attended at which he sat at the back rather than disport himself at the top table. I was not present at any of the meetings but a friend was and told me he came in quietly and sat at the back. The CSO figures indicate a rising number of primary school teachers in the system, which is good news.</P><?oasys [cl11]?>
    <P>Senator Hanafin requested a debate on the financial institutions and spoke about greed. I agree with Senator Bradford that polling stations should be open until 10 p.m. If one leaves Dublin at 7 p.m., one will not reach Athlone by 9 p.m. The fact that polling stations are open at 7 a.m. is of no use if one works in Dublin and must get back down the country by 9 p.m. The issue was raised with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting but the times had already been set. I acknowledge that returning officers and staff will be at their stations for 14 hours but they are well fed and watered during the course of the day. An extension of the polling time to 10 p.m. would mean that people travelling home from Dublin at 7 p.m. would be able to cast their vote.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn referred to the legislative void, which is an exact description, in regard to alternative medicine. Alternative medicine will have to be made subject to regulation, notwithstanding the fact that much of it is good. Senator Paddy Burke asked about the Western Health Board. I find it odd that Senators take the trouble to raise a matter and I take the trouble to listen and answer but some Senators have vanished by the time I do so. It is rude. I am not referring just to Senator Paddy Burke, but also to Senators on this side of the House.</P>

Senator Browne raised the importance of finding an alternative to oil as a fuel source given its rising cost &mdash; I wish there was one. He also requested that the Minister for Transport or another responsible Minister come before the House to discuss the effects of drugs in terms of accidents which are occurring in the early hours of the morning. Senator Feighan raised the issue of the financial services sector and also called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a long debate about this at the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights when maternity protection legislation was being discussed. I pointed out a difficulty, namely, that if somebody on additional maternity leave went out sick, it would mean, in accordance with the recommendations of the committee&rsquo;s working group, that provision would have to be made that the maternity leave should terminate. It would mean the person would lose the balance of her maternity leave that was not taken. The reason is that European case law provides that if someone is on leave due to pregnancy, she cannot be sacked until such time as that term has expired. If someone who is on additional maternity leave goes out sick, she can stay out of work indefinitely. She can literally stay out of work, sick, for the rest of her life. As part of the maternity leave has still to be taken, technically, she can still be on maternity leave and so can never be sacked.</P>
    <P>That does not apply as regards adoptive leave, but I have two difficulties with the amendment. The first is that our objective is to make the adoptive leave legislation mirror the maternity protection legislation. If we were to accept the amendment, there would be a significant difference. Second, the report produced by the working group was &ldquo;arrangement by consensus&rdquo;, with give and take on both sides. It arrived at a delicate balance. To suggest an amendment along those lines, even as regards adoptive leave, <Col N="1468"/>would, in my view, upset the balance. I will now give the Senator the official response.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is inconsistent with the recommendation of the maternity review group, which this section of the Bill seeks to apply to adoptive leave, in that it removes subsection (4)(<i>b</i>), which requires untaken leave to be forfeited. The review group recommended that:</P>
    <P LI="1">In the event of illness, an employee should, subject to the agreement of the employer, be able to transfer from additional maternity leave to sick leave. If an employee transfers from additional maternity leave to sick leave, she will forfeit her right to any additional maternity leave not taken at the date of commencement of the sick leave.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That is taken directly from the working group&rsquo;s report. As Senator Tuffy will be aware, the purpose of the Adoptive Leave Bill is to apply the appropriate outstanding agreed recommendations of the maternity working group to adoptive leave. The social partners agreed to a consultation process and it was formally stated in section 12.2 of the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. It states clearly and unequivocally that the Bill would provide for &ldquo;termination of additional adoptive leave in the event of illness subject to the agreement of the employer&rdquo;. To move from this would be a significant departure from the package of compromises agreed.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 8 of the Bill as regards termination of additional adoptive leave on the sickness of the adopting parent is consistent with the provision of section 6 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003, which implements the recommendation of the maternity working group as regards this matter. The basic principle on which this section of the Bill is constructed is to provide an employee with the option, if the employer agrees, to terminate unpaid additional adoptive leave in the event of her illness and to benefit from payment in respect of sick leave, depending, obviously, on the sick leave arrangements available under her contract of employment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 8, line 48, after &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or such other date as may be agreed between the employer and the employee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to remove unnecessary rigidity in the Bill which requires that where adoptive leave is postponed following the hospitalisation of a child, it must be taken as a continuous period beginning not later than seven days after the child is discharged from hospital. We feel that, in a spirit of partnership, our amendment would allow the parties to be free to negotiate a different date and we ask the Minister of State to accept it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, the difficulty with this amendment is that the maternity working group wanted a situation where the leave would end immediately after the child came out of hospital. In order to provide some flexibility, we managed to get in a period of seven days. However, I believe it would be undesirable to extend it. We have moved from the original position recommended by the working group. To make it longer along the lines suggested in the amendment would leave the question of the additional leave hanging indefinitely. I will give the Senator the official response.</P>
    <P>Subsection 9(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Bill provides that the postponed leave must be taken as a continuous period, beginning not later than seven days after the child is discharged from hospital. This is identical to the provision contained in subsection 7(4)(<i>c</i>) of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003. The maternity working group recommended that provision should be made for the postponement of maternity leave in the event of the hospitalisation of the child, subject to the agreement of the employer. It also recommended that postponed leave should be taken in one continuous block when the baby is discharged from hospital. Section 9 applies this recommendation to adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>The working group intended that the leave should only be postponed for the duration of the child&rsquo;s stay in hospital and that the employee would retain her entitlement to take the balance of the leave once the child was discharged. It follows that the employee should resume her leave as soon as possible after the date of discharge. Subsection (9)(2)(<i>d</i>), which provides that this leave shall commence within seven days of the child&rsquo;s discharge from hospital, meets this requirement. Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s amendment strays beyond the agreed recommendation of the working group, which appears to meet the needs of an adopting mother who would, in all likelihood, wish to take the postponed leave immediately on discharge of the child from hospital.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 12, to delete lines 27 and 28 and substitute &ldquo;accordance with that section.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We tabled this amendment because there appears to be a strange anomaly in the section which prohibits dismissal of an employee on adoptive leave in circumstances where the purported notice of dismissal expires after the employee&rsquo;s absence. However, it does not expressly deal with the situation where the notice of dismissal expires during the employee&rsquo;s absence. We feel that this ambiguity could best be taken care of by deleting the condition that the notice has to expire after the absence. I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Frankly, I did not understand the thinking behind the amendment although the Senator has now explained it. I believe the situation she is worried about is addressed. I will give her the official response and we may discuss it further if she wishes.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this section of the Act is to make the employee&rsquo;s job secure while absent from work on adoptive or additional leave. This section of the Bill broadens the existing provisions of section 16 of the principal Act by adding &ldquo;absences while attending any required pre-placement classes or meetings&rdquo;. The new section invalidates certain actions of the employer where they are done by him or her during an employee&rsquo;s absence on adoptive leave, additional leave or absence from work to attend any required pre-placement classes or meetings. These actions are terminating an employee&rsquo;s employment during the absence or giving notice during the absence of termination of an employee&rsquo;s employment, which notice would expire subsequent to the absence.</P>
    <P>Subsections 16(<i>a</i>) and 16(<i>b</i>) prevent two different actions by the employer. Subsection 16(<i>a</i>) prohibits termination during protective <Col N="1471"/>leave while subsection 16(<i>b</i>) prohibits a notice of termination being given during protective leave, which becomes effective once the employee returns to work, after protective leave. In other words, if the situation to which Senator Tuffy refers had occurred and the notice expired while the employee was still on leave, that would be covered by section 16(<i>a</i>) because the employer would effectively terminate the employment during the adoptive leave.</P>

    <P FLI="0">These are drafting amendments. Amendment No. 12 deals with the point that the wording of the section does not make sense.

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment encapsulates all that I said on Second and Committee Stages. If we are dealing with equality, to which this amendment refers, we should offer and provide full equality to adoptive and natural parents. I requested that we provide leave for adoptive parents, or potential adoptive parents, prior to the placement of the baby. I tabled amendments which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, did not accept. I concede that probably they were too wide. I will submit more amendments on Report Stage, which I hope will be acceptable, to the effect that we grant equality and recognise that many adoptive parents must travel abroad to visit the place where the child is staying or the people who deal with the adoptions in those countries. Their trips should be recognised in some way.</P>
    <P>Babies are born to families in different ways. The easy route is when someone expects and then delivers a baby, and there has been an expectation of and preparation for that event. It is probably much more difficult for adoptive parents to go through that process because their hopes are built up but often dashed too. We should recognise that they must go through a very <Col N="1473"/>long process prior to placement of the baby which should be recognised. That must be addressed in the context of equality.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if he could provide us with the figures for the number of foreign adoptions. While his officials gave us the annual number of adoptions in recent years, they could not provide figures for the number of foreign adoptions. I expect that number to show that many adoptions are dealt with abroad, which will highlight the need to provide time off for parents who must travel to initiate and complete the adoption process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This point was discussed in some depth the last time we debated the Bill. Senator Terry and Senator McDowell advocated some of the amendments proposed. I note Senator Terry&rsquo;s acknowledgement that the phraseology of the amendments was too wide and, therefore, they needed to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to equality between adoptive and natural parents but what is being sought would exceed any equality with natural parents. The prenatal leave for natural parents is given on health grounds and is a prudent measure in the late stages of pregnancy. The postnatal leave is to enable the mother to bond with the newborn and adoptive parents are granted an equal period. To give prior leave to adoptive parents does not seem to be the route on which we should embark.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell made an interesting point on this to which I was more sympathetic than to Senator Terry&rsquo;s point, namely, that in many instances the travel abroad involves significant expense. Many who travel are able to fund that from their own resources so it is not an imposition and they are happy to do it. However, people with limited financial resources would find it more difficult to adopt because of the cost involved. Given the increased propensity and need for people to go abroad to adopt, there may be an argument for providing means tested assistance in the social welfare structure for those who cannot fund the trips from their own resources. That would be better than imposing further on employers. Granting leave is not really the issue. The main obstacle for those people in the categories I mention, and to which Senator McDowell referred, is financial. That point is well made and perhaps the Government would consider it in a different framework.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I take Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s point in regard to amendment No. 15. The main objective of the legislation is to amend the Adoptive Leave Act. It has to amend the 1995 Act in any event. However, in the Long Title to a Bill we must describe accurately everything the Bill does, in so far as we can. The Bill before us amends the Unfair Dismissals Act and also the redundancy payments legislation. Therefore, it is necessary to include the term &ldquo;and to provide for connected matters&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1474"/>
    <P>I listened to what Senator Terry proposed and, unfortunately, the advice I received is that whatever about the rights and wrongs of the argument, and I can see the force of it, it would not be appropriate to include in the Long Title a reference to natural parents because the Bill makes no provision whatever for natural parents; it deals exclusively with adoptive parents. As Senator Walsh said, perhaps some other vehicle can address this matter. Senator Terry indicated she would bring forward amendments on Report Stage and we will have a look at them.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry also asked for the figures for foreign adoptions. In 2001, of a total of 472 adoptions, 179 were foreign. In 2002, of 602 adoptions, 336 were foreign. The provisional figures for 2003 indicate that, of 604 adoptions, 341 were foreign. I apologise that these figures were not made available sooner.</P>

   <Title>Report on Seanad Reform: Statements.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief because I came here today to listen. I take this opportunity to compliment Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, Leader of the Seanad and chairperson of the sub-committee, Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Fine Gael group, Senator Dardis, Deputy Leader of the Seanad, and Senator O&rsquo;Toole, co-ordinator of the Independent group. I thank them for giving of their time and producing a comprehensive report. I also thank the Cathaoirleach and the House for inviting me here to partake in the discussion on Seanad reform and to carry forward the debate on the composition, functions and future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee&rsquo;s report, which was published last month, succinctly sets out the many views which were expressed and also a coherent and comprehensive package of recommendations for further consideration and action. A range of issues has been considered by the sub-committee during the past 12 months and its report contains many far-reaching and groundbreaking recommendations.</P><Col N="1475"/>
    <P>This review is only the first step in what I am confident will be a progressive and extensive debate on how these recommendations can be considered in practical terms and implemented. Given the importance of the review and of the broad acknowledgement of the need for reform of the Seanad&rsquo;s role and responsibilities, it is only correct that we should consider in this debate the steps to be taken to advance these recommendations in a timely and constructive manner.</P>
    <P>I commend the sub-committee on the openness of its consultation process. The latter is evidenced by the many views expressed by a range of bodies, representative groups and, in particular, members of the public who took time to submit their opinions. It is fitting that at a time when political commentators are heralding the decline of public interest in politics, there should be such a positive response from members of the public who spent time and effort on making their views known to the sub-committee. This interest and participation in the debate demonstrates that far from being a remote and mysterious institution, the Seanad is valued as a vital component in our democratic process and that it can continue to develop its relevance and value as a parliamentary institution. A broad spectrum of views have been expressed on the issue of the composition of the House and proposals put forward regarding new arrangements for the election of Senators, ranging from a radical reform of the vocational panel system to allow for wider enfranchisement to the introduction of direct popular elections for some or all Seanad seats.</P>
    <P>I came here to listen to the views of the Members who will contribute to this important debate and I look forward to hearing them. T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm bheith anseo inniu le h&eacute;isteacht leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht th&aacute;bhachtach seo faoin Seanad agus beidh l&aacute; eile le freagra a thabhairt do na ceisteanna a cuireadh.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. This is a historic debate. When the current Seanad was elected two years ago, there was cross-party consensus about the need for the House to examine the issue of Seanad reform and bring forward proposals. It is encouraging that we have managed to produce this report less than two years after the most recent general election and that, by and large, it has cross-party support.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader for ensuring this will be a rolling debate which will last a number of days. It is important that every Senator should contribute to the debate on this report. If colleagues speak, as I encourage them to do, rather than just being critical, they should put forward alternatives. The notion that we can continue without any reform and that there should be no changes whatsoever is nonsense. I encourage people to state their views during the debate.</P><Col N="1476"/>
    <P>I thank the various members of the sub-committee with whom I served, namely, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, the Leader of the House, Senator Dardis, the Deputy Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, co-ordinator of the Independent group, and Senator Ryan who, unfortunately, could not stay the course because of another matter which arose. However, we appreciate Senator Ryan&rsquo;s work during the six to seven months when the sub-committee sat. We were served by an excellent secretariat led by Peter Finnegan, a member of the staff of the Houses, and his deputy, Eugene Crowley. At very little cost, we have produced an excellent report and I congratulate the civil servants involved who played a major role in that regard. I also wish to pay tribute to Dr. Michael Laver for his expertise and his work with the sub-committee, which proved to be invaluable.</P>
    <P>Why is the report important? There have been 11 reports in the past 50 years on reform of the Seanad but there has been virtually no reform. It is now time for action. The report is also important because there has been substantial cross-party agreement on many elements of the reform required. In a sense, the report is a bottom-up response. Many parties from different backgrounds have agreed with the recommendations put forward. The report is also important because it is realistic and balanced. The reforms set out are achievable and are not pie in the sky. They are not so wide of the mark or impractical as to make them irrelevant. These are practical, sound measures that can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The most important reason for the issuing of this report at this time is that we are two or three years away from a general election. This Parliament is now mid term and now that we have this report it gives us a realistic and workable road map for achieving many of its recommendations. This report has not come out at the end but in the middle of the life of the Seanad. The Government and our group leaders have an obligation to take it on and deliver tangible reform.</P>
    <P>Another reason the report is important is that we have had widespread consultation, as alluded to by the Minister of State. The public consultation last summer discovered a wealth of interest in this House and in our parliamentary democracy. People wanted to put their views on the record and had views in respect of how this House could be reformed to make it more modern and up to date with the challenges posed by society. We must tap into this broad public support for the notion of Seanad reform.</P>
    <P>Why is this debate which we will have over the next few weeks important? We must remind ourselves that our mandate as Senators comes, ultimately, from the people, who are an essential ingredient in all parliamentary life. This debate is also important because people, by and large, want to be included in the decision as to who become Senators. The most tangible way we can effect Seanad reform is to give people the power to vote <Col N="1477"/>to elect people to the House. This is already available in respect of the university panel, from which Senator Quinn was elected. A substantial number of people are graduates and elections to the university panel work well because there is a popular mandate. In respect of my panel, I was elected by local authority members. Members elected to this panel are also supported by a mandate.</P>
    <P>The majority of the population has never been asked its view or had the opportunity to contribute to the election of Senators. We must tap into support for the notion that these people should be allowed to vote for Senators. People want a commitment from this debate that Government and other parties will take the ball and move it in the direction of reform. This report should not remain a document which gathers dust on a shelf. People want to see reform.</P>
    <P>Like the turkey voting for Christmas, the fundamental question is why a Senator would support reform which might ultimately lead to the loss of his or her seat. I understand this is a concern for those on both sides of the House and among all groupings. People want to retain the <i>status quo</i> and are concerned that if the situation alters radically, people will lose their seats. My response to that concern is that if we do not shape reform now, it will be shaped by someone else. We have the opportunity to come up with the kind of reform that is workable, practical, realistic and can garner widespread public support. Now, because we are in the middle of the life of this Oireachtas, we have the opportunity to shape that reform.</P>
    <P>Our parliamentarians have new tasks and duties many of which are not carried out fully. We have far too much legislation which is not being sufficiently tested or scrutinised. I make this criticism of myself and everybody else. We must be honest and admit we are not doing the job set out in the Constitution to scrutinise legislation. Both Houses have new tasks which must be addressed. We cannot be afraid of reform because if we do not shape the body of reform, others will shape it for us. People tapped into the prevailing cynicism at the previous Seanad election and asked how it was possible such an important institution of the country could be elected virtually without any recourse to the people. This is something we must address.</P>
    <P>Many important aspects of this House give it great credibility. It is less party political and less theatrical than the D&aacute;il as a result of the traditions that have grown in this House which ensure it is less partisan. The D&aacute;il is in a sense a massive theatre of public opinion. While this House also reflects public opinion, people do not work here with the same kind of tunnelled vision or party political bias as in the other House. This is a huge advantage we must tap.</P>
    <P>One of the most important advantages of this House is that all Stages of a Bill are debated in the House. This means all 59 Members except the <Col N="1478"/>Cathaoirleach, can contribute on all Stages, an advantage the other House does not have. The D&aacute;il also suffers from time constraints that do not exist in the Seanad because of our unique situation. Another great strength of this House is its mixture of voices. We have leading industrialists, people from the world of commerce, from the social science area, from the world of academics, from the local authority base and people who have lost D&aacute;il seats etc. This mix of experienced people is important and lends itself to proper scrutiny in the House.</P>
    <P>The problem for this House is that it is totally subservient to the D&aacute;il. This was clearly set out in the report we issued approximately a month ago. Another major problem is that the House lacks legitimacy because the majority of the population cannot vote to elect Senators. Some people are of the view that the university seats are elitist and that not all graduates can vote. Others hold that it is wrong that graduates can vote while others cannot. Also, while this House is supposed to represent vocational groups, it does not, as everybody knows. The various bodies that nominate Senators cannot vote. It seems a bizarre notion of democracy that groups can nominate people but not participate in the vote and this should be changed.</P>
    <P>The key challenge is not to recreate the D&aacute;il, which is directly elected by the people, but to have the Seanad review legislation with a greater mandate and do important new jobs which are not being done currently in our parliamentary life. Let us all agree with the view that came from the committee. Nobody suggested the Seanad should be abolished or that it does not play an important part in our parliamentary system. This was the overwhelming view of the consultation groups. People believe the Seanad plays a vital role, but they want reform.</P>
    <P>I will go through the recommendations briefly. We propose that the Seanad would have 65 members, or 64 if as we propose the Cathaoirleach would be automatically returned at the next election.</P>

	<P>We suggest that 32 Members would be directly elected by the people at the same time as local and European elections, half-way through the life of an Oireachtas. We suggest that the other 32 would be indirectly elected. Some 20 would be appointed or elected by local authority members because we feel it is important to keep the link between councillors and this House and 12 would be appointed by the Taoiseach of the day after a general election. Of the 32 directly elected, 26 would be on a PR list system throughout the entire country and six would be left for what we describe as a new higher education constituency.</P>
    <P>The situation has worked well with regard to university seats. If people wish they may remain <Col N="1479"/>in that sector. However, if one is a graduate and wants to vote in the graduate constituency, one would vote in the new constituency of six seats, whereas other members of the public would vote in the 26 seat constituency under a PR list system.</P>
    <P>We suggest that 12 Members would be nominated by the Taoiseach, two from Northern Ireland representing the two traditions there. Certain regard must be given by the Taoiseach to groups under-represented in our society to ensure their views are represented in Parliament. We suggest that there would be a rolling renewal of this House in that 50% of Members would be elected on the same day European and local elections are held and the other Members would be elected after a general election to the other House. In effect, we propose an end to the vocational nomination system. We suggest that former Taoisigh and T&aacute;naist&iacute; would be entitled to attend but not vote in the Seanad because of their particular experience in Government and the wealth of experience they have built up over time. Their contribution would be useful to this House.</P>
    <P>We have proposed new functions for the House, work that has not been done by any Member in either House of the Oireachtas. There should be a formal consultation stage for legislation, allowing for submissions at that stage rather than Bills coming before the House without proper consultation. The House should have a particular role in EU affairs to provide that proposals which go to Council from the Government would be scrutinised better in the House. We propose a particular role for MEPs and a particular role in reviewing national policy and examining how it is delivered by State agencies.</P>
    <P>There should be a greater linkage between this House and the social partners. There should be much greater scrutiny of the North-South Ministerial Council and the North-South bodies, which could be done by this House.</P>
    <P>We suggest there should be proper scrutiny by this House of a proposal from Government for senior appointments made by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This suggestion does not in any way undermine a Government decision but seeks to ensure that a person who will obtain a very high post would be subject to questioning in this House to ensure that person is up to speed and suitable for the job.</P>
    <P>We suggest the Leader of the House should be entitled to attend Cabinet, given that whomever that person will be, he or she will have to defend the Government on regular occasions. We propose that preferably the Leader would be a Cabinet Minister to give this House the standing it needs.</P>
    <P>I could speak for another 40 minutes on this issue but the time allocated does not permit me to do so despite the fact that I have proposed the Cathaoirleach be returned automatically at the next election. I commend the report to the <Col N="1480"/>House. I ask colleagues to give it a fair wind. At the end of this process we do not want another report gathering dust; we want one that will deliver reform and gain new credibility for the House and ensure its integrity and durability in the years ahead.</P>

   <Title>Report on Seanad Reform: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate and am delighted we are having this debate. I thank the Minister of State for speaking briefly but eloquently at the start of this debate. Obviously he could not propose resolutions to it because as he said, t&aacute; s&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht.</P>
    <P>Before I pay tributes and go through the report, it is important to note Appendix A on page 70 of the report. Working from the bottom up, Members will note there have been 11 reports on Seanad reform. The first report was commissioned in 1928 and the last one in 2002. Not much has happened as a result of the 11 reports, which says something not about the industry of the people who compiled them but about the lack of implementation or follow-through of their recommendations. That is a salutary lesson for us.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues, Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, Senator Dardis, Deputy Leader of the Seanad and Senator O&rsquo;Toole, co-ordinator of the Independent group for their contributions and Senator Ryan who was present for 18 meetings during which we shared our thoughts and compiled the report. Senator Ryan had an issue with the composition of the commission. He expressed his thoughts on reform, attended all the meetings and contributed greatly to the thrust of the report. I also thank Peter Finnegan and Eugene Crowley, who provided a great Civil Service secretariat, and <Col N="1481"/>their Northern colleague who helped us with various references. In particular, she reviewed the operation of upper houses in other countries, which is instructive and shows how other countries run their upper houses. That appendix in the report is well worth reading. Dr. Michael Laver was a terrific help to us in our thoughts on reform and in compiling the report.</P>
    <P>This report is a compilation of the thoughts of the Senators, to whom I referred, who worked with the secretariat. We spent many mornings last summer in the good weather discussing this matter. We did not approach this from a perverse notion, as I said to my party colleagues. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges under the chairmanship of the Cathaoirleach convened a meeting at which we were given the terms of reference for preparing the reform package. We debated this matter over two days in this House at the start of this process two years ago during which Members shared their thoughts on it. We did not suddenly decide to put forward a Seanad reform package. Under the guidance of the Cathaoirleach, the sub-committee was given its terms of reference, namely, to examine the composition and functions of the Seanad, which we set out to do.</P>
    <P>Countries throughout the world which have upper and lower houses have each adopted different ways of dealing with their upper house. Our Upper House was modelled originally on the House of Lords in the UK because many of the ideas underpinning our system of government comes from there. I am not a newcomer to the Seanad thanks to the generosity of the Taoiseach. I served here with the Cathaoirleach for two six month stints. I have always been struck by the ease of movement in dealing with matters in this Chamber because of the intimacy pertaining due to its size and the fact that it is a compulsory legislative assembly. A Bill cannot become an Act unless it has been passed by the Seanad. There is no point in saying the Seanad is worthless or that it does not have any relevance. We could not pass legislation, by which we are all governed, if we did not have the Seanad to pass Bills. We have been fortunate in that many Bills have come to this House before going to the D&aacute;il, and <i>vice versa</i>, but all Members have a chance to examine every Bill and amend it on Committee Stage, a point mentioned by Senator Brian Hayes. In the D&aacute;il, Committee Stage is taken in select committee because of the large number of Members in that House. It would be impossible to do it otherwise.</P>
    <P>I hold fast to the idea that people throughout the country do not understand the point of having the Seanad. If we were to go out to Grafton Street, Henry Street or O&rsquo;Connell Bridge and stop any number of people ranging in age from 80 to eight and ask them if they know anything about the Seanad and what it does, I would vouch that unless we were extremely fortunate, we would not meet people who knew what we were about in this Chamber. I do not mean to lessen <Col N="1482"/>the importance of what we do. If one does not have a democratic link with the electorate, our fine thoughts, words, speeches and attendance will come to naught. It needs to be built on a bedrock of democracy.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>It could be argued that Senators are elected by county councillors who are, in turn, elected by the people. I respect the work of county councillors, who have been given a strong role in the proposed Seanad reforms. Candidates will be nominated by county councillors rather than by vocational bodies, who have lost much of their relevance to Irish society, sadly. Letters were sent to the vocational bodies on three occasions and huge public advertisements were placed in all the newspapers, but less than one third of the bodies deigned to reply or to make a submission. That indicates that they have moved out of synch.</P>
    <P>The 1930s ideas of <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> etc, resulted in greater social awareness and inclusion and other fine thoughts that were of relevance then. A great deal of time has passed since the 1930s, however. We did not have a Seanad for a time because it had been abolished by &Eacute;amon de Valera due to its inability to pass important legislation. It was revived in the 1937 Constitution and we are all here today. Very little has changed in the interim.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee on Seanad reform examined the functions of the Seanad. I thank all those who made submissions. We received 158 public submissions in total. Everybody who engaged in the process had a purpose. Individuals and groups took the trouble to sit down to put together their thoughts and to come to the House. The sub-committee met in the Seanad Chamber for a week without the Cathaoirleach to hear the submissions. Questions were asked and certain matters were probed during the hugely interesting exercise. I wish we had more of it. RTE was very good to broadcast much of the sub-committee&rsquo;s hearings. Many people made submissions.</P>
    <P>In making recommendations on the composition of the Seanad, the sub-committee tried to ensure that a certain number of Senators will continue to be elected in the traditional way. The sub-committee has a high regard for the work of county councillors and the link between local government and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A decision was also made to recommend a vote by suffrage. I cannot understand why some Senators think they would not stand a chance in such a vote. Why do they think so little of themselves that they feel they would not be elected if they faced such a vote? Others might wonder why I am making this point, given that I lost my D&aacute;il seat in the last general election. I would respond by saying that I was returned to the other House on five consecutive occasions. Very few people can better such a record. Although I was not successful on the last occasion, I have a huge regard for the popular vote. I do not understand why people are imbued <Col N="1483"/>with so little self-confidence that they think they would not come through such a system when, of course, they would.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss the university panels. The people voted in a referendum on university representation in the Seanad in 1979. They expressed 25 years ago their wish that graduates of certain institutes of higher education would have the right to join graduates of universities in voting in Seanad elections. It is sometimes suggested that the universities voting system is elitist, but those elected under the system are the only Senators to be elected by means of a form of public suffrage. The university Senators are elected by graduates. I do not share the view that the system is elitist. It has been a huge disregard on the part of all Governments in the past 25 years. When I reminded the Taoiseach that the people voted in 1979 to allow graduates of other colleges to participate in the Seanad elections, he said that he could hardly believe it. We all continued blithely on our way in 1979 and did nothing about it. The time has come to remedy the matter.</P>
    <P>Everybody favours changes in the functions of the Seanad, but nobody favours changes in its composition. Perhaps I am more detached in that regard, but I am conscious of the way in which I got into this House on two occasions. It is some job to court county councillors in multitudes as people do now. It is a wonderful exercise which leads to great interchanges. Certain little groups manage things much better than others. Many Senators arrive in the House in that way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made some interesting points about the functions of the Seanad in the strong letter he wrote to the sub-committee as part of his submission. He spoke in the House as part of the reform process, as did the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton. Members of all political parties took the trouble to come to the House in mid-September to put forward their points of view. The provosts of all the colleges also addressed the sub-committee. The Taoiseach made suggestions in respect of the North-South bodies, social partnership and the European Union. It was recommended that the House should have a role in examining the EU mid-term review, in considering what it is like and what it will be, and in assessing its scope, its work and what needs to be done. Such ideas emanated from the Taoiseach. He also spoke about several other matters.</P>
    <P>Many people said they do not know about legislation until it has been passed and starts to be implemented. While Senator Mansergh did not quite say that we should not entertain lobby groups, he said at our party meeting that such groups might have an overweening influence on legislation. We do not see it that way, however. We consider that it would be appropriate to allow groups to state how proposed legislation might affect them, materially or otherwise. It is right that such people should convey their thoughts to <Col N="1484"/>those who are preparing Bills. Perhaps legislators might consider such ideas or meet the groups to explain the legislation to them. For whom are we making legislation? About what are we making it? When will it all happen? Many groups are made aware of proposed legislation that affects them in a sudden manner.</P>
    <P>Many representatives of respectable and proper lobby groups who addressed the sub-committee said they would come to give their opinions, prior to the formulation of legislation, if they could be sure they would get a hearing. It is hugely important that we receive such advice because if we do not do so we will be preparing legislation in the air to meet a need. Such legislation is often the subject of a challenge &mdash; everybody has the right to challenge &mdash; and found to be faulty. It is important to bear in mind that it may have been rushed or it may not have taken into account human rights, poverty or some of the issues that are relevant to people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
    <P>I thank Peter Finnegan, Eugene Crowley and Dr. Michael Laver for their contribution to the sub-committee&rsquo;s report. Anybody can read the report because it is well laid-out. It sets out the legislative and constitutional changes that are needed. We can use the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to make the functional changes that are needed. We have started on that by arranging for many MEPs to come to the House.</P>
    <P>When one hands out leaflets while canvassing with candidates for the local and European elections, everybody asks what MEPs do when they get to Brussels. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who used to represent a large, far-flung European constituency, is aware of how difficult it is to convey what one is doing. We heard the opinions of a range of extremely interesting MEPs who addressed the sub-committee. They told us about their work. MEPs should come to the House on a regular basis, although we cannot make it mandatory for them to do so. They could tell the House about the committees on which they serve, the work they are doing, the role of the Parliament and the relationship between the Parliament and the Executive. We need to know such things.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Seanad should be relevant. The Chamber is beautiful. The Seanad office is fortunate to have excellent staff, who work diligently to serve all Senators. We should not be keen to rush into the Chamber so that we can hurry home again. I do not think we should do our business in such a manner. We should conduct ourselves properly as the full legislators we are and we should scrutinise our work in detail.</P>
    <P>Oireachtas Members have reached a point at which they are on a decent but not lavish salary scale. However, we work for it and I have always believed that one should work for one&rsquo;s money. The Seanad can be put to far greater use. Members should have confidence in themselves, absorb the report and believe that recommendations can be taken from it rather <Col N="1485"/>than carp about it. I am very happy that the Cathaoirleach will be in the next Seanad in some capacity. The report is good and, if I may immodestly state, we have done a fair job on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator say &ldquo;in modesty&rdquo; or &ldquo;immodestly&rdquo;?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I meant without modesty.</P>
    <P>When the elections are over, the Taoiseach will set up the implementation group. I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on this issue and thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw Senators&rsquo; attention to the fact that it is not customary to compliment or criticise persons who are not Members of the House. However, as I have allowed latitude already I will continue to do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling gives me the freedom to compliment a number of Members who are in the House. I can mention the names of the Members present, namely, the Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Dardis; I hope the Cathaoirleach will also permit me to congratulate Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Ryan in their absence.</P>
    <P>The document is very impressive because it is easy to read and understand but, more particularly, it is easy to act on. Often documents may be easy to read and understand but may not be easy to act upon. I was particularly impressed with the examples from other senates in other parts of Europe and the world. When I have tried to explain to people from other parts of the world and even in Ireland the concept of a second house, they ask why we need it, in reply to which the Leader has given us a number of examples.</P>
    <P>When Bills are initiated in this House, it is interesting to note the number of amendments tabled and the number accepted by Ministers. However, it is even more interesting when a Member of this House identifies an error or potential improvement in a Bill which has already been passed in the Lower House. Ministers are often willing to acknowledge such errors or improvements and redraft the Bill accordingly. The example which comes to mind is the issue Senator Ross identified at the last moment in the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2002, in respect of opinion polls prior to elections. We realised at that stage that a flaw had not been identified in the Lower House and the Bill was stopped.</P>
    <P>Another role of the House, to which Senator Brian Hayes referred, is the scrutiny of legislation which is needed and to which on occasion we do not pay enough attention. We probably would not have had the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2004 before us last week, which we have asked the President to sign in five days, if we had thought through the issue when the Copyright and Related Rights Bill was taken <Col N="1486"/>five or six years ago. The Bill received a great deal of attention at the time but we did not identify the flaw which has now been identified.</P>
    <P>The other question people raise is how Members are elected from their constituencies. When I explain the process and the constituencies, people remark that it sounds like an undemocratic House. The manner in which we are elected or nominated is not entirely democratic. However, the second house in the British Parliament is not very democratic either.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They are all appointed. It is far less democratic.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>In the United States, Hawaii and Alaska, with their tiny populations, have the same number of senators as California and New York. It is not very democratic but the recognition of the need for a second house which represents other interests has been recognised in this document as being well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The concept envisaged for the Seanad in the 1937 Constitution was well thought out. It was to ensure that those voices, which would not otherwise be heard in the D&aacute;il, elected by universal suffrage, had some chance of being recognised. The issue of Trinity College Senators will not be solved by this process and perhaps does not need to be because the world has changed since 1937. However, it is unlikely that the voice of the Protestant minority in Trinity College would have been heard if we had not given three seats to what was, in those days, a totally Protestant university. Nonetheless, the world has changed since then and the new system for electing Members will take that into account.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution also recognised the other vocational interests and the whole concept was well thought out. However, the error was that referred to by Senator Brian Hayes, namely, that while there were vocational plans, the rights to vote were given to county councillors who voted along party lines and, therefore, Members are elected on a party political basis and do not represent the vocational interests as envisaged.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the need for a second house. Some 11 reports have been produced since 1928 to examine how it can be improved but none has received the same attention as this one. I congratulate the members of the sub-committee for producing an excellent report. Never has the future of the Seanad been investigated with anything like the rigour which has been applied on this occasion. Neither has the issue ever received such a comprehensive level of public consultation. A huge number of outsiders made representations to the sub-committee in written form and personally, making the process well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate the sub-committee on the subject matter of the report. Its recommendations are quite radical and far-reaching and, if fully implemented, will bring about the beginning of a new era for the Seanad as a creative and viable <Col N="1487"/>force in the political process which has been so definitely required. The recommendations are also courageous because they fly in the face of the expressed preferences of the main Government party.</P>
    <P>Up to now, we have relied greatly on the energy and political clout of the Leader to push this process along and we will need even more of this in the implementation phase as the Government will clearly need some persuasion to go the route recommended by the sub-committee. I wish the Leader well in that effort and I only hope the Government will be influenced by the strength of the consensus that has emerged from the public consultation.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee made a raft of recommendations, some of which will require constitutional amendment, new legislation or can be implemented by adopting and adapting our own procedures in the House and those of the legislative process in general. In this context, has any thought been given to the practical question of whether it will be possible to deal with the constitutional amendments by means of a single referendum question rather than a series of separate proposals? This issue, which may seem trivial, is anything but. Putting one question to the people is a relatively straightforward matter but putting a whole series before the people, even if the referenda happen simultaneously, is likely to be very much less attractive to the Government.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, asking a series of questions of the people runs the risk that they will give different answers to different questions and the outcome may well turn out to be an unworkable mish-mash. However, we are constrained in what we do here by the Constitution, which lays down that only one issue can be put before the people in any referendum. The obvious way around this is to incorporate all the changes into a single new article. I have no idea whether it is possible or practical to do that but I suggest some consideration be given to it because the alternative is difficult and dangerous inasmuch as it will not be an attractive outcome. We should look at it, as a matter of urgency, rather than just talk about it if we are serious about achieving real progress. Having listened to the first two speakers, I know it is not the intention to just talk about it, but to act on it. We must move fast to make the recommendations in the report a reality. Therefore, I disagree slightly with the Leader when she said not to rush it. Perhaps she did not say that but I got the impression&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all, I am all for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>We can rush it. It would be a tragedy and a lost opportunity if this report was allowed to gather dust in a filing cabinet.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1488"/>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that is not the intention but we have to get behind it.</P>
    <P>As a university Senator I express my particular pleasure at the proposals in regard to the university franchise. At this stage there is no way of justifying in democratic terms a separate franchise for university graduates. However, the recommendation to continue with it reflects a widespread awareness that the system has worked well in practice to the benefit of the political process and the country in general. I warmly welcome the recommendation to extend the franchise to graduates of all third level institutions. I remember well the vote in 1979.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 25 years ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that it was 25 years ago, it is long overdue. I had not thought it through that some of us have two votes. If one is a county councillor and a university graduate, one has two votes. Perhaps that is not democratic. The solution that has come out of this is well thought out and innovative. Irrespective of what one&rsquo;s views may be on having university representatives, it makes no sense to have only some of our graduates represented to the exclusion of others.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the higher education franchise, I wonder how it will work in practice. As I understand it, there will be a general electoral register for the Seanad, which will include everybody entitled to vote in the D&aacute;il elections, and a higher education register in which graduates can choose to be included instead of on the general register. That is well thought out and an issue I had not considered. What is the position of graduates of the universities who are Irish citizens but not resident here and, therefore, are not eligible to vote in D&aacute;il elections? At present they are entitled to vote in Seanad elections. I am not clear whether it is intended that this will continue afterwards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a postal vote.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the intention to disenfranchise non-resident university graduates? I would like some clarification on this issue because that has not been fully thought out, but perhaps I am wrong. If it is so intended, that would be a pity. At present it is the only aspect of our electoral system that recognises the existence of our emigrants overseas. We have heard much in recent times about giving emigrants votes. The only emigrants who have votes are those who vote in the university elections. Part of the difficulty is that so few graduates have registered. Certainly graduates from the NUI panel have not been good at registering, Trinity College has been much more efficient in that on the day one graduates, one is given a document to sign. In the case of NUI, one has to make a second visit or request it to do so. Those are technical issues we should be able to overcome.</P><Col N="1489"/>
    <P>I recommend the report as good reading for students but even more so for those who are able to get to work and do something about it. I congratulate the Leader, the committee and those behind the scenes who did a great deal of the work and who have already been mentioned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and thank him for attending to listen to the debate. It is a privilege to be a Member of the House and the national Parliament. We should be conscious of that privilege and the responsibilities it carries with it. I am fortunate to have been the first member of the Progressive Democrats to be elected to the House and to be nominated on several occasions. What we do is important. We contribute to the overall national debate which is important in a democracy and we have contributed to the improvement of legislation. All the parties and those who are not members of a party have contributed to that process.</P>
    <P>The report was prepared by the sub-committee, of which I was pleased to be a member. I join in the words of thanks to the secretariat, Dr. Laver and the other members. It is a comprehensive and good report and is quite courageous. The current system is indefensible. It cannot be defended on any grounds of proper democracy or of relevance to the electorate. I have found three more written submissions in addition to what the Leader found. There were 161 submissions and there were four days of hearings. We were fortunate to be guided by people such as the Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton. There were many pearls of wisdom from those who came before us, all of whom were listened to attentively. The report is a good representation of the consensus that emerged from those hearings and from the submissions. It does not reflect the personal bias of any of the members of the sub-committee or their party positions. I do not think anybody promoted their party&rsquo;s position within the committee. That was one of its strengths.</P>
    <P>The origins of the current Seanad under the 1937 Constitution, which was to create a vocational Chamber whereby the various vocational elements would be represented, was laudatory. Within that context it was legitimate to have the universities represented as a separate constituency. The system of vocational panels was devised. Given that the electorate was political, the nominating bodies became political instruments and it was inevitable that would happen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please. I have reminded Senators often that it is disrespectful to engage in conversation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the vocational system that emerged, it was understandable it would become a political instrument and that the political parties would take it over because the electorate was <Col N="1490"/>political. There is no difficulty about that; the House is political. I do not see anything wrong with a House of Parliament being a political House. If the intention was to have vocational representation, it was thwarted by the electoral system which was devised.</P>
    <P>An aspect mentioned by Senator Quinn was that some matters require constitutional change. The way the House is structured and elected would require constitutional change but the functions aspect does not require constitutional change. There are certain issues that might require legislation but not many. We have the capacity to make fundamental changes to the functional side of the House. That can and should be done quickly to bring it in line with modern thinking and the population as a whole.</P>
    <P>The current system, which is a product of the 1937 Constitution, is arcane. If one was to try to explain how the system works to people who are politically astute and even to some Members &mdash; they need to know how it works to be elected &mdash; one would have a difficulty in the area of sub-panels, the Oireachtas nominating sub-panel and the various vocational panels. If one asked somebody to tell one off the top of their head how many members are on each of the vocational panels, I am sure he or she would have a difficulty, except for the one he or she represents, which he or she would know intimately.</P>

	<P>If one had fought an election one would know.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>My party&rsquo;s position is that it would have been preferable to have universal suffrage for the whole of the Seanad, in other words, that there would not even be a university panel and everybody would be directly elected.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the report represent a reasonable balance. However, the universities, as a separate constituency, still present a difficulty. The only defence for university representation is the contribution made by university Senators over an extended period. We must ensure that when election to the Seanad is by universal suffrage, nobody has two votes, for example a vote as a graduate or a county councillor as well as a vote under universal suffrage.</P>
    <P>How does one deal with representation of smaller parties in a system of direct election? The only way that can be done is by having, as the report suggests, a national constituency of 26 people, whereby a party that receives 4% of the vote will get a seat. If one divides the county into four constituencies, similar to the European constituency, the threshold becomes much higher and it is much more difficult to have representation from a cross-section of the smaller parties.</P>
    <P>It is totally indefensible in circumstances where the universities are entitled to membership that a decision by constitutional referendum 25 years ago should not be implemented. It is not possible to defend that. Obviously every graduate and <Col N="1491"/>everybody at level 7 at NFQ, as recommended in the report, should have a right to vote. I have problems about how this option will be offered. When one graduates from university, will one be asked to opt for the university constituency or universal suffrage? This would be quite problematic also in terms of putting the question to the people in a referendum of whether to increase the membership of the Seanad from 60 to 65 Members. The report explains the reason for that &mdash; the Cathaoirleach has to be returned automatically; the Taoiseach has to hold the balance of representation, as well as nominating Members from the Unionist and Nationalist traditions in the North; and there must be a balance between directly elected members and the members elected by county councillors. The report is reasonably conservative but I can see it being problematic if one asks people to increase the membership of Seanad &Eacute;ireann from 60 to 65 Members. More than one question would be put and I agree with Senator Quinn that a composite proposition should be put to the electorate to embrace all the aspects. This is relatively complicated because of the number of references in the Constitution to Seanad &Eacute;ireann. We are not dealing with only one article but with a multitude thereof.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that it was recommended that disability groups, emigrants and other such groups should be represented in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominations. The committee spent considerable time examining the possibility that emigrants should have the right to vote in Seanad elections. I have always been of the view that emigrants should have the right to vote not only in Seanad but D&aacute;il elections. I accept that is extremely difficult to organise, but other countries do it. Obviously, the question of representation and taxation and the cut off point for the number of years one is out of the country impinges on this, but it should be possible to organise it. Having listened to the evidence of the distinguished former ambassador, Mr. Se&aacute;n Donlon, who outlined how difficult it would be to organise, I have had second thoughts as to how to register an electorate. It is reasonable to suggest that the Taoiseach would nominate representatives from the emigrant community.</P>
    <P>The central issue is how the people connect with Seanad &Eacute;ireann and in my view the only way is to give the electorate a direct say in choosing the Members of the Seanad. The democratic deficit is evident in elections for the European Parliament where there is a direct election. That is a major flaw. I am not saying that county councillors who elect the Members of the Seanad are not representative of the electorate. Of course they are representative of the electorate and comprise a reasonable electoral college. There are electoral colleges in other jurisdictions. However, the nominator should be the electorate, in other words the nominating body should supply the electorate. If the electorate are the <Col N="1492"/>county councillors, they should become the nominators and the report suggested that the backing of ten councillors would be required to secure a nomination to contest the election. It is reasonable that there should be a rolling renewal. As far as I am aware, most second chambers have that system, where Members serve a fixed term. If the Seanad election is held on the same day as the European elections, one will have a higher turnout and one is likely to erode the umbilical chord between the Seanad and the D&aacute;il. It is generally perceived, although I do not subscribe to it, that the Members of the Seanad are either here as part of the D&aacute;il cr&egrave;che or as the D&aacute;il retirement home. Serving a fixed term would rid us of that perception.</P>
    <P>The original policy of the Progressive Democrats was that the Upper House would be demolished.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Abolished.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope we never demolish a room as distinguished as this one. It was proposed to abolish the Seanad. There are precedents for the removal of the second chamber, such as in New Zealand and other jurisdictions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They now wish they had not done so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the report states that in the absence of reform, that might be considered. The Seanad performs a valuable role. It would not surprise anybody that because I am a Member I am not particularly in favour of abolition, and have not been for some considerable time. I do not see an inconsistency with having an abolitionist attitude and participating. The Seanad is a very important political institution and a political party has to participate in the political institutions of the State. I have this speech rehearsed and off by heart after 14 years. We have a duty to participate, but that does not mean we did not raise radical views with the committee.</P>
    <P>It would be good for democracy for a major proportion of Senators to be elected by direct franchise as it would give people a sense of ownership of the work of the Seanad. It is important that the Unionist and Nationalist tradition as well as emigrants and other under-represented groups are reflected in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees. I agree that the Cathaoirleach should be returned automatically as is standard practice in most parliaments where the speaker is returned unopposed. I would also like former Taoisigh and T&aacute;naist&iacute; to have the right to be Members, if they were to choose to exercise that option although I appreciate the constitutional difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>The Seanad could have a more meaningful role in debating the issues that will arise in Europe and in considering legislation at the early stage when the possibility for consultation exists and in <Col N="1493"/>reviewing policy. I agree that the Leader, and I know she excluded herself from this, should be able to attend Cabinet meetings.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been there and done that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be important for the way the business of this House is conducted. I agree that senior public appointments should be subjected to scrutiny by the House or at least by a committee of the House.</P>
    <P>The report is quite radical and forward looking, and I say that as a member of the sub-committee. I hope there will be progress in implementing its main conclusion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators in complimenting the sub-committee and the secretariat and the many individuals and bodies who made submissions on Seanad reform. I welcome the Minister who has exercised patience during this debate. The Leader referred to groupings of individuals and petitioners. I hope she was not referring to little groupings of councillors organising votes during her presentation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must be talking about himself because I never said that the councillors organised votes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>That did not happen among elected local public representatives. Reading the report on the first Seanad and the list of Members, including such well known figures as William Butler Yeats, poet and dramatist, and Oliver St. John Gogarty, surgeon, wit and author, one has a sense of history. I am proud to be part of the system, as laid down in the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State. One can only have admiration for an era which had the wisdom to include such figures in our Upper House.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, it was the intention at that time that the Seanad was to be directly elected by the people but, as a transitional measure, one half of the first Seanad was nominated by the President of the Executive Council and the other by the D&aacute;il. It is now being proposed in the report on Seanad reform that 26 senators should be directly elected.</P>
    <P>Despite his avowed opposition to a second Chamber, &Eacute;amon de Valera included proposals for the Seanad in his new Constitution in 1937. His vision for the Senate was influenced by Pope Pius XI&rsquo;s support for vocationalism in his papal encyclical of that time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right. It was entitled <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i>.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>As a result, 43 of the 60 seats were filled from vocational panels, a position we now propose to change, bringing us nearer to the original concept of 1922.</P>
    <P>Change is important for growth and the Seanad is not immune to the need for such change. <Col N="1494"/>However, it could be said that for any meaningful change to take place, Seanad reform should follow what many see as necessary change in the D&aacute;il. It is important that any Seanad changes should reflect the input of all sectors of this House and all strands of the wider community.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that members of the public were involved in the process of Seanad reform and were invited to give their views. There is a contradiction between the Leader of the House and the leader of the Progressive Democrats group on that matter. Senator Dardis is correct that there were 161 submissions which gave us a view of public opinion on Seanad reform.</P>
    <P>Direct Seanad elections are probably the most important change to encourage and strengthen public interest in the workings of the House and give purpose to public perception of its viability. At one time, the Progressive Democrats had a policy to abolish this House but I am glad they had a change of heart on the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They changed their minds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting to see that Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s arguments against giving ordinary citizens a Seanad vote were of a politically pragmatic nature. Why would Fianna F&aacute;il be concerned with the practical consequences of such actions?</P>
    <P>The Seanad is to be retained despite reservations by the Progressive Democrats about its effectiveness, but in a very overhauled form with a view to making it a vigorous and vital part of the future governance of the State. Political inertia, which has in the past stymied reform, seems finally to have been overcome, but is there any certainty that these changes as proposed will be in place for the next general election? The major elements will require a constitutional referendum, which will have to take place within the next two years if the changes are to be introduced before the next general election.</P>
    <P>Seven years ago the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution proposed the direct election of 15 Members of the Seanad and the enfranchisement of all third level graduates to elect six university or third level Members, without affecting the overall numbers. Nothing was done, however. In all, there have been 11 previous reports on Seanad reform with little or nothing to show for them. This is the 12th reform plan and the first which claims to have all-party support. The fundamental difference now is that there is a strongly demonstrated desire for change not only from Members of the Oireachtas, but also from the public. We are light years behind public opinion on Seanad reform.</P>
    <P>My party, Fine Gael, advocated a mixed voting system as a first step to full, direct elections. It is interesting and even reassuring that Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s view, despite supporting the continuation of the existing voting system, did not prevail in these proposals.</P>
    <P>The proposed abolition of Seanad vocational panels, which nominate candidates for Seanad <Col N="1495"/>elections, will see the end of what is a unique international electoral system. The Leader of the House referred to that point also in her contribution. While we may be unique in terms of this system, the report highlights the fact that we are not alone in facing problems that confront other second chambers throughout the world. Ultimately, our problems are peculiar to our situation and must be resolved in the best interests of society.</P>
    <P>As suggested, 26 of the directly elected Senators should be elected by voters on a national list PR system, with elections being held every five years on the same day as the European and local elections. That is the proposal in the report and I welcome it because it would give greater independence to the Seanad if that were to happen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The remaining six seats would be elected on the same day to a higher education constituency. This independence from D&aacute;il elections would underpin the unique nature of the Seanad as a deliberative body that takes a different perspective from the D&aacute;il, while at the same time complementing it. There should be no attempt to reform the Seanad at the expense of bringing it into confrontation with the D&aacute;il. I compliment the sub-committee on ensuring that this will not happen. I gather from the report that under the proposed system of reform, the Seanad would be independent of the D&aacute;il and there would be no confrontation between both Houses.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Seanad should not be seen to act, in any way, as a carbon copy of the D&aacute;il. Its function should be the examination of Bills and while many people feel that is so, its role has been somewhat chequered in recent years. Senators often had to wait for long periods for Bills to come form the Lower House. I am glad that during her current term of office, the Leader has initiated more Bills here than ever in the history of the House. I compliment her on having done so.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the party Whip system should be considered, thus allowing Members to act and vote independently. A system whereby Members could freely state personal opinions would be preferable to the constraints of the Whip system where Members toe the party line. We should be independent because we all have our views on various issues. During the debate on the legislation to abolish the dual mandate, a majority on the Government benches felt it was a bad idea.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great idea.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the arrogant Minister whipped them into line in order to push the Bill through both Houses.</P><Col N="1496"/>
    <P>In any consideration of the Seanad, it is essential to consider gender balance. Any representative body should be composed of equal numbers of male and female members. Looking around the Chamber today, one can see that such equality does not exist but I am sure the Leader would be happy to see this position reversed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report&rsquo;s recommendation on the extension of the Seanad&rsquo;s role concerning the EU. The sub-committee stated that it should be responsible for four specific areas and, most importantly, for providing MEPs with a domestic forum to discuss EU matters and account for their work. There is probably less interest in European elections now than when we joined the EU, which is sad. The public seems to think that Europe is a gravy train and that MEPs do not make a meaningful contribution to the development of our country in Europe. If Irish MEPs were given an opportunity to outline their policies in the Seanad and explain how they voted on various issues, it would attract public attention. The report makes provision for the attendance of former Taoisigh and T&aacute;naist&iacute;. That should be extended to all former Cabinet members, whose contribution would be invaluable. They should have the right to attend and speak, though without, of course, voting, which is the privilege of the elected Members. However, it would do no harm to hear their views on certain subjects. We should broaden matters, and I would even go a step further, giving ambassadors a role from time to time. If there were a crisis in another country, we should afford the ambassador the opportunity to attend and address the House to update us on exactly what is happening. We rely too much nowadays on the media and journalists to pass on the message, and we act on their reports rather than on those of our diplomatic representatives in those nations where we have ambassadors. We should broaden matters so that we can request an ambassador to attend, give his views, address the House and make a statement on what is happening in the nation in which he is posted if it is at war.</P>
    <P>There are other areas I would like to see addressed, but I will always toe the party line on policy, and I compliment our leader, Senator Brian Hayes, on keeping us updated on many activities. I thank him for his foresight and assistance to members when we raised many queries during the process of preparing the reform document, and I wish him well.</P>

    <P>I would like to take up what Senator Dardis said about the complications of this election. I assure him I did not find it complicated. I disagree with everything he said. He said that people in this House would not even understand the system. I stood for election to the Seanad and I understand the system upside down and inside out. I do not agree with him that people in the House would not understand it. Anyone running for the House would do so. It is a mega election to run for and a mega pleasure to win a seat. It is an honour to be here, and I cannot identify with what Senator Dardis said about it being so complicated that people in the House cannot understand it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not identify with what Senator Dardis said. I found it straightforward once I knew what it was about. I also disagree with his view on emigrants. He said that, because of what Mr. Donlon said, he would re-examine the issue. Why on earth, just because a previous ambassador to the United States said it is not that easy, would one revise one&rsquo;s opinion on emigrants voting in Senate elections? I found that amazing. All that is required is a political initiative rather than a bureaucratic, departmental one. If politicians agree the rules should be changed, emigrants should vote in the Seanad election. It is not for him to decide that it cannot be done from an administrative point of view. I found his contribution very naive.</P>
    <P>I am very thankful to Senator Kitt for sharing time. No Progressive Democrats Senator made a written submission. I find that amazing too. Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley made a submission, but no Progressive Democrats Senator made a written submission for the report. Senator McHugh was the only Fine Gael Senator to make one, though his party made a submission. If people could make the effort, it would be worth doing. We were all rushing at the time, and it was a burden to do it, but it is important.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1498"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I might clarify that. The submission made by the Fine Gael Party was in the name of all parliamentary party colleagues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>In my party, we were asked to make individual submissions too. It would show more interest if individual submissions were made by Members. As I have said before to the Senator, I do not think that being in the Seanad is playing second fiddle to the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I made no such suggestion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will comment on what I have been listening to and put the matter to bed. I am glad the sub-committee picked up on emigrants and said the Taoiseach, when selecting his nominees for the Seanad, should include people who can represent the interests and perspective of both emigrants and immigrants. The sub-committee acknowledged that emigrants should have a role here. That is fundamentally important, and one could spend an hour discussing it.</P>
    <P>Though I have not been asked to do so, I am speaking on behalf of Dr. Yvonne Galligan of the Centre for Advancement of Women in Politics. I got to know her as an undergraduate in UCD, where we both did a degree in economics and politics at night class. She went on to get a doctorate in politics and is a mega lady. The D&aacute;il and the Seanad have some of the lowest levels in Europe for women&rsquo;s participation in parliament. It has been shown that in any country where more women are represented in parliament, a broader range of issues comes through in legislation. It has been proven that women see things differently. Child care is a significant issue to me, and it is not really figuring in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>We should have social and political engineering through temporary positive discrimination quotas to get more women into the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, though we are here to talk about the latter. The next time the Taoiseach makes his nominations, I will speak to him about half of them being women. I said at a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party that the Dublin committee looking after the local elections was a seven-man one. Seven men were considering the candidates for Dublin. That is sick; half the population is female, and women are in the workforce. We must all become more aware, and more women must be put on the committees. I will not hold up matters any longer. I hope I have got the point across that I would like to see more women here. In any country where more women are represented, after social engineering has taken place, there is better legislation, since we have a different perspective on matters, as I am sure the Minister would agree. We naturally have a different outlook. It would be all the better if there were more women in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Kitt for facilitating me in attending the other meeting before 4 o&rsquo;clock.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1499"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I compliment the committee which drew up this report, which consisted of the Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, and Senators Brian Hayes, Dardis and O&rsquo;Toole, as well as Senator Ryan for a period. Their starting point regarding the involvement of the public was very important. That formed the basis of many of their recommendations. There is a certain cynicism about the Seanad, but at the same time the point was made very clearly that very few people wished to abolish it, and even those who did want that, including the Progressive Democrats, seem to have changed their mind. I welcome that and hope we can work together to improve things.</P>
    <P>Much of the report discussed how we would choose Senators and the changes to the functions of the Seanad. There are many references to the role of the European Union in the report, which I welcome. In this Seanad we have provided opportunities for debate on the European Union. Many of our MEPs have been here. Deputy John Bruton has been at the Presidium talking about the constitutional treaty. In particular, the debate we had with Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neachtain MEP on the status of Irish led to a great deal of debate throughout the country and, I hope, throughout Europe.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Perhaps there should be a different composition in the Seanad relative to the D&aacute;il. The public is not involved in our electoral processes. At the same time one does not want conflict between the Seanad and the D&aacute;il. That is addressed in the report. We can talk about EU and North-South bodies and the scrutiny of public appointments, which is important, but if there is to be conflict, we will get into difficulty. Perhaps that is why former President &Eacute;amon de Valera had difficulties with the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Many derogatory remarks have been made about the Seanad over the years. I remember someone once saying that when the D&aacute;il had a day off the second-hand cutlery and crockery were taken out in the restaurant. I hope we have moved beyond that and that the Seanad is being given the respect it deserves. There is also an issue as regards the nomination bodies. I understand, from reading the report and from what the Leader has said that the county councils would be the nominators. Certainly in the past there have been problems and one would have to question the relevance of some of the nominating bodies in a modern Ireland. Also, it is quite clear that a person may get a number of nominations on panels, thereby excluding others. That is wrong. It would be interesting to discuss who will nominate prospective Senators. Many of the issues involved are out of date and need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The question of the universities is important. We all value the great contributions made here by our colleagues from the NUI and Trinity College Dublin panels. It is a fact, however, that there are many other people with third level qualifications who should be entitled to a vote. Considering that <Col N="1500"/>we voted on this back in 1979, it is amazing that we have not moved on it. The Seanad would be much more representative if that issue was resolved, once and for all.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to emigrant representation in the Seanad. Again, different views have been expressed on this in the debate. I happen to have been a spokesman, ten years ago, on issues relating to emigration. There was a strong lobby at the time to have votes for emigrants. I recall that when Deputy Howlin, as Minister for the Environment, tried to resolve that he met with difficulty. There was the whole issue of the secrecy of the ballot to be considered and the problems of getting votes from as far away as Australia for an election in Ireland. Further problems were identified as to how this might be done quickly in the event of a sudden general election. The consensus at the time was that the Seanad could be the appropriate place for emigrant representation. Again, some difficulty has arisen in this area and some people believe it would be better if it were resolved through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nomination. Perhaps that is the way to go.</P>
    <P>The report deals with other countries and what they do. There are bad situations in some countries, where people are made senators for life.</P>

	<P>In Spain, there is a dual process, which looks more democratic. It is interesting for us to look at what is done in other jurisdictions which operate a bicameral system. This is an issue that arises regularly as regards emigrants&rsquo; votes and representation and how they should be dealt with. I agree with the report&rsquo;s recommendation on inviting MEPs to speak on particular matters. We have done this in the past regarding the work of Irish MEPs. The right of a former Taoiseach or T&aacute;naiste to come before the House as well is also important. I welcome also the recommendation that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad would be deemed to be re-elected as well as the recognition of the Leader of the House at the Cabinet table or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the next Cabinet that is chosen. Involvement of the public is important as regards directly elected Senators. The committee has tried to get the balance right between those who are elected directly and indirectly, when compared to the situation in other countries. The role of the Seanad is very much recognised in the report. Perhaps members of the public wonder what is our role, how we are elected and why they do not have a greater role in the electoral process. I would like to again thank the committee and welcome the receipt of 161 written submissions. This shows a high level of interest in this House. I hope we have a rolling debate on this and come <Col N="1501"/>to discuss the many further issues that will arise from it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, and thank the Leader and her committee for the tremendous work they have done in compiling this report. I would like to take up Senator White&rsquo;s point about the number of Senators who made submissions. Senators may not have made submissions in the knowledge they would have the opportunity to speak when the report came before the House and to avoid prolonging the committee&rsquo;s work.</P>
    <P>I often wonder how the Seanad was set up, when one thinks back to the 1930s or whenever. As Senator Dardis said, ours is probably the most complicated system in the world. One wonders how people ever thought of putting all those panels and sub-panels together and devised the system for the counting of votes. Then there was the educational end of it involving the graduates of Trinity College and the NUI, as well as the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees. It must have taken an enormous effort and considerable time to reach agreement, unless there was one brainy strong-willed person that commandeered the whole system and put it all together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There was. His name was &Eacute;amon de Valera.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a complicated system from start to finish. It is not that bad either because it brings a broad range of views before this House from many different backgrounds &mdash; from farmers to educationalists to fishermen etc. Anybody can be a Member of this House or nearly any group may have a representative. I would like to touch on Senator Dardis&rsquo;s point about connecting with the people. We have local government, two Houses of Parliament, a Seanad and a D&aacute;il, and elections to the European Parliament. If one asks the vast majority of the public about any one of those, few understand what goes on in any chamber, whether it is a town or county council, the Seanad, D&aacute;il or the European Parliament. Councillors probably feel they have the most sophisticated electorate, but we have the most educated electorate involved in the selection of Members of this House. The brains of the country elect three members, the three Trinity graduates. If one were to ask 90% of the people who elect the three Trinity graduates here what goes on in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, they would not know. By putting in five or six more Senators and giving various other groups representation, will the Seanad connect better with the public? In my view, it will not. It is all about education. This matter will have to be brought back to the classroom. One must bring the teachers into the Seanad and give them crash courses on what happens in the Seanad, the D&aacute;il, the European Parliament and town and county <Col N="1502"/>council chambers. They will bring it back to the classroom. This may need to be introduced into the curriculum. When I was in first or second year at secondary school the teacher asked the civics class what was a specimen ballot paper. I was the only one who could answer because I had been marking them for my father at an election shortly before that.</P>
    <P>In Canada there is a system for educating teachers about their parliaments. They are brought in for two or three days at a time and learn how Bills pass through the houses, their different stages, and how they progress from one house to the other. We should consider educating our educators in the same way. Most teachers or lecturers have no idea how a Bill goes through either the D&aacute;il or the Seanad. People who visit these Houses on deputations or watching briefs are amazed at what happens and are often delighted they have come in and observed the progress of a Bill, regardless of how they lobbied on it. That is a very educational process and is the way we should move to bring our Parliament closer to the people. They should know what happens here and how it happens.</P>
    <P>We will not bring our Parliament and local authorities closer to the people by bringing in more Members or representation from other interested groups. Any group can be represented here. Looking back at how I got in here I realise that if any of us can get here, anyone else who puts his or her mind to it can get in here too. Going through the process of local government and national parliament and coming in here is a learning curve. It is a university in its own right. There is much to learn locally and nationally on politics and legislation. We must educate our educators if we are to bring Parliament closer to the people so that we can connect with them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>A member of one of the Orange societies in the North said to me a couple of months ago that he likes to turn on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; as a cure for insomnia. One can take that any way one wishes but he also expressed a preference for the Seanad. Whether it puts him to sleep quicker than the D&aacute;il, I am not quite sure. It is interesting that we are holding this debate on a day when we have passed a Standing Order which puts flesh on an existing latent function and one that may develop further and be used for the first time in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Every country with a population over 1 million people should have a second chamber. Having legislation in particular discussed in two different chambers is a safeguard against something slipping through that should not. We need checks and balances <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the Executive. I support the retention of this Chamber and would always have done so, not simply since becoming a Member. I also agree with the premise that this is not a matter of increasing the powers of the Seanad but about increasing its influence and input. The role of the Seanad is primarily to persuade and influence rather than to engage in conflict and <Col N="1503"/>confrontation with the other Chamber, as can happen, particularly in federal states. Tony Blair finds this to be the case in Britain but the British electoral system creates such untrammelled power for the government that some checking mechanism, even an unsatisfactory one, is perhaps needed.</P>
    <P>There is one point not covered in any way in the report but prompted by my mention of Britain. I would not like this Chamber, particularly through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominations, ever to become a place where people could buy seats in Parliament as happened 200 years ago. It happens across the water; if one pays a sufficient amount to either of the main parties one can be nominated for public service. I would not wish to see this Chamber being used as a business card or flag of convenience. I notice with some interest a former colleague who has made the transition from here to the House of Lords. He sat on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches and is a fine industrialist who provides a great deal of employment in the North of Ireland. Now he is to sit with the Unionists.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Senator call that being kicked upstairs?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I might have some difficulty following the consistency of political philosophy but there may be a very considerable consistency of business philosophy.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding I wish to congratulate and compliment the authors of the report on a fine, comprehensive survey. The chapter on functions is a very important part of the report and in broad principle I agree with all the recommendations there but if they were implemented in full we would be biting off a large amount at one go. That side of the report should be implemented and gradually absorbed by stages rather than at one fell swoop. Checking or vetting, whether by sub-committee or the full House, of important public appointments will take a long time. We have taken some steps in the direction of contact with Europe by concentrating rather more than is possible for the other House on European issues. It is unrealistic to think we would always, or even that often, be able to second guess at a glance what specialist civil servants have been working on for months, if not years, in regard to particular areas. On the whole, we have to stick to the broader political issues or measures of particular interest to the public at various times. We must be realistic about what we can do.</P>
    <P>The third point which was referred to by the Leader relates to lobby groups coming to the House to give us their views at a formative stage of legislation, perhaps when no more than the heads of a Bill are prepared. I have no difficulty with that, but the way it was put is that the House would then send a recommendation to Government as to whether to proceed with legislation. Being practical about it, that could put the Government party in a bit of difficulty if the <Col N="1504"/>Government, having considered these representations, decided it would proceed with the Bill. It would be best to formulate it in terms of passing on concerns to be taken into consideration, but in a general way, not necessarily taking a hard and fast position before the Government&rsquo;s mind on the matter is fully known. I appreciate the perspective of the Opposition; that would not be a problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I was in favour of it too.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three areas I wish to cover regarding composition. I agree with the recommendation that the university seats be kept. It might be hard to defend in principle, but one is defending it in practice. There is no doubt the university Senators, to this day, make a fine contribution to our deliberations. I accept the Seanad should have been reformed long ago, given the way we voted in 1979.</P>
    <P>My sister&rsquo;s godfather was a Member of this House for 25 years, former Senator W.B. Stanford, and was subsequently chancellor of Trinity College. There is no doubt the House served a function in terms of minority representation at a time when cultural divisions and historical difficulties were much greater than they are now. The Seanad was preceded by the Free State Seanad, which was even more generous, but the problem is it then got into serious conflict with the D&aacute;il and the elected Government. One of these days I must read Donal O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s book on the Free State Seanad. I am sure I will find it full of interest. As far as minority representation is concerned today, there is no reason why anyone should not seek it, either through the continuation of the six university seats or in any parties that have, or have had, minority representatives, not only from the Christian religion, in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have to express some disappointment with the proposal regarding Northern representation. The only justification for increasing the number of seats from 60 to 65 is so we can have five Northern representatives. The discussions between the Taoiseach, the Government and the Northern parties were on that basis in 1998. Although it was not part of the Good Friday Agreement, it is something that would perhaps be properly moved on as an act of completion on our part paralleling a lot of other acts of completion. It is not something I would necessarily have sought to fast forward. We have had, and still have today, some Northern representation in the Seanad. We have had that on and off since the late 1940s and fairly consistently since the early 1980s. If one were to have only two representatives who would be in any sense representative these days, one would come from Sinn F&eacute;in and one would come from a representative of the Unionist community. The reality is that there are four main parties in Northern Ireland, not two, if one is to have the <Col N="1505"/>spread of representation that is needed. However, we also need the type of non-party voice provided by Senator Maurice Hayes. There is a non-party, cross-party or middle ground element that may not add up to more than about 10% of the voting public in Northern Ireland but, nonetheless, it is valuable and was extremely valuable at the time of the Good Friday Agreement talks. If we are to have a constitutional referendum on Northern representation I fear the Northern parties would feel themselves sold a bit short with only two seats. I feel we need to have five. That would perhaps have consequential adjustments which I have not looked into and would have difficulty going into.</P>
    <P>I support the notion of former Taoisigh and T&aacute;naist&iacute; having speaking rights here, but I would limit it to that. I would not go overboard in the way Senator Bannon suggested, as that would upset the balance.</P>
    <P>I now come to what many people might consider the main issue, namely the electoral composition. I suppose it is inevitable, and this has been reflected in the debate, if one has come through a particular system however arcane or complicated one acquires a certain vested interest in it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>One will defend it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have to declare an interest; it is obvious. The only point I would make about the system, and I would not necessarily die in the ditches for the existing system, is it has some merits that should be recognised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It has a certain integrity of principle in that 43 Members are elected by the people whom the people elect. The French have the exact same system of Senators being elected by councillors and representatives of municipal authorities, although the electorate is much larger numerically. It also provides a genuine democratic election to the extent that very few people are guaranteed election.</P>
    <P>It is a toughly fought election and there is no such thing as a safe seat, although some people manage their affairs so well they make it look as if they are safe, but we know that is not the reality. There is genuine excitement and uncertainty involved in the process. Counting 987 votes takes three times as long as counting 60,000 votes in a constituency.</P>
    <P>The nominating bodies provide an input by various groups but I accept this should have been updated. That said, I have an open mind. On a personal level, I am prepared to take my chances with whatever electoral system other people in their wisdom may decide upon, whether in regard to this House or if opportunity offers, elsewhere.</P><Col N="1506"/>
    <P>I would not overly knock the existing system which has served us well. I have reservations about a list system and how much it would add to legitimacy. One has to ask who will compose the list and if there will be any democratic input into that. These are matters for further debate and consideration.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about mid-term elections. These are not always the best of news for Governments, regardless of who holds power at a particular time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator preparing himself for something?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>In a tight situation, it could arise that the majority in the House might change. However, we lived through the 1994 to 1997 period without any constitutional crisis arising. At that stage, there was a rainbow Government in power but Fianna F&aacute;il held a majority in the Seanad. That is a great tribute to the good sense of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I wish those who will be carrying Seanad reform forward all the best. I am sure they will take into consideration the views expressed on all sides of the House and not treat the report as holy writ but as an agenda. I hope they will make some progress immediately on the matters on which it will be easier to make such progress.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for being patient enough to remain here for the entire debate. I was not present during his contribution but I listened in on the monitor. I am sure he pleased every Member of the House when he stated that the Seanad is valued as a vital component of our system. That is good to know, particularly when it is said by someone on the Government side.</P>
    <P>I compliment everybody associated with the report. It is very well laid out and easy to follow. I appreciate that a great deal of work was invested in this report at a time when people could have been doing other things. The sub-committee dealt with many submissions and held a large number of meetings. I commend the Leader, the Deputy Leader, Senator Brian Hayes, Senator O&rsquo;Toole and even the Member who resigned for reasons outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made by the Leas-Chathaoirleach. Like Senator Mansergh, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I must declare an interest because we were elected twice on panels. We will not be making the final decision on this matter and we will be obliged to accept what will be decided in due course. For that reason, the report is somewhat like the proverbial curate&rsquo;s egg, namely, it is good in parts. However, it contains some excellent elements and I liked what Senator Mansergh had to say about rolling renewal. I would also have reservations about such renewal but we could have rolling progress as well. Progress could be made on matters that could be dealt with in the immediate or near <Col N="1507"/>future. There are some wonderful recommendations in that regard. However, I am not sure that a system of rolling renewal would suit people in this country or whether it would be apt to have a mid-term elections system.</P>
    <P>It has been noted that there were 11 previous reports on Seanad reform. I did not have the opportunity to read any of these but perhaps they also contained some good recommendations. Everyone agrees that this House is less partisan than the Lower House and it is also often more objective in its outlook.</P>
    <P>There is almost an element of concern coming through in the report in respect of legitimacy. I would not worry about that at all. The Seanad is constitutionally provided for and I do not believe anyone should be concerned in that regard. As Senator Paddy Burke stated, it does not matter what type of election is taking place because there is huge apathy abroad. That is something all politicians are trying to counter but it is not easy. Unfortunately, people are largely not interested in knowing about the make-up of the D&aacute;il or Seanad. I am not sure whether this should be a primary concern. I accept that some Members would be more concerned than others about it and we would all like people to take more of an interest in our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>In <i>Constitutional Law of Ireland</i>, Michael Forde states:</P>
    <P LI="1">In his account of the Senate, Professor Chubb observed that</P>
    <P LI="2">Seanad &Eacute;ireann is both singular in its composition and circumscribed in its powers. In considering a new senate, De Valera was attracted by one of the proposals of a commission set up to advise on the composition of a new house, a proposal for a body selected on a vocational basis and obviously inspired by the principles enunciated in the encyclical Quadragesimo Anno of Pius Xl. However, he recognised that the country was not sufficiently organised on vocational lines to allow direct choice by vocational bodies, and he was also concerned not to have a body that would be likely to oppose the government of the day.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In that sense, the 43 Senators elected on the panel system may be termed &ldquo;quasi-vocational&rdquo; Members. However, I do not believe that anyone would set out to have a senate or second Chamber that would run into conflict with the Government of the day. That would not be the intention. I may be wrong but there appears to be a slight conflict in the report in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the executive summary, under the heading &ldquo;Defining the Problem&rdquo;, it is stated that the Seanad is seen as having no distinctive role. The report also states: &ldquo;These difficulties are compounded by the fact that the Seanad is dominated by the Government.&rdquo; Under the heading &ldquo;Reform of Existing Powers and Functions&rdquo;, the report states: &ldquo;Either explicitly or <Col N="1508"/>implicitly, virtually all submissions accepted that a revised role for the Seanad should not bring it into conflict with the government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Being dominated by the Government is part of our democratic system. The people elect the Government and, particularly in the Lower House, it must dominate. There is also an in-built Government majority in this House and I do not believe this should be a matter of concern. I may be misinterpreting what is stated in the report &mdash; I have only read it once &mdash; and it may not have been intended in that way. However, it appeared to me that there was a conflict in terms of what the sub-committee stated in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are some good recommendations in the report. I do not want to labour the point further but I accept what was said by many speakers. What was voted on in 1979 is worthy and it could be implemented without any further constitutional changes. In my view it is correct that the university franchise should be broadened. Everyone would welcome such a move. It is also recommended that MEPs should have a voice in this House, which would be relatively easy to provide. The report also refers to enhancing the role of the House in respect of reviewing EU affairs, a recommendation that would also be relatively easy to implement, and in terms of consultation with the social partners. These are meritorious and worthy suggestions and could be implemented without the need for constitutional change.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that is near and dear to my heart and to those of many other Members because we all must engage, to a greater or lesser degree, in constituency work. I thought this might be part of the supplementary recommendations.</P>
    <P>I agree with the supplementary recommendation that the Clerk of the Seanad should be on the Oireachtas commission. I thought there might also be a recommendation regarding a facility for Senators to seek written answers to questions. We can write to Ministers, who are courteous about responding, but a system of written questions and answers would be a great facility. This is something that would be dear to many Members&rsquo; hearts, particularly if approved without obstacle and taken on board.</P>
    <P>I return to the main point made regarding the quasi-vocational nature of this House as defined and accepted in the Constitution. The report would say that. I believe the county council is an ideal electoral college. There will be no apathy in its case as all the councillors will vote. In support of county councillors, they represent, on average, at least 1,000 voters. As Senator Mansergh just said, there is something inherently democratic about that. It is an ideal indirect method of voting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I confessed at the outset that my notes were somewhat disorganised. I did not realise I would get the opportunity to speak on this matter today. However, I am delighted to do so. I agree with what Senator Mansergh said about the North. We realise there are four separate and distinct main parties there. The Senator means well with his proposal for two Senators from the North. As we know there is great value in having an independent voice in the House of a person such as Senator Maurice Hayes who has been excellent.</P>
    <P>I too would have reservations about the list system and the potentially anti-democratic measure inherent therein. One would worry about the integrity of the system and those compiling the lists. Presumably, the lists would be drawn up at individual party headquarters and we would not have the widest possible input into them. For that reason, I agree with Senator Paddy Burke and Senator Mansergh that there is merit in our current system which I would be slow to change.</P>
    <P>The report has some good points and makes some excellent recommendations, a few of which I have mentioned. There are many more such as the suggestion regarding former taoisigh and t&aacute;naist&iacute; with which I would not disagree. The main recommendations appear to be to change the numbers and the method of election. The debate will go on. It is good that we have this report and that further debate will follow. This will not end today.</P>
    <P>Another great service provided by the report is the inclusion in its appendices of the descriptions of other second chambers and the method by which their members are elected. I have no particular interest in the Canadian or Australian chambers as they are so far from us, but found the descriptions of the European chambers very interesting. We would all agree the British have a major problem with their second chamber.</P>
    <P>This report provides a valuable service. I welcome it and the debate thereon. I thank the Minister of State for his attendance and his attention. He has been good to us.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1510"/>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the Minister of State. This has been an interesting debate on what is an important topic for Senators. The report produced by the sub-committee is the result of six to seven months of hard, dedicated work. This is evident in today&rsquo;s debate and debate outside of the Chamber. I congratulate the members of the sub-committee and its secretariat which provided great support. The result of this process will be a credit to Members because it will continue long after present Members have moved on. In that sense it will be an effective testament.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said, any reform of the Seanad must be realistic and achievable. The balance reached in this report will lead to that achievement. The strength of the report is that it chose, in a clear and understandable way, the way forward. I would like to concentrate on some of the recommendations for &ldquo;the way forward&rdquo; as it is termed.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have expressed reservations about the part of the report dealing with renewal on a rolling basis. If, for example, as has happened in the past, we have one or two general elections within the space of six months, what will be the position regarding renewal of members? Our current utopia cannot continue forever and it is possible we will have a number of elections in a short period. What effect will this have on the functioning and consistency of the Seanad? This is something we must consider. We can build the rolling renewal into the current system; it is a reasonable suggestion.</P>
    <P>We should not, as the Leader said, be afraid of direct elections. We are currently in the throes of local elections. When people put themselves before the people seeking the vote of electors, that is probably the most difficult part of the process. However, they should not be afraid of the process and we should not be afraid of direct elections. Questions regarding proportionality and how divisions will be made are a matter for future debate. I am a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee but I have often heard Senators comment on how arduous it can be to canvass councillors throughout the length and breadth of the country. This is common.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is great fun too.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all been involved with direct elections in some form, whether general, local or European. Our system lends itself to that involvement and this House would benefit from more direct elections. I would have some concerns about their costs and about the proposed list system which could have drawbacks in the manner in which it is compiled. These matters can be debated in the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding third level representatives, I have always thought that all third level institutions should be represented in that election. The six Members who will be elected by all graduates will ensure good representation of that sector and such a means of representation has proven <Col N="1511"/>successful in the past. We have a number of successful representatives from third level institutes.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, it is important to ensure that in practice the Government of the day will have a majority in the Seanad, which will enable it to get the legislative programme through the House. That this system of nominees also enables exceptional people to become Members of the Seanad is a bonus. The former Senator, the late Gordon Wilson, Senator Maurice Hayes and others have contributed greatly to the work of this House. The sub-committee states in the report that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the current system. It is proposed to increase of Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees to 12 to provide for a second representative from Northern Ireland. Senator Mansergh made the point that the number could be increased even further. With the Good Friday Agreement in place, the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland, cross-Border bodies up and running and even North-South and east-west bodies up and running, there is scope in that regard. However, we must be sensitive and careful how we tread. My concern is that if an offer was made to a person of either tradition in the North and it was refused, that could be not only dangerous but damaging. The point was made that the implementation of these recommendations must be pursued. The Minister of State pointed out that the Government is committed to pursuing them. That is something we can only support in this House.</P>
    <P>There was much talk about emigrants&rsquo; representation. I have often heard an argument against such representation on the basis of whether a person who has lived abroad for 35 to 40 years is in any way contributing to the country. Such emigrants have children and grandchildren. Particularly in the case of emigrants who live in the United States, a great effort is made by many of them to return home, even if only for a holiday, and that is a contribution to this economy. Many emigrants have returned to live here in recent years. As stated in the report, these people contribute daily to our economic progress in all fields. The suggestion that the Taoiseach, in his nominations, has scope to take account of emigrants&rsquo; representation is valid. It would be a logistical nightmare to give emigrants a vote. As Mr. Dorr pointed out, some 80 million people around the world have some connection with this country. Irish Embassies even find it difficult to register Irish citizens abroad. There are questions in this area which we can examine.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion that former Taoisigh and T&aacute;naist&iacute; should be allowed to address this House. A number of interesting people have addressed this Seanad, from which all Members have benefited. Use of that provision could be expanded.</P>
    <P>I can foresee problems arising regarding the ability of graduates and indirect electors such as <Col N="1512"/>councillors to opt for their own list. How will we police and control that system? Our population is going to expand and there may be problems with that proposal.</P>
    <P>As the report states, we cannot veto legislation or amend it without the agreement of the Lower House. While there is an opportunity for the Seanad to become, as the report states, more powerful, it is probably more appropriate for it to become more involved. There are ways we can become more involved in the end result of the process we go through in this House in passing legislation. The sub-committee recognises the primacy of the Lower House and I agree it should be maintained.</P>
    <P>I attended a few of the public submissions on Seanad reform, when members of the public were invited to give their views. The report states that many of these groups and individuals valued being asked for their opinion. That point is crucial. The suggestion there should be some public input into the daily or weekly running of the Seanad is excellent. The suggestion that there should be more access for the public to have a voice is one that will benefit not only the public but also the Seanad in the sense that we have often complained about the lack of media coverage of the proceedings of this Chamber. If a certain time is set aside, as suggested, in the business of the Seanad each week for an element of public consultation or input, that would attract media coverage and enhance the standing of this House. A formal system of consultation could be put in place early in the legislative process.</P>
    <P>Since becoming a Member of the Seanad as a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee, I have been surprised that councillors do not take full advantage of the Seanad, particularly as a conduit for information. We have the facility to debate matters on the Adjournment, but it is not used to the full extent possible. Certain Senators will raise issues, the Minister responsible will reply and the Senator will be given a copy of the reply, which he or she can use in a circular, magazine article or in a local radio programme. That facility seems to be totally underutilised. It could be expanded as a mechanism to facilitate an element of the public consultation whereby if an issue arose or information was required, it could be used to provide such information.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposed role of the House in EU affairs, I agree we should have a greater input in that regard. However, I caution against becoming bogged down in scrutinising the minutiae of legislation and directives. I have read some of the work of the sub-committee on EU scrutiny and it is hard work to check that every full stop and comma are inserted in legislation. I agree the Seanad should only be involved in scrutinising EU legislation or proposed legislation or directives on matters of national importance.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal that MEPs should attend this House and address it. The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, MEP, made a good contribution when he addressed this <Col N="1513"/>House recently. Other MEPs also addressed it, which proved a useful exercise, particularly in the run-up to the European elections. Apart from election time, there is a contribution to be made by MEPs, because they are in a sense disconnected from us in that once they are elected they are based in Europe. People might see them once or twice a year after that, but in the meantime they are working all the time. It is similar to Members of this House. We are here two or three days a week and when we leave people believe we have nothing else to do. This proposal will provide an opportunity for MEPs to become more connected with us on a more regular basis. I used to get a regular update in the post from Niall Andrews about everything that had happened in Europe in the previous six months.</P>

    <P>The report recommends that the House should be involved in a review of public policy and have an input in assessing the performance of Departments. I caution against overlapping with the work of other institutions, such as the office of the Ombudsman, which are involved in scrutinising Departments. We should have some input in certain areas. The suggestion that was made about public appointments, in particular, is an excellent one. We have often heard people asking who certain appointees are, where they came from or how they were chosen. I congratulate the sub-committee.</P>

    <P>The contributions of the Senators who spoke were most interesting. We sat here for two and a half hours but it seemed like just half an hour, which is a testimony to the speeches we heard. I look forward to hearing further contributions from other Senators at a later date.</P>

    <P LI="1" FLI="0">welcomes the Government&rsquo;s plan to decentralise 10,300 Public Service jobs to 53 centres in 25 counties outside of Dublin and invites the Minister for Finance to submit a report to the House on the plan&rsquo;s progress and its future implementation.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. I am sure many Senators were glad to hear the Minister for Finance announce the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation plans in his Budget Statement. The announcement was universally welcomed, particularly in those places to which the public service will be decentralised.</P>
    <P>Some officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will be decentralised to Athy, in my home county of Kildare. If one examines the experience of Athy, one will see a good example of the benefits that decentralisation can bring to towns and regions throughout the country. When I was growing up, Athy was the premier business town of County Kildare. Many people from the central areas of the county went to Athy to do their business, for example, to buy household requisites and agricultural supplies. It was a hub of economic activity. Those days are long gone, however, due to the decline experienced in Athy during the 1970s and 1980s. We welcomed the construction of large public authority housing estates, as such houses were needed, but the job prospects of those living in such estates were poor. Athy suffered because businesses did not thrive or develop there. The town became a shadow of what it was when I was growing up in County Kildare.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the decentralisation of jobs in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to Athy was greeted with acclaim by the town council and the people of Athy. That was also the case in Newbridge, where it is proposed to relocate part of the Department of Defence, and in the Curragh, where it is proposed to relocate the Army&rsquo;s headquarters. The benefits of decentralisation are such that there are no dissenting voices in the county, or indeed throughout the country. The Government stated that it planned to review progress at some stage. I am conscious that Senators on all sides of the House have called for a debate on decentralisation in recent weeks. The motion before the House has been proposed in that context.</P>
    <P>I have to ask the Opposition a fundamental question, which applies to Fine Gael in particular. <Col N="1515"/>Does it agree with decentralisation as a principle? Its carping and sniping about the proposal is such that one has to question its commitment to the principle of decentralisation. It is important that we be given an answer to that question. Are the Opposition parties, particularly Fine Gael, committed to the principle of decentralisation? If not, why are they not committed to it?</P>
    <P>Regardless of the benefits of decentralisation to regions and communities throughout the country, the relocation of public sector jobs has significant potential benefits for Dublin. Driving into Dublin each morning is such a problematic exercise that one would almost be inclined to leave the night before. I exceeded my personal record for a 30 mile journey during the week when it took me two hours and 20 minutes to drive to Leinster House. Many public servants welcome the opportunity to relocate to other areas because they find it difficult to travel to Dublin because of traffic congestion. They are dissatisfied with the lifestyle in this city.</P>
    <P>One can understand that some of those who are settled in urban communities, many of whom work at senior levels of the public service and have given many years of service, are reluctant to move. A reluctance to change is a common human characteristic, especially as one gets older. It can become more dominant as one becomes more senior. There are significant potential benefits for such people, however. Many people in the lower levels of the public service are prepared to move to places where housing costs much less, where it is much easier to get access to quality education and where the entire lifestyle is better. Senior people with a residue of capital in the property they bought many years ago might consider it beneficial to transfer from Dublin to a town or city where housing costs are less. If they benefit from the difference between the price of a house in Dublin and the price of a similar house elsewhere, they may build up a nest egg to put in their pockets.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that there is no question of coercion in this regard. There are obvious career opportunities and promotion and advancement possibilities in the public service. Nobody is coercing anybody to move. The Government intends to decentralise 10,300 public servants, which is a small proportion of the total of 300,000. I would be surprised if it could not find 10,300 people who are willing to move. I am aware that Mr. Philip Flynn, the chairman of the implementation body, is dealing with these matters. I am sure the industrial relations and other issues that arise will be dealt with to the satisfaction of people who might be affected by change. One can readily appreciate the reluctance of many people to go and I am sure those who do not want to will not be forced to go, which is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Mobility of labour and personnel is a common feature of the modern era to the extent that aeroplanes travelling across the Atlantic Ocean <Col N="1516"/>or even beyond the nearest jurisdiction, Great Britain, to the continent are frequently filled with executives of multinational companies who travel back and forth to work, often having no discretion in the matter. If one started a job with, for example, one of the banks, although that may be an unfortunate example at present, historically one did not have much discretion as to where one was sent and the fact that one might be transferred several times in one&rsquo;s career was taken for granted.</P>
    <P>There is a reluctance inherent in the public service to enduring such changes but we have come to a point in modern society at which there is huge mobility and people are moving not just within countries but between them and across continents at the behest of their employers in the private sector. On the other hand, decentralisation is voluntary.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that decentralisation will affect the integrity and impartiality of the public service, which displays a very limited degree of confidence in the public service, its traditions, the fact that it has served the State so well over such a long period and that public servants are committed to the service of the State and the communities. That ethos does not rely on offices being located in Dublin, rather it is evident no matter where such people are located. The culture is not about buildings or addresses but the way in which people work, the values they share and the implementation of the judgment calls they make, none of which will be undermined by decentralisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton seems to have some reservations about decentralisation in his article in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>. On the one hand he stated, &ldquo;The private sector of our economy, with the exception of some of the professions, is as efficient as it can be and can be expected to further improve its efficiency by more use of information technology&rdquo;, which bears out the point I made about the private sector. However, Deputy Bruton goes on to state, &ldquo;The real competitive challenge for Ireland will be that of ensuring that Government services become progressively more efficient to enable them to absorb the extra cost&rdquo;, to which I say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo;. This can be done in the context of a decentralisation policy which is well-ordered and thought out and will bring benefits to the regions.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation implementation committee is chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn. Any concerns about industrial relations problems are being handled by individual management bodies. The first report of the decentralisation implementation committee of last March states:</P>
    <P LI="1">We identify the people dimension as being far and away the most important element. We are grateful for the earnestness with which the issues are being addressed and would encourage all concerned to continue to engage meaningfully.</P><Col N="1517"/>
    <P FLI="0">That is indicative of the approach which has been taken by the decentralisation implementation committee.</P>
    <P>In her budget speech to the D&aacute;il on 4 December last, the T&aacute;naiste stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">I believe that people elect politicians to get things done. Our decision to decentralise is right for our country, right in its scale, right in its ambition and right in its results. Decentralisation can only work as a stimulus to the economic development of the regions if it is large scale and not piecemeal. It can only work as Government, leading by example for investors, if it involves major Government offices.</P>
    <P FLI="0">She also spoke about the opportunities the policy will create for public servants and their families, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation will also have the effect of bringing the public service much closer to the people. There is a sense that the offices in Dublin are in some way remote and inaccessible to citizens and that even when one telephones, one feels that a Chinese wall operates. That public servants will become part of communities throughout the country will be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Parlon, is involved in finding premises and offices for the people who will be decentralised and I understand some 700 proposals have been received by the OPW in response to requests for property, which shows a live interest on the part of communities around the country in having public servants locate in their communities permanently. I am sure the Minister of State will report on the property aspect of the programme in respect of sites and so on. It is beneficial that we discuss these issues. I am a decentralisation enthusiast and I look forward to its advancing at a rapid pace.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.</P>
    <P>I fully support the national policy to bring Departments to the regions. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House and wish him well in his role in this development. It is important we facilitate in every way the public service organisations, the civil servants and their families who are moving to the regions from Dublin. We well understand the problems such a move might cause for some families when opportunities for promotion become available down the country. It is important we keep the political momentum for the implementation of decentralisation policies on course to ensure that local housing and amenities policies make the decentralisation programme work to everyone&rsquo;s benefit. We should also encourage the programmes of interaction between councils and decentralised public services so that the learning and information sharing takes place in both directions, which will be welcomed in all the regions.</P><Col N="1518"/>
    <P>It is great to see 10,300 public service jobs coming to the 53 centres in 25 counties outside Dublin. It is a vote of confidence by the Government in rural Ireland and its future. In all local authorities throughout the country, the decentralisation programme has been welcomed. It is above politics. When the national spatial strategy was announced, it was a boost to look forward to Civil Service jobs coming to the regions. I am particularly delighted to see those jobs coming to the mid-west region. I am convinced it will make a better Ireland for all and wish the Government every success in the implementation of this programme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the status of the decentralisation programme for Newcastle-West in an Adjournment debate in the House on 26 May. For many years, I have sought decentralisation to Newcastle West and assisted in the submission. Therefore, I was very pleased to see it coming to fruition at last with a commitment not alone for Newcastle-West but also for Kilrush and Listowel with the provision of 150 jobs in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Along with my rural colleagues and others, I am delighted that decentralisation will now occur.</P>
    <P>The scale of the project announced in the budget on 3 December last surprised many people. In many cases, people did not talk about the budget or make comparisons with other budgets in respect of financial matters because the sheer scale of the decentralisation announcement deflected attention from it so that it became the main focus of interest and discussion. The Minister of State enthusiastically greeted the decentralisation programme in his own county and the banners were out in jig-time welcoming decentralisation to various parts of Counties Laois and Offaly.</P>
    <P>That is the political dimension, but what people want to see now is the sequence for the evolving nature of the decentralisation process around the country. In Newcastle West, where 50 posts are being decentralised to Revenue, there is already a great success story of decentralisation there. Between Nenagh, Limerick and Ennis 900 jobs have been decentralised and the area has been extended further to include Newcastle West, Kilrush and Listowel. Within that mesh of activities there will be certain promotional opportunities. If there is a scale of 50 jobs, that level will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In terms of complete Departments, one may not get the necessary transfer rapidly because reservations will be expressed at senior level within the Department. That is as it should be because in many cases people have put down their roots firmly in the Dublin area. They have access to third level education establishments and the commitments of their children in the education process will often dictate whether they move on or otherwise. In addition, spouses may be working. All those considerations influence <Col N="1519"/>decisions. A factor which must be taken into consideration, as in rural areas, is that if I decide to live in Newcastle West, my extended family is in the area. Naturally, there is a bond between the older members of one&rsquo;s family and people who are working. That should not be forgotten in regard to the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>If expressions of concern are being made by senior people within the Civil Service in regard to moving, we recognise that civil servants, by virtue of their positions, will not be vocal in expressing an opinion which is contrary to Government policy and opinion. Through their unions they have articulated a concern in regard to certain members moving down the country. If decentralisation takes place, and I am an enthusiastic supporter of it, those left behind will have to be absorbed into other organisations. If so, will they lose out on seniority and promotional opportunities or would the evolution be in the country? Where decentralisation has taken place, such as in Ballina, if civil servants want to progress they have a better chance of doing so if they move back to Dublin. If the movement takes place in the other direction, will those in the Dublin area be regarded as not having co-operated with decentralisation and, if so, will they be penalised?</P>
    <P>In regard to the scale of the project, I am not sure if offices are being decentralised to 25 counties. The largesse is being spread on a national basis. When the original decentralisation project for Newcastle West was introduced, Shannon Development stepped in and said it would be much better if it was embraced within the mid-west region, Kilrush and Listowel. At the time I said we would have a better chance of success because not alone is west Limerick being accommodated from a political dimension, but it takes in Clare and north Kerry. That is the reality of politics and that is what happened.</P>
    <P>There is a level of interest about going to Newcastle West which I welcome. I can understand that level of interest given that recently I inquired about a person, not at senior level, in a Department in Dublin who was anxious to transfer to the area and I was informed that the person was very far down the queue. It struck me forcefully that people would willingly move to an area such as Newcastle West.</P>
    <P>When we think of decentralisation we think automatically of Dublin and transferring to rural locations. The Department of Agriculture and Food in Limerick city is placed in an illogical location in regard to community services. If a farmer wants to do business there, it is impossible to get parking. When a Member of the other House, I often advocated that decentralisation should not focus totally on Dublin but should look at Limerick. If people from Limerick city want to transfer west, they should be given that scope. That should happen in regard to such locations.</P><Col N="1520"/>
    <P>I support the project in principle although there are many issues to be teased out. One has to recognise that senior civil servants and Ministers were not aware of the commitment and scale envisaged until they were told about it 48 hours before the budget. There was no consultation despite the fact that trades unions had sought, since 1999, an attitude survey to be carried out by the Minister for Finance on decentralisation. Failure to get that commitment resulted in an element of surprise and shock. Before the process is complete, there will be a long gestation process and many teething problems. There is an acceptance and a willingness throughout rural Ireland to embrace civil servants. When they decide to move, whether to Newcastle West, Kilrush or Listowel, they will find that their quality of life will improve considerably.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the positive tone of Senator Finucane&rsquo;s contribution. Both of us come from the west Munster region where it has been warmly welcomed across the board. I welcome the Minister of State and his officials and compliment the Minister of State on the energy and vigour he is bringing to this task. In two or three years&rsquo; time I look forward to him saying one can pay a visit to the fine town of Trim, along with Trim Castle, the Wellington monument and Butterstream Gardens where we will be able to visit and admire the headquarters of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>This policy of decentralisation is one to which Fianna F&aacute;il has been strongly committed for over 20 years and perhaps even longer. One of the finest examples of decentralisation was in 1964 when the Garda Training College moved to Templemore. The programme has been greeted extremely warmly outside Dublin. I argue that the programme is also in the interests of Dublin. Regardless of where we come from, we want a strong capital of a strong nation. That is not possible if all the development and growth is concentrated in one area which is bursting at the seams and where there are many pressures such as high house prices, congestion and so on while much of the rest of the country is lagging behind. It should be possible to spread development more evenly. Industry tends to concentrate in certain centres There are some exceptions, for example, the village of Dromcollogher in Senator Finucane&rsquo;s constituency which has some significant industry attached to it. In a situation where the Government is accused of breaking promises in its election manifesto, this is one we are keeping.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The only one.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was to go to substantial well-located towns that were not necessarily able to attract industry. That is what happened. One still reads editorials about the national spatial strategy. If one takes all the decentralisation <Col N="1521"/>programmes together &mdash; there were a couple of phases in the early 1990s &mdash; every hub and gateway has decentralised offices. The concept of a hub and gateway is that activity surrounds it and is not just concentrated at the centre. In spite of the contribution by Senator Finucane, there are somewhat mixed signals coming from the Fine Gael Party. I noted Deputy John Bruton&rsquo;s personal contribution on decentralisation in an article in the<i> Irish Independent</i> this morning and I cannot but wryly reflect that one of his great achievements was to bring the European Veterinary College to Grange. I do not know if all the studies he is calling for were conducted in regard to that move. I am even more concerned by the attitude from some sections of the Labour Party although I would immediately exempt Senator O&rsquo;Meara from this. There has been an unfortunate tendency to try to rubbish the programme, presumably in the hope of currying favour with civil servants in Dublin who are not very keen on the idea. That applies only to some members of the party.</P>
    <P>Civil servants do not have a right to challenge the principle of electorally mandated Government policy. Of course, they have the right to make choices and to make clear particular practical difficulties. I am glad we are having this discussion and I must thank our Progressive Democrat colleagues for that. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service there was, as I would have interpreted it, an attempt to start a parliamentary filibuster of the decentralisation process and it was opposed. I am not opposed to regular discussion and progress reports on decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the decentralisation programme had an immediate impact, for example, in Tipperary town. Within a couple of months, before a building was chosen or a civil servant moved, important investments were announced and this has given a significant boost of confidence to the town. I am sure that is replicated in most of the towns around the country and will lead to an improvement in quality of life. I understand the difficulties faced by some civil servants who may have to make difficult career and personal choices. There are many situations where married couples do not work within a hundred yards of each other. People have to adapt to the situation. They may decide, however, not to adapt. I do not see this in terms of electoral stroke politics. Even if this side of the House goes out of Government at the next election, I would be very anxious to see the decentralisation programme being implemented by whatever alternative Government is in power.</P>

	<P>This is for the benefit of the country, which is far more important than the benefit to any party.

It is the consensus among all political parties in the Tipperary area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate on this motion and I look forward to hearing the Minister give a progress report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>To pick up on the point made by Senator Mansergh, I too welcome a progress report as one of our concerns is how the decentralisation programme is progressing. I totally favour the principle of decentralisation which offers major benefits to towns. The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture and Food have located in Nenagh and one can see the clear benefits to the local economy of having a substantial number of public and civil servants located in the town, not only from the point of view of spending power, house buying and so on, but in terms of the confidence it gives to the area and its ability to attract business and infrastructure development. Another positive benefit of decentralisation, in terms of public servants, is the creation of a potential career structure in a regional area. Qualified women who would like to work in the public service, for example the county council, do not have that opportunity because there is no recruitment, but they would be very happy to work in a decentralised Department. If one is promoted for example from the Revenue Commissioners in Nenagh, one is promoted out of the county and one must work in Portlaoise, Limerick or possibly Dublin and a small number find they are commuting to Dublin, possibly on a daily basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to improve the train service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I was about to make that point. An improved train service would help. A proper worked out programme of decentralisation could be excellent for the economic life of towns round the country. When one looks at the reality of this programme, it does not appear to line up with that, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation programme that was so unexpectedly announced at the last budget, has taken everybody by surprise, particularly the public servants. What is certainly emerging as one of the big issues is that people do not want to move. One cannot force people to move. To a certain extent I agree with Senator Mansergh that public servants do not have an absolute right to question the decisions of a democratically elected Government, but at the same time one would hope that in a well ordered and civilised society people should not be forced to move to somewhere they do not want to move to.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what each Department will do if only a percentage of its staff want to move. What will happen to the remainder? Will we have an increase in public service numbers, for example if 200 are due to go to Thurles and <Col N="1523"/>only 100 want to move, will an additional 100 jobs be created locally? Where will the 100 staff members who stayed behind be deployed? Will there be a significant increase in Civil Service numbers in order to create the decentralisation programme successfully but also to ensure that nobody who does not want to move is accommodated? It is very important to ask how will that be resolved in practice.</P>
    <P>That the public service unions are not happy about how the process has been managed is also a very serious matter. The Government is the largest employer in this area. It is essential that there be a process of partnership, proper communication and agreement at that level. Otherwise, the national partnership process effectively means nothing.</P>
    <P>This programme does not line up with the national spatial strategy. In fact, it bears no relation to it. Although I welcome the proposed decentralisation to north Tipperary and to Tipperary in general, County Tipperary&rsquo;s omission from the national spatial strategy was notable. Perhaps the Government might drop the pretence that there is a correlation between the decentralisation programme and the national spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>On the decentralisation policy, I would be more convinced of the Government&rsquo;s motives if that same policy of decentralisation were evident in other areas. In the health service, for example, the policy framework contained in the Hanly report on hospitals is all about centralisation. It is about removing local services and incorporating them into 12 regional centres. This entails the loss of local access to an essential service and forces people to travel long distances to avail of a fundamental facility, namely access to acute and emergency care. On the one hand, therefore, we have the Government extolling the virtues of decentralisation while, on the other, the direct opposite is happening in a way that will cause serious and fundamental problems in communities. That the policy of decentralisation is not mirrored in other areas of Government policy is one of the main reasons I question the Government&rsquo;s motives on the decentralisation programme. With regard to the Department of Education and Science, for example, one can hardly fix a window in a school down the country without this fact being imparted to Marlborough Street. I am aware that the State examination section is based in Athlone but the mindset of centralised decision-making is endemic in that Department, to name just one. The Government does not have a worked-out policy of decentralisation. If it had, we would see this policy implemented in more than one way.</P>
    <P>In this context, the decentralisation programme is merely a cynical vote-gathering exercise. This is a pity because decentralisation, properly managed, would be a good policy, not only in terms of how the economy has developed in Dublin, but also for the purpose of improving the <Col N="1524"/>functionality of local government, as so much of its decision-making is centralised in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and, indeed, with the Minister of that Department. I look forward to the report on this issue and I commend the Progressive Democrats for proposing this motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Dardis and his colleagues for introducing this important matter for debate. The last time I spoke on this matter, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, told me that I had a Dublin mindset, which I thought was teetering on the edge of unparliamentary language although it did not bother me unduly at the time. Dublin is not my constituency; I have no particular axe to grind. I speak on the basis of 50 years of service in the public service. I have enormous regard for the public service in Ireland, both North and South. I have also been interested in planning matters and issues like central place theory.</P>
    <P>The overriding priority in planning in this country is to try to move facilities and businesses out of Dublin to provide the space that would give people a decent standard of living there also. We need to demagnetise Dublin and I have reservations about the fact that the national spatial strategy tried to achieve this end by placing too many counter-magnets about the place, rather than three or four large ones. The solution I propose does not exclude the hub and spoke model Senator Finucane spoke of, but I have difficulties with some of Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s arguments, particularly regarding the health service, which should not be decentralised <i>ad infinitum</i>. There is an important consideration of the critical mass at which activity takes place.</P>
    <P>I support the movement of public service jobs out of Dublin. The Government, as a major employer, can provide a motor for regional and local development in carefully selected locations. There are different sorts of activities in Departments, however. I ran a Department for several years that had offices in 26 towns across Northern Ireland. Major blocks of work, such as accounting, delivery services, data processing, which can be carried out anywhere. When it comes to a Department&rsquo;s policy-making function, however, over-decentralisation becomes difficult. This is based on the experience of how business is done on that level, which involves interaction between people on the edges of meetings, for example, which cannot be replicated by conference calls, memos or information technology, however good. In Northern Ireland, we had an experience of decentralisation that involved a shift of approximately eight miles in the location of the Department of Education to Bangor. The Department became even more introverted than it had been and it was difficult for other Departments to maintain a dialogue with it. When one consider the principles outlined many years ago in the Devlin report of dividing work into aireachta&iacute; and agencies, there is a lot <Col N="1525"/>to be said for decentralising and relocating agencies to the greatest extent possible, while maintaining the overseeing aireachta&iacute; which can be quite small, in as close a continuity as possible. The objective of joined-up Government becomes more difficult when one disperses staff about the place.</P>
    <P>In terms of recruitment, one must consider why so many people leave rural areas. It is because they need the anonymity of the city for a particular period of their lives, to facilitate a rite of passage to adulthood. However, this does not have to be provided in Dublin; other urban centres can perform the same function, so long as they possess the critical mass of which I already spoke. Many of these young people will want to return to their local place when they are older and wish to settle down, and that is fine. A potential danger in the decentralisation process is that if recruitment is undertaken at the local level as well, there tends to be a sameness about people, particularly if, as appears likely, the role of the appointment commissioners changes. It is important to develop safeguards for employment patterns. It may be necessary to appoint civil servants who will want to spend all their working lives in a particular urban centre or area as well as others who are prepared to be more mobile. There is always a danger that the public service will lose potentially top-level people because they have become land-locked at some stage in their careers. I strongly support the principle behind the decentralisation programme but I have serious reservations regarding the strength of the spread and, in particular, the diffusion of top-level departmental staff. It is grossly inefficient to have people spending time, for example in cars travelling, trying to hook up with one another over long distances. I hope that will be examined. However, regarding moving jobs out of Dublin, freeing the city and building up strong and progressive poles of growth around the country, I commend the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. I reassure Senator Dardis that Fine Gael&rsquo;s position on this matter is very clear. We support the principle of decentralisation. However, the Government&rsquo;s handling, or mishandling, of it does not fill us with confidence. The last time the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, spoke on decentralisation in this House, before it was announced, he said that places that had not fared well in the spatial strategy, such as Carlow which was left out, would receive a bonus through being included in the decentralisation process. While I was delighted with that news, some of my colleagues were horrified. They came from towns that had been included in the spatial strategy and they certainly did not feel they should be discriminated against. The T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Minister of State&rsquo;s party took a completely different view on the issue in the D&aacute;il. There have been very contradictory statements from the outset.</P><Col N="1526"/>
    <P>It was wrong to include the announcement in the budget debate, which was done because the budget was so bankrupt of ideas. The announcement regarding the location of the Teagasc headquarters in Carlow was included by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in his budget speech. That later turned out to be a stumbling block for compensation agreements with the unions about relocating. It was then removed from the budget speech. The whole incident was handled very badly. The Teagasc deal was concluded before the budget and was not really part of the decentralisation process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody mentioned it in the budget.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It was included in the speech, which I remember reading. It said that Carlow was to get 350 jobs and that 250 were wanted at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It was a significant issue, and it was on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> a few weeks later. Senator Dardis should be questioning his Government colleagues. It is remarkable that there is currently only one Fianna F&aacute;il Senator in the House willing to speak on the subject.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Three of our Senators have contributed so far. The Fianna F&aacute;il Chairperson of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, Deputy Fleming, first agreed to a debate on the decentralisation process, then rowed back and would not allow a debate on progress though, with all due respect, that would have been a logical step for the committee. Now, suddenly, the Government is willing to debate it, but Fianna F&aacute;il Senators and members seem lukewarm on the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should wait until later when he has heard some of them speak.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am amazed at Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s comment that public servants do not really have the right to question something. In a democracy, everyone has that right. People have a right to be consulted, and the sudden announcement of the decision, without consulting the main players, was a fundamental mistake. I query whether 10,000 civil servants can be moved. Would it not be more realistic to set an initial target of 5,000 and see how that works out? I have spoken to different politicians with far more experience than I who were in Government in the past and who relocated some sections of Departments to different areas. They found it <Col N="1527"/>extremely difficult to achieve the numbers. Though they might only have relocated 200, to make up that total they had to go outside their own Department. They could not fill the places from within. When one is moving 10,000 civil servants, one does not have the luxury of going to other Departments; one will have to find them within one&rsquo;s own Department. It will be extremely difficult, and there will be major issues concerning people who refuse to go. Will they be victimised? Will they get the promotions they deserve? If they move, will they stay?</P>
    <P>I often meet people in Carlow who have moved from Dublin because the idea of a cheaper house and country life appealed to them. However, once they are there, their children might not even settle in the area and they might well move back to Dublin. These are real issues. Of the 250 due to come to Carlow from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, how many will commute to Dublin every day, and how many will build or buy a house in Carlow, send their children to a local school and actively participate in the community? Will they simply look on it as a job and commute? That would negate the full potential benefit of such decentralisation.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis is aware of the furore regarding Magee Barracks in his own neck of the woods, where I understand that 60 acres of State-owned land are available; yet the Government is looking for land and buildings in Newbridge and the Curragh. That does not make sense. Obviously, Newbridge will be delighted to get a Department and the Curragh is also getting a headquarters. However, when one has a barracks lying idle with 60 acres of land &mdash; ten are taken up by other activities &mdash; that is certainly an issue.</P>
    <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann is to be privatised within the next few years, or so we are told at the Committee on Transport, but it is down for decentralisation. The numbers there simply do not add up. Those currently working there do not equal those whom it is proposed to move. How can one make a privatised company move to Mitchelstown, for example? It does not make sense. I have asked that question on numerous occasions and have yet to get an answer.</P>
    <P>I regret the fact that the Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats candidates are using decentralisation as an election gimmick. Some did play a part in it, but in Carlow some people who were not even involved in politics at the time are now taking the credit for it, which is a disgrace. Four years ago Carlow was guaranteed in the D&aacute;il that it would get a Department. We had such a good case that we could not be left out. We were far enough away from Dublin, yet not too far, and we had all the infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In Carlow County Council, the former county manager, Tom Dowling, put together a very good plan to explain why Carlow should be chosen. Along with the local politicians, some of whom I acknowledge were Progressive Democrats, the sitting Deputies at the time and the local <Col N="1528"/>authority staff, they put together a very good package. We held a meeting in July 2003 to refresh the Department of Finance&rsquo;s mind and we kept lobbying for it. It was a good day when it came to Carlow. The question is whether we will get the full benefit of it. Unfortunately, no really new jobs will be created by the process. People in Carlow to whom I have spoken when canvassing are far more interested in getting a commercial bank in the new business park, which is now lying idle. There are 70 acres of land, but nothing is being done there. That would be far more beneficial in the minds of the people of Carlow.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that when the decentralisation process goes ahead we have an efficient public service. While I acknowledge the great work that many people are doing at the Department of Social and Family Affairs, in my experience it is very confusing when one starts ringing people and one is put through from Sligo back to Dublin and all over the country via different subsections. Invariably, after seven or eight telephone calls, one still does not have an answer or a result. We must be conscious of that, which is why Deputy John Bruton, who has been in politics for much longer than most of us, is correct to air his views. Simply because we scatter Departments everywhere does not necessarily mean we will have an efficient public service. That is obviously our ultimate goal. We are all chasing social welfare queries that take weeks. Perhaps if we had a centralised approach in some respects, it might be quicker. People are waiting for social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is in favour of decentralisation. Unfortunately, the Government&rsquo;s record on the national spatial strategy and the national development plan, which is behind schedule and over budget, does not give us much assurance or confidence. However, it is vital that we continue to receive progress reports regularly. I am glad the Progressive Democrats have accepted the Fine Gael position put forward at the Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to speak in support of this motion. The decision to decentralise public service jobs from Dublin to other parts of the country has been strongly welcomed, particularly by those towns and communities that will benefit. As previous speakers said, it has already created a new vibrancy in those communities, a sense of self-worth and self-belief that can only augur well. They now see an anchor being given to them around which they can further build their communities. Not only will people come to work there, but they will integrate into communities and contribute to their social lives.</P>
   
    <P>We should approach the idea of decentralisation in terms of a short, medium and long-term plan to ensure efficiency is maintained and that the transition taking place over a period of time in no way undermines the vital role being <Col N="1529"/>played by public servants in the administration of the State. The plans and targets set out have to be readily achievable. It would be dangerous to set ourselves plans, targets and timeframes and, in the process, set about undermining the system of governance in the country.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have a certain amount of concern as to how we approach those civil servants in the Dublin who are somewhat uneasy and unhappy about the proposed moves. There must be a sense of reality. Many people enter careers knowing they are liable to be transferred or moved, for promotional or other reasons. However, people have entered careers on the understanding that they would permanently reside in the Dublin area. That is fine and an acceptable viewpoint. However, there are people at a certain stage of life, with family and educational commitments, etc, who are now being forced to take challenging decisions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> their careers and families. I hope that all necessary support mechanisms and systems will be put in place to reassure civil servants going through that decision making process that they will have the necessary supports to help them come to a decision. There is no doubt that the long-term advantage to the country far outweighs the short-term losses in achieving this, but it is a great responsibility on the political system to ensure that this is effected in the most efficient manner, both for the personnel involved and equally for the systems they administer.</P>
    <P>I support in principle some of the comments made by Senator Maurice Hayes about senior level management. Whereas technology can fill many gaps in the modern era of communication, a hands-on approach is also necessary. One has to give serious consideration to the senior levels of management. Sections of Departments can be moved and operate efficiently down the country. However, we need to be careful regarding senior management level in Departments. Where there is interdepartmental interaction, this should be kept in place and I hope this will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne referred to Government parties and members of my party taking credit for this initiative. I assure Senator Browne that I am taking absolutely no credit for it. I was heartened to hear that we were getting 200 jobs in Cork, but I was somewhat disheartened to discover that the 200 jobs in the Macroom-Fermoy area were coming from Cork city. I was of the opinion that decentralisation involved moving people from Dublin. However, I am allowed to be somewhat parochial, since most of us avail of the opportunity. I found it astonishing that we were moving people from Cork city to Macroom and Fermoy, which for me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;undervalues and undermines the whole principle of decentralisation in that these people, I suggest, will commute to their <Col N="1530"/>new-found employment. They will not contribute to the community, purchase houses or put their children into local schools. It is a decision I fail to understand. Not only could I not understand it when it was originally made, I equally cannot understand it since it was subsequently changed and people who were heading one way are now heading in another.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the Minster of State about this and I hope that particular decision will be kept under review&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a sensible resolution will be found to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this debate is taking place. It is necessary that we have a report and an update. We must give reassurances that the system being put in place by the Government will work. People applying for these moves and those in fear of being forced to move must be reassured that the necessary support mechanisms to help them make decisions that affect their careers and families will be such that they can decide in a confident manner. We have to look at the overriding principle, which is to decentralise from the Dublin area. That is a welcome decision.</P>

    <P>I inform Senator Dardis, the spokesperson for the Fianna F&aacute;il B team, formally the Progressive Democrats, that Fine Gael supports decentralisation. It was the first party in the State to propose decentralisation when Fianna F&aacute;il was closing small rural schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Decentralisation, despite indications to the contrary, was a live issue in the run-up to the last general election. It was part of the Agreed Programme for Government to be delivered by the end of 2002. Now we are approaching the local and European elections and again it is hot news from the Progressive Democrats. Will it hold good as a promise for the next general election?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcomed the Minister to the House a year ago to discuss the issue of decentralisation, which, as I said then, had an immediate urgency that four years of Government inaction had failed to address.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a rapid response the Senator received.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>That urgency is still with us. Decentralisation is important for this country, both from urban and rural perspectives. I support it and want to see it implemented in an open and <Col N="1532"/>transparent manner. This motion calls for the Minister to submit a report to this House on the plan&rsquo;s progress and its future implications. We heard Senator Minihan&rsquo;s comments on Cork. I fear that reports in this case are another stalling action which will preclude action, rather than be an open statement of the Government&rsquo;s plans for decentralisation in all its aspects. This country is primed for decentralisation. Communication systems are in place to link offices and businesses effectively, and the need to alleviate pressure on Dublin housing and traffic gridlock is undisputed. However, decentralisation that is not open to public scrutiny in all its aspects is not the way forward. Decentralisation makes sense but it is vitally important that its inception is no longer used as another political promise and that it is fully implemented without further delay. I hope the Minister is prepared to end the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over it and allow his plans to be opened to public scrutiny. This is very important coming from the Progressive Democrats and where they stand on the issue. They have recently been obscured by their immersion in Fianna F&aacute;il and its policies.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The vote by Fianna F&aacute;il to block the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service from having hearings on the implementation of the decentralisation programme shows its utter contempt for democratic accountability.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>If so, why are we having this debate now?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The lack of transparency by the Government and the Minister of State has led to a situation whereby they are arrogantly overriding the standard procedures of our democracy. It is incredible to think that since the plans for decentralisation were first mooted prior to the local elections in 1999 no motion in this regard has been debated in the D&aacute;il. No Government memorandum has accompanied it. No business case or risk assessment of its effect on any of the agencies has been presented. No human resource plan has been developed and no proper assessment of the financial implications has been presented. None of the selected locations has been justified against criteria for successful regionalisation. Neither those who fear a significant loss of &ldquo;organisational memory&rdquo; nor those who say that the dispersal of a majority of Departments across the countryside runs counter to international best practice have received an answer.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is not, and should not be allowed to be, shoved in through the back door but it is becoming clear that this is how the Government regards its implementation. The introduction of decentralisation in the budget was <Col N="1533"/>a deliberate ploy, as Senator Browne said, to avoid the scrutiny which has been established to protect our citizens from ill-considered proposals. The Government is not above accountability and the need for such accountability and transparency is laid down in the Article 28.4.1 of the Constitution which states &ldquo;The Government shall be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;. Sadly, it appears that the Government sees itself as being above such restraints. In demanding accountability from the Government, I am conscious of the human element involved in any decentralisation plans. A total of 10,000 families are being asked to move, lives are to be disrupted, and public servants are being put into a &ldquo;Dutch auction&rdquo; situation by the Minister of State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator against the motion?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>They are being required to make a bid for their own jobs before a deadline or suffer the unknown consequences when their jobs are allocated to others. So much for voluntary relocation without duress. In a proposal worthy of farce, if not amusement, 200 staff from Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Dublin headquarters were scheduled to be moved to the proposed new headquarters in Mitchelstown as part of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. The only problem was that Bus &Eacute;ireann has only 80 employees at its head office almost all of whom opposed the move. The 120 phantom staff have not been consulted. Voluntary decentralisation with no alternative plans for those who do not wish to relocate is tantamount to compulsion. What are the alternatives for civil servants who do not wish to move?</P>
    <P>It would be more appropriate if the Progressive Democrats had tabled a motion on their lack of support for the European initiative. Not for the first time it has been shown that the party is anti-Europe. It has failed to put forward candidates in any constituency and it has let down the people who propose to support the European institutions.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I was anxious to hear Senator Bannon&rsquo;s contribution before I spoke. The cloud of uncertainty and confusion he reckoned was <Col N="1534"/>over his head is spreading over that side of the House. There is a great deal of hot air&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised the Minister of State is still here after the manner in which he acted on budget day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the Seanad this evening on the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. When the Minister for Finance announced the details of the extent of the new decentralisation programme in his budget speech in December last year, several commentators were of the view that it would be many years before progress could be achieved on moving the programme forward. When one sees the extent of the progress that has been made, with the assistance of the decentralisation implementation group, in advancing this important Government programme one will agree, on hearing the facts, that we have delivered fully on our promise to translate our targets into real action in a very short timeframe.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the implementation group is Mr. Phil Flynn who reports directly to a special Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation. The group was asked to prepare an implementation plan and report back to Government by the end of March 2004. In parallel with the work of the implementation group, each Minister has been given overall responsibility for the decentralisation of his or her Department and of the State agencies for which he or she is responsible. The Minister in each case established a decentralisation unit in his or her Department which reports to the management advisory committee of that Department and to the Minister. All decentralising departments and agencies have appointed decentralisation liaison officers.</P>
    <P>The Flynn group submitted the report of the decentralisation implementation group to the Government at the end of March 2004. The Government approved the terms of the report which has been published and which contained several key recommendations. These include the setting up of a web-based integrated transfer system called the central applications facility, or CAF, to allow people to apply for transfer to decentralised locations and to rank their preferences among those locations. Work proceeded very quickly to turn the plan into reality. The CAF was launched on 12 May 2004 by the Minister for Finance and will remain in operation until such time as all the locations are fully subscribed, but those who apply within a period of eight weeks after the system goes live will receive preference over those who apply after that period. The eight-week period will finish on 8 July 2004. The information gathered through the CAF in the period up to 8 July 2004 will be analysed and passed on to the implementation group, thus providing it with a very valuable input for its next report. The Government sees the <Col N="1535"/>CAF as one of the cornerstones of the overall implementation process and the next phase of implementation.</P>
    <P>The group has also recommended that a second system similar to the CAF be developed at a later stage for people whose jobs are being decentralised but who wish to remain in Dublin. Several people have articulated this. It is a totally voluntary scheme and the people who choose not to move can rest assured they will have an opportunity of going onto a similar CAF immediately after the first one finishes. The implementation group also examined the training requirements for decentralisation and made recommendations in this area. One such recommendation is the provision of a series of workshops and seminars for decentralising organisations to provide a structured forum to build understanding of the training and development issues involved in the new programme. Last month CMOD organised and ran the first of these workshops for key representatives of decentralising organisations. The workshops were very well received by the attendees who represented 55 organisations. The group also considered that the Department of Finance should develop an overall decentralisation training plan. This would identify areas suitable for common responses, options for skills transfer and for mainstreaming the training across organisations.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the group asked that each decentralising Department and agency prepare its own implementation plan for submission by the end of May 2004. The plans are to include a detailed listing of all issues to be addressed in terms of people, property and business, with appropriate indicative timelines, an outline of the processes already in place to be developed plus the products to be delivered under each heading. Each plan should take account of the organisation&rsquo;s review of business process and service delivery methods. The plans should incorporate specific risk assessment and mitigation strategies. They should avail of suitable project management tools and include appropriate monitoring provisions. These initial implementation plans will require further development as additional information emerges in regard to the people, property and business issues identified in the implementation group&rsquo;s report. In addition, key trainers should be put in place at an early stage in every organisation which is scheduled to decentralise. The information contained in these plans will, together with the material from the CAF and property information, form a major part of the group&rsquo;s next report.</P>
    <P>In the area of equality, the group felt that the opportunity afforded by decentralisation should be used to re-emphasise the importance of equality issues. I confirm the Office of Public Works will, in line with its existing policy, ensure that best practice in regard to universal access to <Col N="1536"/>buildings is incorporated into the specifications for new buildings.</P>
    <P>I assure the House, in keeping with the group&rsquo;s suggestions, that every opportunity will be taken to promote and widen the use of existing family-friendly and work-balance schemes in determining working arrangements in a decentralised service.</P>
    <P>In budget 2001, the Minister for Finance allocated &euro;12.7 million for the provision of Civil Service cr&egrave;ches. The allocation was part of a wider Government policy to increase the number of child care places. Five such cr&egrave;ches are currently in operation, two in Dublin and one each in Ennis, Athlone and Sligo. The implementation group felt the future direction of the Civil Service cr&egrave;che initiative needed to be reviewed in light of the decentralisation programme. The availability of pre-school child care facilities in the decentralised locations, whether within the workplace or otherwise, needs to be addressed. The group considered that this review should take account of the scope for achieving the necessary critical mass in terms of demand and commercial viability by examining possible joint ventures with other public service employers in the relevant locations and private sector employers in those centres.</P>
    <P>Based on the group&rsquo;s recommendations, an interdepartmental committee has been set up to examine and report on the provision of child care in decentralised locations. This committee is examining the scope for the provision of further Civil Service workplace cr&egrave;ches in some decentralised locations as part of the child care initiative and suitable pre-school child care in other locations.</P>
    <P>In December 2003, at the request of the implementation group, the Office of Public Works invited proposals for the provision of office accommodation in the 53 locations announced on budget day. This was done through advertisements in national newspapers. By the closing date of 16 January 2004, approximately 700 submissions had been received. Since that date, officials from the OPW have been analysing these proposals on the basis of the criteria agreed by the decentralisation implementation group and using an agreed marking system. All negotiations with the vendors of properties are being handled by the OPW.</P>
    <P>To date, a number of properties have been secured. I am sure Senator Bannon will be delighted to hear the site for the Prison Service headquarters has been acquired from the local authority. I congratulate the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>In Carlow, a superb site has been acquired from the local authority for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has been universally approved by all local authority members.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>They are looking after Fine Gael as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>They are certainly very proactive in counties Longford and Carlow.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Carlow County Council on the expeditious manner in which it dealt with the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It was done for free.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>A Senator referred to the fact that an alternative site had been suggested to the Curragh as the location for the Defence Forces headquarters. I am happy to inform the House that the State owns the land in the Curragh where the Defence Forces headquarters will be situated. Likewise, the Department of Education and Science site in Athlone is State-owned. The OPW expects to have in excess of 20 properties under negotiation by the end of July 2004, with the remainder to quickly follow. The implementation group recommended a public private partnership approach to the procurement of office accommodation be adopted and that design, build, maintain and finance be the preferred procurement mechanism.</P>
    <P>Since the first announcement of the programme, there has been ongoing engagement between Civil Service management and trade unions within the framework of the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme. Discussions have also been ongoing, under the auspices of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and with unions representing staff in the various State agencies.</P>
    <P>Management has put forward a number of proposals and progress is being made. The ICTU trade unions representing public servants in decentralising agencies are meeting with the official side this afternoon. It is also recognised that many issues require ongoing discussions and much of this will have to take place locally between management and staff in the individual agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>Six months have elapsed since the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s announcement on budget day. Any reasonable observer would conclude that significant progress has been made during that time in the implementation phase of decentralisation. Public servants who wish to decentralise are in the process of making their applications. Most of the organisations participating in the programme have drawn up implementation plans and submitted them to the Flynn group. The OPW is continuing to seek and identify suitable locations for the decentralised offices. However, a significant task remains to be <Col N="1538"/>achieved. This programme is proceeding satisfactorily and Senators can rest assured it will be achieved.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I thank the Progressive Democrats for tabling this motion, which is an important one. I am always delighted to speak on decentralisation. Since I first became a public representative as a member of the then Waterford Corporation in 1985, it is a subject I have addressed on many occasions. It has always been close to my heart because I am aware of its importance and have spoken about it whenever I got the opportunity in the various fora that were available throughout the years. I am delighted to put forward my views on decentralisation and support the motion before the House.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party is very much in danger of becoming the anti-civil servant party. It is against decentralisation and it was against benchmarking. I do not know what it has against civil servants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Both points are factually incorrect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>The party appears to be against anything that affects civil servants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is factually incorrect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>At least Fine Gael is consistent in one thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak about his own policy. What is the Fianna F&aacute;il policy?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;namely, opposition to decentralisation. I heard Senators Browne and Bannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not opposed to it. That is factually incorrect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;state they support decentralisation and then they complained about the 10,000 civil servants we want to displace around the country.</P>
    <P>I remind Fine Gael that Fianna F&aacute;il was the first party to promote decentralisation towards the end of the 1970s. Decentralisation was then held up for a number of years. After the three elections in 1981 and 1982, we had a Fine Gael and Labour coalition from 1982 to 1987&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne should go back and check the policy of that Government; it was against decentralisation. It scrapped the decentralisation programme. The party is against it again on this occasion.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1539"/>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>They were different times.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>How can Fine Gael Members tell me they are pro-decentralisation when they opposed it then and now? That is nonsense.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not oppose it tonight. That is factually incorrect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>When Senators and Deputies go back to their constituencies and local areas they will tell people they are totally for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We never opposed it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>They know people want it because of the advantages it can bring to a town or city. However, they play politics with the issue in the House. They are not fooling anybody.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>They might come up with a policy about something some day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps, but I would not hold my breath on that one.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Fianna F&aacute;il position on decentralisation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Kenneally to speak without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>When decentralisation was first mooted, a decision was taken regarding the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The telegraphs part of it was to come to Waterford and the post end of it was to go to Dundalk. That never happened. Both sections were hived off to become An Post and Telecom &Eacute;ireann. It was a matter of great frustration to me at the time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Had the Senator invested in it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Kenneally to speak without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>We went around in circles trying to get Telecom &Eacute;ireann to come to Waterford. In 1992, when I was Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, I looked at the file on it and discovered that we would never get Telecom &Eacute;ireann to decentralise because it did not want to go and, as matters stood, we could not make it do so. We then went after the Land Registry and it is now located in Waterford where a few hundred people are working successfully. There are many people in that office who did not come from Waterford city or county or the south-east but who chose to move to that particular location and are now happy with their lot. That is not only true of Waterford, it is also true of Carlow, Galway, Limerick, Cork or any town or city throughout the country to which people were decentralised in the first tranche out of Dublin. From talking to their friends and colleagues who <Col N="1540"/>decentralised, those in Dublin know that these people have a far better quality of life in the places in which they now live.</P>
    <P>During the period to which I refer we could not get people to move out of Dublin because they felt they were going into the unknown. Now, however, people are aware of what is available in other locations and it is much easier to encourage them to decentralise. That is why I have no concerns about encouraging 10,000 people to move out of Dublin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator guaranteeing that 10,000 people will decentralise?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept there will be difficulties. Nobody suggested that problems would not arise. It is a huge undertaking and no one thought it would be straightforward. It will not be straightforward and more problems and difficulties that we have not yet even envisaged will arise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>No doubt.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we are determined to proceed.</P>
    <P>A great deal of misinformation has been put about. A Department carried out a trawl of its employees and inquired as to how many people wanted to decentralise to the location to which it proposes to move. It was stated that decentralisation would not work because so few people wanted to move to that location. However, when the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources posed the question, the answer was completely different. There are enough people and they are anxious to move. I accept that in many cases this will entail moving to different Departments. What of it? This is happening in any event. People are constantly moving from one Department to another, whether it be in terms of gaining promotion, transferring or whatever. Moving Departments will not create any difficulty.</P>
    <P>I heard a debate on radio this morning about local authorities and their powers. Reference was made to the decision-making process and the fact that many of their powers have been taken away and centralised back to Dublin. I do not want to discuss the rights and wrongs of what has happened to elected councils. However, I am of the view that elected representatives in local authorities should have more power. As regards the decision-making process, decentralisation of eight Departments will move this process out of Dublin to other locations. Those on radio this morning were decrying the fact that the decision-making process is being removed from rural areas. Now, however, it is being returned to various rural areas. I cannot understand why people oppose that.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1541"/>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator give an example of where that is happening in local government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody opposes decentralising the decision-making process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>My final point relates to new agencies that are being established. Some of the legislation with which I have been dealing contains proposals to start various new agencies. As a matter of policy, all of these agencies should be located outside Dublin. They are all quite small at present but some of them could become the large semi-State organisations of the future. If we move them out of Dublin now, we will not have to face the difficulty of doing so in 20 or 30 years time. I suggest that they should be moved elsewhere at this stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>
    <P>From reading the motion, it is clear that there is doubt in the proposers&rsquo; minds as to the feasibility of the project or the timescale within which it will be implemented. The Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution clearly indicates the absence of factual information regarding what is actually happening. In discussing decentralisation in this instance, we are talking about nothing more than relocation. That is the bald fact underlying this rushed scheme. Every public representative in the country welcomes decentralisation and the idea behind it. However, with the concept of decentralisation must come power.</P>
    <P>If I could offer one example of a Department and Minister that have gone contrary to the beliefs I have outlined, it would be the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and its Minister. Let us consider the Minister&rsquo;s record. I am sure there are other Ministers to whom I could refer but I will concentrate on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because I was a member of a local authority. The Minister has clawed back power to his Department at every opportunity. He has removed power from local authority members with responsibility for waste management. He has also taken back power in the area of planning with the issuing of his recent guidelines, which were completely irrelevant and had no impact as regards solving the problem some Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and Ministers of State stated they had resolved in recent times. My party has a concept of decentralisation, in this instance, as meaning nothing more than the relocation of civil servants out of Dublin while retaining power here. We cannot accept that the Government&rsquo;s concept of decentralisation is real or genuine.</P>
    <P>Another parallel exists in terms of the spatial strategy. What has happened in this regard? There is no relationship or link to the policy the <Col N="1542"/>Government has espoused in the past couple of years in respect of the spatial strategy. Under the strategy, we were supposed to develop hubs and gateways throughout the country and everybody embraced the concept. What has happened? The strategy has been scrapped. Will the Minister of State indicate whether anything positive, other than a coincidental allocation of some semi-State office or service to one of the proposed hubs or gateways, has happened in respect of the spatial strategy? I would go so far as to say that such allocations were even accidental.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a substantial link-up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>What has happened with the spatial strategy is similar to what happened when the Minister of State put up hoardings throughout the country. That led to a great deal of cynicism towards the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>From where did that cynicism come?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It came from the Minister of State and the people who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I was merely informing the Minister of State as to the source of the cynicism. If he has not yet realised what it is, I have helped him to achieve closure in that regard.</P>
    <P>People have been affected by the decision on decentralisation, particularly in terms of the way it was handled. There were no negotiations or discussions. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, launched decentralisation because of the absence of any other real initiative or policy from the Government. The Administration decided to proceed with decentralisation in the hope that all other matters would be swept aside and that people would talk about nothing else. People have talked about it but for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to tell a young couple living in Dublin, one or other of whom works for a Department or State agency, who have purchased a home and whose children are in school or child care that the particular Department or agency is being encouraged to decentralise to a particular location. What will that mean for them? The motion refers to the need to restrict housing cost increases in Dublin and how people will benefit. Of what were its proposers thinking when they put forward that suggestion?</P>
    <P>There are proposals for decentralisation to the towns of Ballinasloe and Loughrea and I welcome them. Nobody in Fianna F&aacute;il or the Progressive Democrats should attempt to suggest that anyone opposes decentralisation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The charge is far more serious than that.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1543"/>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is merely a ploy, particularly during an election campaign, to say that people are opposed to decentralisation. However, that is fine because the Government parties have nothing else to say. The Government parties know well the real issues are coming up on the doorsteps and this is the side issue it uses to save some of its embarrassment over its failures and broken promises.</P>
    <P>Before decentralisation was so hastily announced last December, negotiations were going on with the Government with regard to St. Bridget&rsquo;s Hospital, Ballinasloe. That institution is being vacated quickly and rapidly as a result of a change in policy of the health board and the Department of Health and Children which aims to bring patients into the community rather than institutionalise them. However, nothing has happened concerning the building. There was a rumour, which I discussed earlier with another Minister, that it would become a prison. Almost every town which did not get an offer was to be a location for a prison. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, however, has decided to get rid of Mountjoy Prison and to build a new jail and this has meant that the proposals for prisons in other locations have died an untimely death.</P>
    <P>When I hear the Minister of State say that we will have reviews and studies of locations and that we must have child care facilities in all the proposed areas, this is a sure sign of indecision and postponement and of avoidance of putting practical plans in place. The Minister of State has no plans, if it is he who is responsible for the move. The Minister for Finance has allocated no funding, other than small piecemeal amounts.</P>
    <P>Carlow and Longford were mentioned as two examples of where accommodation was available.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I also mentioned Athlone and the Curragh.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>For what percentage of the 10,300 personnel has the Minister of State received concrete evidence of available accommodation? The reply will demonstrate that he is only tinkering at the edges of a policy that was badly thought out and in ten years&rsquo; time we will probably not have got to its final episode.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who participated in this debate. I also thank the Minister of State for doing as requested by the motion and bringing us up to date on the decentralisation process. It is an achievement to have identified four locations and to have a further 20 under negotiation within a six-month period. This indicates the timeframe, which I regarded as ambitious when the announcement was made in the budget, is achievable.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat confused, not for the first time, by the attitude of Fine Gael. We started with the reasonable face of Senator Finucane. This was followed by the anti-everything face of Senator <Col N="1544"/>Bannon and now we have the schizophrenic face of Senator Ulick Burke.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator Finucane said he was delighted that decentralisation will happen. This seems to be in marked contrast to what other members of his party had to say and to what has been said on the Order of Business in recent weeks where one would get the impression that this is the worst proposal ever. I am pleased to hear that Fine Gael has nailed its colours to the mast and that it is in favour of decentralisation, notwithstanding the individual solo runs within the party.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister of State with regard to the Curragh and Defence Forces headquarters. It is my contention since I entered public life that Defence Forces headquarters should be in the Curragh. It did not make sense to me that many people travelled from Kildare to Defence Forces headquarters in Dublin when most of the activity was in the Curragh. It makes sense also to locate the Department of Defence close to the Curragh. I am pleased it is coming to Newbridge. Kildare would also have been suitable and I noted what was said regarding the barracks and the land there.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes made a good point regarding critical mass. The location of the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces headquarters, etc, within a reasonably close geographical area creates this critical mass. The same could apply in other situations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the selection of towns, one of the reasons Athy was selected was to do with the quality of its application and the presentation made by the Athy development and investment forum. It is pleasing &mdash; the same has happened around the country &mdash; that politicians from all political parties united in their support for the Athy proposal. This included those from other towns that had made applications. The situation has not been particularly politicised.</P>
    <P>For political reasons much scaremongering has taken place in Dublin to try to scare public servants into thinking a scenario of doom faces <Col N="1545"/>them. I repeat the point that only 10,300 out of 300,000 public servants are being asked to move. This is a small number of people and I am confident there are enough people who want to get out of the rat race which is Dublin and move to more pleasant places around the country in which to live, rear their families and participate in community. Many of these people came from those places. It is because we faced high unemployment levels at the time that they had no choice but to move to Dublin. Now, however, people have a choice.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by what Senator Mansergh said on the subject of infrastructure and the spatial strategy. This was supported by Senator O&rsquo;Meara. Exceptions can always be found but the plan has coherence and is working well. Major policy decisions of national importance must be made by senior civil servants in consultation with their political masters. This is probably best done in Dublin or in some central area. This does not mean that the administration of a Department cannot be devolved to other areas. Within all Departments many activities could be done as well in New York as in Kiltimagh, Ballinasloe, Longford or wherever.</P>

	<P>With modern communications all this is possible. In my town a large company, Oral B, which is part of the Gillette company, interacts daily with its people in America through video link which works perfectly well. The technology is there. We have moved immeasurably from where we were ten years ago in terms of having systems that work effectively for both oral communication and the transfer of documents.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes made a good point with regard to demagnetising Dublin. This is the key to decentralisation. There are huge benefits to be gained for the Civil Service, the capital and for regional development. Senator Minihan said that decentralisation could be the motor for regional development. It would bring benefits to the country as a whole. I am pleased the decentralisation programme is rolling out and I wish the Minister of State well in his future efforts. The programme is in safe hands as long as he has responsibility for the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in August 2001, on receipt of information from Interpol obtained by the United States Postal Inspection Service during a search of premises in Fort Worth, Texas, concerning details of alleged customers of a company offering access to child pornography websites, commenced an operation in relation to persons allegedly so identified from this jurisdiction,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) that these details included the names, passwords and credit card and charge card details of certain persons,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) that one of the persons from this jurisdiction so named was a Brian Curtin, 35 Ashe Street, Tralee, Co. Kerry, and that subsequent enquiries indicated that this person was Brian Curtin, Judge of the Circuit Court, with a home address of 24 Ard na L&iacute;, Tralee, Co Kerry,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) that a warrant to search Judge Curtin&rsquo;s home under section 7 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 issued from the District Court on foot of an application by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 20 May 2002,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>e</i>) that Judge Curtin&rsquo;s home was subsequently searched on foot of the said warrant and that garda&iacute; took possession of a personal computer and other material during the search,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>f</i>) that an investigation file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the Garda authorities in October 2002 and that the Director of Public Prosecutions instructed that Judge Curtin be prosecuted for knowingly having in his possession child pornography contrary to section 6 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>g</i>) that the trial of the said charge commenced on 20 April 2004 at Tralee Circuit Court and that on 23 April 2004, Judge Curtin was found not guilty of that charge without evidence being given in relation to the subject matter of the charge, the Circuit Criminal Court having determined that the aforesaid warrant was spent when executed at the home of Judge Curtin; and</P>
    <P LI="2">2. Calls for the removal, pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution and section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, of His Honour Judge Brian Curtin, Judge of the Circuit Court, from office for stated misbehaviour, being his conduct in and in relation to subscribing to, accessing and use of websites containing child pornographic images and thereby rendering himself unsuitable to exercise the office of a Judge of the Circuit Court.</P><Col N="1547"/>
    <P FLI="0">All of us are aware at this time that a responsibility of profound constitutional importance now falls to be discharged by this House, and has been discharged by the D&aacute;il, namely our responsibility regarding the removal of members of the Judiciary for stated misconduct.

   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this important matter, the proposal, as reported in recent times, by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and by the Government &mdash; it also involves the Minister for Transport &mdash; to transfer the most significant part of the assets of Shannon Development to a new Shannon Airport authority to rid it of its debt of &euro;5 million in the context of the development of an independent airport authority at Shannon.</P>
    <P>While the people of the region want to see the airport develop, there is great concern, particularly among the business community in the Shannon area, that this proposal is a short-term measure and very much a quick fix solution to the issue of the debt a new authority would bear in its early life. The impact, particularly economically, of this proposal on the region would be devastating. In that regard, it is vital that the Government ensures that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence from Limerick Chamber of Commerce and I have read comments in the media from players such as Fitzpatricks Hotel in Bunratty, Dell, one of the biggest employers in the region, and other significant figures from the University of <Col N="1548"/>Limerick who say this proposal would have severe economic consequences and is simply not the way forward. The impact of it would be to strip Shannon Development of its assets, particularly in the Shannon free zone. The Minister of State is aware that the creation of a free zone around the airport to attract industry was an innovative development. The project has been very successful. Shannon Development has had significant success in attracting industry to the region. I stress Shannon Development&rsquo;s role in supporting and nurturing new industry in the region.</P>
 
    <P>The role of the airport authority is to act as such. An airport authority cannot be a development authority. It cannot play the role currently played by Shannon Development, especially in developing relationships with employers.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is worth noting that 7,300 people are employed in the Shannon free zone. Some 120 companies are located in the zone, including Intel, Lufthansa Technik, Halifax, Tyco Raychem, DeBeers and Thompson Financial. The zone has the largest cluster of north American investment in Ireland. The proposal under discussion puts the investment, the jobs and future development in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>As a public representative in the area, I am in regular contact with Shannon Development. I am briefed regularly on the initiatives being taken by the company and on its future. Shannon Development is examining the development around the airport. It is considering the introduction to the area around the airport of a new type of industry. It is studying the possibility of developing distribution networks at the airport, using the attractive facility that is in place.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development is also a tourism body. It is responsible for the development and encouragement of tourism in the area. If it is stripped of its assets, it will not be able to carry out its tourism functions to the extent that it does at present. The tourism industry in the Shannon area, which has already been hit by the potential weakness of Shannon Airport &mdash; I refer to the American market &mdash; would not receive the significant level of support it receives at present. There would be certain implications in that regard. The proposal under discussion cannot work. If it is pursued, it will have negative economic consequences not only for the Shannon area, but also for the entire mid-west region.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Meara for raising this matter. The T&aacute;naiste, who is engaged in Presidency duties this evening, regrets that she cannot be here to take part in the debate on this important issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to place this debate in its proper context, which will underline the commitment of the <Col N="1549"/>Government to the mid-west region, particularly Shannon. The House is aware that a number<?oasys [jy?>of recent developments, including the Government&rsquo;s decisions on decentralisation and the need for an autonomous airport at Shannon, will impact on the region and the State agencies located there.</P>
    <P>The first of the developments was the decision announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement of December 2003 to decentralise the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon. Some 300 of the agency&rsquo;s Dublin-based staff will be relocated at Shannon and 100 staff from the Irish Aviation Authority will also transfer there. The decentralisation programme envisages the transfer of 1,210 staff from Departments and State agencies in Dublin to the mid-west region. This hardly indicates that the Government has lessened its commitment to the region&rsquo;s economic development.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste has contributed to the process by agreeing to the transfer to the region of 300 staff from Enterprise Ireland and 250 staff from F&Aacute;S. The transfer of the agencies, both of which are under her Department&rsquo;s remit, provides firm evidence of her commitment.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development performs a range of functions for Enterprise Ireland on a delegated authority basis. In light of the decentralisation decision, it has been decided that the functions will revert to Enterprise Ireland. It is an entirely practical development as it would make little sense for two agencies in the same location to perform the same functions. The decision, which is fully supported by the board of Shannon Development, will result in the transfer of the Shannon Development staff engaged in the functions to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that the management of Shannon town should be transferred from Shannon Development and vested in Clare County Council. The decision has been made on practical grounds and Shannon Development and Clare County Council are in agreement with it.</P>
    <P>A further development of considerable importance to the region is the decision, which is supported by the board of Shannon Development, to establish an independent Shannon airport authority. The promulgation of legislation for the new authority is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. The T&aacute;naiste considers that ensuring the independence and viability of Shannon Airport is absolutely critical to the future development of the mid-west region. All commentators agree that the task of maintaining and developing the vibrancy of the region and guaranteeing its continued attractiveness as a tourist destination and a location for investment would be made considerably more difficult if the airport were not there.</P>
    <P>One of the options being considered by the Government is the transfer of the Shannon free zone&rsquo;s assets to the new airport authority. While <Col N="1550"/>no decision has been taken, the transfer of the assets would not involve a change in the status of the zone or its attractiveness as an investment location. The question that is ultimately at issue is the management of the zone. In the context of the establishment of the new airport authority, the T&aacute;naiste wants to ensure that the best use is made of the State asset to benefit the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the light of the changed circumstances, the T&aacute;naiste met the chairman and some members of the board of Shannon Development in March. She subsequently met the chairman and chief executive of the company at the end of April to explain and expand on the matters under consideration. She asked the board to bring forward detailed proposals about the role Shannon Development can play in the region&rsquo;s future development. This discussion is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste is keen to stress that she is committed to the future of Shannon and the mid-west region as a whole. The Government&rsquo;s concern is to ensure that it puts in place the most sensible and efficient structures and manages the region&rsquo;s most valuable and strategic assets to optimise their benefit for the entire region.</P>

   <Title>Schools Building Projects.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House. I would like to raise the simple matter of the excellent educational facility offered at the Presentation College secondary school at Askea in Carlow town. The excellence of the facilities is not matched by the level of expertise and care given to the students, unfortunately. The school is at stage 5 of the planning process, but it is stuck in band 3. It wants its band rating to be increased so that it can guarantee that the building works will commence this year. The bill of quantities has been completed, the tendering documents have been submitted and planning permission has been secured for the building programme. The project is ready to start as soon as it gets the final nod <Col N="1551"/>from the building unit of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The existing school building, which was constructed in the 1980s, is modern, but it is out of date in certain respects as a consequence of advancements in the building industry. It is not wheelchair-accessible in the same manner as a modern building. The school has some health and safety issues. It does not have a PE hall at present. The children are forced to walk a mile to a nearby sports centre, which poses real risks to them and is unsatisfactory for them and their teachers. It means that PE classes often have to be cancelled because of bad weather. Secondary schools in Ireland deserve to have their own dedicated gym. The school has major plans to renovate the buildings to modern standards, including wheelchair accessibility.</P>
    <P>Everything has been done in respect of this project. Planning permission has been secured, all the documents have been submitted and the school has worked closely with parents, teachers and children as well as public representatives. I attended a constructive meeting in the school a few months ago with the local Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, M.J. Nolan. The school asked us to try to apply as much pressure as possible to ensure that the project is started next year. There was grave disappointment when the building programme was announced this year and the school discovered its project was not to proceed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Education and Science to write the cheque and send it to Carlow. I will even bring it down myself and save him the cost of a stamp. I hope the school building programme can commence, even towards the end of this year if possible, so that it can be in place by 2005.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the proposed building project for the Presentation College in Carlow. A major extension project for the Presentation College is listed in section 8 of the Department&rsquo;s school <Col N="1552"/>building programme for 2004. As the Senator has outlined, it is currently at stage 5 in the architectural planning process and has a band 3 rating. The indicative timeframe to tender for this project is post-2004.</P>
    <P>As the Department of Education and Science announced when publishing the capital programme, a key strategy for schools building projects going forward will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multi-annual allocations for capital investment in education projects. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme will be re-evaluated with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. This re-evaluation will include the project at the Presentation College, Carlow. This strategy will provide better clarity for schools in terms of when they can expect their projects to proceed.</P>
    <P>As the first step in the review process, the Department held consultations with the education partners on the prioritisation criteria used for large scale building projects. The purpose of these consultations is to ensure that the criteria have optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of the primary and post-primary sectors. The Department expects to be in a position to make a further announcement in this matter later this year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, to alleviate difficulties at the Presentation College, I am pleased to inform the Senator that the Department recently approved grant aid in the amount of almost &euro;58,500 towards the cost of two prefabricated classrooms at the school. The Department is confident that the multi-annual approach to the school building programme and its underpinning principles will provide a mechanism for ensuring that capital investment in school infrastructure will not alone be targeted at those schools most in need but that it will also be made in the most open and transparent way possible.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Browne for raising the matter in this House.</P>
