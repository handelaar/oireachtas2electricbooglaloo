	<P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to explain why St. Mel&rsquo;s training centre, Longford, has experienced drastic funding cuts in the past year, and to indicate the steps that can be taken to restore the number of participants and to keep this valuable scheme going.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mansergh of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to ensure that the original planned Clonmel road intersection on the Cashel bypass is carried through with connections in both the Dublin and Cork directions.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by Senator Bannon as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Mansergh as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am curious as to why No. 2, the motion for earlier signature of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 is sought when most of the Government speakers yesterday were against large parts of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions concerning widows. Will the Government speakers who, on Second Stage so loudly proclaimed their support for the position outlined by Senator Cummins, which he has restated in the form of amendment No. 1 on Committee Stage, back this amendment? It seems from the Minister that &ldquo;the lady is not for turning&rdquo; on this issue, a position which was held by our friend across the water some years ago. The Minister should come to the House and listen to her colleagues who want her to do a U-turn. I implore the Leader to support amendment No. 1 on Committee Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not discussing the contents of the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing the motion for earlier signature, which is a proposal from the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of huge hypocrisy that the Government wants the President to sign into law a Bill which the Government believes to be ineffective.</P>
    <P>A recent survey produced by Fine Gael highlighted that almost 10,000 children in this country are waiting for psychological assessment before their special educational needs can be determined. We now know that the average waiting time for a child to be assessed within the current system is between six and eight months. While a national education body was put in place to deal with psychological assessment, it is clear the backlog of assessments has not been dealt with. Will the Government ensure that if after two months a child within our primary education system cannot obtain an assessment, funding would be provided for that child to be assessed by the private sector?</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that children presenting with special needs problems in our schools cannot be dealt with for six to eight months because a bureaucratic edifice stands in the way. The Government should consider this given that special needs education is the Cinderella of education. We are regularly informed that 1997 was the baseline upon which the new society was built. If that is the case, the Government must consider its performance in this area, which is a disgrace. This is where reform needs to be brought about.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the last point made by Senator Brian Hayes. The House should know that it was the arrangement for a number of years, agreed by the previous Minister, that in the event of the system not being able to cope with <Col N="1943"/>the demand for child psychological evaluation at primary level, a certain amount of funding was made available to schools to purchase services in the private sector. There was no objection to this arrangement, which had been sought by trade unions, management and parents. It was an effective system which removed difficulties and I ask that it be reconsidered by Government.</P>
    <P>A recent discussion in the House highlighted the concerns of Members with the proposal to have a referendum on immigration policy to coincide with the European and local elections. The view from all sides was that it would be a disastrous move. I note with some satisfaction that the Government has listened to what was said and appears to be pulling back from that dangerous situation. However, it is equally important that the Government confirms that the referendum will not be held at the same time as the forthcoming elections. There is doubt on the issue which we should not allow to continue. It would be appropriate for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline his proposals, or for the House to have a Government view on when it is likely to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>I accept that the issue must be dealt with in some manner but there should be much discussion before it is put to the people. The referendum should not be held at the same time as an election as that would feed the racist tendencies of too many in Irish society. I ask the Leader to address that point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I share Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo; anticipation of the eloquent speeches from the other side of the House in defence of widows, I will leave the matter until Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would agree.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I rarely anticipate your rulings, a Chathaoirligh, but do so on this occasion. Contained in the Order Paper laid before the House this morning are no less than 57 national heritage area orders. Where did they come from, what are they about and will we have some opportunity, at least in a generic fashion, to discuss measures as extensive as 57 separate national heritage area orders? I only saw the list this morning and I doubt even if I had seen it in time, I would have looked at them all. However, it is a major change and there are implications for people who own property in those areas. This should not slip through the Seanad without some debate.</P>
    <P>Most of the debate on the Government&rsquo;s sudden proposal for a referendum on citizenship, to the extent that there has been a debate, has been conducted in a very restrained fashion. Will the Government give us some evidence, as opposed to misquoting doctors, supporting the suggestion that 23% of births in Dublin maternity <Col N="1944"/>hospitals are connected with an abuse of citizenship? Many people argue that the increased number of non-nationals having babies in Dublin relates to international recognition of the quality of maternity care in the city and that many of the non-nationals are well off and pay to come here because of the quality of the service. Nobody would dispute that point. That is the reason. It has nothing to do with citizenship and much to do with the quality of the service. It also gets rid of any suggestion that there is an urgent crisis.</P>
    <P>This issue should be discussed dispassionately. Less emotionally sensitive issues such as land were referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and this matter, more than any other, deserves to be referred to a special committee made up of all parties which can evaluate the evidence and come up with a consensus solution to whatever problem is identified. To do otherwise is to leave one open to the charge of exploiting fears about racism and immigration.</P>
    <P>There have been many contradictory statements about the rights of the security personnel who will be protecting President Bush when he comes to Ireland in June. Will the Leader find out what passports those security personnel will be using? I refer to those who will be carrying arms, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform believes they will have the right to use them. Will they be travelling on ordinary or diplomatic passports? If they travel on diplomatic passports, the Garda Commissioner can do all the investigating he wants but they will be covered by diplomatic immunity. The Leader should clarify whether they will all be covered by diplomatic immunity, in which case the commissioner can investigate anything that happens but nothing will come of it because they are covered by diplomatic immunity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to make inquiries about the need to pay such exorbitant fees to barristers who have guaranteed jobs at the tribunals, which look as if they will continue indefinitely.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s party agreed to it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Who wanted to close them down?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not trying to close them down.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hanafin without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In many cases they are earning up to &euro;3,000 per day. It is not unreasonable to raise this matter because this is guaranteed income as the tribunals will run for some time yet. That may answer the points raised by the Opposition. Given that these tribunals will run <Col N="1945"/>for some time, they could be asked to take &euro;2,000 per day, which is still a huge sum. However, it would be a significant saving to the Exchequer and might amount in total to &euro;40 million.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. There was a huge budgetary surplus of approximately &euro;300 million at the beginning of the year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Pay the widows.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Pay the widows.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it would be appropriate for the Leader to write to the Department, stating that there are clearly some places where money could be spent to alleviate suffering.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Sunday on behalf of Fine Gael I signed a proclamation agreeing to do everything to ensure there would be no racism in the run-up to any election, with the local elections in particular in mind. All other parties were represented and signed the proclamation also. With that in mind it is appropriate that we ensure the proposed referendum does not take place at the same time as the local elections. This issue needs to be considered by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and everyone needs the opportunity to debate the matter. The referendum should be postponed to a later date and should not take place in June.</P>
    <P>All Members take a keen interest in planning issues, particularly those of us who were councillors. We also take due care in dealing with county development plans, which many counties are dealing with at present. Today we read in the newspapers that in my area of Castleknock, which is part of Fingal, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted permission for approximately 300 housing units adjacent to Farmleigh House. This flies in the face of our county development plan because the land was zoned for two houses to the acre and now permission has been granted for 300 units. That does away with local democracy and I want the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to explain to us why we should bother with county development plans if, with the sweep of a pen, An Bord Plean&aacute;la can make a decision that totally ignores the county development plan. It is an absolute disgrace.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no control over An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned, as are other right-thinking people, by recent newspaper reports of bogus registration of births by certain non-nationals. Perhaps nationals are doing it also; I do not know. If this is the case, and nobody has contradicted those reports, what will be done about it?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1946"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What about bogus non-resident accounts?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>How widespread is this practice? Is this an isolated incident? The relevant Minister should tell the House what he or she proposes to do about this worrying trend. I am all for child benefit for children who exist, but I do not support paying child benefit to people who do not exist.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If Members are worried about the developments next to Farmleigh the first thing they should do is stop undermining An Taisce by attacking it viciously here. That is the statutory body in this area and this is what we will get, and we will get much more of it, if we do not stop our ignorant attacks on that body. I look forward to a debate in which I can defend An Taisce.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have several questions. I compliment Senator Ryan on picking up on the point I made yesterday about passports. A statement was issued by the State Department in Washington that these personnel would be travelling on diplomatic passports. That is where this matter arose.</P>
    <P>The Leader should consider withdrawing No. 1 from the Order Paper. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 1 be deleted. The provisions of the Bill are being introduced to circumvent a series of court cases. One widely quoted case involving Susan McHugh went to the Supreme Court and it was decided that those precise measures were unconstitutional. Those people won rights and the Parliament is being used to circumvent them. The situation was the same with regard to gay spouses. The Government&rsquo;s own Equality Authority found there was a breach and the Government&rsquo;s law officers told them if they continued what they were doing, they would be guilty of discrimination under the law. What did they do? Instead of addressing the discrimination, they tried to change the law. It is a disgrace to the House and many decent Government Members recognise this point. Now they are trying to tinker with the situation of the widows but it would be unconscionable to deal with only one vulnerable group. The only decent thing to do is to withdraw the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has elaborated sufficiently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we take No. 23, motion No. 18, on Tibet? It should be dealt with now because of an answer given to Senator Terry here within the last two weeks. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, speaking on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, read into the record a statement that Ireland recognises Tibet as an integral part of China. It is <Col N="1947"/>vital that we now have such a debate because this is being contradicted by past and current behaviour, going back to Frank Aiken at the United Nations. Within the last year, a former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael O&rsquo;Kennedy, stated categorically this was not the case. He said it had never been done and would be vigorously opposed within Fianna F&aacute;il. I do not believe the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, was responsible for that. The statement was drafted by civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is a very serious matter if, without recourse to the Cabinet, the Committee on Foreign Affairs or either House of the Oireachtas, a violent and unexplained change is made to our foreign policy. This would be an absolute disaster for democracy in this country. For those reasons, it is very important that we take item 23, No. 18 so the Minister, Deputy Cowen, may have a reasonable opportunity to rectify the matter and put on the record of the House the real situation regarding Ireland&rsquo;s policy in this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Health and Children to attend the House to discuss the recently published strategy plan by the Mental Health Commission? The plan indicates clearly that there has been a failure to implement the Mental Health Act 2001. Up to 3,000 patients are involuntarily admitted to mental institutions annually because there has been a steady decline in resourcing the community mental health plan, which was of great advantage to many people who suffer from mental illness. Currently, however, such people are being involuntarily committed to mental institutions. The Minister should indicate urgently what he intends to do to rectify that serious situation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to request the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend the House to discuss the disturbing loss of 32,000 manufacturing jobs over the past two years. The T&aacute;naiste and the Government appear to have failed to do anything to reverse the position. IBEC is concerned that this trend will continue if the T&aacute;naiste and the Government stand idly by. The most vulnerable jobs are those in the west where many manufacturing positions have been lost. I am seeking an urgent debate on future employment prospects.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment. The Leader knows, as well as I do, about the struggle the National Association of Widows in Ireland has had for nearly 40 years to obtain some rights. I do not think it will give the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, long enough to try to rectify this if we take the Bill this morning. I am quite sure she is concerned about the matter. A small amount of money will be saved but if the Minister had a little more time to consider the issue we could <Col N="1948"/>find a way of rectifying the Bill by deleting this unfortunate clause.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Defence to attend the House to outline the current situation in Kosovo where Irish personnel are serving with the United Nations. There are serious risks involved following the recent outbreak of hostilities there, so we should receive an update on the current position from either Minister, including the likely prospects of a return to peace in Kosovo.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Leader intend the House to reconsider the draft guidelines on rural housing from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen? As we have seen, councillors in a number of counties believe the draft guidelines are inadequate in many respects. Senator Terry raised a pertinent point regarding a recent decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but there have been others. Will the draft guidelines mean anything more than county development plans when they move beyond the draft stage? When those guidelines become definitive, can they be overruled? It seems that perhaps they can. In any event, I would like to know when the Leader intends the House to return to the discussion on item 18.</P>
    <P>Given that both the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Finance Bill will presumably be completed by the House today, will the Leader indicate next week&rsquo;s business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, raised the question of waiting periods for young children who are scheduled for psychological assessment. He said they are currently waiting for six to eight months, while two months was supposed to be the limit. I will make inquiries about that matter. I have read about it and I know of some such cases myself. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, it used to be the situation that parents of such children could arrange assessments privately, and there was no negative feeling about that. I do not know whether there is an abundance of young people awaiting psychological assessments, but I will endeavour to find out the position.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I happened to have the monitor on in my office and saw the T&aacute;naiste speaking about the referendum on polling day. She made it clear, however, that the Government had not made a decision on having the referendum on polling day. In answering Deputy Rabbitte and others, she was absolutely clear that there had not been a decision on the matter. That is the position I outlined here two weeks ago because I was aware that no decision had been made. Personally, I do not think it is a good idea to have such a referendum on polling day for the local and European elections. With the best will in the <Col N="1949"/>world, if everybody acted in a restrained manner, ambitions to get themselves elected would overrule whatever their finer feelings might be. In some cases, one could have a descent into racism on the issue, so I hope it does not happen like that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said we had eloquent speeches on this side of the House, which makes a change from what he said about us two weeks ago. He asked about the protocols concerning 57 national heritage area orders. They have been outlined but I will not decipher them for the Senator. A debate on national heritage would perhaps elucidate the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also made an interesting point concerning the 23% increase in births in Dublin. He proposed the formation of a special committee to determine whether the increase was due to the excellent arrangements in Dublin maternity hospitals, or to the increase in asylum seekers giving birth in the capital. That issue is tied in with the referendum.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Ryan also asked about diplomatic immunity for President Bush&rsquo;s entourage, and the same point occurred to me. If the people coming here with President Bush have diplomatic immunity, with the best will in the world, the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Conroy, could not touch them. From reading about this matter and from what I have heard in the House, I understand the presidential bodyguards have never had to fire a shot on any overseas visit when protecting President Bush or any of his predecessors. I will inquire about what type of passports they will be travelling under, however.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin asked about the level of tribunal fees but I have no remit in that area. The D&aacute;il and Seanad jointly established the tribunals &mdash; it was a mutual arrangement. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has ideas about how they will be held in future, should they be needed.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Terry&rsquo;s point, I saw the picture in <i>The Irish Times</i> showing the signing the proclamation. It is a good idea for all the parties to come together so that racism will not be an issue during the local elections.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Cathaoirleach clarified this issue earlier. The board is an independent body and, therefore, we cannot tell it what it should or should not agree. That is how the board was set up under legislation. The Senator referred to the 300 units agreed by Fingal County Council near the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn raised the issue of the bogus certification of births, about which I do not know.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It was reported in the national media.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Not much escapes the national media. However, I did not pick up on that issue. I will ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs <Col N="1950"/>about it. I take the Senator&rsquo;s point that it is fine to pay child benefit but not for bogus babies. I cannot understand this because one must give various details when one registers a birth.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Somebody got away with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like the bogus accounts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris said we should stop bellyaching about An Taisce because it is a guardian of our planning rights. He proposed that the House should not take the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 today because it discriminates against gay spouses. The Senator also called for the motion on Tibet to be taken as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to the Mental Health Commission and said a total of 3,000 people are involuntarily admitted to mental institutions. A debate on this issue would be worthwhile. The Senator also called on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to discuss the loss of 32,000 manufacturing jobs. However, the unemployment rate is 4.4%, which is a good rate within the European Union. It is a significant plus. Sadly, we are moving on from manufacturing to alternative employment. The strategy is to be ahead of the next trend in employment and to have plans in place to cope with the increased training and education that will be required. I fully agree it is sad to lose manufacturing jobs. I was involved in such issues when I was in the other House. It is extremely sad for men and women who have spent a number of years in one job. However, retraining, upskilling and reskilling is the strategy for now and an unemployment rate of 4.4% represents a fine record.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry seconded Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment, particularly in regard to the treatment of widows and widowers.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised the current position in Kosovo and called on the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House. It would be useful to raise this issue as an Adjournment matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan referred to statements on the draft guidelines on rural housing, which is still on the Order Paper. We will resume the debate as quickly as possible. He also asked about next week&rsquo;s business. I hope to elucidate on that tomorrow. He has got himself into a nice habit, which is not bad. He usually asks on Thursday what the following week will be like in terms of business. I will outline it, in so far as I can, on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>

   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Minister shall give consideration to reversing the cuts imposed on those in receipt of widows/widowers pension and those in receipt of one parent family payments.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This issue was debated at length on Second Stage. Several Members on the benches opposite spoke in support of the principle which informs this amendment. It addresses the disgraceful cuts which have been meted out to widows, widowers and single parents. The matter was discussed in the D&aacute;il last night and has been debated by the public over the airwaves for the last number of weeks.</P>
    <P>The cut involves a paltry &euro;5.8 million yet it will cause hardship to widows. This has been confirmed by the widow&rsquo;s association, members of which the Minister for Social and Family Affairs met last night. I call on the Minister to consider rescinding the decision to make these cuts and returning to the <i>status quo</i> to allow widows to claim half benefit. I also call also on Members opposite to support the amendment as their remarks on Second Stage were in a similar vein to its thrust, or will they act in their usual manner by speaking for something only to vote against it? It is the typical Fianna F&aacute;il method.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We saw it with the GAA players only last week. The Fianna F&aacute;il Members who <Col N="1953"/>ran outside to have their photographs taken with the players returned to the House to vote against the proposal they told the people they would support. These circumstances are similar, which is why I ask the Members opposite to put up or shut up on this issue.</P>
    <P>The widow&rsquo;s association has made its point to the Minister and we ask her to admit the cut is a mistake. She should return to the position as it was before January. It is a simple request involving a group of people to whom the Minister has said priority should be given. If we can prioritise Punchestown and other projects, surely we can prioritise widows.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept these amendments and return to the widows what they are due. If people pay contributions, they should be entitled to get the benefit of them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support what Senator Cummins said. This is a mean-minded proposal. Will the Minister tell the House what is the motivation and the morality behind it? What is the reasoning and justification for it? Is it merely tidying up in order to save certain small sums of money, and they are pathetically small? The editorial in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> said it is taking away the widows&rsquo; mite. It really is a mean cut.</P>
    <P>While I agree with Senator Cummins, it is a little unrealistic to say that the Government Members will speak against this cut and then vote with the Government on it. Of course they will do that. This happens with every Government and every party; it is not simply a characteristic of Fianna F&aacute;il. Regrettably, this is the way the House works. Rather than offending our friends on the Government benches by calling them names, we should be telling them to work as hard as they can to get this changed.</P>
    <P>We all know what is wrong. The Minister has acute political antennae and I have no doubt that she can detect the feeling among Government Members. This cut attacks the most vulnerable people in society. These are not scroungers. I saw elderly women talking about this on television. They, or their husbands, worked all their lives and paid their contributions. It is terrible that it should be taken away.</P>
    <P>I remember getting slight amelioration in a case like this where it too was horribly mean-minded. A brilliant student from the north midlands was due to go to college. He was blind and received a county council grant to pursue a PhD in history. The student was also in receipt of a blind pension and the amount of the education grant was subtracted from this or <i>vice versa</i>. He was told he could not have both full allowances. Why not? While it seems reasonable that everyone should get a low level of support, if an individual deserves a little extra he or she should be allowed to have it. The Minister was able to bend the rules for the case I outlined. The same thing should happen here.</P><Col N="1954"/>
    <P>The Minister for Finance told the D&aacute;il that lawyers at the tribunals earn more at the expense of the State in three days than a widow gets in a year. Under the Constitution we are supposed to be a Christian country. If one wanted to use perverse logic, one could take the inexplicable passage from the New Testament: to those who have shall be given and from those who have not shall be taken away even that which they have. I have never understood what it means. Perhaps the Minister feels it is her Christian duty to punch widows in the eye and rob their handbags. This is more or less what is happening and it is dreadful. The Minister for Finance knows this too; otherwise it was shameless for him to say what he did in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>The case of a widow, Susan McHugh, has been referred to on several occasions recently and appears to have escaped the notice of the Department. She took a case against similar legislation that went to the Supreme Court. The court decided against the Department. When a measure such as this was constitutionally shown to be inappropriate and wrong, it is extraordinary that we should be trying to introduce something similar again.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a sophisticated response to the issue of partners in gay relationships and therefore I will make my point briefly. While the legal apparatus of the State has determined that discrimination exists, the response of the Government is not to address the discrimination directly, but to cure it by legislative sleight of hand. For those reasons, it is bad in principle.</P>
    <P>Based on my own instincts, I am sure the Minister is under pressure from other Departments. Instead of making party political points we should all support her in doing the right thing. I know she wants to do the right thing. I also know that my decent friends on the Government benches want her to do the right thing.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>We must encourage her and, dare I say it, seduce her into doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>One would have to be made of stone not to have been touched by the contributions some widows made on television programmes. There was a lollipop lady who had worked all her life and her husband had also contributed. She is out of work during the summer when the schools are closed. What is she going to do? She is badly affected by this move. An asthmatic woman from Cork was also interviewed and she too will be penalised under these provisions.</P><Col N="1955"/>
    <P>I often wondered how people could afford to buy houses in Palmerston Park. I was told they were barristers.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris, we are on Committee Stage and I think you have made your point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is aware that people are milking the system and earning &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 of taxpayers&rsquo; money per day. Even on non-sitting days, the State is happy enough to give barristers a couple of thousand euro. We are taking a couple of cent from people to whom it really makes a difference. Further thought should be given to this provision and the one that arises later in the Bill. I know this is what the Minister would like to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, I am sorry, I call Senator Ryan. I did not see you raise your hand.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, I did not indicate. I assumed the Leas-Chathaoirleach would call me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What was it if it was not the Senator&rsquo;s hand?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I could do without Senator Norris&rsquo;s assistance.</P>
    <P>I was elected to this House in 1981 and until 1999 served as an Independent Member. I always refrained from claiming moral superiority. I thought being independent was a valid political role and I believe being a party politician is also a valid role. Neither is in a position to claim moral superiority over another. The only difference between Independent Members and party politicians are the issues on which people compromise and the manner in which the compromise is expressed. The suggestion, from one of most eloquent points scorers the Oireachtas has seen in the past 20 years, that attacking the Government in blunt terms is an inferior form of politics called party political point scoring is more than a little ironic. The significance of the widows issue lies first in the capacity to impose extraordinary hardship on a small group of people, which is what the decision will do. Widows to whom I have spoken foresee a future in which the income for which they planned will change spectacularly for the worse.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain the Fianna F&aacute;il party with which I grew up would have had the political antennae and the humanity to resist such a move. I was brought up in a Fianna F&aacute;il household where the biggest boasts were the putting together of a basic social welfare safety net and the construction of public housing. Both these aims were denounced in academic papers in the 1930s as the manifestations of Bolshevism. One would not accuse Fianna F&aacute;il today of the slightest leaning towards Bolshevism. Perhaps the other &ldquo;ism&rdquo; dominant in the 1930s shows up <Col N="1956"/>occasionally, but Bolshevism is long gone from the influences on Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy to see what was the great radical party in this country taken over by the ideology of a party which has only eight D&aacute;il seats, but 95% influence on the Government. This is all about the politics of envy by the well-off. Many people wax eloquent on the politics of envy, but few people in our society are more envious than the very well-off. I do not mean those on significant salaries, but those who fly in and out of the country on private jets, staying away long enough to avoid paying tax in Ireland while remaining in the country long enough to claim credit for their charitable activities. These are people whose entire charitable activities in a year raise only a fraction of the tax they avoid by remaining outside the country. Their politics of envy is a resentment of those whom they believe are doing too well without their personal level of achievement. The issue before us involves one aspect of the politics of envy, concerning a group seen to be slightly better off than the rest of the poor. The intention is to equalise down, and make them all the same, though I do not know in what interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister has frequently said the Department of Finance required certain cuts. One of my Labour Party colleagues spent a good deal of the period from 1992 to 1997 in Government. He said that one of the most awesome performances during his period in Government with Fianna F&aacute;il was the capacity of the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Social Welfare to defend his patch against the Department of Finance. He never allowed the Department to dictate to him that sums of money should be taken from social welfare. That same former Minister is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today as being one of the most eloquent critics at yesterday&rsquo;s Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting of this particular nasty little amendment to the social welfare code, because he knew how to defend his patch.</P>
    <P>A collection of cuts, each of which affected only a small number of people, was cynically assembled, on the assumption that because only small groups were involved, none would have political clout. It is an eloquent commentary on the remoteness of Fianna F&aacute;il from public opinion that it did not understand how an assault on widows would resonate with all decent people. This is not about 2,000 people, but about all those who have seen the struggles of people, women mostly, but also men in recent years, to support their families and themselves with some pride and dignity. There was a sudden, deliberate decision to target a group within that group as a means of saving money on the assumption that a couple of thousand people would not be able to make a fuss.</P>
    <P>That is why Senator Norris is so wrong in appealing to the goodwill on the other side of the Chamber. As these calculated cuts show, the Members over there only understand where the <Col N="1957"/>votes are, and how things can be done without affecting their voter base. That is why this particular issue is causing them so much discomfort. It is now reverberating through the community as an assault on people in a situation we all believe is sufficiently difficult. Living on one&rsquo;s own, supporting a family, struggling after one has lost one&rsquo;s partner in life, is difficult enough without a public statement that one is an anomaly. Whether intended or not, to say to people who have experienced one of the greatest tragedies in life through losing a partner when one is still at a working age, and often still supporting children, as a statement of support, that the situation is an anomaly is effectively to tell these people that they are an anomaly.</P>
    <P>These people are not anomalies. They are people who struggle on, the sort of heroes who make a decent society worthwhile, people whom the Progressive Democrats, which owns Fianna F&aacute;il, would describe in its moments of eloquence as the coping class. I do not know any people who have been better described. Widows and widowers who struggle on, who work and support a family, are by definition the coping class. They are also the poor class, and because there were only 2,000 of them, it was deemed possible to single them out for this treatment.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for a moment the Minister will change her mind today. The Government has made a profound political miscalculation. Either it will change its mind, or the Government will be changed, and if the public decides to change its mind it will do so because it has seen the decision regarding widows as symptomatic of the fact that the Government has moved away from the priorities and considerations of ordinary Irish people, and is now totally taken over by those of the sort of class that has infected Fianna F&aacute;il in the last ten years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I was one of the speakers yesterday who asked the Minister to revisit this decision, which affects a small but vulnerable group of people, widows and widowers who in many cases are struggling. The saving to the Department of Social and Family Affairs is small, and the decision should be revisited. Those in Opposition know well that as Senator Norris pointed out, one can retain one&rsquo;s own views while belonging to a political party. It does not mean one is wrong. However, one must conform to the rules and regulations of the party. If one&rsquo;s Minister and the Government believe that certain measures should be implemented, one goes along with that. It does not mean one agrees with the decision.</P>
    <P>I am amazed to hear in particular Senator Ryan, who now belongs to the Labour Party, and who is very proud of his Fianna F&aacute;il roots&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator should use a better analogy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>From what some Members have said, one would think this cutback was the Opposition&rsquo;s idea and not the Government&rsquo;s. I do not believe the Department of Finance was involved in this cutback. It got through because someone did not keep their eye on the ball. The full implications were not thought out when it was delivered to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I make that charge with full knowledge of the complexity of the social welfare system, having been social welfare spokesperson in the other House for two years.</P>
    <P>Mistakes are made and this is one of them. The proposal was not properly thought out and it must, therefore, be reviewed urgently. Last night, the Minister, after a good meeting with the National Association of Widows in Ireland, said she would come back to it. It will be fine if she says that she will move on this issue over Easter when the Houses are in recess so as not to be seen to be kowtowing to the Opposition before <Col N="1960"/>tonight&rsquo;s vote on a Private Members&rsquo; motion in the D&aacute;il. However, she must clarify the position on the cutback today, particularly in respect of the meeting held last night.</P>
    <P>In her response to the Second Stage debate, she claimed she would look at other ways to resolve this issue. In her reply today, I want her to outline what other ways she is talking about. My prediction yesterday remains the same: the Government will cave in on this proposal. However, the caving in will happen when the House is not in session at Easter so that the full ire of the Opposition cannot be brought to bear. It is important that the widows and widowers know their position on this cutback. It is equally important that the Minister replies to this debate in that vein.</P>
    <P>The argument the Minister&rsquo;s officials are giving her on this proposal is that one cannot be entitled to two schemes. The fundamental tenet of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is that one can get the highest paid scheme but not both. However, former Ministers will receive ministerial and Oireachtas pensions if they are out of the Houses at 50 years of age. They receive two pension schemes which are not delivered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs but which we in both Houses accepted. If the principle for politicians who have gone through the Houses with distinguished service is that they are entitled to an Oireachtas pension and a ministerial pension, the same principle should extend to widows.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when I attempted to extend the free schemes for widows, I was informed that it could not be done as it would open the floodgates and one group cannot be distinguished from another in the social welfare code. If it is the resolve of both Houses that widows are a distinct group of people who must receive support from the social welfare code, then it can be done. It would be a brave Minister to stand up to the advice that she is getting on this issue. The Minister will probably say that the number of people affected by this proposal is minimal. Yet, it could have an effect on 120,000 widows and widowers. This is a growing group. While the figure is relatively small at present, there is huge potential for it to have a negative effect on a significant group of people.</P>
    <P>Before the 2002 election, the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, raided the social insurance fund to the tune of &euro;500 million to ensure that the election was bought. If the Government in 2002 could take &euro;500 million from a fund designated for the workers of this country, I cannot understand why it cannot give the paltry sum of &euro;5.8 million to resolve this issue. The moneys for the social insurance fund come from PRSI contributions. Widows and widowers, as well as their deceased spouses, paid into that system. It should be there for them when they need it most, in their hour of need. This is the kind of measure that highlights that particular hour of need.</P><Col N="1961"/>
    <P>What comfort will the Minister give to the National Association of Widows in Ireland? I ask her to make a statement to the House in respect of her discussions with that group. If she is telling the House that she will make her U-turn on this issue in two weeks, that is fine. We can live with that and will be delighted to hear it on Good Friday. However, I do not want people led further up the garden path on this issue. Senator Wilson&rsquo;s fascinating thesis on the contrasts in the social consciences of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party at constituency level and in the Houses is one I intend to read in the future. However, I do not want his colleagues at the weekend issuing statements to the local newspapers shedding crocodile tears on how awful these cutbacks are and how they will do the divil and all to ensure a U-turn on it while opposing my colleagues&rsquo; amendments to the Bill today.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris suggested earlier that Members should charm the Minister for Social and Family Affairs into changing her mind on this amendment. However, we are not here to charm but to use common sense and fair play on this matter. It is obvious to everyone in the House, including the Minister, that this legislative provision is grossly unfair. It constitutes an attack on the most vulnerable people in the community, particularly widows and widowers who, along with their families, are struggling to cope with the loss of a spouse. We should support such people, who may be trying to keep down a job, but under this Bill they will be punished if they become sick or lose their jobs. It is beyond belief that one should try to punish people in such a manner. Those who will be affected have certain rights because their spouse, who is now deceased, paid PRSI and they may also be making such contributions. It is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that the inclusion of this measure must have been a mistake, as it does not seem to have been properly thought through. It must have slipped through the net because it does not make sense that we should punish these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that people cannot receive two payments. If that is the crux of the problem, it is very easy to address. Rather than cutting people&rsquo;s payments, one can ensure the benefit payment they receive is equal to the level <Col N="1962"/>of unemployment or disability benefit to which anybody else is entitled. I implore the Minister to address this issue. I hope she will demonstrate compassion and fair play in dealing with it and I trust that she will do so. I look forward to hearing her response, which I hope will include an indication that she intends to accept Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
     <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I do not understand why the Minister stands up to say that she sympathises with the problem and with those affected by it and that she will try to address the issue in the coming weeks. It is blatantly obvious to everyone in the House that the issue needs to be addressed. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and to move forward. She can help 2,000 people by making a change that will cost just &euro;5.8 million. Other Ministers, particularly the Minister for Finance who holds the purse strings, are well able to give money to all sorts of people and organisations. I refer in particular to the horse fraternity and others in the sporting world. It is disgraceful that our society works the way it does &mdash; we think it is better to give money to the wealthy racing industry than to look after the most vulnerable in the community. The Minister is probably sick and tired of hearing such comments, but the comment I have made is fair and true. I ask the Minister to address this issue, to redress the balance and to accept this amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendment. I remind the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that this is not the first time widows have been targeted and been made beggars of. I assume the Department of Finance is responsible for the predicament faced by the Minister today. The Department has levied serious inheritance tax on widows in the past. Many widows had to dispose of their property to comply with the Department of Finance&rsquo;s requests at that time. Families were denied the inheritance of a property or, in many cases, a livelihood. We are targeting widows again today.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Department of Finance told the Minister last summer or autumn that every Department had to bring about cuts. Did the Minister&rsquo;s advisors in the Department of Social and Family Affairs tell her, to that end, that double payments would have to be stopped? Approximately 2,000 widows and widowers &mdash; the most vulnerable people in society &mdash; are being targeted as a result of the decision that has been taken. Is the Minister unable to stand up and declare her independence, without being subservient to the Department of Finance? I cannot believe she is yielding to its demand for overall cuts. Somebody in the Minister&rsquo;s Department must have decided it is legitimate to make changes in this area in order to satisfy the Department of Finance. There can be no legitimate reason for the introduction of this cut and many others in the Bill. The cutback being <Col N="1963"/>addressed in this amendment targets a vulnerable group.</P>
    <P>I doubt the sincerity of many Government Senators who say they have pity, who talk about it and who say they will look into it. Such verbiage has to be disposed of so that we can examine directly the problems faced by vulnerable people who are suffering as a result of serious cutbacks. Such people did not recognise the seriousness of the cutbacks until the day on which they received their first payments under the new system. They found then that they were affected by the implementation of the new regulations. They had not imagined that the consequences of the introduction of the system would be so serious.</P>
    <P>It is useless to postpone a final decision or to say it will be examined in some other way. If the Government is determined and willing to recognise the hardship involved in this cutback, it is important for the Minister to indicate clearly that she will restore, by means of some other mechanism and as a matter of urgency, the income that has been lost by this very vulnerable group. For that reason, I ask her to consider seriously the amendment that has been moved by Senator Cummins this morning. The Minister should demonstrate, for once and for all, that she has listened to those who have shown their concerns in a legitimate manner by seeking to meet her. It does not happen often that a representative group wishes to meet the Minister for Social Welfare to discuss a cutback, as the National Association of Widows in Ireland has done in this instance. The Minister can walk away if she wishes.</P>
    <P>This Bill reminds me of the infamous Disability Bill 2001. When a former Minister of State, who was responsible for disability matters at the time, met various disability groups to discuss the Bill, she dug in before she eventually had to abandon it. I think the same thing will happen in this instance. It is important that the Minister should make any announcement in the Oireachtas, rather than holding a media show outside the House. It is important that a decision that affects so many people receives the status it deserves. It should be dealt with in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, rather than being the subject of a press conference.</P>

    <P>Senators have said that I do not have my eye on the ball. References have been made to the <Col N="1964"/>Lower House, to my personality and to the way in which I deal with things. I was not a stone the last time I looked. I have indicated that I do not hold a certain opinion of this House, as I have discovered at long last that perhaps the Upper House is sometimes more human than the Lower House. It is grand that people have expressed their points of view &mdash; people can have points of view. When we talk about moral superiority, however, that should be applied across the board. I have learned with interest about Senator Ryan&rsquo;s upbringing. It is obvious that he did not listen to people at home when they spoke about politics.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan spoke about the German social welfare system.</P>
    <P>If one does a little comparative social policy analysis of our system and that of the Germans one will notice that ours is a more caring society. It is a more caring society than that of France and most other European countries. In most European countries there is no such thing as a one-parent family allowance &mdash; it does not exist. Unemployment benefit is only applicable for a short period. There is no such thing as a free scheme in 90% of European countries, not including the UK.</P>
    <P>We have a unique social system which reflects a major investment. If somebody asked one which Department spends the most money, one might suggest the Department of Health and Children or the Department of Education and Science, but it is actually my Department which has a budget of &euro;11.26 billion.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a reflection of the &euro;630 million additional funding which is being provided this year. This ensures that everyone is treated equally. Everyone received &euro;10. In normal circumstances, certain groups receive more than others. Widows are treated particularly well, although the professor of English down the back will probably kill me for saying this. This reflects our support for them. We gave them a larger increase last year &mdash; &euro;11.60. Invalidity pensioners also received more last year. This is a reflection of our priorities.</P>

	<P>The reality of politics is often totally different from what we talk about on the floor of the House. Mention was made of the politics of envy and the targeting of widows. People&rsquo;s sincerity was cast into doubt. Senators talked about league tables of where people are investing. We could go back and consider where others have had the opportunity to make changes. Other Governments had major opportunities. Senator Ulick Burke spoke about taxation of widows and widowers. He is absolutely correct. That was changed by our Government, not by someone who came down from on high.</P>

	<P>The Government was busy sorting out the mess it had created.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>What else did this Government do? We introduced a major increase in the widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s contributory pension and non-contributory pension. The first time widowers were recognised was 1997. I do not know, but I think we were in Government that day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct. My father died in 1950, but if my mother had died my father would have received a housekeeper&rsquo;s allowance. The Minister is not correct in that respect.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1966"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The widower&rsquo;s means-tested pension was first introduced in 1997. We introduced a widowed parent&rsquo;s grant in December 1999, initially of &euro;1,270 and which I increased to &euro;2,700 this year. That is a recognition of the difficulties faced by certain people. The capital assessment arrangements of my Department have been completely changed to benefit widowers who have made contributions. After-death arrangements have been expanded to include everyone. Free schemes, bereavement counselling and so on have been available to support this vulnerable group.</P>
    <P>There are 120,000 widows in this country. Of these, 70% are over 66. Very few widows are working.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a good discussion with members of the widows&rsquo; association last night. They told me what they wanted done and what needed to be changed. They recognised that the issue of widows over 66 was now being sorted out. The anomaly was dealt with in the last Social Welfare Bill. They stated, and I agree, that for widows under 66 the baseline payment is very poor. They receive &euro;140 per week. I provided an assurance in consultation with them that we would consider the baseline payment.</P>
    <P>Many people, from what I can ascertain, are still not aware of family income supplement. It is a very good scheme and one which I support. I indicated, given that the widows&rsquo; association does not have a database, that I would use my database to contact all widows and widowers regarding this.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback to hear that people did not feel they should apply for mortgage interest relief or rent supplement if there was a change of circumstance. I tried to allay any concerns in this <Col N="1967"/>regard. Contrary to how things were in the Dark Ages, these people are professional and have fine offices and applicants can be dealt with confidentially. I asked them to consider that on the basis of other changes in circumstances. I agreed to evaluate what they had to say and return to them with my conclusions. One is criticised when one does not meet people and also when one does. One is criticised for not getting back to people, but when one does get back to people one is also criticised. I met the members of the association and I promised them I would return to them personally with my conclusions and that we would have further interactions.</P>
    <P>I meet every group in civil society at least once a year. On an ongoing basis, I have had several discussions with interested groups. I meet carers on a regular basis as I try to formulate a carers&rsquo; policy. I have met the widows&rsquo; association. I meet the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and all the housing organisations. I met the new organisation for one-parent families with which Senator Henry is associated. I have had many opportunities to listen to and consider people&rsquo;s concerns. People may not agree, but I still believe it is my duty to listen to what people have to say. I have given the assurance that I would do so. I am not in a position to do anything until such time as we have completed the Social Welfare Bill and the European conference is completed. At that stage I will return to the widows&rsquo; association with my conclusions.</P>
    <P>People have made fair points during the debate, but some incorrect facts have been circulated. Widows do not pay PRSI on any of their pension incomes nor do they pay PRSI on amounts up to &euro;287 per week. They do not pay a 2% contribution towards the health levy which was removed by the Government. It is important that those points&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They paid into the same fund.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>They did but we are talking about an individual entitlement and unlike everyone else in the State, they do not pay PRSI on amounts up to &euro;287 per week.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question raised by the case of McHugh <i>v.</i> the Department of Social Welfare. The case was heard in the High Court in 1990. It was appealed and a decision was handed down in 1992. It was to do with a regulation made by the Minister for Social Welfare in 1987 about overlapping payments. That case was taken and under the regulation, the implication was that they were seen as <i>ultra vires</i> in that the Minister did not have the power to remove an entitlement to payment which is given in the primary legislation by way of secondary legislation. That was changed in the Social Welfare Act 1991. Therefore, the primary and secondary legislation are at one. It was on that basis that a new provision was passed in the 1991 <Col N="1968"/>Act, where, under the Consolidation Act, new provisions provided that where a person has an entitlement to more than one social welfare payment at any one time, only one is payable. It was reverted back in that legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to read into the record of the House the comments of the judges in that case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Supreme Court ruled that the 1987 regulations were <i>ultra vires </i>and that the Minister did not have the power to remove an entitlement to payment which is given in the primary legislation by way of secondary legislation. In addition, the court ruled that in making these regulations which took away entitlements to half-rate DB but left entitlement to half-rate UB intact, the Minister acted in an unreasonable manner. That is a point of view.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They had a lot more than that to say.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all I have.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have a protracted historical argument but, at the end of the day, the primary legislation was rectified to such an extent that the overlapping benefit regulation was encompassed in the Social Welfare Act 1991.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that people are making sincere comments, despite the fact that we are having some political banter about a number of things. On this occasion, I am not in a position to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 4.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the Minister. She spoke at length but spent very little time on the amendment which calls for a reversal of the cuts. I am delighted she met the National Association of Widows in Ireland and that it was an amicable meeting but if the Minister is saying that she will examine the base line payments for widows aged under 66 years, it will be in terms of next year&rsquo;s social welfare Bill, which is 12 months away.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no respite at all from the cutbacks if the Minister is trying to take the sting out of this issue by talking about the situation in 12 months time. We will not allow that to happen.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1969"/>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We believe this should be amended now. The Minister stated yesterday that the social insurance fund is &euro;1.6 billion in surplus. Surely the measly amount of money that is required can be taken from the social insurance fund to pay the widows? It was raided previously for election purposes and it could be done at this stage to help widows. We intend to press the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister is not made out of stone. She is a very decent human being and she is a good Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am going to be hammered now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>She is in an unfortunate position at present because, unquestionably, she is being squeezed by some tough guys around the place in other Departments. I point out to the Minister that I did not engage in any partisan action and I specifically made that point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say the Senator did so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I felt it was a mistake. We should all support the Minister in trying to get an easement of this situation. I understand that political parties would wish to do that and to exploit a situation but my concern is not with partisan advantage in which I have no interest anyway, apart from the fact that it would not benefit me one way or the other &mdash; I am quite open about it. The real nub of the question is the widows who are involved.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful that the Minister opened up the question of the McHugh case &mdash; I referred to it as McKeown but it is McHugh. What she did not refer to &mdash; I acknowledge they were not supplied to her with the papers &mdash; were the very trenchant comments of the judges in the Supreme Court. I cannot remember the exact words of the judgment but they said it was mean, cowardly, unjustifiable and immoral. They used an extraordinary collection of adjectives to describe what the Government was then doing and the principle is exactly the same. That was found initially to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is wrong to try to redress a situation with subsequent legislation. In my opinion, as a lay person &mdash; I am not a lawyer but I am extremely litigious &mdash; I would imagine that if a principle was found to be unconstitutional in one case and the Minister has produced a similar new legislative form, if it was tested in the courts it would be found to be unconstitutional again, as it was in the McHugh case and I do not think that has been completely addressed.</P>
    <P>To deal with the other arguments made by the Minister, I accept there have been massive improvements. I remember the situation &mdash; I am in my sixtieth year to Heaven, as the poet, Dylan Thomas, would say &mdash; and I have seen in my <Col N="1970"/>lifetime massive improvements due to the work of the voluntary agencies, the Civil Service and Ministers of different complexions. However, as I understand the argument now being made by the Minister, it seems to rely almost on numbers, that there is a small number of people involved. I may be misinterpreting the Minister but she stated that there is only a small number of widows still working. I do not think it matters. If there are only five of them it would still be an injustice. An injustice is an injustice that attaches to the individual. I have never been impressed by a numbers game and it makes it worse because there is less sense of collegial grouping around the people who are victimised.</P>
    <P>The Minister is isolating a tiny number of people. Her figures state that only a small number of widows are also working but then why does she persecute them? It is like the blasted tax laws. They go after the unfortunate little creatures who made some kind of an error and they let Goodman and all the rest of them skite off with unpaid tax bills of various kinds. It is dreadful. The Minister stated that only 7% have child dependants. That is a numbers game argument. Does it mean that one can be unjust to a number below 10%? The Minister seems to accept that there is a problem with the<Miles com="jy"/>7% but she is saying that she has looked after 93%. It would be a good day&rsquo;s work to look after the 7%. The point has been made, which I regard as reasonable, that although we understand we are in a period when the Government collectively has decided it is in the best interests of the nation that there should be a cutback in public expenditure, and that is a wise decision, we need to be careful where the cutbacks fall. In a situation where the amount of saving is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I apologise for putting the Senator off his stride.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have to admit that but it was done in the nicest possible way. To return to the numbers game, the Minister admitted that the amounts are so small that it is not even a practical saving of any real significance. When put in the context of the enormous budget which the Minister has, it is a pity that these groups are targeted. The Minister is probably correct in saying we have a more humane system here than in many other European countries. We should be proud of that and should encourage these countries to take our approach. We should not use it as a defence for cutting it back. Some European countries are awful in the way they <Col N="1971"/>treat their citizens and appear to be veering towards the awful American system. I do not want to go down that road.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to continue with the work she is doing well. In this situation a small number of people are adversely affected. I hope the Minister can see her way to examining it again. She should not think that because it affects only 7% of the population it does not matter. The Church of Ireland, of which I am a member, has been extremely well treated by the State. Why is that? We comprise only 2% of population. We could be forgotten about and written off. We do not meet the 10% requirement. Indeed, we are so well treated, for example, in terms of the provision of money for schools, that some of the others are bellyaching about it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister takes the correct position on the amendment because it will not solve the kernel of the issue. At their meeting yesterday, the Minister gave a commitment to the widows&rsquo; association to look at the position. She went into the meeting with an open mind and has looked at all the issues that have been identified, including baseline payments and providing more information to people to ensure they get all the payments to which they are entitled, whether widows or not.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Norris is valid and the Minister will understand it. I have no doubt it is not about a numbers game. I accept the decision was made last autumn and winter in the context of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>It is important that all the changes made to the social welfare system are based on equity and fairness. The underlying principle which has been quoted on a number of occasions by the Department of Social and Family Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator is backtracking on what she said yesterday.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; is that only one payment can be made to an individual. That principle is not correct. I have had this argument since I became a Member in 1997. We cannot have a blanket rule such as that, especially given that because of certain and family circumstances, people have different needs. It is not a numbers game, but amendments Nos. 1 and 4 are not the solution to the problem. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides and her commitment to re-evaluate the position and to come back to the widow&rsquo;s association and the Houses on it.</P>

Was it because she did not notice that she was poorly advised or that it was one of the easier decisions to make? We are in precisely the same position as we were before. We do not know why this was done, we can only speculate. I have my own interpretation, as have others. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s reason but she did not give us one.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report:</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) contrasting the increase in 2003 of the Consumer Price Index with the</P>
    <P LI="3">increases paid to the entitled persons under the Act of 2003;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) evaluating the suitability and appropriateness of the items and</P>
    <P LI="3">weightings used by the Central Statistics Office in computing the rates of increase in the Consumer Price Index to the needs of the principal category of entitled persons under the Principal Act; and</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) setting out the Department&rsquo;s assessment of those groups potentially</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par ="0p8"/><Miles com="ix"/>most seriously affected by significant inflationary pressures which may arise because of internal and external factors in 2004.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">The amendment is concerned with the consumer price index which, in many instances, takes into consideration luxury items such as cars and holidays. However, the increases that affect the poor are mostly increases in the price of electricity, food and other items. Those areas should be taken into account for those on social welfare and luxury items should be omitted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a number of discussions on the indexation and methodology which determines inflation and prices. The CPI has been used extensively and it encompasses a huge number of items, not just luxury items but basic items also. There are 55,000 prices accumulated over 1,000 different items so it is a very extensive methodology and we do not have the ability to prepare for any change to be made to it. It is the most appropriate methodology for looking at price indexes and any change in it would not be fruitful. We have a base line set for the CPI and we make determinations on that <Col N="1974"/>basis. It is levelled against our inflation figures. Given the extensive professional appreciation and acceptance of the CPI, any change in its methodology would not benefit anyone and there is no necessity at present to do so.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall establish an internal Departmental committee t assess the extent to which the amounts provided for in <i>subsection (1) </i>adequately meet or assist in meeting the costs of maintaining a child in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The amount of money it costs to maintain a child was debated on Second Stage. We have had various reports on child poverty and we still have children who are not getting a hot meal every day. This amendment seeks to set an amount which would adequately meet or assist in meeting the cost of maintaining a child.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an interdepartmental committee working on the child poverty initiative which is part of Sustaining Progress. We are looking at income maintenance as part of that. Part of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is dealt with in an ongoing way because within the Department we prepare for discussions on that kind of evaluation and policy direction. That is taking place at present. The agreed view is that dealing with child poverty from an income base must take in the totality of income supports and is not necessarily just about child benefit. Though the universality of that measure benefits all children it is fairly targeted at children in poverty.</P>
    <P>We are currently working on the initiative set on in the amendments as part of Sustaining Progress. Internally a committee is evaluating child poverty and a special child poverty initiative is also being undertaken.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 4, before section 5, the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report indicating the likely number of persons who would benefit if the carer&rsquo;s allowance was extended in whole or in part to persons already in receipt of payments under the Principal Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with people on pensions who are looking after a family member. At present if they receive one payment they are not entitled to another social welfare payment, so we are back to where we were with the widows. This area should be examined, particularly the situation of carers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the thrust of Senator Cummins&rsquo; amendment and it is important that this is kept under continuous review. On Second Stage, the Minister mentioned ongoing reviews and her ongoing commitment to reform of the social welfare system. We are continually looking at carers in particular and on Second Stage we discussed how we can make payments to carers &mdash; nursing home subventions, carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit &mdash; as effective as possible in order to reflect the kind of environment we want for our old people. This is not the vehicle for such changes. I would be delighted to discuss these issues in the future and I have no doubt the Minister would be happy to come back and do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are looking at the numbers who would benefit from changes in means testing. At present the cost of abolishing the carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is estimated at &euro;180 million. There are almost 21,000 carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance at a cost of &euro;183 million and Senators will know there have been huge changes in the income disregards.</P>
    <P>For the first time, as a result of the census, we have some real statistics from the CSO on the number of persons providing unpaid personal care for a friend or family member with a long term illness, health problem or disability. We analysed those figures, which were available from 15 October 2003, and we found that 40,500 people provide 43 hours or more unpaid personal help per week, or approximately six hours per day, while 23,400 provide between 15 and 42 hours unpaid personal help per week, which is between two and six hours per day. In addition, 84,900 people provide between one and 14 hours per week, which is approximately two hours per day. Currently 22,000 people receive carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit, which means that 34% of the 64,000 people estimated by the CSO to be caring <Col N="1976"/>for over two hours per day are in receipt of a specific carer&rsquo;s payment from the Department.</P>
    <P>The carers issue was part of a report provided by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs and, contrary to what the Chairman feels, I took up one of the policy initiatives last week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not cross the Chairman.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not going to cross the Chairman. He was bemused that I would not do anything but I said I would and last week I provided funding from the information side for one of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. We will take that into consideration for the next budget.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>We are well within the programme for Government target for carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit and hopefully we will reach the target next year. That said, caring is a long term issue, especially in view of the huge change in the demographic profile in the next 20 years. That will not only impact on pensions but on caring. There has been considerable discussion of this issue and how to pay for it. We participated in the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s evaluation of home care and subvention. I will shortly be in a position to examine the issue of financing long-term care. The Nordic countries, for example, provide specifically for caring through the PRSI system at an older age, and I may have to evaluate that system. Recommendations have been made as to how we can fund long-term care, one of which involves a PRSI increase. I have not yet made a determination as to how we will do this. The matter will have to be considered through an evaluation, and different methodologies will not suit everyone.</P>
    <P>We have made tremendous changes, including increased supports for carers and it is my intention to continue doing so. The increase in the income disregard this year has not only been beneficial to new applicants but, equally, it has supported people who are currently in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit, in that they may receive an increased payment accordingly. It is a big issue which we will all have to tackle, regardless of our political perspectives because at the end of the day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While I echo some of his frustrations in the implementation of these matters, I have explained to the House the implications of the <Col N="1977"/>changes.

  <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;7&mdash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report:</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) setting out the mechanisms by which family income supplement could be paid through the tax system, the estimated additional numbers of entitled persons who would benefit from such a change and the estimated cost of such additional take-up; and</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) evaluating the potential number of beneficiaries under family income supplement if self-employed persons were to qualify for participation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In referring to her negotiations with the National Association of Widows in Ireland, the Minister said many widows were not aware of the provisions in the family income supplement. Many people are not aware of how that supplement works. Rather than being considered by the public as a hand-out, the FIS should be incorporated into the tax system so that people should not have to seek such entitlements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group was established to examine the role refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare systems. This examination included the possibility of paying FIS through the tax system. Both issues are closely related since a substantial number of FIS claimants have income which comes below the tax exemption limit appropriate to their family size. In order for such families to benefit from a tax credit system, the payment would have to be in the form of a refundable tax credit. Entitlement to FIS is not solely determined on the basis of the claimant&rsquo;s current earnings; account is also taken of family size, hours worked and duration of employment, as well as any earnings from the spouse or partner, where relevant. Not all of this information is currently available through tax returns made to the Revenue Commissioners. The system is, therefore, not capable of automatically <Col N="1978"/>identifying households with an entitlement to FIS.</P>
    <P>In addition, the family income supplement&rsquo;s application is immediate whereas a return from the tax system is from the previous year. My Department has considered that point, arising from the deliberations that have taken place. We have examined ways of increasing awareness of family income supplement, which is referred to in the child benefit books. I agree with the Senator that we should state that FIS is an entitlement, not a hand-out.</P>
    <P>Employees may be concerned that employers would know that they had made an application to the Department for a payment, but we have to get beyond that point. I have undertaken to examine new ways of encouraging people to apply for family income supplement. We have made a number of changes concerning it. For example, it is no longer taken as a means with regard to rent supplement. While all those changes are important, I share the Senator&rsquo;s view that we must reach out to people to ensure they will apply for family income supplement. Perhaps, as public representatives, we should re-examine this matter.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 17 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris is not currently in the Chamber but earlier he was giving us lectures about not being too political concerning these matters. Given his capacity to politicise the most extraordinary things, however, I am not sure about that.</P>
    <P>I accept the movement of people within the European Union, particularly the expanded EU, is an issue that needs to be sorted out but it deserves to be done by proper analysis. I want to ask the Minister about the concept of habitual residence. How does she propose to justify under European law a discrimination between how we deal with citizens of the United Kingdom and others? I emphasise the term &ldquo;under European law&rdquo;, so let us forget about the British-Irish <Col N="1979"/>common travel areas. How does she propose to justify treating citizens of the United Kingdom differently from citizens of France and Denmark, for example, leaving alone the accession countries for the moment?</P>
    <P>What about people who are here because we essentially invited them to come to do jobs that we can not get others to do? One part of the Government says that we have to accept, welcome and encourage immigration because of demographics and our extraordinary economic growth. It is a fact that there are employment sectors which are predominantly staffed by people who in some cases are non-nationals of the existing or expanded EU, and in other cases are nationals of the existing EU. Since we have an unemployment rate of 4.4%, if such people do not come here businesses will suffer dramatically. What will happen to these people if, after six months here they find themselves out of a job? Are we asking them to come here first and then telling them to go home? They will not do so, unless they are covered by social insurance in their own countries. I am intrigued to know what will happen to Danish people, for example, who do not have a social insurance scheme, do not pay PRSI and where funding is through taxation. Will Danish citizens be therefore treated differently?</P>
    <P>I have three questions. First, what is the position on the anomaly relating to countries such as Denmark? Second, will the Minister clarify the discrimination between citizens of one EU country and the rest of the EU? I fully accept the State is entitled to treat everybody else as badly as it treats its own citizens but I do not accept the State is entitled to treat the citizens of 23 countries one way and the citizens of one country on its own another way. That is discrimination.</P>
    <P>Third, how many other member states require habitual residence before parents are entitled to child benefit or its equivalent? My secretary contacted the embassies of member states in Dublin regarding the issue of child benefit. I am not playing poor mouth on this because I do not have the resources of the Department but my secretary and I could not find a member state which applies a habitual residence requirement for entitlement to child benefit. Anybody who is legally entitled to reside in Germany or the Netherlands is entitled to apply for child benefit immediately, according to the information supplied by their embassies. Why is the State dealing with this issue differently? Why is it saying to immigrants who travel with children or who have children when they are here, &ldquo;You are different, you are not entitled to child benefit. We want you to work and pay taxes here but you are not entitled to child benefit for two years.&rdquo;?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The habitual residence test is available in several EU member states. However, Ireland has never insisted on legal status within the EU. For example, if one wishes to work in Belgium, one must seek permission to live there <Col N="1980"/>and, as a consequence, one can apply for a bank account and so on. The habitual residence test will apply to all EU citizens, including ourselves, and it only applies in the common travel area. In other words, if one has lived in the UK, that country&rsquo;s habitual residence requirement of two years can be taken into consideration if one applies in Ireland. This is a special bilateral reciprocal arrangement to which the State is entitled.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister explain that?</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>All member states can enter into bilateral social welfare arrangements because people cannot be a burden on the state. Everyone who travels to work in Ireland and brings their families will receive child benefit.</P>
    <P>The habitual residence requirement is not necessarily two years; that is only a guideline. Other guidelines include the length and continuity of residence, the employment prospects of the individuals, why they are coming to Ireland, their future intentions and centres of interest. For example, if a person is working on a building site, falls and breaks his leg and is out for six months, it will be expected he will return to his employment. These guidelines are based on EU judgments to evaluate habitual residence. The test will be applied on a case by case basis. If the person who is injured, for example, can show he will return to work, he will be entitled to assistance until he does so. It is on that basis the Department will deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>Under the Danish system, people collect assistance but they are still covered by regulation 1408 of 1971, which provides that people can transfer their benefits from one country to another. The principle still applies where there is free movement of people. French and Polish people will not be treated differently. The test is being introduced as a full change under our social welfare code and not under the accession treaty, similar to several other countries.</P>
    <P>Applicants will receive child benefit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why will they receive child benefit?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>They will if they are working here.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because the habitual residence test only applies to people who are not working and wish to avail of social welfare assistance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit is not assistance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>If one is legally working in the State, one is entitled to child benefit.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1981"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse my ignorance but I cannot find that provision in the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation provides for a habitual residence requirement. There will be free movement of labour and people will have the same entitlements as Irish citizens. However, if one applies for social assistance under means tested schemes, one must meet the habitual residence requirement.</P>
    <P>All citizens of the new accession states can live in Ireland as long as they are not a burden on the State. A number may transfer their pensions with them but they will have to take other issues into consideration, such as the standard of living and housing costs. One cannot travel here and be a burden on the State. If people travel here, apply to a CWO for social assistance and are not entitled to it, they will be repatriated following consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform if that is what they want. People who travel to work here will have the same benefits as every worker in the State. The difference relates to social assistance and this is the first time the habitual residence requirement has been adopted. The UK adopted it almost ten years ago and the test is based on sound EU law.</P>
    <P>A Council of Ministers meeting was held two weeks ago. A case was taken by an American man, Francis Brian Collins, who held Irish citizenship, to vindicate his social welfare rights in the UK and the court dismissed his legal argument. The legislation will stand up on that basis. It had been criticised on the basis that it would not stand up to scrutiny under European law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Which court was involved?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Court of Justice. The decision was made yesterday. The habitual residence requirement can be introduced but it must apply to every EU citizen, including our own. Guidelines will be set and, on the basis of previous European court judgments, the Department can deal with this issue on a case by case basis. For example, Irish citizens returning from the US may be in a difficult legal position because they did not pay social insurance contributions. If they move back here lock, stock and barrel, put their children into schools and seek employment having previously had a centre of interest, they will able to prove a habitual residence requirement.</P>
    <P>Guidelines are being determined under EU case law and departmental staff will be trained on the basis that this is a new requirement and it will be important to advise public representatives and CICs when they are finalised on what will be required to prove habitual residence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister because, as she has often done in the past, she has educated me. This is complicated legislation and I do not think <Col N="1982"/>we have debated it excessively. I take it that the reference to section 193 in Schedule 1 to a qualified person applies to people who would otherwise be technically qualified for social assistance and that is how people who are at work are still entitled to child benefit because they are not qualified persons for social assistance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, exactly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When somebody from an accession country who comes here to work and loses his or her job after a couple of months, does he or she lose the child benefit?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The assumption is that the person would try to find another job. My view is that the majority will come here to work. They are thrifty, tenacious and vibrant workers and would be able to find other work reasonably quickly, putting some of our own people to shame. We categorise people in the labour market as active or inactive and &ldquo;active&rdquo; in the labour market means that somebody is available for and looking for work and on the basis that he or she lost the job through no fault, he or she would be in receipt of interim payments, similar to any other &ldquo;active&rdquo; citizen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person loses his or her job, through no fault of his or her own, will he or she be sent back or how long may he or she stay here?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody can be sent back. People who find themselves in long-term need of assistance may be facilitated. We do not interact too much with people on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit for a period of between six week to three months. After three months, there is an application form to ensure that persons are available for and genuinely seeking work and similar provisions will apply to them. Of course, particular issues will arise, but everyone will be treated equally under the active labour market provisions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a separate question, is there empirical evidence that these provisions are needed, either on the experience of other countries in the past or the experience of the EU, when East and West Germany united and suddenly 20 million impoverished East German became citizens of the European Union? Is there evidence that the so-called &ldquo;benefit tourism&rdquo; has taken place, apart from the hysteria reported in<i> The Daily Mail</i> and its equivalent in this country?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a bot&uacute;n during a press conference where I wrongly accused one of the members of the press for being responsible for that hysteria. I did not mean him personally, but the reported assumption that everyone in the world would move. There was an assumption that more than 1 million people would have moved with the accession of Spain, Portugal and Greece, <Col N="1983"/>but that did not happen. However, a serious issue is that in the accession states, the media headline would encourage people to come without being properly educated on the cost of and standard of living, housing and so on. For some reason under accession treaties, countries may make legal changes but they do not have to advise the Commission. The Commissioner has set up a technical group to look at the full evaluation. Nobody has all the information. European Union countries, apart from Britain and Ireland, are changing their labour law as well as social welfare law. Some countries are introducing quotas or something similar to a work permit system. Based on empirical evidence, the view is that 1% of the European population will move. We would all agree that in the main the people who move are single young people looking for a job. Given that we have a common travel area with the United Kingdom, we have followed the British lead and persons must meet a habitual residency requirement in order to get social assistance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there similar provisions for habitual residency in other European countries?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Other countries would have more extensive provisions in that there will be a quota on the number of people allowed to work in the country as well as major restrictions on access to welfare payments. Last week I visited Italy, where I spoke to Mr. Moroni. His difficulty is that in northern Italy, part of a town is in Italy and the rest in Albania and people walk across so he will have to seek a bilateral agreement for that. There will be idiosyncrasies everywhere. They have restricted access to labour as opposed to social assistance, because in their view labour is the issue. People in Italy are reliant on people from neighbouring countries coming to work. It is an evolving issue. Britain and Ireland are the only two countries with no restrictions on the free movement of labour.</P>

  <P Just="Center" el="10">NEW SECTION.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 10, before section 18, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;18.&mdash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report setting out revised targets for the full implementation of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment refers to the targets for the full implementation of the national anti-poverty <Col N="1984"/>strategy. In Sustaining Progress it was promised that child poverty would be eliminated by 2007. We are tabling this amendment to find out if the targets have been revised and the provisions being made to eliminate poverty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The NAPS programme was evaluated last year by the European Commission, which carried out a peer review on best practice. The European Community noted that MABS is one of best practice and a number of colleague have come to look at the setting up of the system. Last year we evaluated the entire NAPS, which includes income, education, housing and health targets. We have to a considerable extent reached some of the income related targets, for example the target that the old age pension would be increased to &euro;200. Another target was to increase in 2002 terms the baseline payment of &euro;150 and that is being progressed by &euro;10 each year. We have made steady progress on meeting our targets during the lifetime of the Government. I believe one has to have targets to work towards if one is sincere in addressing the issue of poverty. A former Minister, not of my party, was the first to decide to introduce a national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The conclusion of this business was ordered for 1.30 p.m. and I must put the following question: &ldquo;That amendment No. 11 is hereby negatived and, in respect of each of the sections and Schedules not disposed of, that the section or Schedule as appropriate is hereby agreed to in committee; that the Title is hereby agreed to in committee and that the Bill is accordingly reported to the House; Fourth Stage is hereby completed; and the Bill is hereby received for final consideration and passed.&rdquo;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a disgrace. We are a Parliament and it is our duty under the Constitution to discuss these amendments. We are being prevented today from discussing matters which are before the House. I do not accept it. It is my responsibility as an elected Member of this Parliament to discuss amendments. If we are not to be allowed to do so, I challenge the question. I will not sit down. I ask that we take the rest of the amendments. We have put amendments down which we are not <Col N="1986"/>allowed to discuss. We should be allowed to table them again on Report Stage, but we cannot. I insist that we do our parliamentary duty. We are expected to examine these amendments. It is a disgrace. One can take whatever view one wishes for political reasons.</P>

	<P>The Leader indicated that she was prepared to change the Order of Business of the House, which she is entitled to do.

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">2.&mdash;The Principal Act is amended by inserting the following section after section 468:</P>
    <P LI="3">468A&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par="2p6"/><Miles com="ix"/>&ldquo;the consumer price index number&rdquo; means the All Items Consumer Price Index Number compiled by the Central Statistics Office;</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="is" par="2p6"/><Miles com="ix"/>&ldquo;The consumer price index number relevant to any year of assessment&rdquo; means the consumer price index number at mid-September before the commencement of that year expressed on the basis that the consumer price index at mid-September 2002, was 100.</P>
    <P LI="3">(2) For the purpose of computing the amount of any tax credit or allowance in sections 461, 461A, 462, 462A, 463, 464, 465, 466, 466A, 467 and 468 to a person, each sum referred to as a tax credit or <Col N="1988"/>allowance shall be adjusted by the higher of either&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="4">(<i>a</i>) such sum as shall be prescribed by law, or</P>
    <P LI="4">(<i>b</i>) such sum as to which it shall be adjusted by multiplying it by the figure (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the multiplier&rdquo;).</P>
    <P LI="3">(3) (<i>a</i>) The Revenue Commissioners shall make regulations specifying the multiplier and shall make corresponding regulations in each subsequent year of assessment.</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) The multiplier, in the year of assessment 2004, or any subsequent year of assessment, shall be quotient, rounded up to 3 decimal places, obtainable by dividing the consumer price index relevant to the year of assessment by the consumer price index number relevant to the immediately preceding year of assessment.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and his officials back to the House. This recommendation seeks the automatic indexation of tax credits. This is currently not the case and the Fine Gael Party believes it should be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Finance and his officials.</P>
    <P>I beg leave to doubt whether the Fine Gael Party actually believes tax credits should be indexed. Whenever it is in Government again, I doubt it will implement such a practice. It is <Col N="1989"/>essential for the Minister for Finance to have a degree of flexibility. At times, it may be possible for him to do much more than indexing. At others, it may be appropriate not to index at all and to concentrate, as in this year, on the minimum wage when resources are limited. This recommendation would be contrary to all principles of good public finance management. It is essential that the Minister&rsquo;s hands are not tied. No Fine Gael Minister for Finance would wish to have his or her hands tied in such a manner.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mansergh must have taken my speaking notes. However, I will outline why I cannot accept Senator Browne&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this recommendation is the indexation of certain tax credits. Such a move could be costly for the Exchequer depending on the indexation factors in the given year. For example, taking the September figure of 2.9%, representing the fairly modest rate of growth in the CPI for 2003 over 2002, the full cost of indexing the release would be &euro;80 million in a full year and &euro;56 million for 2004. Clearly, the mandatory earmarked tax expenditure at such a scale will severely limit the Government&rsquo;s flexibility in determining budgetary priorities having regard to the economic realities in any given year. No Minister for Finance would wish to be so constrained.</P>
    <P>It is important the Government retains the maximum flexibility as to the size of the personal income tax package, as against other priorities, for the composition of the budget proposals for any particular year. For example, in this year&rsquo;s budget, the income tax package amounted to a full year cost of &euro;287 million of which &euro;282 million was used to ensure that 90% of the increased minimum wage continues to be exempt from taxation. On the other hand, it was necessary to allocate resources equivalent to a full year cost of &euro;630 million for social welfare purposes. The tax expenditure was predetermined to the extent that to accept this recommendation it would be more difficult, if not impossible, to target limited resources, as was done this year. Senator Browne may wish to note, however, that the indexation of credits alone to the consumer price index in budget 2004 would have delivered significantly less of a budget tax package in 2004 than was actually spent. From the figures already quoted, the difference would be nearly &euro;207 million in full year terms.</P>
    <P>The overriding aims of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary and economic policy as set out in An Agreed Programme for Government are clear. The Government is committed to sustaining economic growth, strengthening and maintaining the competitive position of the economy while maintaining full employment. Responsible fiscal policies are central to the achievement of these aims. It is not clear that locking the Exchequer into an annual indexation of tax credits would be consistent with this approach. The Government <Col N="1990"/>already has policy priorities in place over its present term of office with regard to personal taxation, including the achievement that all those on the national minimum wage are removed from the tax net and ensuring that 80% of all earners pay tax only at the standard rate. However, the achievement of these aims is subject to the overarching requirement of sound economic and fiscal policies and keeping public finances in order. I cannot, therefore, accept this recommendation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years, the phrase &ldquo;stealth taxes&rdquo; has been much in vogue. I am sure the Minister will agree that it is a much used and abused term, not least by elements of the Opposition. Most of what are termed &ldquo;stealth taxes&rdquo; are actually user charges. Some I agree with, while others I do not, depending on the importance of the particular service being provided.</P>
    <P>However, the failure to increase tax credit is a classic and genuine stealth tax. We should be looking for an element of transparency. There is merit in the notion that there should be an automatic increase as per inflation for standard credits. This would then put the onus on the Minister for Finance in each year&rsquo;s Finance Bill to deliver. This would allow a measure of clarity in what the Minister is doing. I know from previous experience, the Minister, or any of his predecessors, is not much given to that.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister digressed in his response, I wish to ask about the overall area of income tax. The end of February Exchequer returns show, as the Minister is aware, a substantial increase in income tax returns over and above that which was anticipated at budget time. Can the Minister inform us if this indicates greater buoyancy than he had anticipated or are there seasonal factors at play?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The end of February figures as regards capital gains tax are higher than their profile. Senator McDowell will be aware that in 2003 I introduced and published profiled expenditure targets from the various Departments regarding votive expenditure. I also decided to publish estimates from the Revenue Commissioners of profiled taxation receipts for the year. I will explain my main reason for publishing the expenditure profiles. Senator McDowell will recall the 2002 general election.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying my best to forget it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand that. The Senator will recall the hullabaloo that followed that election, when some eminent commentators went off half-cocked in respect of the expenditure out-turn for 2002. I have spent a great deal of time in the Department of Finance and I have discussed other Departments with my colleagues. It is obvious to me that few people understand all the intricate aspects of the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="1991"/>accounts and expenditure. Some eminent writers on the subject do not seem to understand it too well. A Department cannot spend more than the amount that is devolved to it by means of the annual Vote.</P>
    <P>The expenditure figures for the early part of 2002 were high, but I consistently said that the out-turn would be in line with the initial projection. We said that the increase in the Revised Estimates Volume would be approximately 14.4%. The year-on-year increase in expenditure in the early part of the year was well in excess of 14.4% but, lo and behold, the out-turn at the end of the year was approximately 13.9%, slightly less than what was in the REV. There was less hysteria in 2003 because many commentators&rsquo; fingers were badly burned, in terms of public credibility, in 2002. They were proved to have been wrong. I do not have much difficulty with the Opposition making accusations and political charges, although it does not excite me too much. As a politician, I understand why Opposition politicians have to engage in such tactics. However, other people who should have gone to the trouble of getting their figures right did not go about their business as madly in 2003.</P>
    <P>One gets the wrong impression if one takes one month with the next. If one examines the total expenditure figure to the end of February, which was mentioned by Senator McDowell, one will find that it is just 1% higher than the year-on-year increase for the previous year. The overall REV out-turn shows that there has been an increase of 7% in net voted expenditure for 2004 as a whole. The year-on-year increase until the end of February is just 1%, however.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the figures for 1999 because I read them in response to a parliamentary question yesterday. In most years, the figures at the end of February are considerably in excess of the out-turn for the year as a whole although they were much smaller in one instance. Some commentators have argued that the recent figures for the end of February demonstrate that it is obvious that the Government will not engage in as much capital spending, etc. Although I might like it if that were the case, it is untrue. I am almost sure, at the end of March, that the Departments will spend their allocations this year. As always, my difficulty will be to ensure, like any sensible manager should, that Departments&rsquo; expenditure is not in excess of their allocations. If one bases one&rsquo;s estimates on the increase of 1% in the expenditure figures to the end of February, one might extrapolate that we will be under expenditure at the end of the year. That will not be the case, unfortunately, as a consequence of certain timing issues.</P>
    <P>I published the profiles mainly to stop the nonsense that took place in 2002. We published on the website the predicted cumulative expenditure of the Departments, based on their best guesses, for each month. Some of the Departments&rsquo; best estimations for their monthly <Col N="1992"/>profiles last year were not great, but we hope they will be better this year. The overall expenditure figures for 2003 turned out at the end of the year as we had predicted. My main reason for publishing the profile figures was to get away from the unadulterated nonsense that was written about spending in most of 2002.</P>
    <P>I also decided to publish the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; estimates of their likely monthly receipts for 2003 and 2004. In previous years, the year-on-year figures, compared with the previous year, were given at the end of each monthly statement or in the quarterly Exchequer returns at which my officials give a press conference. Such documents usually mention that some elements of Exchequer receipts are above profile and others are below profile. I decided this year to publish the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; profiles.</P>
    <P>As Senator McDowell is aware, estimates of taxation are different. I can control expenditure, but I am not in a position to know how much money will come in. The estimations of all tax receipts are based on the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; best guess-estimates, which in turn are based on the strength of the economy, employment levels and other factors.</P>
    <P>The Senator is correct to state that to the end of February, tax receipts have increased on 2003. Most of that relates to capital gains tax, however. Capital gains tax is above profile for two reasons. Estimates of capital gains tax are the most difficult to predict because, by their nature, they are based on once-off transactions. Capital gains tax was usually paid on one date each year until I made a change in the Finance Act 2003. It is difficult to estimate the capital gains tax figure for those two reasons. In the 2003 Act, I changed the capital gains tax payment dates to bring them into line with the self-employed income tax payment dates. It is all now paid on 31 October. Capital gains tax was previously paid a year in arrears. I received a large amount of money in 2003 from capital gains tax because, in effect, I received two years&rsquo; capital gains tax in one year.</P>
    <P>Another change I made in the Finance Act 2003 meant that deals done in the last three months of the year were treated on the basis of a current year assessment. I introduced a measure to ensure that taxes from deals done in the last three months of the year, which could not be paid by 31 October, had to be paid by 31 January. Therefore, the tax receipt figures to the end of February include the extra capital gains tax payments made by 31 January, under the terms of the measure that I brought into effect last year. The capital gains tax figures to the end of February are approximately &euro;200 million greater than those expected by the Revenue Commissioners. The next big payment of capital gains tax will be received by the Exchequer on 31 October next, in line with the normal payment system on that date. Revenue from capital gains tax is above profile.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, the income tax and VAT figures to the end of February are slightly below the <Col N="1993"/>Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; profile. I emphasise that the decrease is slight and not something about which we should be alarmed. As income tax and VAT receipts are better indicators of the level of economic activity, we should take greater notice of them. Having said that, it would not be correct to make any assumptions based on the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; figures for the first two months of the year. Equally, the figures for the first quarter, which will be published in approximately ten days&rsquo; time, are not a suitable basis for any projections. It will be necessary to wait until much later in the year before I will be prepared to say, for example, that there will be a downturn in taxation.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to explain the relevance of the figures for the end of February. Capital gains tax is above profile for the reasons I have outlined. The two other main taxes that I have mentioned, income tax and VAT, as well as excise taxes, are slightly below the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; profile at the end of February. I am sorry for having spoken at such great length.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is to be complimented on his decision to increase the transparency of the public finances. There is an obvious public interest in that regard, because there may be an effect on confidence if commentators get it wrong or are too gloomy. Equally, it is not desirable that such people should be too optimistic. I accept the qualifications made by the Minister. Unfortunately, I do not have the budget booklet in front of me. As I said on budget night, I am confident that he will achieve and over-achieve his revenue targets. Far from being an indictment of the Minister and his Department, that is good news for everybody because it shows that the public finances are very sound.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that Senator Browne&rsquo;s amendment should be written into legislation, as it would show that the Minister is deviating. One of the first aspects of the changes in income tax that commentators examine on budget day is their impact, if any, on indexation. I do not accept there is any mystery or stealth involved. Commentators home in on this and inform the public straight away if there is a change equivalent to the rate of inflation. If it is written into the legislation, however, this effectively establishes a norm and henceforth, if the Minister makes any changes he is deviating from the norm or reneging on a commitment. All sorts of political charges are made if the Minister does less than the norm even though it may be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The issue being debated is whether we should make a formal benchmark of indexation. I do not believe we should. Although it was a matter of wages or social welfare rather than taxation, the Italians, when their economy was pretty ropey, had a system of exact indexation &mdash; whose name sounded quite Rossini-esque, <i>la scala mobile</i> &mdash; which crucified the economy. I do not believe we <Col N="1994"/>should go down that route, although I accept that, other things being equal, we would like to see tax credits at least increasing in line with inflation. If one takes the last seven or eight years together, we have succeeded in doing much more than that. I have no doubt that if the public finances are healthy, in further budgets the Minister will make up for any lost ground.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept all that has been said, but the bottom line is worth repeating. In 1999, the personal tax credit under the then equivalent tax code amounted to &euro;1,000. By 2001 the Minister had succeeded in reducing this figure to &euro;814. In 2002 it was doubled to &euro;1,520. For the last two years there has been no change. These are the facts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>For the reasons I have outlined, I do not adhere to the principle that we should automatically index bands and allowances. The suggestion has been put forward over the years, but no Minister for Finance of any political persuasion would go along with it. Senator Mansergh has also referred to the reasons for this.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator McDowell&rsquo;s question about the figures for the year, we hope that the offshore accounts investigation will bring in some one-off payments during the year. During the last month the banks issued letters to thousands of customers and it is to be hoped this will bring in additional moneys. Senator Mansergh alluded to the hope, which I share, that we will achieve our Revenue targets this year. I also intend to keep to our spending targets, as in previous years.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Recommendation put and declared lost.</P>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;2.&mdash;With effect from the end of 2004, and annually thereafter, the Revenue Commissioners shall lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a Report detailing in respect of any relief, other than an amount however described which is excluded in the calculation of tax by a body corporate, partnership, or individual if calculating tax&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) an estimate of the number who availed of the relief and of the range of the value of benefit;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) an estimate of the total cost of the relief to the Exchequer on a geographical breakdown by tax districts; and</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) a statement of the social and economic benefits of the relief.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This recommendation provides that annual reports be given to the Oireachtas to justify tax breaks in specific areas such as the bloodstock industry and section 23 and property tax breaks. It is important that we review such tax breaks <Col N="1995"/>every year. To be fair I must point out that Fine Gael brought in the tax breaks for urban renewal back in 1986. Former Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Brien was involved in that area.</P>
    <P>The economic conditions in 1986 were very different to those which prevail now. Unfortunately, the housing situation has become worse. We must question the wisdom of policy decisions which ensured that a quarter of all new housing units built last year were second homes, while there are 50,000 families on local authority housing lists. The recommendation is clear. It provides for closer scrutiny and explanation of tax relief schemes on a yearly basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is significant merit in the recommendation being made by Senator Browne and the Fine Gael Party. I can anticipate some of the Minister&rsquo;s response. I know he has altered the nature of the tax form so that people must at least declare income even if it is not subject to tax.</P>
    <P>It is important that we assess the amount of tax that has been foregone because of these tax breaks, but it is perhaps even more important that we assess the benefit that is being derived from them. We will deal in later sections with specific breaks for those who build student accommodation, holiday homes and so on. Perhaps when we get that far we can try to investigate their actual benefit. As a general principle, however, the notion that we should make an annual assessment of the effects and cost of the tax breaks is useful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>This recommendation proposes to insert a new section into the Bill. The purpose of the new section is to require the Revenue Commissioners to make an annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas giving in respect of each tax relief &mdash; apart from tax reliefs deducted by persons calculating their incomes for tax purposes &mdash; details of the numbers availing of the relief, the range of the value of the benefit to those availing of the relief, the total cost of the relief to the Exchequer, a geographical breakdown by tax district and a statement of the social and economic benefits of the relief.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners already publish an annual statistical report which includes some information about the cost of tax reliefs. Copies of this report are sent to the Oireachtas Library. Table IT6 of the annual statistical report gives the cost of tax allowances and reliefs. This table does not currently give any indication of the numbers availing of the relief, geographical breakdown or the range of the value of the benefit.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners, to the extent that information is available in respect of particular reliefs, will examine the possibility of including such details in future statistical reports. In the matter of the range of the value of the benefit of each relief, while such a level of detail may be difficult to achieve in many instances, the Revenue <Col N="1996"/>Commissioners will investigate the possibilities. In this regard, the measures I am taking in section 86 of the Bill to require taxpayers to include additional information on tax returns in respect of certain specified reliefs should enhance the range and detail of the information available to the commissioners. This in turn will allow the Revenue Commissioners to consider ways in which it can increase the amount of detail on the take-up and cost of tax reliefs to be reported in its statistical report.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it would be a good use of resources to create a statutory compulsion to have a case by case breakdown by tax district of the numbers availing of reliefs and exemptions. The cost and the resources expended in preparing this information for every relief and exemption would be disproportionate to the value of the information obtained from such an exercise. We need to consider the appropriateness of the information required from taxpayers and strike a balance between seeking improved data to assist in the costing and evaluation of tax relief schemes and the compliance burden imposed on taxpayers.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Finally, as regards the provision of a statement by the Revenue Commissioners on the social and economic benefit of each tax relief covered by the report, I do not think the commissioners are equipped or qualified to make any such judgment. The role of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect the taxes and duties imposed by the Oireachtas fairly and impartially and to administer the tax code by providing the best possible service to the compliant taxpayer and pursuing all forms of tax evasion. We will shortly be able to see more relevant statistics on this matter as a result of the changes I introduced in this Bill and further work carried out by the Revenue Commissioners. It is the job of Government and the Minister to decide on the appropriateness or otherwise of a particular relief or incentive and make decisions on that basis. That is the democratic process. Thus, I cannot accept the recommendation proposed by the Senator.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I stick to my original point. It is worth noting that the urban and town renewal schemes will have cost the Exchequer &euro;0.75 billion in lost taxes by July 2006. When this is coupled with the fact that 130,000 people are now on the waiting list for social housing, it must be asked why reviews of tax reliefs are not undertaken. The tax relief was initially introduced to encourage regeneration and it was very successful. It has now unfortunately pushed house prices up by an average of &euro;100,000 and housing has become even less affordable for the ordinary person. There is now the scenario where some people can afford to have five or six properties but others cannot afford to buy their first one. This issue should be examined again.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1997"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder what the real position is and to what extent the Revenue knows the number of taxpayers availing of particular reliefs. Even more pointedly, I wonder to what extent the Minister knows. I ask the Minister if he has statistics which he can consider each year in the context of the Finance Bill. Is he aware of the number of individuals or companies who are availing of a particular relief? It is surely a vital piece of information when it comes to assessing the worthwhile nature of a relief.</P>
    <P>I find the history of this a little puzzling. I remember being told a few years ago by the Minister that Revenue did not compile these figures and it can only make a stab at the amount of tax being foregone. As the Minister rightly pointed out, last year or the year before last, Revenue produced estimates but it is not clear where the estimates came from because they are not accompanied by any backup statistics in terms of the number of people availing of the reliefs to allow one to make a realistic assessment of what the statistics mean exactly. Has the mechanism changed and does the Minister have all the information available to him, even though it is not published?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of these reliefs are considered by the tax strategy group and the group&rsquo;s papers are published after the budget.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

	<P>They used to be published after the budget and before the Finance Bill. I remember well because I spent many a night having a good look at them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is certainly one of the few people who read them. I have often quoted the Senator to his colleagues when he often stated that he loved reading the tax strategy group documents because then he knew what the Minister was not going to do.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was particularly helpful in the context of the Finance Bill. I wonder if there has been a change of policy in the Department of Finance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend that there would be. Anyone who wants the tax strategy group&rsquo;s papers may have them. They are more comprehensive post the publication of the Finance Bill. There may be matters referred to in <Col N="1998"/>the lead up to the budget which do not take effect until after the Finance Bill and they then become part of the deliberative process. The only reason for their publication after the Finance Bill is to get the overall picture. I will make inquiries for the Senator. They will be published very shortly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is correct. I always thought of the tax strategy group as a kind of clearing house and I mean that quite literally; it cleared a number of things out of the way as non-runners.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme was introduced in 1985 by the Fine Gael-Labour Government and the seaside resorts scheme, about which I have distinctly more mixed feelings, was also introduced in 1985&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not one of our good ideas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;at the behest of the current leader of Fine Gael and much to the benefit of the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s county.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Well known seaside resorts such as Clonakilty, Westport and Achill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mansergh without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>It ended up with 15 although it started off with six. The additional nine were introduced on Report Stage, I believe. I know there were an additional seven or eight.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trying to raise pleasant visions of home in the mind of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>The Minister has replied very positively to this recommendation. My understanding is that he is interested in collecting more objective information about how certain reliefs operate. I notice Senator Browne could not resist flogging a live horse regarding stallion fees.I would be surprised if that does not show that abolishing it would cost the Exchequer as opposed to bringing in revenue to the Exchequer. On average, most people do not actually make money from investing in and breeding horses. I know that some do and a few do spectacularly well. We must decide if we want to see our equestrian industry going lock, stock and barrel to Kentucky or Australia. If so, we can take that decision although it is something that has worked very well.</P>
    <P>It is true that a few people have become very wealthy as a result but it must be judged, as this recommendation states, on the economic and social benefit it provides. It employs thousands of people, especially in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency of Kildare and my own shadow constituency of South Tipperary. It is over-emphasised in political and media debates and is an easy populist point to make, but it does not make any sense. The late Deputy Joe Bermingham and the <Col N="1999"/>late Deputy Michael Ferris of the Labour Party examined the matter very carefully and recommended that it should not be changed. I do not think that regularly brandishing that as a kind of symbol that one is attached to core socialist values, equity, a just society and all the rest washes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of compiling or collating statistical information regarding the cost of these reliefs has been on my mind for some time. Section 86 of the Bill makes changes in this regard to allow the compilation of extra statistics on the person&rsquo;s income tax return.</P>
    <P>This has a history attached to it and much of it is to do with the efficiency, new methodology and changes in practice adopted by the Revenue Commissioners over the past 20 years, which are all for the better. The changes are being made from the old system to the new system. Those of us who remember the old system will testify that it was very labour-intensive with lots of writing to the Revenue Commissioners, lots of questions for them to return and lots of replies. We spent years doing this as did the accountancy practices before we came to the self-assessment system for the year 1988-9.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Revenue Commissioners have developed the desk audit principle in that one sends in returns. The Revenue Commissioners nowadays do not wish to have any forms sent to them. They do not need to see accounts, letters or receipts. It is becoming more like that.</P>
    <P>Form 11 is very large, containing approximately 20 pages. In order to be more efficient, there are group figures for capital allowances in various areas. For example, most of these questions relating to capital allowances such as urban and rural renewal and seaside resorts are grouped together. This is more efficient but the consequence is that one cannot identify the number of capital allowances going to the various areas of seaside resorts, multi-storey carparks or whatever.</P>
    <P>I have been thinking about this for some time. There have been tremendous benefits in the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners have changed their methodology. The capture of relevant information at the same time is the goal without clogging up the system, thus making it more difficult for the compliant taxpayer. In section 86 of the Finance Bill 2004, as passed by the D&aacute;il, there is now a provision under which the forms will be redesigned to capture more information.</P>
    <P>As I stated yesterday, the P35 form to be submitted in February 2005 will capture the information regarding occupational pension schemes for employers and the amount they have contributed. There are also other changes. Senator McDowell is correct in this regard. Some information used over the years is exact. For example, it is very easy to do it now on mortgage <Col N="2000"/>interest relief because the change is made at source. One does not have to put it on one&rsquo;s form as the Revenue deals with one&rsquo;s mortgage provider. The same system applies to medical insurance relief. Therefore, one can find out the exact costs. Some of the other reliefs such as the capital allowance type relief have not been captured but will be in the future. To get exactitude in terms of the losses, one would have to go through every single tax case which claimed them, find out information from the individual&rsquo;s files and write to him or her.</P>
    <P>Some surveys are carried out by tax offices, for example, on the seaside resorts relief and so on but it is not totally exact. The new information will allow this to be captured in an exact form. Some of the costs of the reliefs are exact and some are not. On the survey carried out on the top 400 individual earners, each file would have been gone through to see what allowances those people claimed and how they reduced their tax. That would be an exact figure. One cannot extrapolate from that that all taxpayers are using all those particular breaks. Hopefully the new method of capturing information on the forms will make it much easier to do so.</P>
    <P>Senators raised the issue of lost taxes. To be fair to Senator McDowell, he gave a fair commentary on this issue last evening. A balance must be struck at all times. The Senator asked about the loss of tax revenue to the Exchequer and the economic activity a particular tax incentive will give. It has to be accepted by all, including those who write regularly on this subject, including politicians, that tax breaks-incentivised capital allowances will always be used more by high earners. Irrespective of whether reliefs are to the film industry, multi-storey car parks seaside resorts or urban renewal schemes, they will be used in the main by high earners who pay tax at the rate of 42%.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the confused debate on the matter, no one doubts that arising from the benefits of relief for the film industry where there is a competitive market, gains are made in terms of economic activity. There is considerable evidence that much of that relief is being abused. Even if all the abuse were eliminated, the cost of that tax relief would be gained by high income earners. Some Members in the Lower House wanted to have it both ways, which is not unusual for politicians on all sides for generations. It is high income earners who will benefit from these reliefs. One has to weigh up whether the benefit of the relief outweighs the tax loss. One can put any figure one wishes on the amount lost on the seaside resorts relief or multi-storey car parks given the caveat I have entered about the exactitude of the figures. One has to weigh up whether the money would have come to the Exchequer through those income tax earners. On the other hand, one must weigh up the activity that would have been lost if that relief had not existed. For example, in the construction industry, thousands of additional employees were <Col N="2001"/>taken on because of the relief and many spin-off jobs came about as a result of those people being in employment. Many of those would have been unemployed and, as such, would have been drawing assistance or benefits from the State, and that also has to be factored in. One can add up the amount of extra VAT that would be earned, the PAYE, income tax and corporation tax those people would save. One side must be weighed against the other. It is important that everybody understands the parameters involved.</P>
    <P>I have introduced as many, if not more, focused income tax incentives, some of which have been a roaring success, than any other Minister for Finance. One that has not been a success is the park and ride tax incentive scheme. Nobody disagreed with that scheme when I introduced it. Even though Senator McDowell was an Opposition spokesperson, I do not think he opposed that particular relief.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I was sceptical about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was proved right. To encourage park and ride facilities I improved the scheme the following year to make it more attractive. Up to today, one person has expressed an interest in this area, but we do not know whether that person is going ahead with it. That is one scheme that has not been a success. While Senator McDowell was sceptical about it, most people would have thought that relief was a good idea. There are other reliefs that would be availed of by everybody. For example, the rural renewal scheme in the upper Shannon area &mdash; Leitrim, most of Sligo, all of County Longford, and large parts of Roscommon and Cavan &mdash; has been a tremendous success in recent years. The seaside resort renewal scheme was introduced by Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, the then Minister for Finance. I was Minister for Tourism until December 1994 and the budget was introduced in January 1995. We had been working on that scheme from the previous year and the idea came from my Department. Senator Mansergh has raised doubts about this. When Deputy Quinn introduced it in the budget there were six locations. By the time the Bill reached Report Stage there were 15 or 16 locations because of understandable pressure from various backbenchers to include other places.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to deal in detail with stallion relief as I have dealt with this on many occasions. In the Finance Bill 2003, I introduced a provision that allows us to capture information in this area. Until then, it was not possible to capture that information because it was an exempt income. For some reason, successive Governments, including Governments of which Senator Browne&rsquo;s party was a member, opposed any change. I agree with Senator Mansergh who has some experience in this particular business. People will be surprised at the end result. Perhaps one should look at the accounts of the Irish National Stud which is an efficiently run <Col N="2002"/>organisation to get some idea of this area of activity. It is like many things in Irish life, including political life, one can get a cheap headline by knocking something like this. It is the kind of bar-stool, non-analytical politics many people favour. We have done better than any other country and are a world leader in the area of horse breeding. We should think long and hard before making any change in that area.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s the Commission on Taxation published a five volume report which recommended the abolition of almost every relief under the sun, except one. The only one it favoured keeping was the stallion relief.</P>

	<P>I have no interest in the horse industry, good, bad or indifferent but one thing I am sure of is that the Minister, despite what he has said about reviewing, assessing and collecting information on numbers and so on, has not the remotest intention of interfering with it. This will allow us to flog that particular horse for another couple of years at least. I suppose it suits all concerned. I agree with almost everything the Minister has said in terms of how one goes about assessing these matters. There are some things, and this is where we would disagree, which the State has a responsibility to provide. Park and ride is a facility that should be provided by local authorities. I would say the same about child care. We should not leave these up to the vagaries of tax incentives and so on. I agree with the general thrust of the Minister&rsquo;s comments. He is in a position where he is turning his back on all of these reliefs which, in theory, he is meant to abolish, notwithstanding the extension this year.</P>

  <P>Recommendation put and declared lost.</P>
  <P>Section 2 agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Section 472 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (4)-</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) by inserting &lsquo;or proves that he or she is a home-carer&rsquo; after &lsquo;purposes referred to in that section&rsquo;, and</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) by inserting the following paragraph after paragraph (<i>b</i>):</P>
    <P LI="4">&lsquo;(<i>c</i>) in the case of a home-carer, a credit of the amount referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>) will be provided against the income of the employed spouse.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The recommendation seeks to introduce a provision whereby the value of the home carer&rsquo;s allowance would be linked to the PAYE allowance. The home carer&rsquo;s allowance was introduced by the Minister when he introduced his proposals on individualisation. There was a widespread belief on the Government backbenches as well as elsewhere in the House that we needed to acknowledge those who chose to stay at home and that the home carer&rsquo;s allowance was an appropriate way of doing so. In the intervening period, although the benefits of individualisation have substantially increased and run now to several thousand euros for those on top pay, no effort has been made to increase the home carer&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not a fan of the home carer&rsquo;s credit. However, I would be very interested to know the statistical background as to how many taxpayers actually claim the credit. The Minister will remember there was much hullabaloo at the introduction of individualisation and the subsequent introduction of this credit.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="2004"/>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne should know that this area was a specialist subject of Senator McDowell&rsquo;s when he was in the other House. The recommendation seeks to amend section 472 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to extend the employee or PAYE tax credit to home carers, with the credit to be given to the working spouse. Under section 466A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the home carer&rsquo;s tax credit is granted to married couples where one spouse remains in the home to care for a dependent person. We considered an identical proposal in the other House which attempted to link the value of the home carer&rsquo;s credit to the employee tax credit, as does Senator Browne&rsquo;s recommendation. Presumably, the home carers in question are those currently within the ambit of section 466A. To extend the employee tax credit as proposed in the recommendation would be to depart from the essential purpose of the credit which is to take account of the position of employees as compared to the self-employed. Widening the availability of the employee tax credit in this way would cost some &euro;82 million in 2004 and &euro;118 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my Budget Statement last December and as I repeated in the other House, the resources available for tax reductions this year are limited. I therefore made only limited changes in the area of personal taxation and these will cost an estimated &euro;287 million in a full year. The increase I made in the employee tax credit was to ensure that income tax was not payable on 90% of the minimum wage. Over 39,000 persons were removed from the tax net. Apart from this and the increase in the income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over, there were no increases in the generality of the personal tax credits or in the standard rate band &mdash; the budgetary position would not have allowed it. I am, therefore, not in a position to accept the recommendation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the statistical question raised by Senator McDowell, 140,000 persons claimed home carer&rsquo;s credit.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Minister some general questions on income tax and, in particular, on the credits. I want to explore whether it is still his intention to remove the minimum wage from the income tax net. As I said, this is the most important remaining tax priority and something on which the Minister should have moved last year and should certainly move this year, even if it means having to compensate in other parts of the tax or income tax codes. I will not labour the argument as the Minister is familiar with it but I invite him to state whether it is still his intention to do this in the <Col N="2005"/>one budget which remains to him as part of Sustaining Progress.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>As explained in the programme for Government, it was and still is the intention of the Government to exempt the minimum wage over a term in office, as was also acknowledged in the Sustaining Progress document.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that Sustaining Progress has one more budget to run. Is there a specific commitment to do this in next year&rsquo;s budget? Must we wait for another three years, if the Government lasts that long?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to this matter when dealing with amendments in the other House and referred to the Government&rsquo;s clear policy in regard to exempting those on the minimum wage from taxation. An Agreed Programme for Government set out the achievement of this objective as a priority over the next five years but this is subject to the overarching requirement for sound economic and fiscal policies and keeping the public finances in order. The Sustaining Progress agreement endorsed this approach and provides that &ldquo;to the extent that there is any scope for personal tax reductions, progress will continue to be made over the three budgets contained within the life time of this agreement towards removing those on the minimum wage from the tax net&rdquo;. This is entirely consistent with the Government&rsquo;s broader economic strategy of sustaining economic growth, strengthening and maintaining the competitive position of the economy and sustaining employment.</P>

    <P LI="3">(3) Where this section applies, a qualifying sportsperson shall, on the making of a claim in accordance with subsection (6), be entitled to a tax credit (to be known as the &ldquo;qualifying sportsperson tax credit&rdquo; of &euro;2,000).</P>

    <P FLI="0">My colleague, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, who put forward this amendment in the D&aacute;il, has seven all-Ireland medals. The Minister for Finance knows how hard it has been to survive in his position for seven years, but to win seven All-Ireland medals is even tougher.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Deenihan has five All-Ireland medals.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendation put forward by Deputy Deenihan was rejected in the other House. It applies not only to Gaelic footballers but also to other sportspeople such as cyclists, boxers, rowers and other elite athletes not benefiting from the provision made in the Finance Bill 2002 under which professional sportspeople were rightly granted a major income tax break. This, however, should apply equally to all other elite athletes. Former Taoiseach Charles Haughey, when Minister for Finance, granted a major tax concession to artists which has been successful, although I would argue some aspects of it should be reviewed. Nonetheless, it has encouraged a number of writers and scriptwriters to stay in Ireland to develop the arts. Last year, that measure cost some &euro;37 million. The recommendation proposed for sportspeople would only cost some &euro;9 million and would affect 5,000 to 6,000 athletes across the spectrum of sports. It should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>When I met recently with the Gaelic Players Association in Buswells Hotel, I was amazed by the number of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and Senators present, agreeing with the players, throwing their arms around them and posing for photographs. Those Deputies then ran to the D&aacute;il to vote against the amendment. I hope their Seanad colleagues do not do likewise. I am aware that <Col N="2008"/>we cannot change a financial Bill in the Chamber today and can only make recommendations. However, when this comes to a vote, I hope Fianna F&aacute;il Senators will look into their consciences, if they have any, and vote with their hearts. This would ensure that sportspeople who give great enjoyment during the year &mdash; I realise the Minister is a big sports fan &mdash; would get some tax credit to offset the yearly expenses they incur in providing entertainment for us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Browne. I listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s list of tax shelter schemes such as the seaside resort and urban renewal schemes and he pointed out that those at the high end of the economic spectrum availed of those breaks. Those on lower incomes could avail of the tax break recommended here. Great credit is due to those who train from one end of the year in hurling, football and other sports. They give great entertainment to the nation and far beyond. One need only spend the day of an all-Ireland final in Australia, America or England to see the enthusiasm for the game among people who left Ireland years ago.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne made a case for this small concession being made available to people who slog through the winter months and spend late nights away from their families. They must also travel long distances. In a county like Mayo, which is very large, some players must make a round trip of 120 or 130 miles four or five nights a week to train to play for their county. They give huge entertainment to people all over the world.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Not much chance of an all-Ireland medal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Those might have eluded us for a number of years but we might be in the shake-up this year. The Minister should consider this worthy proposal. Anyone could stand behind the recommendation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I was never a fan of the original tax break in the Finance Bill 2002 which provides a potentially very break for people who are, generally speaking, well off in the first place. I understand the argument that their careers are relatively short but I am not sure there is any huge benefit to the public in encouraging them to stay resident in Ireland. We always suspected, with some justification, that the Minister had his eye on the kind of sportsman who is numerous in the horseracing industry in his county.</P>
    <P>I was never a fan of the measure but nevertheless the precedent is there in the 2002 Act and the Minister has opened a Pandora&rsquo;s box. Having treated elite sportspeople in a particular way he was inevitably going to be subjected to pressure to extend the tax break to amateur sportspeople, with GAA players the most obvious example.</P>
    <P>I endorse what has been said by Fine Gael colleagues about the increasing amount of effort <Col N="2009"/>GAA players must put in, such as the amount of time they must take off work and the income clearly foregone by those efforts. The pressures on GAA players are increasing all the time and they want to be valued. They want it expressed in a monetary way and the Minister is coming under pressure to do so. It may be that what we should be saying explicitly to the GAA &mdash; perhaps this is what the Minister is trying to do in a less explicit fashion &mdash; is that it should be looking at some way of remunerating players and that it should be honest and up front about it. There may be merit in that approach and I would welcome much greater debate on this than has occurred heretofore.</P>
    <P>I quibble with some of the specific terms of the recommendation but the general principle, that we send a message to those playing GAA games and other sports that they are valued and perform a useful role in society which we all appreciated, has serious merit and should be examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael speakers pointed to the blatant hypocrisy of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies embracing GAA players and voting down the proposals they had devised. Unless I am mistaken some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues in the D&aacute;il seem to be under the impression even now that he is giving the matter some thought, that he is well disposed towards it and that perhaps next year or the year after he will do something about it. Perhaps they need some clarity. The Minister&rsquo;s inclination towards clarity comes to the fore on such occasions. Perhaps he will help Members here and in the D&aacute;il by stating his views clearly because unless I am completely misreading his indications, the Minister has no intention of doing anything about this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is undoubtedly a lot of sympathy among my colleagues for this idea. It is not hypocrisy to express support or sympathy for what is <i>prima facie</i> a good idea and then, if reasons are given as to why the idea does not stand up in that particular form, accepting those reasons. All of us find ourselves in that position.</P>
    <P>Without anticipating the Minister&rsquo;s reply, the measure he introduced in 2002 was a good idea. The application of that measure or an equivalent to GAA players may require further thought and this proposal is a stimulus to that. As Senator McDowell hinted, it is also a question of how particular sports organise themselves, so thinking may be needed on all sides.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment on the basis that it is time some recognition was given to those who have given a lifetime of commitment to our national games. The commitment that GAA players must give to their sports is very serious and their livelihood often comes second, with family life coming last. There must be some recognition for that. We are not asking for anything on a par with professionals in other codes but it is important that commitment to the <Col N="2010"/>national games is recognised. When such players of outstanding ability give a display that is below par they are highlighted and often ridiculed.</P>
    <P>How many players of all ages have lost an eye to hurling? I remember a famous Kilkenny player who lost his sight in a match. He had to bear that himself and insurance was not taken into account, though no insurance could ever compensate him for the loss of his sight. His whole life was changed as a result.</P>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>We are asking for recognition, not compensation &mdash; recognition of the commitment and <Miles com="ch"/>dedication that these people have given. They have broken bones which may result in arthritis in later life. The Minister has uniquely recognised the importance of sport and has given breaks to certain other sportspeople. He should give serious consideration to some degree of recognition by accepting this recommendation.</P><Miles com="xh"/>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment proposes a scheme of annual tax credits for elite amateur sports persons who are resident in the State. The tax credit of &euro;2,000 would be used against the person&rsquo;s non-sport income since, being amateurs, they do not have income arising directly from the sport itself. This proposal for a tax credit for elite amateur sports persons has been promoted by the Gaelic Players Association whose members are not paid in respect of their direct participation in Gaelic games. In effect, it means that the taxpayer should subsidise certain amateur sports persons when their own organisations are unwilling to do so. This is the nub of the matter.</P>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><P>This matter has been discussed at great length on both Committee and Report Stages in the Lower House. I have made my views very clear in those debates and I welcome the opportunity to restate them before this House. As regards the GAA in particular, I should emphasise that this Government has made substantial sums of money available to the GAA at national and local level for the development of facilities which provide the appropriate arenas in which these great national games are played. The GAA has also been exempt from income tax for the past 75 years, since 1928. That special relief should not be overlooked by those seeking additional tax concessions.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <Miles com="ah"/><P>In the past two years alone this one organisation has been allocated no less than &euro;68 million in Exchequer funding, including &euro;1.5 million a year of current funding for the governing body. I am not just talking about the Government funding for Croke Park, in respect of which I took more than my fair share of criticism, but for a whole range of GAA facilities the length and <Miles com="ch"/>breadth of the country that have been built with assistance from the sports capital programme administered by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. The record shows that no Government has ever been as generous to Irish sport as the current Administration.</P><Miles com="xh"/>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><P>I am fully conscious and appreciative of the efforts of GAA players at the top level. As a lifelong supporter of Gaelic games, I am well aware <Col N="2011"/>of the pleasure and benefits followers derive from the efforts of players wearing club and county colours. In my view, it should be a matter of pride to put on a county jersey and not a matter of monetary calculation. Many amateurs in all walks of life have been honoured to represent their country many times at their own expense.</P>
    <Miles com="cl" par="108"/><P>I have previously said that over the years the needs of players were often neglected and it is shameful that only in recent times have players&rsquo; concerns been heard. The GPA is to be complimented for its role in that regard. However, the provision of a new tax credit for each player, as recognition of the efforts of the GAA players, is an entirely different matter. The GPA&rsquo;s argument seems to be that because the GAA refuses to pay the players for participation in the games or even to reimburse them adequately for legitimate expenses incurred directly as a result of the players&rsquo; involvement in games and training sessions, the Government &mdash; that is, the taxpayer &mdash; should pick up the bill. It is not an argument with which I can agree under any circumstances.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>I noted with interest official comments reported recently in the media from the GAA in support of the GPA&rsquo;s submission. It is ironic that while the GAA regards the GPA as some form of maverick group with suspect motives that it has kept at arm&rsquo;s length, it has no problem in issuing edicts of support for this same group when it appears that the Government could be the solution to the thorny question of pay for play. The GPA problem is a GAA problem. It is not my intention that individual players should now be given generous tax exemptions to compensate for the difficulties of the GAA on this issue. The resolution of the problem of player compensation is a matter for the GPA and the GAA, not for the GPA and the Government.</P>
    <P>The proposed tax credit of &euro;2,000 per annum per sports person is more than the total tax credit available to a non-PAYE single person, which stands at &euro;1,520. The PAYE tax credit itself of &euro;1,040 is almost half of what the GPA proposes be granted to a select group of players. A tax credit of &euro;2,000 is the equivalent of exempting &euro;10,000 of income from tax for a standard rate taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that there is already State funding for sports organisations and sports people, if it was ever considered desirable to grant &euro;2,000 per annum to all elite sports persons, a direct grant mechanism would be a fairer and more appropriate measure. A tax credit would not benefit many elite athletes who, due to the levels of commitment and time demands of their respective training regimes, are often not in a position to hold down full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The GPA has claimed there is discrimination in the treatment of the players it represents. Two years ago, I introduced a scheme of tax relief for certain professional and semi-professional sports persons which was given by way of a repayment of tax which could be claimed in the year in which the sports person retired from active participation <Col N="2012"/>in the sport. The relief relates solely to direct sports income and not from sponsorship or other income. However, the position of GAA players<i> vis-&agrave;-vis </i>professional sports persons who can avail of the retirement relief is quite different. In general, specific allowances or credits in the tax system are put in place to compensate taxpayers for necessary expenses incurred in the process of earning an income and not for expenses incurred while undertaking a voluntary activity.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the introduction of this credit would set an unwelcome precedent and other voluntary workers may well demand a similar credit on equally supportable grounds. If these players were to get a special tax credit to acknowledge their expenses relating to their activity and their contribution to the community, it would be nearly impossible not to extend this to other categories of individuals who give of their time and incur expenses in a wide variety of community, youth and other voluntary work. Many of the organisations to which they contribute are less likely to be able to meet the expenses of these individuals than the GAA can.</P>
    <P>It is my experience that when reliefs are given in one area there tends to be pressure to extend them to what are arguably equally deserving categories elsewhere and for this reason I am not prepared to use the tax system to provide this support. In the circumstances I cannot accept this recommendation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s comments. First, I do not believe it is a generous tax break &mdash; it is only a moderate one. If we had no other tax relief schemes, I would agree fully with the Minister, but we do. For example, U2 can claim tax relief, although it is one of the wealthiest bands in the world, if not the wealthiest. Likewise, the bloodstock industry can claim tax relief. The property tax break in section 50 suits people with five or six properties who can offset their tax liability against rental income.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ulick Burke has pointed out, these people are out playing their sports, yet the amount of criticism being levelled at them is unreal. If professional footballers have a bad day they, at least, earn a nice big salary but those playing GAA club or inter-county games have no such comeback, yet they are criticised more than their professional counterparts.</P>
    <P>We often talk about getting more people involved in sports. Recently, I saw a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that a quarter of Irish teenagers are obese. We are trying to encourage them to play sports but the difficulty is that people are not as active as they used to be. The proposed tax relief would be a way of encouraging people to engage in sport. The Minister pointed out the need for balance in tax relief, weighing up what one gives and what is taken back. It could be argued that those who avail of this tax credit might stay in sport longer and since they would be healthier, the State would incur fewer medical costs later on. As the Minister said, such a balance is required.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="2013"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is some merit in what Senator Browne is saying. The principle is well established in the tax code that a tax credit which derives from a particular income or activity can, nonetheless, be set against income arising from a different activity. By any stretch of the imagination, therefore, it would not be a new principle to establish such a relief.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister raised the matter of GAA funding which is an interesting issue and one on which I would not seriously disagree with him. Perhaps he can help me on one or two points, however. As I understand it, there is still money outstanding to the GAA, which was promised to the association in consideration of its support for the national stadium in Abbotstown. Given the Government&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with the national stadium, is that money clearly off the table now?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister received any proposal from the GAA for the completion of the renovated Hill 16? I appreciate that the Minister&rsquo;s county does not have the opportunity to visit Croke Park very often, but he will appreciate that those of us who support the premier county of Dublin and the city clubs like to go to Croke Park regularly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Senator that Tipperary is the premier county.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Dublin GAA fans lament the passing of Hill 16 but they are delighted that the planning authority has decided to allow it to be reconstructed as a terrace. I would be interested to know if there has been a specific proposal from the GAA to fund Hill 16, whether the Minister is considering this and whether he is favourably disposed towards it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne raised a number of tax reliefs, each of which relates to people making their living from that particular activity. He mentioned reliefs for artists, the bloodstock industry and others which are related to income. The recommendation is not related to a person&rsquo;s income.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>But the capital allowances are not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>By definition, an amateur sportsperson does not derive an income from that activity. Capital allowances are brought in to incentivise various activities to which reference was made earlier. I brought in the most far reaching change in my first Finance Act by ring fencing the reliefs. There was more pressure on me to change that proposal than many others, which had a higher profile.</P>
    <P>The recommendation proposes tax relief against the income of sportspersons from their jobs. Many thousands of people are involved in voluntary activity outside the sporting arena. They do tremendous work and are role models in their communities. They give up a great deal of <Col N="2014"/>time at great expense. How could I justifiably say those people should not be recognised in terms of special tax credit against their work income if I granted it to elite amateur sportspersons? It is not a small relief. The personal tax credit for 2004 was only &euro;1,520. The proposed extra tax relief under this recommendation is &euro;2,000, which equates to &euro;10,000 in income for a standard rate taxpayer and is, therefore, a substantial relief.</P>
    <P>Aside from the quantum of the relief, I cannot go along with the principle it is proposed to establish. I have been clear in both Houses about this matter and Members should read what I said. This is not something I will enter in the tax code. The change in 2002 for professional sportspersons, which has been alluded to, relates to their income from their professional activities, whether they are jockeys, rugby players or boxers, and the relief is given at the end of their sporting lives so that they will have something at the end. Most of their careers are short. They can pick their best ten years going back to the 1990-91 tax year and re-calculate their tax liability under the new provision. They cannot write off their tax liabilities. They pay their tax liability similar to everybody else annually but, at the end of their sporting lives, their liability is re-calculated. It has been beneficial, even in the recent past.</P>
    <P>My belief regarding publicity is that if people have an image of somebody, there is no point trying to kill it. I have seldom tried to correct the record in this regard. However, some of the professional jockeys to whom Senator McDowell referred live in County Kildare, but the majority live in a different constituency to mine, Kildare South. I have represented a semi-Dublin constituency following the last two general elections. I hate killing a good story. I would kill my image as a right winger altogether if I keep going on with some of this stuff. I do not want to do that because what would certain organisations, trade unionists and commentators in certain newspapers do if I lost that particular image?</P>
    <P>I do not accept Senator Browne&rsquo;s recommendation and I have outlined why I cannot do so. I recognise more than most the effort put in by amateur sportspersons to their sports, particularly intercounty GAA players. They train as hard as professional athletes and harder in some circumstances. A player&rsquo;s job would want to be a reasonably cushy number to be able to put up with the training hurling and football intercounty panels undergo. Only two teams will win the All-Ireland championships but the other counties put in as big an effort and they never get recognition for it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Hill 16?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator referred to both Abbotstown and Hill 16. The Government made a commitment in the context of the proposed national stadium at Abbotstown to give moneys to the GAA over a period of time. I honoured that over various years until it was no longer possible to proceed with the Abbotstown proposal. I, therefore, do not owe the GAA any money and I told the association that directly at face to face meetings a considerable time ago. There is no money outstanding to the GAA. The agreement was made in the context of the construction of a national stadium at Abbotstown and the GAA was to do certain things in that regard. The agreement is no longer in vogue and, therefore, I do not owe the GAA, on behalf of the taxpayer, any money. I made that clear to the GAA in face to face meetings with the association&rsquo;s previous president and his officials a long time ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to the redevelopment of Hill 16, an application for funding would be made to the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism and not the Minister for Finance. I will check whether an application in this regard has been made but no moneys have been dedicated to it.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="2016"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister be well disposed towards such an application?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government parties have been more than generous to the GAA during their two terms in office. I recall the barrage of criticism from politically correct Ireland following my first budget when I allocated £20 million to the GAA over six years. We went ahead and most people now think it was money well spent. I outlined the amounts the Government and its predecessor have given the GAA. However, the moneys allocated through sports lottery funding each year is not recognised. The bulk of the funding goes to the GAA for good reason. The organisation makes the best applications, it has much of the work done and it has significant funding in place itself. We have responded in kind and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not owe GAA headquarters any money as a result of that agreement years ago. The Government will examine applications from the GAA for funding in the future but that is a matter for another day. No money is owed to the GAA.</P>

  <P>Recommendation declared lost.</P>
  <P>Sections 5 and 6 agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">5. In page 8, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P><Col N="2016"/>
    <P LI="2">7.&mdash;Section 819 of the Principal Act is amended&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) by inserting a new subsection (2A) and (2B):</P>
    <P LI="4">&lsquo;(2A) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section an individual who is an Irish citizen shall be deemed for all purposes to be resident in the State for <Col N="2017"/>a year of assessment unless such individual shall prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that such individual is not resident in the State within the meaning of this section.</P>
    <P LI="4">(2B) The Revenue Commissioners shall prescribe such returns and information an individual who is an Irish citizen shall deliver to prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that such individual should be treated as not resident in the State for the purpose of this section.&rsquo;,</P>
    <P LI="5">(<i>b</i>) in subsection (4) by deleting the words &lsquo;at the end of the day&rsquo; and the substitution of the words &rsquo;at any time during a day&rsquo;,</P>
    <P LI="5">(<i>c</i>) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (5):</P>
    <P LI="6">&lsquo;(5) For the purposes of this section, an individual who is an Irish citizen, who would under the provisions of this section be not resident in the State for a year of assessment, shall be deemed to be resident in the State for the year of assessment unless such individual proves to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that such Irish citizen is resident in another State where such individual is liable for the payment of tax on worldwide income and capital gains made by such individual in the year of assessment.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This recommendation seeks to end the tax-free status of Irish millionaires who live abroad. Currently, if such a person spends 183 days and nights of a year abroad, he or she is exempted from tax. Fine Gael is not happy with that and considers it necessary to tighten and reform the provisions in this regard. There is broad consensus on the issue on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I find it nauseating to see these so-called &ldquo;great Irish people&rdquo; who have probably paid less tax over the course of their lives than I have in my short working career. When they present a cheque for &euro;100 to some charity, they make the front pages of every newspaper and are portrayed as fantastic Irish people. At the same time, the ordinary Irish worker who pays the normal PAYE rates is crucified. While we must, unfortunately, provide for the tax status in question, it is time to update and reform it. Fine Gael calls for that reform today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Browne on this recommendation, which I support strongly. There is nothing in the tax code which more disturbs and annoys ordinary taxpayers than what they see as an abuse of the residency rules. People who are manifestly Irish and who made their fortunes in the first instance <Col N="2018"/>in Ireland now live abroad purely for tax purposes. In essence, they are tax exiles. Frequently, they visit the country and leave before midnight, in which case they need not count that particular day as part of their residency for tax purposes. While I do not expect the Minister to accept the recommendation before us, he would send a useful and powerful signal if he were to indicate that he is unhappy with a clear abuse and intends to review the residency rules.</P>
    <P>The recommendation moved by Fine Gael suggests residency for tax purposes should be based on citizenship. It is a useful starting point, though it may be a little too simplistic. No doubt, there are people who are Irish citizens who have not been here during the course of the year and who do not derive income in Ireland. I acknowledge that the section as recommended allows for that possibility. Citizenship is a good starting point. There should be an onus on people who are clearly Irish citizens to demonstrate why they should not contribute to the maintenance of public services here.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McDowell though I will, of course, vote with the Government. The Minister should examine this issue. I find it obnoxious to see these people who make fortunes here. When their children are due to be born, they have them born outside the country. As Senator McDowell said, the average person in the street is conscious of the need to examine the issue. These people must be very unpatriotic to have made their fortunes out of us and yet not wish to live here. It would be a positive political decision to revise the provisions though I am not in a position to suggest how that could be done.</P>
    <P>It is an important issue for the rest of the citizens of Ireland. When Senator Browne began to speak and used the word &ldquo;nauseating&rdquo;, I wondered why he did so in this context. Having heard what he had to say, I agree with him. I find it irritating to see the headlines when these people come to and leave the country. Many of them have made their money through State businesses. The less said, the better which is why I should sit down before I say too much. They have earned money from public contracts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree broadly with the sentiments of my colleagues. Any judgment must be pragmatic to maximise the public good for individuals in this country. There is a person I will not name, as to do so would be to contravene the rules of the House, who is much criticised, particularly on the Order of Business. To give Members a clue to his identity, he runs a successful airline company. To be fair, that person is tax resident in this country and has even had his photograph taken with a cheque detailing the several million euro he pays. I accept the points made by Senators White and others. Certain people seem to expect enormous praise for particular donations and benefactions they make, whereas they would make a better <Col N="2019"/>contribution if they were to remain resident here and, like the gentleman I mentioned, maintained a herd of pedigree cattle to occupy their leisure.</P>
    <P>It is thanks to the Minister, in particular, and some of his predecessors that the tax system is no longer as onerous and penal as it could once have been represented. There are people who have made out of public assets vast, windfall fortunes before disappearing to some Mediterranean clime. I agree that it sticks in people&rsquo;s craws. We have a fine country and the tax system is not so onerous. If people are very rich, they can keep a large amount of their wealth to spend here. A caveat is that among that class of individuals, there are some who engage in substantial economic activity in other countries. Given their substantial investments and businesses abroad, they may need to live and work in several different countries. They are in a slightly different category to persons who made their fortunes here before leaving for some other clime simply to avoid paying tax. It is not the patriotic thing to do.</P>
    <P>While I am glad the matter is being discussed and aired here, like Senator McDowell, I expect the Minister will not be able to accept the recommendation in its current form. It does no harm to move this recommendation to allow us all to register what we think of the vast majority of our fellow citizens feel on this subject.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>This recommendation is concerned with our current residency rules which were introduced in the Finance Act 1994 following detailed consideration by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners. They replace the previous unsatisfactory approach which was based primarily on case law and Revenue practice and reflected the development of the income tax system in the United Kingdom from its introduction in 1799. Interestingly, last April the British Treasury published a background paper entitled &ldquo;Reviewing the residence of domicile rules as they affect the taxation of individuals&rdquo;. In this paper, it acknowledged that Britain&rsquo;s current rules on determining residence of domicile, developed over the past 200 years, are complex, poorly understood and do not reflect the reality of today&rsquo;s integrated world. The British rules are effectively the rules we would now have if we did not take the initiative we did in 1994.</P>
    <P>The essence of this recommendation is twofold. First, it proposes that every Irish citizen be treated as tax resident in the State unless he or she can prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that he or she is being taxed in that year in another jurisdiction. Second, it proposes that the question of an Irish citizen being present in the State for any day be asked on the basis of whether the individual was present in the State at any time during that day. The current regime only asks whether a person is present in the State at the end of that day.</P><Col N="2020"/>
    <P>A Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Government introduced the changes in 1994. The then Fine Gael spokesperson, Ivan Yates, pointed out on Committee Stage of the 1994 Finance Bill that the provisions, as they were then drafted, would render a person who stayed overnight in the State present here for two days rather than one. Hence the rule was changed to account only a presence at the end of a day. This was consistent with Revenue practice prior to the introduction of the 1994 rules.</P>
    <P>The 183-day rule is the common rule among other jurisdictions. However, it is not applied in the same way in every jurisdiction. For example, Britain ignores the days of arrival and departure, regardless of the number of visits in a tax year. If one arrived in Britain on a Monday and left on a Wednesday, one would only have been deemed resident for one day. Indeed, were one to arrive on a Monday and leave on a Tuesday, one would not be deemed resident for any day. In Denmark, an individual is deemed resident if he or she has lived there for six consecutive months.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne&rsquo;s recommendation seems to force an obligation on all Irish citizens, regardless of where they reside, to convince the Revenue Commissioners that they are not liable for tax in Ireland. Even if such an approach were administratively feasible, I cannot see how it would be of assistance in keeping Ireland competitive in the global economy.</P>
    <P>The USA is unique among OECD countries in basing its tax residence on citizenship and not on where a person lives. Several OECD countries apply the same basic residency tests as we apply in this State, namely, the number of days spent in the State in the tax year. Ireland&rsquo;s approach to this is not unusual.</P>
    <P>The change brought about after long discussions within the Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour Party coalition Government in 1994 put this complex area on a much better footing. As I have pointed out on previous occasions, the rules on residency and domicile were complex and based on a mixture of administrative practice and other arrangements. The 1994 decision put this on a legislative basis and has worked well. All countries I know have this income tax residency rule, except the United States, which has a citizenship rule.</P>
    <P>This recommendation is another example of the bar stool approach to economics. While one can get a cheer by proposing this, it is not based on any sense of reality. We live in a global economy and people are entitled to live in whatever jurisdiction best suits them. There is nothing unusual about the Irish case. Our residency rules are in line, and in some cases more stringent, than tests applied in other countries. As I have said in the D&aacute;il, changing this is not on my agenda.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone changes one&rsquo;s mind and no matter how clever one is, there is nothing wrong with doing so. When I read about these people I wonder what is wrong with the country that, having made such riches, they want to leave. Why cannot they live here? Why are they so greedy that they are not prepared to pay taxes? I would hate to leave my country to live in Spain or elsewhere. I cannot understand the state of mind of someone who would do this for tax purposes. It is blatant greed and sets a bad example.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should say that he will not change this. He might consider it. Were we to collect more taxes from such people we would be able to help the small section of our society that is disadvantaged. Only about 4% of the population is not doing well. I think of Travellers and dysfunctional people who cannot work. The money raised under this could be used to help them.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. As I indicated in my contribution, I did not expect that changing this would be on the Minister&rsquo;s agenda. I accept this as a pragmatic judgment. There is no harm in expressing the widespread feelings held by the public about such persons. Many people find their decision regrettable.</P>
    <P>If tax liability were linked to citizenship then, unfortunately, there would be many renunciations of Irish citizenship. I am not sure that we necessarily want to force &mdash; in their eyes &mdash; our wealthiest people to renounce their Irish citizenship.</P>

	<P>Senator Mansergh made a valid point of the current economic conditions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those that pertained years ago. At one time, people paid tax at a rate of 65%. It sounds daft and I cannot even imagine it now. The economic conditions have changed and everything should be up for review. It is unfair that people can claim tax exile status and masquerade as great and patriotic Irishmen and women. While the gentleman Senator Mansergh referred to has many faults&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>A balance must be struck. After all, people establish industries here, promote business and can then be cheese-paring about their personal taxes. As the law stands, it is their privilege to do so. It is suggested that this should be examined.</P>
    <P>I listened to what the Minister said with interest. I also listened to someone I admire, the singer George Michael, when he was interviewed on &ldquo;Parkinson&rdquo; recently. He said something unusual for a person with a great deal of money and international celebrity. He said that he felt there was disproportion in western life and that some people, including him, had too much money. He said that he feels he has enough money and for this reason, he will make his music available to the public for free download via the Internet. This seems to be a decent approach to life and I certainly welcome it.</P>
    <P>I do not know where a ceiling should be placed, it may be &euro;20 million, &euro;40 million or &euro;200 million. I read a list containing the names of Irish people who have made huge amounts of money, and more power to them. Some of them were billionaires. At that point, money becomes meaningless. After all, one can only eat so much. I do my best. I eat like a pig. I enjoy life and indulge myself as much as possible, but there are limits to the physical human capacity to enjoy wealth. It is rather obscene and distortive that some people have so much money. When Mr. Parkinson asked George Michael what he would say about going back to the old days &mdash; a notion mentioned by other Senators &mdash; when there were tax rates of 60%, 70% or 80% for the super-rich in England, George Michael said he thought that was fair. So do I.</P>

There is something obscene about these enormous amounts of money. There is a distortion. This morning we debated the issue concerning widows, for example, and yesterday we heard the Minister for Finance say quite aptly in the D&aacute;il that some of the fees which barristers received over three days amounted to more than a widow received in an entire year. How much more do these people get from investments? They use every loophole to avoid paying their taxes. That is a pity.</P>
    <P>When I graduated from Trinity College, I used to have lunch with some friends, one of whom was a red-hot roaring republican. He could not wait to tell us how he fiddled his tax. This man <Col N="2023"/>loved Ireland so much that he could not wait to defraud it. There is such a thing as patriotism. It is a pity that people choose to wriggle in every way possible to avoid paying tax and that tax is used by the Minister for Finance and by our colleagues to support people who are less able to support and defend themselves. It is dreadfully mean-minded.</P>

  <P>Recommendation put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 6 not moved.</P>
  <P>Section 7 agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 7:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 13, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), line 41, to delete &ldquo;used.&rsquo;,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">(5G) Subsection (1) shall not apply to expenses incurred by the body corporate in or in connection with a medical examination for a director or employee where the director is not a proprietary director and/or the employee is not a relative, as defined by section 433(3)(<i>a</i>), of a proprietary director of the body corporate.&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Regarding section 8, the Minister obviously made substantial changes to the benefit in kind in the last budget. We ask that medical examinations be exempt from benefit in kind. As the Minister said, there is a need for balance in this area. It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests that people be medically checked. This might apply more to the male than the female population, as men generally tend not to visit the doctor until obliged to do so. I would not like to see any obstacle put in their way. We should be encouraging people to have regular check-ups, and ensure they do not incur tax penalties when doing so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It makes perfect sense that we should encourage people &mdash; particularly men, as Dr. Henry knows because of her profession &mdash; to undergo medical examination regularly. Such examinations are provided by larger companies in particular. That is useful, and should not be subject to benefit in kind.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s reflections on how this provision is working out. Most of us support it in principle but are not sure how it works in practice. The details of the amendments being introduced by the Minister in this year&rsquo;s Bill tend to suggest that it is at least unravelling at the edges, in so far as we are now making exceptions for mobile phones, computers and so on.</P>
    <P>All of us support the notion that if one is getting a large or significant portion of one&rsquo;s income by means of benefit in kind, then one should pay tax on it. There are however many fringe benefits which are not of great material <Col N="2024"/>benefit and which are clearly not an abuse in the sense of being deliberately provided in order to avoid paying people money. A sensible, pragmatic approach is called for. Otherwise, we run the risk of bringing the system into disrepute and very likely tying up the Revenue Commissioners in a great deal of detail with which they would prefer not to be involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>This recommendation would require that all medical examinations undertaken by employees and directors other than proprietary directors or connected persons, paid for by a company, would not be subject to the new provisions regarding benefit in kind. The cost of providing medical check-ups which employees are obliged by their employers to undergo is not regarded as a taxable benefit, and is not liable to PAYE or PRSI. However, routine medical check-ups, paid for but not required by the employer, are treated as giving rise to a taxable benefit, and I do not plan to change this arrangement.</P>
    <P>Regarding the application of PAYE and PRSI to benefits in January, this initiative is designed to ensure that on grounds of equity, employer remuneration in whatever form provided is treated similarly for tax, PRSI and levy purposes. The Senator&rsquo;s recommendation would in effect mean that employees who benefit from medical check-ups that are paid for by their employer, which are not required as part of their employment, are treated more favourably than those who pay for their own medical check-ups. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell asked a question regarding BIKs and the new situation regarding how we apply tax in the particular areas. In December 2002, I announced that the new arrangement would be implemented from 1 January 2004 in order to allow time for employers and everyone else to get their affairs in order. In the latter quarter of 2003, after much consultation with the various bodies, I announced the publication of the details and regulations. Changes in this year&rsquo;s Bill reflect the consultations undertaken then, and I am not aware of any significant difficulties so far this year. From the time I published the methodology of computing last year, I made one significant change regarding vans in private usage. The other changes regarding the personal use of mobile phones and computers were in the changed regulations which I published.</P>
    <P>The purpose here is to avoid employers remunerating their employees and escaping PRSI and PAYE. Some of the changes put the payment of tax on a different basis so that it is now deducted through the PAYE system. Some benefits in kind used to be paid by employees in arrears. For tax reasons, many employers were remunerating their employees by means of a method which would escape PRSI and PAYE. That is not fair to the generality of employees who do not have the wherewithal to use such <Col N="2025"/>methods. It is simpler to put everyone on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>We left some significant items outside the PRSI net, namely share options. Attempting to include them was becoming so complicated that I abandoned hope. It is not currently a major issue, because share options last year were not the major consideration they were in previous times. I have tried to ensure that everyone pays PAYE and PRSI on the same basis. At the time of the budget in December 2003 I estimated that a figure of &euro;83 million might be the benefit to the Exchequer of particular changes. We can assess that after 2004 to see if we got more or less than that figure.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 20 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a somewhat tortuous area that has caused difficulties over a number of years. The Minister will be aware that the main unions involved in the construction industry have made representations over time as to how the RCT system works. The Revenue Commissioners undertook a significant survey on how it was working and were looking to track down abuses and stamp them out. I presume that the establishment of this register is a further measure in that regard.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister inform the House what the current state of play is and to what extent the Revenue Commissioners have been successful, or otherwise, in reducing the measure of the abuse of the RCT system?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>This section governs relevant contracts tax, generally referred to as RCT. It is a tax that principal contractors are obliged to deduct from payments made to certain sub-contractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry industries.</P>
    <P>There are three aspects to the amended section. The first relates to the setting up and maintenance by Revenue of a register of principal contractors and the creation of a formal registration procedure for new principal contractors. At present, the role of principal contractors in the operation of the RCT system requires them to deduct the relevant contracts tax from a certified sub-contractor and to remit it to the Collector General on a monthly basis. The <Col N="2026"/>relationship between principal contractors and the Revenue Commissioners is, therefore, fiduciary in nature just like employers&rsquo; relationships in operating the PAYE system and registered persons to the operations of VAT in the business system. Employers and VAT registered persons are required to formally register with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of each of these functions. This straightforward registration process establishes the fiduciary relationship between Revenue and those persons with regard to those taxes.</P>
    <P>However, no similar arrangement exists between the principal contractors involved in the operation of the RCT system. This section, therefore, includes an enabling provision in the primary legislation dealing with the making of RCT regulations which will allow the Revenue Commissioners to set up and maintain a register of all principal contractors and to where new contractors must formally register with them in that capacity. The enabling rule for the register will have effect from the date of passing of the Finance Bill while details of the form, the requirements to be met in the registration procedure and any time limits applying will be set out in new income tax relevant contracts that are collated later this year. Apart from this approach, registration will also help in establishing the bona fides of persons contacting Revenue as principal contractors regarding various aspects of the RCT system.</P>
    <P>The second proposal in this section deals with the renewal of certificates of authorisation. This issue concerns the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; entitlement to renew certificates of authorisation, C2s as they are commonly called. These certificates, when produced to a principal contractor, allow the contractor to apply to Revenue for a relevant payment card in respect of the sub-contractor. The relevant payments card permits the principal contractor to pay the sub-contractor without deduction of tax. At present, primary legislation governing RCT provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall issue a certificate of authorisation on application to them in that regard by a person if certain requirements for permits are met. However, in order to smooth the transition of the RCT system and reduce compliant costs on the sub-contractors involved, the Revenue Commissioners will be able to renew C2s subject to a compliance check without the need for the sub-contractor to make a fresh application. Strictly speaking, current legislation does not support this administrative arrangement, except that it puts beyond doubt wherever there is entitlement in an appropriate case to renew C2 in this manner. It will bring the legislation into line with administrative practice. Confirmation by Revenue of this type of the new C2 will have effect from 1 January 2004.</P>
    <P>The third issue in this section concerns technical cross-referencing. The Finance Act 1999 amended the RCT legislation and provided the <Col N="2027"/>right of appeal to the Revenue Commissioners where certificates of authorisation were cancelled. At that time, a cross-reference to the new provisions in section 17A and section 531 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was inadvertently omitted from subsection (20) of that section which provided for the Revenue Commissioners to nominate an officer to act on their behalf at an appeal. It has now been corrected and is deemed to apply with respect to 1999, 2000 and subsequent years of assessment. The commencement date is amended.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell asked how successful the Revenue Commissioners have been in ensuring compliance in the relevant contractors tax area. This is an area of taxation which has bedevilled Administrations for the past 30 years. The Finance Act 1970 introduced the sub-contractors&rsquo; C2 system. Many changes have been made over the years in almost every Finance Act with attempts to tighten up the scheme. This section is a provision to tighten it further. In the past number of years the investigations carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, through their joint investigative teams on site, have been successful. In the construction sector, this is the one area where there has been tax evasion over the years. However, in my professional and political opinion, this has been dramatically tightened up over the past seven years. One can never say that one can eliminate tax evasion in PAYE, PRSI levies and construction tax. However, tremendous changes have been made in recent years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many companies are concerned about individuals with C2s and payment cards. Can the Minister check that some people have received C2s and payments cards with post-dated cheques and cheques on account? It is not right that many sub-contractors, who were fly-by-night operators, could produce C2s to be paid, while not paying their own dues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have this matter checked out for the Senator. However, it is my understanding that the issuing of C2 certificates is tightly controlled. It would be a fair feat for an individual to obtain a C2 certificate as the Revenue have tightened it up over the years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised that there is not already some register of principal contractors in place, simply on an administrative basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check that for the Senator. I understand that Revenue has a register for administrative purposes. This section will provide for a formal procedure for registering new applicants for principal contractors.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 23 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am at a loss to understand the alterations proposed in this section that deals with nursing homes. It reduces the qualifying number of residential units from 20 to ten.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>There may have been some misunderstanding on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il of this proposal. Some years ago I brought in a particular relief for nursing homes. It was then put to me that nursing home complexes could be seen as residential units which I brought in as a qualifying criteria. It is the reduction in the number of residential units from 20 to ten that is involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Minister is speaking of sheltered housing and the like.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, such areas of activity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this section deal with nursing homes at all?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Except in the nursing homes&rsquo; tax relief &mdash; it was an add-on in a previous Finance Bill that one could have residential units as part of an overall nursing homes complex. The number was 20 and it was to be reduced to ten.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that to encourage further take-up?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. It will satisfy those who have put forward the idea of residential nursing homes. It is one thing to provide for nursing homes as units on their own, but it is far better to provide nursing home units and sheltered accommodation. I made that addition to it in, I think, the second year. I think it relates to the fact that residential units are part of nursing homes. The Senator is right, in one sense, to state that it does not relate strictly to the nursing homes tax relief, but it is in that section of the Bill.</P>

  <P Just="Center">SECTION 27.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 27 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to explore the effectiveness and the level of take-up of some of the capital allowances schemes. I believe sections 26 and 27 refer equally to the schemes. Specifically, the Minister is extending the availability before terminating some of the schemes. I want to use the opportunity provided <Col N="2029"/>by this debate to explore the take-up of some of the schemes. Some of the schemes, such as the living over the shop scheme, the student accommodation scheme and the park and ride scheme, which we discussed earlier, have not been used to a great degree. I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the take-up of the schemes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said earlier, we are aware of just one possible park and ride development, despite the scheme&rsquo;s attractiveness.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the proposed scheme in south County Dublin? I refer to a proposed development in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure, but I think the Deputy is correct. It should be borne in mind that the living over the shop scheme is a regurgitation of a previous scheme, which may have been introduced by Deputy Quinn. As there was practically no take-up of the former scheme, it was eventually abandoned. When I became Minister for Finance, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said that if further changes were made to the previous scheme, it might be more successful. We made more changes at the behest of the Department, but we understand that there has been a very poor take-up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not worked.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not worked, even though changes were made. The student accommodation scheme has been well utilised in the various university cities and towns, including one in my constituency.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a big take-up of the scheme, which was introduced in section 50 of a previous Act. The take-up of the park and ride scheme has been almost non-existent, the take-up of the living over the shop scheme has been very poor, even though it is being rejigged for the second time, and the take-up of the student accommodation scheme has been substantial.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator mentioned this matter in his contribution on Second Stage. Under the original Bill, as published, one&rsquo;s incremental expenditure on research and development had to be at least &euro;50,000. I reduced that figure to &euro;0 on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity that the change was made, because we should seek to encourage a significant measure of additional research and development. It may not be worthwhile to get involved in the administrative hassle of dealing with relatively small amounts of research and development, which give quite little additional benefit. I welcome the scheme, generally speaking, and I wish it well. I share the concerns expressed by my colleague in the other House, Deputy Burton, about the building aspect of the scheme.

   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

	<P>That is the way she is; that is her personality.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding of the section is that buildings that are constructed for the particular purpose of research and development are liable for the relief. The Minister is aware that it is a generous relief. I understand that it is basically a double relief, in a sense. There is nothing wrong, in principle, with giving tax relief on such buildings, but it would be worrying if a significant measure of the relief being claimed under this section were to be claimed in respect of buildings that may not necessarily be used for research and development in the future.</P>

	<P>Perhaps a summary would be useful.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="2031"/>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 33 gives effect to the budget announcement to introduce a tax credit for research and development by providing for a credit of 20% of incremental expenditure by a group of companies on research and development. Expenditure on buildings is not considered in the calculation of incremental expenditure, as a credit for such expenditure is dealt with separately. Expenditure that is not on buildings, but is incurred in a relevant period by the members of a group of companies, is aggregated. The group&rsquo;s expenditure on research and development in that period is compared with its expenditure in the same area in a base period. A tax credit equal to 20% of the increase in expenditure is given to the group and can be allocated to companies that are members of the group in any manner they wish. The amount allocated to a company can be offset against corporation tax payable by the company in accounting periods falling into the relevant period. Any part of the credit that cannot be set off in that manner in an accounting period is carried forward to be offset against corporation tax payable in the subsequent period. Unused amounts of credit can be carried forward indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Last year, 2003, is taken as the base period for 2004, 2005 and 2006. The level of research and development expenditure in 2004 will be compared to the level of such expenditure in 2003. The additional expenditure will qualify for the credit. Similarly, research and development expenditure in 2005 will be compared with such expenditure in 2003. The same approach will be applied in 2006. The approach will give a good incentive to companies to get started on research and development. For later years, the base period will be the corresponding period ending three years earlier.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, I removed the rule that stated that one had to spend a minimum of &euro;50,000 on research and development in order to qualify for the tax credit. Therefore, the credit will apply equally to large and small companies. To qualify for a credit, the research and development work must be carried out by the company in an EEA country. The expenditure must qualify for a tax deduction under Irish law and, in the case of companies that are Irish resident, must not qualify for a deduction under the law of another territory. The credit applies to in-house company expenditure. Payments by a company to a university or third level institute in the EEA to carry out research and development will qualify for the credit, subject to a maximum of 5% of the research and development work being carried out by the company.</P>

	<P>The buildings have been considered under separate sections for a number of reasons. Expenditure on building a laboratory would constitute research and development, so it would have to be allowed. The relief would be distorted, however, if such expenditure was considered with the research and development activity. One would be able to claim it all back in one year, for example. One will be able to claim it over four years. The construction costs will be considered separately from the other research and development activities to prevent the problems about which Senator McDowell&rsquo;s colleague was worried. The company may decide, after a few years, to turn the research and development facility into a dance hall, although I cannot imagine why it would.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>The original relief would be clawed back in such circumstances. A claimant must be a qualified company &mdash; a company that carries out research and development activities itself. A lessor that incurs expenditure on the construction of a building and rents it to a research and development company will not qualify for the credit on the construction costs. Therefore, the scheme cannot be regarded as a property based tax relief open to investors. The Bill provides for a general regime where the credit is available to any company engaging in qualifying research and development on a self-assessment basis. This is the normal basis for the tax treatment of companies. I reassure Senator McDowell that the purpose of this section is to <Col N="2033"/>prevent any possibility of other forms of tax incentivised property being built. The Bill is not intended to provide for such development.</P>

    <P>There are a couple of things to be said about emigration from Ireland. It was perhaps the greatest generator of excuses for failure that this country ever had. It was a failure that for most of the last 80 years, until about 20 years ago, we collectively tried to excuse and that was not confined to one particular political party. We collectively grabbed on to excuses for our failure. When Professor Joe Lee produced his book, <i>Ireland 1912-1985: Politics and Society</i>, and did a magnificent job of looking at our collective excuses and demolishing them, for instance, our excuse that we were peripheral and then pointing out the position of Finland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker><Col N="2035"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please. Senator Ryan without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is since Professor Lee produced his analysis that we developed the confidence in ourselves and the willingness to take responsibility for ourselves that produced the extraordinary economic performance. It was also due to the bedrock laid by the extraordinary achievements of the 1983-7 coalition Government in sustaining education in the teeth of a mess created by Fianna F&aacute;il which produced the skilled labour force that became the major driving force for our success in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Professor Lee went through a succession of our excuses for ourselves and demolished them all. On peripherality, it was clear that there were countries which were just as peripheral. On population growth it was clear that other countries had a more rapid population growth. Having gone through all these excuse he then pointed out that, in addition, most of the successful small countries of Europe had been flattened by the Second World War but had managed to deal with that and recover.</P>
    <P>When we presided over mass emigration from this country, when we pretended to ourselves for perhaps three generations that it was inevitable, when an eminent politician and one-time T&aacute;naiste, Brian Lenihan, suggested the country could not hold or keep on its territory the number of people that needed to live here and that emigration was a necessity, we were all wrong. This country is capable of sustaining high levels of population and high levels of prosperity like every other small country in Europe that has done so.</P>
    <P>It was our fault as a nation that they emigrated. They did not do it freely or by choice or because they were interested in other cultures, but because the alternative was either misery at home or what they believed to be better chances abroad. For many, although not as many as some of the more optimistic commentators today would suggest, it was a question of better opportunities abroad. What we now know and what we have known for some time, and which was crystallised for many of us in December by a television programme, is that there is also a significant number for whom opportunities abroad, if they existed, were minor, peripheral and left them with no great security in life. There is empirical evidence that the proportion of Irish people in psychiatric hospitals, in prison, and homeless on the streets of the United Kingdom is considerably greater than the proportion in the population at large. A good number of our older fellow Irish people have fallen through whatever nets existed. I presume that was the reason the task force was set up.</P>
    <P>Having read the report of the task force, it is calm, dispassionate and focused. Its members are happy to acknowledge gaps in information. To its credit, it made specific recommendations, each one of which is worthy and important. Two, in <Col N="2036"/>particular, need to be emphasised. These are the two to which I wish to refer. First, there is the recommendation that a new structure be established, the agency for the Irish abroad. It goes into detail about the membership of that agency. The second major recommendation, or the one I choose to highlight, is its crystal clear conviction that to do what needed to be done for people who needed these services, a dramatic improvement in funding was required. The figure it quotes is &euro;18 million for 2003 rising to &euro;34 million for 2005. Those are the gross figures for many different services. For current services it makes specific recommendations. The task force considers that the support for voluntary agencies providing welfare services to the Irish abroad, which in the year in which it reported was &euro;3.5 million, should be increased to &euro;11 million in 2003, building to &euro;21 million in 2005. The two specific recommendations are a dedicated agency and a specific funding revolution.</P>
    <P>We have got &euro;4 million this year which is less than a third of what the task force recommended. We have a unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs which will get working after the Presidency. That is extraordinary. It will be done when important things are out of the way. The generation we abandoned has to wait until important things are done. It does not have to be like that. I can understand why the Department of Foreign Affairs part of this could be stretched, but we could set up the agency that was recommended. The agency and the unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs are both recommended by the task force and are clearly identified as being different bodies with different roles. The setting up of a unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs is a recommendation of the task force but it is not a substitute for and nor will it meet the objectives of an agency.</P>
    <P>The task force reported in 2002. Two years later we get a decision which is not to have an agency. Over a period, the Government decided there were other priorities. That is the lecture one always gets, that there are choices to be made. We all know there are choices to be made. The choice was made to ignore a recommendation from a bipartisan, totally apolitical task force set up by the Government. There was a deliberate decision to ignore the recommendation of the task force.</P>
    <P>I was never forced to emigrate and for that I am most grateful to whoever was responsible for not forcing me to emigrate, but I did spend time abroad.</P>
    <P>I will not speak if a conversation is going on at the same time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not missing anything.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State might be missing something. I spent two summers abroad, <Col N="2037"/>working in north west London in Harlesden. Even as a young person and knowing I was coming home in September, one could not but notice the gradually ageing isolated Irish community. If one went to Mass on Sundays and saw them dressed up in the style of dress I associated with my youth, shiny Sunday suits, it was clear they were going to Mass for one main reason, among others, and that was to meet other Irish people. If one walked into a pub in Camden town, as I did, with three people from Connemara and discovered that all the others there were from Connemara, then what we know at this stage about Irish emigration is as follows. We abandoned perhaps 500,000 people and of that number, perhaps a quarter in Britain are in extremely difficult circumstances and are ageing. Every new agency set up has more demands on it.</P>
    <P>The Government responded in a way it is good at, by setting up yet another task force. That task force reported and made its recommendations and the Government abandons two of its most basic recommendations. An agency and money are the two items that will prove we are serious about saying &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; to people who by leaving and by their transmission of funds bailed out this country and who now need us to give them dignity and support in their old age. On both issues, prioritising their problems through an agency and providing funding that will make a difference to them, the Government has failed them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. I thank the Labour Party for tabling this important motion and concur with what Senator Ryan said. We are debating a Private Members&rsquo; motion which is not just about politics. There is a moral dimension to this motion which is the huge debt of gratitude we, and particularly politicians, owe to the Irish emigrants, most of whom were forced to leave this land down through the years to eke out a meagre living abroad. Those people built up the economies of the countries to which they emigrated. Significant numbers of such people sent back money to assist relatives in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland from the 1930s to the 1960s was a bleak place, particularly in economic terms. Without the money sent home weekly or monthly by hundreds of thousands of Irish emigrants abroad, it would have been worse. For that reason alone, there is a moral obligation on every politician in this country and particularly on the Government to ensure that we mark in a meaningful way the contribution of emigrants.</P>
    <P>Last year, I read that fine novel by John McGahern,<i> That They May Face the Rising Sun</i>, a story which is both simple and complex in its way. One of its characters is an emigrant labourer who spent his emigrant years, for economic and social reasons, in London. In his fading years, he returns to Ireland. When in London, he pretended he was financially well off, with an excellent lifestyle. However, as one reads the novel, one realises he yearned to be at home. The <Col N="2038"/>character comes home because he has no pension entitlements and, soon afterwards, he dies.</P>
    <P>Although it is a novel, that character is typical of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of Irish people abroad. The touching nature of the tale struck a chord with me and made me reflect on what we should do to respond to such people. The Minister has received a report from the task force, which the Government amendment on the Order Paper welcomes. However, unfortunately, the amendment continues by stating why the report will not be acted on as and when it should. Senator Ryan concluded by saying that this debate should be about the agency and the money and I reiterate that point. The Minister should show us the colour of the Government&rsquo;s money in regard to this not only political but moral issue.</P>
    <P>There was a time when, during debates on emigration, we had to deal with what Senator Ryan rightly called the politics of choice. The Government of the day, of whatever hue, would have to make hard choices. Now, fortunately, we have sufficient resources to put in place the assistance which many emigrants still need. The choice now is not financial but political. It is up to the Minister and his colleagues in Government to make a clear statement as to what they think of the Irish generations who lived their lives abroad.</P>
    <P>When we debated emigration over the past ten or 15 years, more often than not we were talking about illegal Irish immigrants in the United States. It was a subject in which I had much interest and I went on a few visits to the United States to meet illegal immigrants. That problem has, on the whole, been tackled, although, as the Minister is aware, there is again an emerging problem of illegal Irish immigrants in the United States.</P>
    <P>However, the broader issue of Irish emigrants to Britain must be urgently addressed. We must accept that tens of thousands who worked in Britain, particularly in the construction industry from the 1940s to the 1960s, are not in a position to retire with a decent pension or secure accommodation. Given the circumstances in which they had to find and maintain employment, their remuneration was often without security or welfare and pension benefits. We must urgently quantify the numbers of such people.</P>
    <P>There have been attempts to put in place schemes to bring some home. One of our Oireachtas colleagues, Deputy Cowley, featured in a recent article regarding a scheme in the west through which certain emigrants are being assisted to come home. Despite what was said by a former member of the Fianna F&aacute;il party, referred to by Senator Ryan, the country is big enough for all such people. If we can at least quantify the numbers interested in returning to live out their final years in this country, we should attempt to do so. The question of choice should no longer prohibit us from responding because the money is there &mdash; it is a question of what political priority we give this issue.</P><Col N="2039"/>
    <P>The wording of the motion is the only wording appropriate to this debate. The recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, Lost Generation, brought home to us starkly the sad lives of too many of our fellow Irish citizens abroad. There is a need for a political response. When a task force is charged with a job of work, responds in a concise fashion as to what should be done and quantifies the money required, it is not good enough for any Government to say action must wait. The idea that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must wait until after the EU Presidency to establish the unit is not good enough.</P>
    <P>During recent debates at the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell suggested that there should be some facility, perhaps through that committee, to liaise with, work with and take hearings from Irish citizens abroad, particularly those in Britain, the problems of whom we could investigate at a deeper level. His proposal was supported by all sides of the committee, including by the Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke.</P>
    <P>I support the motion. At a time when record resources are available in a country which was built on the labours and remittances of many emigrants, we must respond in kind and show real political commitment. Anything but immediate action on, and financial response to, the task force report is simply not good enough. It would not be a fair, honest or moral answer to the Irish emigrants who, in their own way, have made a huge contribution to the building of this country.</P>

    <Miles com="is" par="0p10"/><P el="5">&mdash;<Miles com="is" par="0p5"/><Miles com="ix"/>requests the Minister to keep under review the proposals to establish an Agency for the Irish abroad.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">I was an emigrant. I was less than 18 years of age when I travelled to Dublin and out to D&uacute;n Laoghaire on a cold January evening. Two images still resonate through the decades and will probably stay with me until I die. One was the lights of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour as I left and the other was the approaching lights of Holyhead as I arrived. I arrived at Euston station the following morning after a seven hour train journey in a freezing carriage, where to keep warm I snuggled together with others, mainly from the west, who had made the journey seeking a new life. Arriving in Euston, we were met by representatives of the Legion of Mary.</P>
    <P>It is important and timely, in the context of this debate, to pay a warm tribute to Irish organisations such as the Legion of Mary which, for decades, met the Irish coming off the boat-trains to ensure they were looked after in terms of accommodation and, if necessary, to arrange job applications for them, and also to ensure they did not meet with the wrong company. That covers what I mean. They did not wear their religion on their sleeve but were there for purely social purposes. Many of them have now passed to their eternal reward but it is important to pay them a warm tribute and acknowledge the outstanding contribution they made.</P>
    <P>When I first got involved in politics I was elected to the national executive of Fianna F&aacute;il and one of the first things I attempted to do was to raise the question of emigrants at a meeting in Mount Street. I remember being told by the then Minister for Finance, the late George Colley, that Governments did not wish to recognise they had any financial obligation to emigrants because they felt that giving money to emigrants or emigrant organisations outside Ireland would create a pull factor. That was not the term he used then but it has been used subsequently. Governments felt more Irish people would leave if they felt the Government would support them financially in the UK, which was weird thinking. I was relatively young, naive and inexperienced at the time and I was confronted by a very powerful Minister for Finance who was not so much attempting to put me in my box as reflecting the political ethos of the time.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the sincerity and passion of those who have worked on this since the task force reported and I am particularly struck by the passion Deputy Stagg brought to the recent debate on this matter. Some Members may have heard his contribution repeated on &ldquo;Tonight With Vincent Browne&rdquo; and I empathise with and recognise everything he said. The difference was that he was talking about it from an Irish perspective, watching the consequences of the population haemorrhage from the west and his <Col N="2041"/>native Mayo, but I lived that emigrant experience. Until one lives that emigrant experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>So did Deputy Stagg.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;no amount of passion can bring one to the same level. What I meant was that he spoke of the consequences of emigration in his area. I am not saying he was not aware of it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>So was his family.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am paying tribute to Deputy Stagg. He raised the profile of the debate but many politicians and Governments have paid little more than lip service to this issue. All of us are tainted by our neglect of the Irish diaspora and I speak as someone who was fortunate enough to come home and eke out a living.</P>
    <P>We get the impression from debates here, in the D&aacute;il and among the general public that the Government is doing absolutely nothing for emigrants. However, I will put some facts on the record. The Government has introduced the pre-1953 pension scheme, 60% of which goes to Irish people abroad. I know how beneficial this has been from my experience in Leitrim, which probably haemorrhaged more people than any other county, particularly to England. This year &euro;80 million will go to emigrants under this heading.</P>
    <P>The Government has also introduced special initiatives for returning emigrants to enable them to apply for social housing without having to be resident here, despite our ongoing housing crisis. Like the poor, the housing crisis is always with us. At the time of the greatest affluence in our history we still have a housing crisis. However, the Government has committed itself to this special initiative and local authorities are implementing it in so far as they can.</P>
    <P>The focus of the task force and its report was directed towards those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion. It is important to state that because for the vast majority of the Irish diaspora emigration was a positive experience once they got over the trauma of leaving their home place. I was eight years in London and I enjoyed my time there. I am not saying I could not wait to get back home, as I always wanted to return, but it was a mould-breaking experience. I lived there in my formative years and I owe a great deal to my experiences in that time, not just with English people, as it was a multicultural society, but with my Irish contemporaries. We were very close and supportive of each other.</P>
    <P>A Labour Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, reoriented welfare for Irish people abroad by creating D&Iacute;ON in 1983. For five years before that I was a member of its predecessor, the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad, and I was very disappointed when that committee was disbanded. A D&Iacute;ON grant of over &euro;2.5 million <Col N="2042"/>last year went to 57 voluntary organisations in the UK, 45 of which are under Irish management. These organisations provided advice and assistance to about 30,500 Irish people in 2002 &mdash; Irish-managed organisations dealt with 23,000 people and non-Irish organisations dealt with approximately 7,500. In addition, &euro;150,000 was allocated to the Federation of Irish Societies for capacity building within that organisation. That body has played a pivotal role in ensuring the county associations have kept the Irish diaspora&rsquo;s sense of community alive by organising functions through the county associations, particularly in Britain.</P>
    <P>Many of the organisations assisted by D&Iacute;ON funds help Irish people who are homeless or badly housed, and in many cases they are also in poor health. These are organisations like Acton Homeless Concern, Cricklewood Homeless Concern, Leeds Irish Health and Homes and Rehab UK in Coventry. For example, the Rehab Irish Elders Resource Centre, Teach na h&Eacute;ireann, in Coventry has been supported by D&Iacute;ON since 1999 and received a grant of &euro;30,000 last year towards the salaries of a project manager and a support worker who provided services to over 150 elderly Irish people. Support from D&Iacute;ON enables Irish voluntary organisations to provide assistance and advice to many such marginalised people.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan will be pleased to hear that D&Iacute;ON also supports the Simon Community, which works on behalf of homeless people in London. It received a grant of over &euro;30,000 last year towards the salary of an administrator/fundraiser to work on behalf of homeless Irish people in London. In 2002 Simon assisted 236 Irish people, a quarter of its clients.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years half of the D&Iacute;ON allocation went to organisations which provide services to the elderly. One of these is the Southwark Irish Pensioners Project which has been funded by D&Iacute;ON since the mid-1990s. Last year it got a D&Iacute;ON grant of over &euro;57,000 towards the salary of a community co-ordinator and two part-time outreach workers. The organisation now has 482 members, all over 60 years of age, and 97% of them are Irish. The Southwark Irish Pensioners Project operates a drop-in service and lunch club five days a week for its elderly Irish clients, some of whom are disabled and in poor health. The D&Iacute;ON grant makes a very real difference to the lives of these people.</P>
    <P>Many of the organisations D&Iacute;ON funds have outreach workers who seek out and befriend elderly Irish people who are living alone or homeless and who may be in poor circumstances and health. The London Irish Centre in Camden also employs outreach workers, as does the Irish in Greenwich project, Irish Community Care Manchester, Irish Community Care Merseyside and Coventry Irish Society, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>I put that on the record because despite the enormous obstacles and difficulties faced by the Irish diaspora both at organisational level and by <Col N="2043"/>victims of emigration on the ground, I do not want the message to go out from the debate that the Government does not care or is not doing enough. Of course it is not doing enough and I am the first to say so. It will never do enough for those who had to leave our shores involuntarily but there are some positive aspects to this issue, such as the broad political consensus in both Houses that there is an urgent need for the Government to do more for Irish emigrants. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has commitments to Third World relief and he will bring his commitment and expertise to this area. I am sure he will have much to say.</P>
    <P>On radio and television, I welcome RTE&rsquo;s initiative in taking over what was the Atlantic 252 wavelength. It is a long wave wavelength which covers two thirds of the land mass of the UK. However, I hope the Minister of State, maybe through talking to his colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, tries to encourage RTE to provide more emigrant-oriented programmes on 252. At present they are replicating what is currently heard on RTE radio 1. RTE has the capacity to do this. It requires a philosophical or ideological approach as there is a need to look at more programmes oriented towards the Irish diaspora. I support the task force&rsquo;s recommendations in this regard.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to keep in mind an initiative which has come my way. It concerns the recently celebrated symposium on EU citizenship organised by the organisation Europeans Throughout The World, known as ETTW. That organisation deals with emigrant issues, including the international diaspora. Some 35 million people in the EU are not resident in their own countries. The task force refers to the Government&rsquo;s input to the EU, but the ETTW could provide a way forward. One of its main recommendations is that one of the new EU commissioner posts, created under the enlargement process, would be devoted exclusively to the issues of the diaspora within the EU. This recommendation could provide the Government with a way to link in to that process so that there would be a Government initiative for helping those who have left our shores, as well as an EU initiative.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mooney is right that unless one has had the experience of emigration, and the loneliness of being away from home, it is difficult to empathise with those whom we are discussing. For approximately 17 years, Senator Mooney presented his RTE radio programme &ldquo;Both Sides Now&rdquo;. It must have been a draining experience at times because some of the messages broadcast from London, Coventry, Manchester and elsewhere were from people at their lowest ebb. The Senator used the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;, which is very important in the context of this debate. Many of these emigrants are in their 60s and 70s, <Col N="2044"/>so we will not be in a position to act on their behalf if we delay much longer, no matter what good work the Government is doing.</P>
    <P>To date, Senators have spoken about those who left this country to get work because they could not find employment here. However, there were others, for example, women who became pregnant outside marriage, who were forced out for sociological reasons. Tens of thousands of such women had to leave this country to have their children in England. The perceived &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; of having a child outside marriage was terrible and we have never investigated our levels of infanticide in those days, apart from occasional academic theses. It really was a deplorable situation. Some of those women are still resident in England so we could usefully make contact with them.</P>
    <P>Some Senators will be aware that during the Second World War the idea of obliging single women to obtain an exit visa to leave the country was being considered. However, it was decided to drop the proposal when it was realised what effect it might have on the rate of children being born outside marriage. We used England as an appalling escape route for people who were at their most vulnerable. Some of them are still living in England and I have met a number. A friend of mine worked in a centre for Irish women in Islington, which is not the poorest London borough.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Not any more.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>She was a psychologist. She told me the centre had been set up because Irish women who were in serious trouble with psychiatric illness and alcoholism did not want to let the side down by saying why they had to leave Ireland. That is dreadful. They felt that when they went to the regular social services, they could not tell the truth about their previous predicament. I salute the women who established that centre. Approximately nine or ten women per day came in to tell of their experiences. They did not want to let the side down by speaking about being treated for psychiatric illness or having been forced out of Ireland. I do not know what excuses they used to give about their backgrounds but it is very sad to hear of such cases.</P>
    <P>I have also met the children of those women. Senator Mooney is right to talk about the great work of D&Iacute;ON, albeit with limited funds. I went with someone from D&Iacute;ON to attend a meeting of children who had been born to these Irish women. Very little thought was paid to them, apart from the fact that they should have a Catholic upbringing. One man told me he had been put into a house with an elderly Polish couple, which was all that mattered apparently. Those children went through very rough times so we should make more effort to contact them.</P>
    <P>Another man told me that his mother had been a nurse. She had given him up for adoption in England because otherwise she would not have <Col N="2045"/>been able to get employment as a nurse. She managed to catch up with him again when he was about 40 years of age. He told me that his father was a doctor, gave me his name and asked me if I knew him, which I did. Then he asked me if he looked like his father. I asked the man whether he had ever thought of trying to find his father. He replied: &ldquo;You know, it is so hard the way my mother was treated. Every now and then I think I will go over to Ireland to seek him out, but at other times the pain is so bad that I can&rsquo;t. It is the sort of thing you take up and put down. You think you can go and deal with it, but then you decide you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; We could try to help such groups of people.</P>
    <P>There is all too much in <i>Dancing at Lughnasa</i> which is true to life. The fate of the two youngest sisters was the fate of many Irish women who went over to very poor employment in England and lost contact totally with their families. While emigration was hard for men, it was easier for them to socialise; it was desperately hard for women to do so.</P>
    <P>In sociological surveys of psychiatric illness and alcoholism in England, no one is higher up the league than the Irish. Studies have been done to see if it is due to our Celtic genes, but it is not because the Scots and the Welsh are further down. The Indians and the Pakistanis are further down still. Sometimes one finds that the West Indians have similar psychiatric problems, but not with alcohol. The most vulnerable of these Irish people who had to leave for England paid a dreadful price through illness.</P>
    <P>I remember how we dealt with people who got into trouble before the courts. I was in court in Cork and heard a judge say, &ldquo;It is the <i>Innisfallen</i> tonight, or jail&rdquo;. The youth&rsquo;s mother stood up in the court and replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him the ticket already&rdquo;. We had the most extraordinary methods of dealing with people who were extremely vulnerable from a sociological point of view.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the motion because we do not have much time left. Although we have money now and D&Iacute;ON is doing great work, we must do as much as we can immediately because the people affected are getting older and they will not be there forever. I am pleased with all the Government has been doing but there is an urgent need to accept the motion, rather than the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Two months ago, a similar motion was debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. It was a well attended, informed and, at times, emotional debate, as this one has been. I acknowledge the significant contribution of Deputy Stagg in the Lower House, which was mentioned in this debate and rightly so. It is important that we should hear from those with practical experience as emigrants. Equally, I acknowledge the important contribution made, and the very real experience shared, by Senator Mooney. Those of <Col N="2046"/>us who went to the UK and elsewhere as students to work on building sites in the 1970s would have met the kind of people to whom Senator Ryan referred. In our own lives we have all come into contact with such individuals and, as a result, we are aware of the contribution they made, as well as the difficulties they experienced as emigrants abroad.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>While there was, as one would expect, the usual cut and thrust of parliamentary exchanges, I noted the constructive and positive tone which characterised many of the contributions to the debate in the Lower House. I am, therefore, pleased that the Seanad has also had the opportunity to address this important issue, to make its distinctive contribution to the debate and, thereby, to continue to raise the profile of this significant issue among the public.</P>
    <P>It is important and necessary to have the widest, informed public discussion on an issue that has affected, at one time or another, almost every family in Ireland but yet for too long has been ignored by all of us. I will outline how the subject of our emigrants abroad has been brought to the forefront of political debate and why we are having this debate.</P>
    <P>The background was a report commissioned by the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants and the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas in 1999. That report assessed the current pattern of Irish emigration, reviewed the policy responses and services provided by the Government, the Catholic Church and other voluntary agencies and set out the main policy challenges that would arise over the next ten years. It concluded there was a need for a Government commitment to a partnership approach to the subject of emigration and the development of a coherent and effective policy, funding and service infrastructure and recommended the establishment of a task force. As a result of discussions and consultation with the social partners leading to the agreement of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it was agreed that a task force on policy regarding emigrants should be established.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, established this task force in 2001 and gave it the widest remit. It was asked to examine and review all aspects of emigration, pre-departure services for emigrants and services for emigrants abroad and those who wished to return. The task force was asked to pay attention to the needs of young and disadvantaged emigrants who are at greatest risk of social exclusion and marginalisation when they go abroad and to the needs of returning emigrants, especially the vulnerable and the elderly.</P>
    <P>After wide consultation, both at home and abroad, the task force produced an excellent report in August 2002 setting out the problems and challenges of emigration in today&rsquo;s world. During all the discussion since the publication of the report, I have heard nothing but the highest praise for its incisive analysis of the issues, the <Col N="2047"/>clarity of its recommendations and the humanity that guided its deliberations. The chairman, Mr. Paddy O&rsquo;Hanlon, and all the members of the task force deserve our special thanks for the way they went about this difficult but necessary task.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear when it was published that the implementation of its many wide ranging and far reaching proposals would have to be phased in over a number of years. In this regard, he said he did not believe it would be possible to implement all the recommendations at once, even if the level of resources advocated by the task force could be provided. However, this is far from saying little has been done. Since the publication of the task force&rsquo;s report, considerable progress has been made across a range of areas.</P>
    <P>Britain continues to have the greatest number of Irish emigrants and the greatest proportion of vulnerable emigrants who require special assistance and support. The greatest share of the resources provided by the Government for welfare services for the Irish abroad is, accordingly, allocated to the UK. The total amount allocated by the D&Iacute;ON committee since 1984 is almost &euro;18 million. More than half of this has been allocated since the Government parties took office in 1997. The D&Iacute;ON fund has increased by more than 350% since 1997.</P>
    <P>In 2003, 57 organisations received D&Iacute;ON grants totalling &euro;2.573 million. I accept this was 5% less than the total allocated in 2002 but, later in the year, this was corrected when a further &euro;150,000 was allocated directly to the Federation of Irish Societies in London from savings. This brought the total allocation to emigrant services in Britain to &euro;2.723 million in 2003, representing a slight increase of &euro;15,000 on the 2002 figure.</P>
    <P>This year, the D&Iacute;ON fund will increase by a further 30% to &euro;3.57 million. Funding for a project by the Federation of Irish Societies to provide greater support to its affiliated organisations to improve their capacity to manage their services and secure funding from local sources in the UK is included in this amount. This capacity building support is vital to enable the Irish welfare agencies to make the most effective use of the funds provided by the Government and to assist them in broadening the base of their funding to encompass other available sources. The Federation of Irish Societies has recently appointed a director to manage this project and it will shortly recruit two development workers who will be based in the regions and who will provide hands on management support to the agencies that require it.</P>
    <P>The new director of the federation welcomed the funding in an article in the <i>Irish Post</i> stating:</P>
    <P LI="1">We are delighted that the Irish Government has demonstrated its commitment to the Federation, recognising the central role we play within Britain and providing us with additional funds to continue this role. The new posts <Col N="2048"/>funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs will also enable us to expand and develop the range of services on offer to our affiliate organisations and build upon our capacity to reach groups that may not be linked in with any other Irish organisations such as ourselves throughout Britain.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The total allocation for emigrant services in the Foreign Affairs Vote this year is &euro;4 million. This represents an increase of &euro;1 million, or one third, over 2003. The lion&rsquo;s share of this &mdash; &euro;3.57 million &mdash; will go to the D&Iacute;ON fund for services to Irish emigrants in the UK while &euro;400,000 will be allocated to Irish welfare agencies in the US and &euro;48,000 will go to agencies in Australia. Provision has also been made for grants to Canada, &Eacute;AN, the umbrella body for voluntary agencies in Ireland providing services to emigrants, and the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas. It is hoped to allocate further funds to emigrant services later this year under the Foreign Affairs Vote.</P>
    <P>In addition to the funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Social and Family Affairs provides funding for information to assist Irish citizens considering emigration and to Irish emigrants abroad considering returning home. The total amount allocated by that Department for these services in 2004 is &euro;427,000. Furthermore, approximately 60% of those who qualify under the pension scheme introduced by the Government in 2000 for people with pre-1953 contributions are living abroad, mostly in Britain. Approximately &euro;80 million will be paid in these pensions to Irish people abroad in 2004. Many thousands of elderly Irish people living in Britain will benefit as a result.</P>
    <P>The report contains 71 recommendations. Action is being taken on implementing more than two thirds of them. A number of the recommendations fall within the areas of responsibility of other Departments and they have been asked to examine them to determine what progress has been made in implementing them and what further steps could be taken.</P>
    <P>I will outline a few examples to illustrate progress. The funding for emigrant services abroad has been brought together under the Department of Foreign Affairs. This was done last year following the transfer of the D&Iacute;ON fund from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A significant increase in funding for emigrant services has been provided in the Foreign Affairs Vote this year. The task force recommended that financial assistance be given to &Eacute;AN, the umbrella group for voluntary agencies providing information and advice to potential emigrants, to enable it to provide more effective support to its member agencies. The Minister recently announced that a portion of the additional funds this year will be allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The task force also recommended that the Government should continue its political <Col N="2049"/>engagement with the authorities in the US regarding the position of undocumented Irish people there. During his recent visit to Washington, the Minister met a number of prominent members of Congress with whom he discussed a draft Bill that would regulate the status of undocumented Irish immigrants in the US.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs is implementing the task force recommendation that the Government should give priority to the link between migration and social exclusion during our Presidency of the EU by organising a Presidency conference on reconciling mobility and social inclusion next month.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, is meeting on a fortnightly basis to monitor progress in implementing the recommendations. The task force report recommended that &euro;18 million should be provided for emigrant services in 2003, increasing to &euro;34 million in 2005. These amounts were seen by the task force as the optimum required if its recommendations were to be implemented immediately. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that because of the range and complexity of the measures proposed by the task force, they could not be put into effect overnight and their implementation would have to be phased in over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended the establishment of an agency for the Irish abroad to co-ordinate the provision of services to the Irish abroad. This would consist of a board, representing both the Departments involved and the voluntary sector, with a secretariat provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The agency would be established as a non-statutory body initially but, once established, could become an independent, statutory body. Its cost was estimated at between &euro;1 million and &euro;2 million.</P>
    <P>We are not opposed in principle to the establishment of an agency and do not rule this out. However, we consider that, in the context of the current level of funding, it would be inappropriate to devote a large proportion of it to the establishment of an agency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will not support the agency because it will not provide the funding.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has decided, therefore, at least as a first step, to establish a dedicated unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs, when staff resources become available after the EU Presidency. However, work is ongoing. Its role will be to co-ordinate the provision of services to the Irish abroad and to carry forward the implementation of the task force report. The reality is, therefore, that the Government has done a great deal for emigrants. The level of financial assistance for emigrant services abroad has been substantially increased <Col N="2050"/>and we can be proud of our record in providing assistance to emigrants. Of course, we cannot say we have done enough &mdash; Senator Mooney has rightly made this point. There are constraints on the level of the resources we can provide and there is no point in pretending otherwise.</P>
    <P>Emigration should be viewed in its proper context. We should be proud of the achievements of the majority of our emigrants abroad who have successfully integrated into their adopted countries while maintaining the strongest links with Ireland. On my recent visit to Australia, I had the opportunity to meet with representative groups of Irish emigrants and to listen to their concerns at first hand. I was particularly pleased to be able to meet representatives of the Irish Welfare Bureaux in Sydney and Wollongong, whose valuable community work we support, and Fr. Tom Devereax, whose chaplaincy provides invaluable practical and pastoral care to the many thousands of young Irish people who travel to Australia. What struck me was their work not only for the very large young population but also for the older emigrant community. Harrowing stories of the lonely lives were shared. Many live alone in apartments. The Irish Welfare Bureau is involved in purchasing graves for many who cannot afford to buy a plot in a graveyard. It is important that the Government works with the tremendous organisations abroad which do invaluable work. They have conveyed their concerns to me and I intend to follow up on that. When I addressed various groups, I made the point that departing emigrants not only represented a huge loss to Ireland, but represented a huge gain in building countries such as Australia.</P>
    <P>I accept we have a moral obligation to try to assist those who were forced to emigrate for economic or social reasons in the past and whose remittances home in the 1950s and 1960s contributed greatly to our economy and who now find themselves in difficulties. This sense of moral responsibility imbued much of the task force report and is reflected in the priority areas highlighted in the report, namely:</P>
    <P LI="1">improving the effectiveness of the voluntary agencies involved in providing direct support to emigrants most in need by improving their capacity to secure funds from other sources,</P>
    <P LI="1">promoting more co-operation and communication between voluntary agencies at home and abroad to ensure the best use of available resources and to maximise the impact of their combined efforts [these were the types of issues we discussed with the groups in Sydney] targeting assistance on the provision of front-line services to those who are at greatest risk of marginalisation and social exclusion, as well as the elderly and returning emigrants.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In its approach to implementing the task force report, the Government will focus on these priorities. Fortunately, the number of emigrants has declined very considerably and of those who <Col N="2051"/>emigrate now, only a small proportion requires special support. It should also be recognised that there is a responsibility on the host country to help these people and the burden cannot fall solely on the shoulders of the Irish Government. The Government, of course, is prepared to play its full part in helping the less fortunate emigrants and is working actively to implement the report of the task force. As I have said, many of its recommendations fall within the area of responsibility of other Ministers and so it will require a concerted effort from Government to bring about the desired changes. The Government will also work closely with the Governments of host countries and with voluntary Irish agencies abroad to maximise the impact of the combined efforts for the benefit of the Irish abroad.</P>
    <P>In the 18 months or so since the publication of the task force report, considerable progress has been made. The terms of reference of engagement with Irish emigrants abroad have been changed. The Government intends to continue to deepen this dialogue and constructive engagement in the spirit of the report. It is an ongoing process and I do not think the Government will ever be able to say it has been completed. However, the Government has made, considerable progress in addressing it and it is for these reasons I commend to the House the amended motion tabled by the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the sincere tone of his remarks, but the content of his speech was an exercise in pretence, masking the reality of doing very little. The following line in the Minister&rsquo;s speech sums up best the attempted spin to convince Members that something is being done. It is a reminder more of 1984 rather than 2004.</P>
    <P LI="1">We are not opposed in principle to the establishment of an agency and do not rule this out. However, we consider that, in the context of the present level of funding, it would be inappropriate to devote a large proportion of this amount to the establishment of an agency.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The establishment of an agency might happen sometime, but there is insufficient funding for it. Who determined the current level of funding? The Government determines the level of funding which is inadequate to set up an agency. Therefore, the agency will not be established because the Government has not allocated funding to it. Let us be straight about it. There is no political will on the part of the Government to do anything substantial or real for Irish emigrants abroad, who are in need of assistance. Lip service has been paid to a fine report and to the needs of Irish people living abroad, which have been set out so starkly and clearly in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary of last December. It is an exercise in hypocrisy by the Government for the Minister to come before the House with a long spiel on <Col N="2052"/>what has been done and to talk about an increase in funding. There has been an increase in very little except hypocrisy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The money is very real to the people in England. The Senator perhaps should go over to see them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kitt further stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">The Minister has decided, therefore, at least as a first step, to establish a dedicated unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs, when staff resources become available after the EU Presidency.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That just sums it up. That means that when staff are less busy they will be asked to do something about the Irish abroad, because of the problem with the Opposition giving out yards on how the Irish abroad are not being taken care of. When our turn comes to host the Presidency of the EU again, or some other big issue arises, will the staff be asked to forget about the welfare of the Irish abroad? Is that a dedicated unit?</P>
    <P>It was the Government that set up the task force, which made a very clear recommendation for the establishment and need for an agency. The Minister has made the best argument of all for the establishment of an agency.</P>
    <P>The task force was very clear on the amount of money required. It set out clearly that things cannot be done overnight, a point made by the Minister. It was stated that there needs to be a phased allocation of resources because it recognises that it will take time to expand capacity in the voluntary sector to use these resources effectively to meet the needs of the Irish abroad. It suggests an initial allocation of &euro;11 million in 2003, building to &euro;21 million in 2005 and sets out how those amounts should be distributed: &euro;8 million for services in Britain in 2003 increasing to &euro;12 million in 2005; &euro;2 million for services in the US rising to &euro;6 million in 2005 and &euro;1 million for services in the rest of the world rising to &euro;3 million in 2005, which are not major sums by any means. However, the money would make a substantial difference to the lives and experiences of the Irish abroad and in particular to the community to which the Minister refers, but the targets have not been reached.</P>
    <P>In the words of Eavan Boland, which were recently quoted by Fr. Alan Hilliard, director of the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;Like oil lamps we put them out the back of our houses, of our minds&rdquo;. Clearly, older Irish people abroad were at the back of our minds. Thanks to &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; they have been brought to the front of our minds, where they remain, although we must ask for how long that will be the case. Obviously, it will be for as short a time as possible for the Government. Fr. Hilliard also quoted Catherine Dunne, author of a book called &ldquo;The Unconsidered People&rdquo;. She pointed out that in 1961, the entire education budget for primary and <Col N="2053"/>post-primary schools was the equivalent of £14 million. The same year, the contribution of emigrants in remittances was estimated at £13.5 million. That illustrates the extent of the country&rsquo;s reliance on emigrants and the significance of their contribution which has been estimated in billions of euro.</P>
    <P>My Labour Party colleague, Deputy Stagg, spoke in terms which will go down in history of the experience of poverty in the west of Ireland and the experiences of so many people who left in the 1950s. There is hardly an Irish family which has not been touched by emigration. An aunt of mine who is now in her 80s went to work in the hospitals of London during the blitz and was on duty on D-day when the bodies were being returned from the beaches of Normandy. She recalls her experiences in a TB hospital in Ireland when she had the task of cycling around on night duty to count the bodies of those who had died. That is the country she left.</P>
    <P>I recall visiting a friend of mine in London who is a museum curator. He devised a project to recreate the 1950s experiences of the Irish in Wembley, the particular part of London in which he worked. He reconstructed a room in a digs which was so miserable that I still recall it after ten years. The room featured a mean, small cot with thin blankets, the inevitable cardboard suitcase under the bed, bits of old linoleum covering the floor, a single burner in the fireplace to boil water for tea, one good suit hanging on the back of the door and the inevitable letters to and from home. This was the experience of many thousands of Irish people who went to London and other parts of Britain as well as to other countries. It is an experience which, like oil lamps, we put out the back of our houses and into the back of our minds.</P>
    <P>The hypocrisy of the Government and its attitude to this issue are disgraceful and deplorable. I ask the Government to reconsider this matter. It is not too late to establish this agency and it is never too late to recognise that not enough is being done. I disagree with Senator Mooney. It is possible to reach a point at which we can say we are doing enough, but we must aspire to more than we are currently doing. We must aspire to at least recognising and thanking people for what they have done.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I thank the Labour Party for moving this thoughtful motion. It allows all of us pause for reflection to think of other times and of what can now be done. Senator Mooney proposed the amendment in my name, but it was moved on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il. It described how the Minister for Foreign Affairs has begun to introduce over two thirds of the 71 recommendations of the task force he established. I read the report of the task force which was published about a year ago and was struck by the clarity of its language and the <Col N="2054"/>manner in which the recommendations were set out.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s family reminiscences. A motion such as the one before us causes one to think like that. My brother Paddy emigrated, having been in college here. While it is a different story of emigration, it is quite a telling one. While studying agricultural science in Dublin, the wanderlust got at him and he went to work in the mines in Worksop, a town in the north of England. He stayed there for about ten years although he used to come home every holiday. He would not return to work here although there were plenty of opportunities of which he could have taken advantage. Of course, my parents were heartbroken. He was the second eldest and I was the youngest and I remember thinking of him down in the mines. He worked very hard, which had an effect on his health later although he is alive, well and thriving as a farmer. On one particular holiday, he met a nice woman from Connemara and, after ten years, he returned to marry her and have a family.</P>
    <P>My mother used to be in floods of tears at the tales he told us about the pure hardship experienced by people in the mines when he came home but, of course, he did not tell her the half of it. I know the term &ldquo;pure hardship&rdquo; sounds funny, but it is the phrase we use down the country. The mines are somewhat sanctified now and there was a series recently on BBC television about them, Arthur Scargill and Mrs. Thatcher. That involved only the glory days but the work was grinding, unhealthy and sapped one&rsquo;s youth and energy. Certainly, it would rid one of any illusions. I quote the example of the mines as it is one with which I am very familiar from the days and tales described by my brother. He was lucky in that he met the woman he wanted to marry when he came home one summer.</P>
    <P>The hardship experienced by people who emigrated in the 1950s and 1960s was significant. My brother is in a different category as he was educated to the extent that he had obtained a leaving certificate and attended first year in college. However, he did not want to travel the straight path which is what took him abroad. While we should pay tribute to people, we should also make practical contributions. Less fortunate emigrants left on the boat train with their cardboard suitcases and, on arrival in England, travelled for six hours to London. If they were lucky, they had the name of a rooming house written down at which they could obtain lodgings. Some were lucky and were able to pull themselves up and move on, but many others were not because they did not have an education.</P>
    <P>As always in the United Kingdom, the cut and thrust of society was sharper and more difficult to deal with. However, there were no jobs in Ireland and people who stayed faced stagnation. Unfortunately, many who left faced stagnation also. Many who worked in the years they had the physical ability to do so found in later years that the toil they undertook and the deprivation <Col N="2055"/>through which they lived had effects bodily, spiritually and mentally upon them. They are mainly men and many of them are in a sorry state. While there are some women among them, women tended, whether it was the right thing to do, to marry and establish alternative lives. I had a long conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this very topic and I am aware that he is very involved in the issue. He is very aware of the experiences of these people who left from every townland and village in Ireland. The people who go now do so of their own free choice. There is a considerable body of people still there.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs recently discussed the idea, proposed by Deputy Gay Mitchell, of travelling to London, Liverpool and Manchester. We propose to advertise the visit in the press and meet those working with the Irish community to determine what they want. We expect to hear more about this matter shortly. The diligent and hard-working unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs can make a change. While I do not mean to castigate the motion, I do not know if we should get wrapped up in the idea of having an agency. The matter requires hands-on treatment and a keen ear.</P>
    <P>I approve of what the Minister is doing. I know from talking to him that he is fully acquainted with this issue. After all, people left Offaly just as they left Westmeath and Roscommon. The Minister is keen to do the best he can for these emigrants. Approximately two-thirds of the 71 recommendations are now under way. I would be happier if the unit was already established. While it is about to be set up, this is another matter altogether. Will the Minister of State ask the Department to give us a progress report on what the unit is doing and what contact it has already made with emigrant organisations in Britain? While such emigrants reside elsewhere, such as in the US, most of them are resident in Britain. Many of them only had enough money to get as far as Britain. I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Labour Party on tabling this motion. I followed closely the discussion on this matter in the D&aacute;il when it was discussed two months ago. If anything, the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme of 22 December last helped to focus many minds on this issue. I watched the programme with a great deal of nostalgia. I could empathise with much of what the programme portrayed. I grew up in west Limerick and, like many other people, I emigrated in the early 1960s owing to the lack of employment in the area. Available employment was often casual in nature.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the <i>Innisfallen</i>. I travelled to England on that ship and through a combination of bus and rail travel, I travelled for almost 24 hours before reaching my destination in Torquay, Devonshire. I got seasick on many trips during the winter. I do not tell this as a hard <Col N="2056"/>luck story. I was probably fortunate to gain employment in England and take a course before coming back to Ireland. I enriched my experience by living in England for a time.</P>
    <P>The 1950s and 1960s were cruel times. I grew up in Foynes and a sanatorium was established there for those suffering with tuberculosis, which was rampant at the time. I knew many people who suffered from the disease and were committed to the sanatoria in Foynes or Glanmire. Those were harsh times for employment too. Similar problems were experienced in employment in the 1980s. We are fortunate to have seen a change in the other direction in recent years. However, this does not stop us feeling sympathy for many of the people who emigrated to England in the 1950s and 1960s. Owing to the lump system that operated in England, many of these emigrants now find themselves in harsh economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>It would have saddened anyone to watch the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme that dealt with the issue. I was driving when I heard Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s contribution to the D&aacute;il debate on this issue relayed on the &ldquo;Vincent Browne Show&rdquo;. I felt a lump form in my throat as I listened to it. I asked myself what we could do for these people.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment welcomes the additional funding provided in this year&rsquo;s foreign affairs Vote. The funding increased last September from &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told the D&aacute;il that this doubled the amount of &euro;2 million spent by the coalition in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Why do Ministers always hark back to 1997? While the amount may have been doubled, it has only been doubled over a period of six years. We have enjoyed an economic boom in the interim. I remind Government Members that the boom catapulted them back into government in the last election.</P>
    <P>This House recently discussed the disbursement of the dormant accounts fund. The money was to be allocated to disadvantaged sectors in different areas. Today we were notified of a tranche of funds that has been allocated from this scheme. This is largesse that the Government would not have anticipated receiving in 1997, or even in 2001. The fund was set up arising from work undertaken by the Committee of Public Accounts and the late Jim Mitchell. It is worth bearing in mind that the fund contains &euro;175 million that was not known about four or five years ago. This will increase to about &euro;400 million from next April when the insurance funds come into it.</P>
    <P>Finance is highly important. Mary Creagh, leader of the Labour Party in Islington, recently said that funding for the local Irish centre had been cut and the Irish Government did nothing for it other than offer warm words. The centre exists to look after Irish people. While Islington may be prosperous, just as Camden Town and Kentish Town evoke certain memories, there are areas all over Britain where Irish people live in <Col N="2057"/>poverty. Many of the hostels they live in are sustained by charitable or religious organisations.</P>
    <P>The Government should not boast that it has increased funding by one third from &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million. Money exists in the dormant accounts fund and something positive can be done with it. The task force, under the chairmanship of Paddy O&rsquo;Hanlon, must be complimented for what it proposed. The Government should identify projects and release a decent chunk of funding.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental point behind this. The people living in England do not have votes here. Not alone are we neglecting emigrants, we are also cutting funds for widows and widowers. This is having a serious effect on this sector of the community and those affected feel the State is letting them down. Once a Government receives a significant majority, I often wonder if it forgets about the small things that count. If the Minister wants funding, that disbursement account is there, but the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has hijacked the funding along with the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, since in future, the Government wants to distribute the largesse rather than having it administered by the body which was established on a statutory basis. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, should approach those involved. I am sure they will gladly accede to the requests for funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs for worthwhile projects such as this. The Department should identify the projects and locations and quantify the costs involved. No doubt the funding will be provided.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget the emigrants. I will not repeat what I said in the past. In every community and parish in Ireland, whether in west Limerick, Connacht or wherever, the money that came back to Ireland in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was vital support for families. It provided an economic stimulus for many people otherwise deprived in their own communities. Most of those who went abroad did not forget to send money home.</P>
    <P>I fully support the motion. There are no votes in it for the Labour Party or for any of us, but we owe it to these people not to leave them deprived and abandoned, particularly in England. We must do something about the situation now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House. I am pleased to speak on this important issue. I welcome the debate because it is important to put some facts on the record. Senator Mooney in his contribution sought to dispel some of the myths perpetrated by people within and outside this House. Hopefully the debate will continue in that vein.</P>
    <P>The initiative on this issue was taken by the current Government in consultation with the social partners and others. It was an issue simmering for some time. Others have referred to it in terms of the age profiles, and recognising the times during which people emigrated, and <Col N="2058"/>how they reached the point where they are no longer working in the standard environment, and need help.</P>
    <P>The task force was initiated in 2001 and reported in 2002. The strength of the Government policy lay in setting out for the first time a coherent framework for dealing with this difficult issue. Much talk has focused on what has not been achieved rather than what has. People have referred to percentages and so on. Some 50 of the 70 recommendations have already been implemented. It would be wrong, however, to take a tit-for-tat approach in this debate. It is a more fundamental issue about understanding the way forward. As a number of Senators said, there are no votes in this. The Seanad is a good place in which to debate the issue, because we are not always as conscious of the wider electorate as Members of the other House. It is important that we add our voices and our wisdom, whatever we might have.</P>
    <P>Fortunately or unfortunately, I have no direct knowledge or experience of emigration. I was fortunate in that at the time I was born and when I was being educated, there was no longer a need for emigration. I have, however, heard of the experiences of many in my extended family. The difficulties that emigrants faced were well aired by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke and by others, as were the kind of issues with which they daily contended. Scars were left on their lives and on the lives of those family members left at home, who were all the time concerned for the welfare of their siblings overseas.</P>
    <P>The issue should not be about bureaucracy, about an agency versus a Departmental unit. It is more fundamental. I favour an approach by a Department over one by a separate agency. We have an ongoing difficulty with political accountability. The Government sets up an agency and powers are devolved to it. The Government or the Minister responsible then continues to get the grief, publicly and privately, for not becoming involved in the day to day running of the agency. While a unit remains within a Department, the Minister at least has a direct hand in the control, organisation and management of it. More than anything, that is what we need in this case &mdash; a political hand in the operation on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the issue is about money. Unfortunately, not enough money has been committed this year. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, have clearly stated that and said they would like to see more money committed. They have, however, started an important plan, as well as a journey towards getting sufficient funding. This situation has not developed overnight. The crisis has been going on for some time. We have taken an important step by putting a coherent policy in place through the framework documentation. The Government has made a commitment to increase funding and honoured it with a year by year increase. I encourage the Minister of State <Col N="2059"/>regarding the financing, though he probably does not need encouragement. He is well aware of the financing difficulties. I hope the commitment continues regardless of who holds the ministry. While Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats are in Government, that increase will be provided, as it should.</P>
    <P>The Government policy on emigration has been inclusive. We all know the historic facts &mdash; the forced emigration, the lack of education for those leaving and the difficulty they had. We talked earlier today in this House about racism. Let us not forget that those who had to emigrate to our near neighbour suffered intense racism. There were signs on the doors of certain boarding houses saying that no blacks or Paddies need apply for entrance. That was the kind of difficulty encountered. It is important that this legacy should not bear down on us in the future, and that the Government continues, as it is doing, to put in place a proper structure to alleviate the difficulties suffered.</P>
    <P>The current situation in this country is very different. We all know that most people leaving Ireland today do so with a sound, structured education behind them, with good prospects. They can travel outside Ireland to gain valuable experience which they bring back to great effect. Many of them have returned with entrepreneurial skills and have sought to create employment in Ireland, the lack of which was the root cause of many of the difficulties historically.</P>
    <P>The task force approach will ensure that the past experience of emigration will not be repeated, regardless of our economic situation. Hopefully we will never return to the days of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the days of mass or forced emigration. Should emigration take place, the policies of the task force will ensure, particularly through the pre-departure service, a support structure for emigrants in the new country of residence. The report also deals with services for returning emigrants, particularly the elderly. That is one of the strengths of the work done, reflecting the funding put in place to target those who need to return.</P>
    <P>The crux of the problem regarding the difficulties of those forced to emigrate, and the difficulties they now suffer, particularly in England, is the individuality of each case. We cannot generalise either in terms of defining the problem or the solution. There is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution. Many of these people have fallen outside the social structure for a host of reasons. We must recognise that there is no overall solution which will resolve all problems overnight.</P>
    <P>We have the same problems in our own society. I guarantee that anyone who leaves Leinster House tonight will, before reaching Grafton Street, come across two or three homeless people sleeping in doorways. We have a plethora of agencies. Nobody is suggesting that we have a shortage of funds to deal with the problem.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="2060"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should ask the agencies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we are not dealing with the problem. We have similar problems in this country and we have not found the quick-fix solution. There are many agencies charged with dealing with the situation, and they have not succeeded in doing so. An agency is not the solution to the problem, rather a change in mindset is required. I also recognise there is a question of funding. The Department, through its unit, with the capacity to respond and react to the difficulties and issues on an ongoing basis is better charged than an agency. I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt when he asks why &euro;2 million should be spent on an agency when the matter can be better handled within the Department of Foreign Affairs. If that money can be used to alleviate the difficulties for emigrants, then it should be used to do so. We only have to compare their difficulties with those on our streets. I do not know what the solution is to resolve these individual cases.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the work they are doing. I hope a resolution can be found to this difficult issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House and thank the Labour Party for putting down this crucially important motion.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley said that it must not be forgotten where this problem began. However, we must have absolute clarity in our recollections. These emigrants were people from every street, town and county on this island who went across to England under various circumstances. Some did not have jobs in Ireland due to lack of education and had no choice but to leave. However, I recall when living near a courthouse that a month did not go by when a judge gave a defendant the choice of either going to jail or to England. When I hear the pious chantings of some politicians today on immigrants entering this country and fiddling us for a few shillings, it must be remembered that we wrote the script. We knew how it was done from the beginning. We sent the people we did not want across to England. They went over with no education, no prospects and criminal records with nowhere for them to go.</P>
    <P>When they got there, they were met with open arms by those very successful Irish emigrants, many of whom are now giving evidence to tribunals. They were given the most difficult work &mdash; carrying hods with six or seven blocks up three section ladders that broke their health in no time. To make life easier for them, they were always paid in the pub on a Thursday evening. This was to ensure they could spend their money in the very pub that was probably owned by the same builder. To make life even easier, they were told not to worry about social welfare and tax. It would all be taken care nicely on the lump as the <Col N="2061"/>builder paid them in cash, with no tax to be declared so they could take home more. Of course, the emigrants grabbed at it. When I was in England as a student, we all considered those from the West Indies as the poor and uninformed who did the miserable jobs such as driving the Tube and clicking tickets on buses, getting paid half what we were.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish did those jobs too.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Now 30 years later, those who worked on the Tube and buses and for local councils are surviving on their pensions. The Irish emigrants, such as those on the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, are the ones with no pensions, supports, prospects, homes or families. They were never given the opportunity in England. Instead, they were mistreated, abused and exploited right the way through. Senator Mooney, who has done Trojan work in caring for elderly emigrants, will confirm this. The successful people, as he said, were those who took the jobs in Dagenham or on the Tube who were able to buy their houses, get married and send their children, who are now in high-flying positions, to college.</P>
    <P>We have inherited a problem that was created by our predecessors. I do not wish to point the finger at any particular Government or political party. I am not claiming that those on the other side of the House care less about emigrants than those on this side. I readily concede that it is a shared concern. However, the proposals for an agency should be implemented. The Minister of State gave credit to Mr. Paddy O&rsquo;Hanlon for chairing the working group, but every member thereof was diligent.</P>
    <P>Can the Department of Foreign Affairs do some practical things for emigrants? The Cathaoirleach correctly ruled out of order a matter I wanted to raise on the Adjournment, namely that Ireland establish a short-wave radio service. I listen to short-wave radio, such as Voice of America or the BBC World Service, when I am abroad. Small countries such as Estonia, Latvia, Zambia and New Zealand all have a short-wave radio service which can be picked up around the globe and is inexpensive to provide. On St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, I was delighted to note that our long-wave service was decently used. However, the service did not extend as far as Brussels. Can this service&rsquo;s output be boosted to cover Paris and Brussels? By doing so, it could cover the whole of the UK and reach the Irish diaspora in central Europe. It is the next best thing to FM and is clearer than medium-wave.</P>
    <P>People will not tune into radio on the Internet even though RTE can be received on the Internet anywhere in the world. People are more inclined to tune into radio on satellite or digital transmission platforms. Can the Minister of State inform us how much would it cost to take space and satellite broadcast footprints around North America, Australia, Asia, New Zealand and parts of Africa? Senator Dooley claimed there were no <Col N="2062"/>votes in this issue. Actually, Senator Ryan and I have voters scattered all over the world who take great interest in what happens in this country. I have raised time and again the need for some form of articulation for this group in the democratic process, even so far as giving them the vote. There should be a separate constituency where they can have some voice &mdash; albeit under strict conditions &mdash; in our democracy.</P>
    <P>Recently an individual, abroad for 40 years, told me that the Department of Foreign Affairs used to compile a news digest of the news in Ireland on a monthly basis for circulation. This is no longer in circulation, yet it would be easy to have such a digest on the departmental website with a limited print run. This would allow people abroad to keep in touch with Irish affairs. Digital radio, being the next transmission medium which can be easily accessed by satellite, is also very cheap. People in Europe can listen to RTE radio services through Sky satellite. These are superb services. However, there is poor access to RTE services in the US when a broadcast footprint could easily be established. I ask that such services for emigrants be investigated as they would be much appreciated.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>John Hume always used to speak about the number of people in North America who describe themselves as Irish. I have forgotten the exact figures, but they are not important. He said that investment in Ireland to the value of $10 for every Irish immigrant in North America could do a great deal for this country. When one works it out, it is an astronomical figure. I do not suggest that we create Irish millionaires from the pockets of generations of emigrants to North America, but the figures in question allow people to have a clearer understanding of what we are about.</P>
    <P>President Bush is due to visit this country in the next six months. I do not want to discuss all aspects of his visit, but there is one point I would like to make. Certain people, including me, will demonstrate against the policies of the current officeholder of the presidency of the United States. I know that such protests will be misunderstood throughout North America, just as they were in 1984. It would be nice if people could understand that we do not seek to give a calculated insult to the American people and the Irish diaspora in the United States, but that we wish to protest against the policies of one person, who is an officeholder. It is not an insult to his office.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs understands such nuanced matters, which we fail to convey in these situations, more than any other Department. The development of such a nuanced perspective would help to counterbalance certain difficulties. The Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions that foreign direct investment in this country may be at risk, for example, because people do not understand our attitude in respect of certain matters.</P><Col N="2063"/>
    <P>In supporting the motion and the proposed agency for the Irish abroad, I am asking the Minister of State to take a further step. I ask him to examine the creation of greater contact at which RTE is superb. It is a pity that we do not have a short-wave service, as people would listen to it and it would be very much appreciated. It would not cost big money in terms of what we are doing at present. I would like us to expand our long-wave service, to introduce a short-wave service and to book satellite time for radio distribution in the main population centres of the world.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share time with Senator Brennan. Having listened to the debate, it is evident that this is a greatly emotional subject. Many Senators who have spoken have had personal experience, directly and indirectly, of emigrants. I did not have to emigrate because four members of my family had already done so. They sent money back to my family to help us during those times. Such experience is typical throughout the country. It is particularly important, therefore, that we realise we have an obligation in this regard. When I spoke on this subject at a function in Manchester two weeks ago, I said there will be a scar on our national conscience if we do not act urgently and proactively on this matter. I continued by stating there is a specific moral obligation on the Government to respond properly in this case. I do not suggest that the obligation is a charitable one, as we need to repay the generosity we received from the people in question in the past.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have painted an accurate picture of Ireland in the middle of the 20th century. Ireland was a deprived country in every sense of the word. We had none of the affluence we have at the moment. When opportunities came our way, we did not have the seed capital necessary to respond to them. When money was sent back to Ireland by emigrants, it was often used to establish small businesses and to sustain small shops, etc. That was the infrastructure of the time. Let us be fair and honest by saying that we would not enjoy the fruits of the Celtic tiger at present if it were not for those who went abroad.</P>
    <P>Those who emigrated in the years gone by left this country because they had to go and because they wanted to go. They wanted to do something positive with their lives, so they took the opportunities that came their way in Britain, in particular, and in North America, to a certain extent. This often meant that they held down more than one job. There was never an opportunity to develop career prospects in the construction industry, for example, because workers had to follow the job. Wherever the job went, they had to go. Not only were they losing out on any opportunities they might have had at home, but they were also losing out on the chance to accumulate as much finance as possible to send home to Ireland.</P><Col N="2064"/>
    <P>I have been travelling to Britain for the past 35 years. I have been in every Irish centre and in every welfare centre on at least a dozen occasions in that time. I have had the privilege of meeting some of the finest open-hearted and generous people one could ever hope to meet. It is obvious they did not foresee the difficulties they would encounter in the future, but they were to find in their twilight years that they had no security as a consequence of unorthodox methods of payment, particularly in the construction sector. They often failed to interact with the agencies and organisations that could help them, perhaps because of their personal sense of pride. Voluntary organisations, such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and many others were often at the coalface at that time. Many of the organisations that comprise the Federation of Irish Societies looked out for their own people and tried to help. They remain an important conduit for such people, even more so than the official agencies.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a group of people who have often been denigrated and whose history has been revised mercilessly. I refer to priests and nuns in Britain who did outstanding work to help those about whom we speak. Our difficulty nowadays is that we do not have as many priests or nuns to offer assistance.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude and allow Senator Brennan to contribute, I would like to say that I support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s suggestion that the funds from dormant accounts be used in this area. It would be worthwhile to contact the Government as a matter of urgency to state that we need money now. The people we are discussing will not be alive in another eight or ten years. The most important part of the work that needs to be done is to provide help on the ground. We need to connect with people in certain areas who are in contact with those who require help. I have said that we should be generous because we are not providing charity, but repaying the generosity that was given to us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with the words of Senators from both sides of the House. Goodwill and a Christian approach have been evident from all speakers. Although there may be a division on the motion and the amendment before the House, everyone who has spoken has recognised the role played by Irish emigrants in the development of this country in the 1960s. A great deal has been said about construction work in the UK. The money that was sent home by people working in that industry helped to keep food on Irish tables at a time when employment here was confined to 40 hours per week and it was hard for people to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, I wish to pay tribute to the voluntary organisations. Those involved in voluntary housing organisations, such as the Safe Home programme in Mulranny, County Mayo, are doing tremendous work to help our emigrants <Col N="2065"/>on a national basis. A great deal of work has been done in respect of housing. Local authorities can take people off the Safe Home programme&rsquo;s list, but much more could be done in this field. I urge the Minister to examine what can be done through the local authorities to help our emigrants.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a single approach has not been put in place to solve the problems of our emigrants. I pay tribute to the emigration task force, which has compiled a first-class report, and to all those who made submissions. I ask the Minister, in his wisdom, to consider all these approaches and suggestions. In the meantime, all Departments should work to make the lives of our emigrants a little easier and fulfil our responsibilities in that regard. I pay tribute to the Minister for what he has done to date, but much more remains to be done.</P>

	<P>I welcome this debate because it reminds us that many of us have experience of emigration. It was only when I was thinking about this debate that I remembered that I am the daughter of Irish emigrants. My parents emigrated from Mayo after getting married in the 1960s and I spent the first five years of my life in England. They returned in the 1970s. Then, 20 years later, my sister and my friends emigrated because they could not find jobs here. We must keep reminding ourselves of this phenomenon because it is such a major part of Irish society.</P>
    <P>It is important that we cherish Irish people who have emigrated, whether they stay abroad or return. My parents were moderately well off. They were not poor in England. However, they experienced difficulties on returning to the wealthy Ireland of the 1970s. My father said there was a prevalent attitude that they should not be coming back because they were fine where they were. That attitude has persisted in Irish society. It was detectable in the comments of the late Brian Lenihan when he said: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all live on a small island.&rdquo; When I raised the issue of emigrant housing at a county council meeting recently people had the same attitude. One official more or less said that we did not want to bring people back to be added to the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It is difficult even for people who have houses in the United Kingdom or the United States to return here because they must give up their houses, return to Ireland and go on a housing list for years as they cannot afford to buy a house here. I welcome the work done by Deputy Cowley in this regard and I have been doing my utmost to persuade my county council to implement an initiative like his, in the face of fierce resistance. My replacement on the council, who happens to be my father, is raising the same issue. We are the only two councillors in South Dublin County Council who have raised this issue. This is because of my parents&rsquo; experience. They came from Mayo, and through visits to Ballina I became aware of the work being done by Deputy Cowley.</P><Col N="2066"/>
    <P>We need an overall agency. That is one of the recommendations in the report. It is due to the lack of an overall co-ordinated approach by county councils that we need an agency such as this. We cannot build houses for emigrants without money. Without resources, we cannot provide support for emigrants abroad or cherish the work they do in other countries. If the report is left on the shelf by the Government it will prove that the words of its members are empty rhetoric. They are exhibiting exactly the same attitude as that experienced by my mother and father when they wanted to return here in the 1970s.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate was characterised by a profound depth of feeling. There is agreement about the scale of the disaster we allowed to fall upon our society. I do not blame anyone in particular for this, but we failed as a society. The amount of emigration that took place was neither necessary nor inevitable.</P>
    <P>Political debate, however, is not the place for a group catharsis of deeply held emotions. It is about making things happen. People have said they would like to see more money. I will make things clear: the Opposition can say we would like to see more money, but Government can provide more money. When more money is not provided it is not because somebody else decided not to allocate it. It is because the Government made a decision not to. A decision was taken that money could be better spent on other things or that more money would not be raised because of issues of taxation. These are not aspirational matters or accidental consequences; they are deliberate policies. It is the difference between government and opposition.</P>
    <P>I say this as the grandson of an American citizen. My late grandfather on my mother&rsquo;s side was an American citizen. I suspect that if I ever tell the American Embassy I am probably entitled to American citizenship, a minor reverberation will occur in the relationship between this State and the USA. I would not be its preferred extra citizen.</P>
    <P>We are all touched by emigration. We all feel strongly about it. However, it is time we moved beyond feeling and charity. In the Catholic bishops&rsquo; document on justice, issued many years ago and forgotten by most people, the very valid point is made that charity is what one does after justice has been instituted. It is not a substitute for justice, nor is it a precursor to justice. The 200,000 people living on our nearest island who were let down and abandoned by this country and in many cases, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole correctly pointed out, exploited by their fellow Irish citizens when they went to work in Britain, require justice, not charity or a feeling of guilt. Justice demands that we look after them. To talk about the responsibility of other countries is a cop-out.</P>
    <P>I must repeat the point made by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Meara. In the Minister of State&rsquo;s <Col N="2067"/>speech, apart from the gobbledegook of putting together figures from 1984 to 1996 to make a small sum look larger and the amalgamation of figures over a number of years, there was the implication not only that the Government had decided to allocate very little money, but that somebody else had then stopped that money, so that the agency could not be set up. The agency is not being set up because the Government will not allocate the money to make it work.</P>
    <P>The agency is the nub of the issue. It is not about a group of well intentioned civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs whose capacity and ability I and every other Member of this House know. The real problem of an agency is encapsulated in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech. <Col N="2068"/>This problem requires and demands a multi-agency response across Departments. Civil servants within the Department of Foreign Affairs would not be able to point the finger publicly at other Departments. An agency under the aegis of the Department but separate from it would have both the moral authority and the legal status to do precisely that. When that agency is set up there will be no problem with finding sufficient causes on which to spend the money. The real issue is that the Government decided not to spend the money recommended by the task force and is continuing to refrain from spending it. The issue is not whether we feel good or bad, but a decision made by Government that these people do not count.</P>
