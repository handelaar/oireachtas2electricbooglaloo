	<P>I have received notice from Senator Paddy Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate the current position regarding the orthopaedic unit in Mayo General Hospital, when it is expected the staff will take up appointment there and if the Hanly II report was the reason for the postponement of the opening of the unit.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2 p.m. Business will also be introduced on supplementary Order Papers during the sitting. These will deal with an expediency motion and the actual motion regarding the establishment of the select committee in accordance with Standing Order 60A and a report from the Committee of Selection appointing members of the select committee.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues. Many of us watched the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on people with intellectual disabilities and people with autism. As a politician for 15 years, I was ashamed at the deficiencies in that area and the painful experiences of many families whose members have autism and the lack of resources within the system. It is difficult to understand why funding is not provided for that area given that each year prior to the budget the financial projections are considered. The Department of Finance has an <Col N="1554"/>uncanny way of underestimating the projections. The Minister can envisage &euro;1 billion extra at the end of the year over the projected amount he had to spend which he did not have at the beginning of the year. I ask that this area be examined because of the increasing uncertainty in the disability sector. Even before the collapse of the last Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not collapse.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or when it went out of office, a disabilities Bill was withdrawn. At the recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, indicated that a Bill would be introduced within two weeks. We have seen no sign of that legislation. At what stage is the legislation and what is the Government&rsquo;s intention in regard to this area?</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to raise concerns something that happens every year and we are seeing the start of it now as is clear from today&rsquo;s newspapers. A convoy of mobile homes moved into Wexford and an hotel had to close, resulting in the loss of jobs, when 400 people moved to a site owned by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In Rathkeale in my constituency 50% of those on the electoral register belong to the Traveller population. In many cases the equality legislation has found in favour of the Traveller community in regard to discrimination. The rights appear to be stacked in that direction. However, I say to the Traveller community that the settled population has equal rights.</P>
    <P>We are now at the start of the summer season. Is it to be punctuated continually with reports of convoys moving into areas where, in many cases, much debris is left behind? The Garda has scant enough resources. The Garda authorities said today it would take approximately 200 garda&iacute; and 30 tow trucks to move the convoy out of Wexford. Under the legislation, the Garda has the power to move them on. However, there are certain deficiencies that allow a convoy of Travellers to build up and invade an area, whether in Wexford or elsewhere. The same problem has arisen at Knock where they moved into the park. I ask that the issue be addressed while reflecting the rights of the settled community.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader provide further information on the report of the committee that will examine the impeachment of Judge Curtin? Will there be an opportunity for Members to discuss those issues again because it is very important that we monitor the issue fairly closely because in the situation somebody has been found innocent by the court? Many are saying it is on a technicality, so apparently there is a two-tier innocence.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1555"/>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Senator that the motion was moved yesterday in the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>All the apparatus of both Houses of the Oireachtas are then directed against one.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, what precisely is happening and will Members have an opportunity to contribute on the information that will be placed before the House at that point?</P>
    <P>A great deal of Government money has been invested in Luas, which is unfortunate as it would have been much better to spend it on a metro. Luas, in operation, will create considerable danger for both the pedestrian and the cycling public. I came down on a bicycle today and there is no provision whatever for cyclists on O&rsquo;Connell Street. The Dublin tour buses are wandering round and squeezing out the cyclists and the trams will be crossing. Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to look at the provision of cycle lanes?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Finucane stated, tax revenues have exceeded Government expectations for the year and it certainly looks as if the Minister for Finance will have more money to spend this year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A bonanza.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Good Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much to be said for the manner in which the Government engineered it so that there were cutbacks directly after the election in order to create the notion of bonanza at the appropriate time. From what I am hearing on the doorstep the public is not fooled. If the Government was responsible, it would consider how to spend the money equitably and fairly. Senator Finucane has referred to the area of disability. The Government might consider some of its promises, which were not delivered on, such as the extension of the medical card. We know that society is unfair when somebody who is suffering from cancer cannot get a medical card, as was the case of the person I met this week. Will the Government, although my request may fall on deaf ears, use the additional revenue to restore some level of equity to people who are seriously ill and need support?</P>
    <P>Will the Leader consider allowing a debate on the issue of students working? An ESRI report shows that the number of students working part-time has doubled and worryingly this is having an impact on their performance in State examinations. This should be looked at in the context of labour law as it applies to young people, not to prevent them working but to ensure that working is not to the detriment of their performance in examinations and investment in their future.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1556"/>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader consider a debate on the spiralling cost of fuel, petrol and diesel? As a result of the difficulties in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, the cost of petrol has risen to &euro;1.05 per litre and diesel to more than 90 cent. Each rise in fuel costs, affects the cost of goods being supplied. The road haulage firms appeared before the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on Wednesday, 2 June 2004 and are deeply concerned about the impact of these increases on the economy. I appeal to the Minister for Finance to take on board the suggestion that the Department of Finance should consider stabilising the revenue generated from fuel and not take the windfall increase resulting from the increased cost of the raw material.</P>
    <P>Illegal organisations in the Border counties engaged in washing diesel and supplying it to cowboy operators are taking up to &euro;20 million a year from the Exchequer in tax foregone. This is daylight robbery and the Revenue Commissioners are not taking enough action to curb this trade. This is a simple and straightforward issue. Instead of dipping the fuel tanks of small farmers at marts in Roscommon and elsewhere, the Revenue Commissioners would be better off investigating the operations in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>May I draw the attention of Members to this historic day in the Seanad, as it is the last day of the dual mandate and I wish to mark its passing?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform commenting in a magazine article last week stated that inequality is an incentive in the Irish economy. I think this is most inappropriate for an elected Member, but for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to say that is quite out of order. Will the Leader ask the said Minister to come and outline for us exactly what was behind his comment that inequality is good for our society and our economy? Is that the reason we are not extending equality to people with disabilities, as Senator Finucane mentioned this morning? Those comments were out of order. I want the Minister to explain to Members how he will bring about equality in Irish society if that is his thinking on these issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s request for a review of autism services. I am not about to make a bid for as yet unrealised public finances, but I think the Minister could pay particular attention to the state of affairs at Middleton, County Armagh, which was set up as a showpiece centre of excellence for autism. However, it appears from reports I am receiving that it is not sufficiently supported either from North or South. This may be as a result of the lack of activity in North-South relations. It is important that this centre, which could be of <Col N="1557"/>enormous importance in the treatment of autism North and South should be supported.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Leydon&rsquo;s plea for more attention to be given to those who launder diesel in the Border areas. This is a huge loss to Revenue. People should be aware of the extent to which this type of fuel really ruins their cars. It is not a bargain at the end of the day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish EU Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, has made splendid efforts to improve food safety in the European Union. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come before the Seanad to outline how we are implementing his suggestions and the progress we have made in the area of food safety?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Terry if she is calling for a debate on the economic structures of the State. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was referring to what was good for the economy when he made those remarks. The old Communist theory of economic equality is a failed one as shown by the abject poverty in many of the former Eastern Bloc countries, and I did not think it was being embraced by the Fine Gael Party. I think most Members subscribe to the more republican approach that one helps people to help themselves. Obviously people are different. We must recognise that difference.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support Senator Leyden&rsquo;s call for a debate on the oil situation. Perhaps the Leader might broaden that debate to include sustainability and alternative energy sources. The failure, particularly of the current American Administration, to meet the requirements of the Kyoto Agreement is regrettable. Unless the developed countries of the globe look to alternative sources, we will not achieve sustainability. Oil is a finite resource.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been reported that the break-up of Aer Rianta is to involve a write-down of &euro;110 million in assets and we are learning of a rift in the Cabinet between the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. The two reports which have been issued essentially state that there are too many unanswered questions, no objective verifiable assessments and no proper projections. When might the Leader get the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to attend the House for a proper discussion on the issue? Everyone is in the dark. I do not want to mention the hotels groups to the Leader this morning, but they are absolutely in the dark.</P>
    <P>I support everything Senator Finucane said. With regard to what Senator O&rsquo;Meara said, I <Col N="1558"/>raised this matter before and I believe the Leader looked on it favourably. Regarding those on the income threshold for medical cards, the truth is, as the medical organisations have pointed out, that many more medical cards should be issued to people in need.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will have every subject debated on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach is right that I seek a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will wait for that debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Some very fine initiatives have been introduced by the Government over the past few months regarding care of the elderly. However, in the implementation programme there is confusion as to which Department deals with which initiative. I ask that the Minister come to the House and clarify the situation and that we might have statements on those programmes and initiatives. While I compliment the Minister, there is confusion about implementation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his impartiality throughout this session&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. It is splendid, unlike some other places.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and on his great reluctance to defend the Leader of the House against questioning from this side. Long may it last. It is a great tribute to the Cathaoirleach that it is so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that, but the Senator should speak on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence for one or two questions. I endorse what Senator Finucane said about autism. The issue has arisen in this House more than in the other and there is all-party support in the area. Senator Hayes raised it and I know the Leader also has an interest in it. Perhaps we could continue that debate and squeeze some money out of the Minister. The motion must continue, but we should get a commitment from the Minister for an extra grant for autism. We might achieve something by doing that in this House with serious intent. All sides appear to agree on the issue and it could be taken seriously here. We could achieve something to our credit.</P>
    <P>I refer to what Senator Terry said. When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, made his comments, people on this side of the House realised that he was, first of all, trailing his coat and that we should not necessarily respond as expected to him when he says such things. When he said that inequality was an incentive for the economy, he qualified it rather cleverly by saying that he was talking <Col N="1559"/>about mathematical inequality. That is a significant qualification. I am not sure that the interview he gave to the magazine in question merits a full debate in the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is going into detail on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect the Minister wants a full debate in the House. Let us not have a debate on that but instead have one on the economy. Some very interesting figures came out last night which are, on the surface at least, a great credit to the Government. They would certainly give every malcontent on this side of the House an opportunity to make special pleading for funds coming up to the budget, and there are signs of that already. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the economy, for which I feel there would be all-party support.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my fellow Senators regarding the Travellers illegally parked in Wexford. The situation with coloured diesel can be stopped by implementing the law. However, without the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; in place to ensure that no laws are broken, we will not be able to implement the law. I will be trying to ensure that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, provides the necessary finance to recruit those garda&iacute;.</P>
    <P>I want each of us to think about what he or she will be doing on Sunday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>We will all be going to mass.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>What does Sunday have to do with the Order of Business?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>That will become clear. Sunday is 6 June, which is the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings. It is very appropriate that this House remembers the ultimate sacrifice that soldiers from the United States, France, Britain and Ireland made to set us free. Sometimes it worries me that we tend to forget it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that the financial figures are very good and encouraging. We had a debate on the economy very recently and I am not certain it is necessary to repeat it quite so soon.</P>
    <P>I appeal for an end to the phoney war on the nitrates directive. It has been explained over and over again at every level &mdash; I have done it myself in my county &mdash; what the situation is and that a derogation will be sought. To keep returning to the base figure is an unreal argument, as if a trade unionist were to keep insisting on talking about basic rates of pay when there are bonuses and overtime of up to 50% above them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>They do that.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1560"/>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us have a real argument. The farming organisations are about to enter the social partnership negotiations and there is ample opportunity there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator seek a debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, a speech.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to clarify any concerns and provide any necessary reassurances.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is surprising how many things in life we take for granted. It is only when something goes wrong that our attention is drawn to it. I am thinking of the serious glitch at air traffic control affecting Heathrow. Something similar happened in Dublin about ten days ago, when there was a glitch in the air traffic system. It was solved very readily and competently. Senators may remember that, last year, in both North America and Italy, there were significant electricity blackouts. I raise that as a reminder of the need to invest in infrastructure &mdash; things we take, and have always taken, for granted, except when something goes wrong.</P>
    <P>I was unaware of it until yesterday but today is the final day for the submission of tenders sought by the Dublin Port Authority for the harbours at Skerries and Balbriggan. I had assumed that they were maintained, if not by the State, then certainly by the local authority. Apparently the local authority does not have the responsibility. It appears that the Dublin Port Authority is putting the running of the harbours out to tender. The acceptance date is this day week and the harbours could go out of the hands of the Dublin Port Authority and the county council. This is exactly the type of infrastructure that should be maintained. I am not sure of the situation. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has had his attention drawn to this. I gather he has not responded yet. Let us encourage him to do so.</P>

   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>On a number of occasions on the Order of Business and also as a matter on the Adjournment I have raised the curtailment of jet skis and skiboats. Will the Leader, and my colleague, Senator MacSharry, the Government spokesperson on this area in the Seanad, ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, when amending legislation will be coming before the House? It has been brought to my attention again that this is a real need. Westmeath is called the lake county, and on one of the lakes around Mullingar it is evident that some of these people do not care about other lake users. I ask that something be done as soon as possible. The legislation, I believe, is imminent. When will it be brought before the House so we can put in place <Col N="1561"/>effective legislation that will curtail the activities of those irresponsible people?</P><?oasys [cl11.4]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden should clarify what he means by the end of the dual mandate. I believe Senator Jim Higgins will have a dual mandate on our next sitting day and Senator Brendan Ryan could well be in a similar position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his clarification.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to clarify the position as regards the proposed closure of 700 Garda stations around the country? Great concern has been expressed to me as regards my area in respect of Garda stations in Balla, Tourmakeady, Lahardane and Ballyglass, because they could face closure. It is very important to have a debate on this in the House because there is great fear abroad that the Minister will close small Garda stations around the country. One wonders how this can be reconciled with the Government&rsquo;s promise to appoint an extra 2,000 garda&iacute;, which we have not seen. People have come to anticipate the closure of Garda stations by the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport to give his views on the national review of speed limits? Much has been said in this House about this in the recent past. I am sure all politicians who have been canvassing in recent weeks have experienced the desire at local level that this national review would take the concerns of the electorate in rural areas into account, as regards built-up areas and county roads.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane, the acting leader of the Opposition, raised the question of the mentally handicapped. Everyone in the House would agree that much remains to be done. Having said that, there have been great improvements, from the time when his own party was in government and thereafter. I readily admit, however, that much more needs to be done. We are all united on the later point which Senator Ross took up as regards autism. This is one of the most tragic of conditions to affect young people and babies. Money spent not just on care but on research which might pinpoint more accurately how and why it happens and how it may be obviated, would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane asked when the disability Bill would be ready. I understand it will be in the autumn, but the education disability Bill has passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il. There have been over 200 amendments and I understand it is vastly changed from the Bill which was presented to the D&aacute;il. We are ready to take it here. It is now a matter of timetabling. It is a very important Bill. <Col N="1562"/>I hope we will debate it the week after we return. The Senator talked about Travellers. I take his point that settled people have rights, just the same as the Traveller community. This feeds into the mini-debate we had on equality and inequality this morning.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked for more information about the motion I moved yesterday. The motion was No. 17 on the Order Paper, calling for the removal from office for stated misbehaviour of Judge Brian Curtin, pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution. The motion was moved by me and the debate was adjourned. This debate will resume when the committee to be established later today by the House makes its report. The debate will resume when the committee makes its report to the full Seanad. Senator Norris also talked about the danger to pedestrians and cyclists when the Luas comes into operation. The metro will also go ahead. I know that Senator Norris and I have always been of one mind in this matter. It appears to be inching slowly along, pardon the pun. Information about it will emerge soon.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara spoke about the financial position, which is good, thankfully. She said some of the money should be used to address the issue which Senator Finucane raised. I am hopeful that will happen. She is also concerned about third level, and I suppose, second level, students who work part-time which may be affecting their studies. Young people have always wanted to have money in their pockets. My prime job as a young student was washing dishes in the hotel where we lived.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the favourite hotel the Senator had?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not. It is a long time ago. Anyway, there were no dishwashers and I washed and washed, but got paid. I have sympathy with students who want to earn some money. Of course one does not want it to cut across their studies. I recall my father saying he did not care how late I stayed out and that he knew I would behave myself. Little did he know. He insisted, however, that I should be in the kitchen in the morning at 7.30 a.m., and I was. It is a good incentive to young people to get out and do it.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden spoke about the oil price. I take his point that extra revenue gained goes into the coffers. He said there should be a stabilisation of that so the extra revenue gained could be offset against the taxation of oil. That would make sense. There is a meeting today of the OPEC ministers. Hopefully, something will emerge from that in terms of extra production. Senator Maurice Hayes talked about the washing of diesel.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry referred to remarks made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. <Col N="1563"/>One would have to read the entire script. I just read the newspaper as well in which it was reported. The difficulty often is that remarks can seem alarming, but set against the context of the full speech it can be a different matter. It would be helpful to get the full speech. I think it was Senator Ross who said society often wants somebody who will be provocative so a debate can emerge on a particular issue. That is no bad thing. Deputy McDowell is able to give such provocation and to take it as well, which is a fair point in a Minister. However, we will endeavour to get him to address the whole issue of equality and inequality in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes spoke on autism. We are all agreed on that matter. We have a resumed debate on No. 12 on the Order Paper, a rolling debate on autism. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, has been good at coming to the House, listening, taking notes and thinking about the issue. Again, when the House returns, we should seek to have another debate on that. Extra money is needed and it could be linked to the debate on the economy. He also spoke about the laundering of diesel. He made the practical point that it was bad for one&rsquo;s engine, as well as being wrong.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about food safety and asked that the Minister for Agriculture and Food should synchronise with the excellent work being done by the Commissioner in Brussels. Senator Walsh referred to oil and also spoke about sustainability and equality. Some interesting topics have been raised this morning. We wish everyone was equal, but that is impossible. When one starts off in political life one thinks if only everybody had a house, and a decent education, a principle to which I always hold, everybody would be better off but people are always striving which is not in itself a bad thing.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan spoke about the break-up of Aer Rianta. I see he has left but we will ask the Minister to come here and explain the situation. He also mentioned the need for more medical cards which is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde mentioned the programmes for the elderly which have been laid down across various Departments, such as Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Social and Family Affairs, and Health and Children. She wants to know where the crossover happens and how the programmes can be contained and structured.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross spoke about autism. We are all at one in wanting improvements in that area and there is a significant degree of cohesion in the Chamber on this matter which we should use to good effect. I suggest that we have the debate on the economy, which the Senator requested, and link it with a debate on one issue to which we <Col N="1564"/>want money diverted, namely, autism. I have dealt with the Senator&rsquo;s remarks about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan spoke about the need to recruit the extra garda&iacute; and reminded us that Sunday is the 60th anniversary of D-Day. There are marvellous programmes on BBC, and one on RTE tonight to mark the event. We will all have other commitments on Sunday but it is good to acknowledge that memory for the free world. I hope to be in Croke Park on Sunday and I hope Westmeath will win.</P>

	<P>Senator Mansergh is right to say the financial figures are good. He also mentioned the debate on the nitrates directive. There was an attempt on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning to stir it up, so to speak. A derogation will be sought in July. The farmers were putting their case as the opening salvo for the talks. Senator Quinn raised the matter of the air traffic control problems in Heathrow Airport. I understand the system is back in order. He also told us the advertisement is out for the tender for the harbours in Skerries and Balbriggan. We should keep an eye on that matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn spoke about legislation to curtail jet skis. I have received a note to the effect that the regulations governing their use will go to Government soon and will be introduced quickly thereafter. The issue will be dealt with by regulation rather than legislation. It is hoped to deal with that next week or the following week.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke mentioned the closure of Garda stations. Indeed, we were all alarmed by the remarks about them. I hope it is hyperbole and that the numbers the Senator cited are not accurate. He also raised the matter of the promised 2,000 extra garda&iacute;. The Government said this would happen during its term of office and by the time we go to a general election &mdash; I almost said go out of office &mdash; those garda&iacute; will be on the beat.</P>
    <P>Senator Brennan suggested a national review of speed limits particularly as they affect rural areas. I am aware of this because voters have raised it during the canvass in small rural areas. A national review would be very helpful in that regard.</P>

Section 54(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act provides that one of the principal functions of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board shall be to cause a cost benefit analysis to be made of the legal procedures and associated processes, including those provided for by this Act, that are currently employed in the State for the purpose of awarding compensation for personal injuries. While section 54(2) provides that the board shall have all such powers as are necessary, or expedient for, or incidental to, the performance of its functions under the Act, it is considered opportune to provide a specific power for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to require any person, including a Minister, or a body established by or under any enactment to provide it with any information it may reasonably require for the purpose of this particular function under section 54(1)(<i>c</i>). Subsection 2 imposes a duty to comply with the requirement of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in this respect. This means that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board can seek a court order against a non-compliant person or body.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This is a technical amendment which relates to section 1(2) of the Bill. It is designed to reflect the fact that all of Part 2 might not necessarily be brought into operation on the same day and a different provision could be brought into operation on another day. It is quite clearly stated in Part 1, section 1(2) that &ldquo;This Act shall come <Col N="1566"/>into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders&rdquo;. The Minister is aware that we often bring forward technical amendments which are designed to be helpful and I hope that he sees them in that light.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, paragraph (<i>a</i>), line 41, to delete &ldquo;one year&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is one of the most important sections of the Bill. We welcome the Bill&rsquo;s overall aim to reduce the number of fraudulent claims. However, I have great difficulty with the prospect of limiting the right of genuine claimants to bring forward cases. The reduction of the limitation period from three years to one year is a matter of grave concern to many people. It is misguided and my amendments seek to change it. Recovery is the main concern of people who have been in a serious accident, which takes time. The first thing on the minds of people who make genuine claims is not putting the claims process in train; it is about getting better. Limiting the timeframe to one year will not give people the necessary time to recover and think about putting a claim forward. The real losers will be genuine people who want to make claims. They are not the ones we have set out to tackle but those who have been making fraudulent claims.</P>
    <P>A case in point is the recent situation in Drogheda. I will not name the doctor involved but we are all aware of it. Only five of those women would fall within the 12 month time limit. <Col N="1567"/>As matters stand, only about 20 women come within the three year time limit. There are approximately 70 other women who fall outside the three year limit. If we go along with the Minister&rsquo;s proposal we will put in place a system where many people will fall outside the time limit. This would deny people the opportunity to lodge their genuine claims, which is something we must avoid.</P>
    <P>We have received letters from numerous interested parties on this matter. I received a copy of a letter from Patient Focus addressed to the Minister. This group deals with women who have experienced medical negligence, particularly in Drogheda. The letter made for interesting reading and brought home the point of how these women need a time limit of at least three years. We suggest a time limit of two years. I realise the timeframe has been significantly reduced over the years, which was a good thing. At one point the reduction was from 20 years to 12 years to six years. However, there is a danger we can go too far, which would be the case if we bring it down to one year.</P>
    <P>As the letter from Patient Focus indicated, taking legal action is not the first step. The priority for people in such circumstances is to get better and they may subsequently take legal action. In many cases it can take people months to recover. A year could well have elapsed by the time they get medical reports. A one year time limit could put people at risk. I urge the Minister to examine the timeframe again and increase it to two years to ensure we protect genuine claimants, which is the purpose of the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support Senator Terry, particularly her opening remarks where she referred to claims that are not frivolous or vexatious. In most cases, the claimants are genuine. The question of time is important for a number of reasons. In the traumatic aftermath of an injury, either through an accident or due to medical negligence, the first thing people worry about is getting better.</P>
    <P>I have a letter from the Law Society, which is a body I am sure the Minister will regard with considerable respect. It described the measure with the following three adjectives, entirely &ldquo;unrealistic&rdquo;, &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;. That is the opinion of the Law Society. It is not a lobby group for patients, worthy though those are, but a senior body entrusted with monitoring and looking at the effective application of the law. The letter went on, in particular, to take up the question of victims of medical negligence, about which Senator Terry spoke. It made a number of significant and telling points and I hope in light of them and of Senator Terry&rsquo;s excellent arguments, the Minister will be disposed to look at this again and accept the amendment.</P><Col N="1568"/>
    <P>There is something special about victims of medical negligence because under the terms of the legislation they are excluded from the scope of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. If somebody registers with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the clock stops while that is being examined, which gives claimants extra time. People who are taking cases on the grounds of medical negligence do not have the extra time that is afforded to all other cases, which appears to be a serious inequity. The situation for people who are alleged victims of medical negligence gives rise to the whole question, which we went through on Second Stage so I will not labour the point, of access to medical records and so on. It can be a long drawn-out process. It often takes a long time for people to get a clear and definite prognosis of their chances of recovery, what the long-term treatment plan will be and so on. Ironically, because there is uncertainty and they may not have a full grasp of the picture because of the absence of it in these things, there will undoubtedly be a tendency to issue proceedings in a pre-emptive way, so it could paradoxically be that the operation of this time clause would result in more people just shoving in claims. I know that is not at all what the Minister is intent on achieving. For those reasons I am happy to support Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment. I hope the Minister will look kindly upon it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment for the reasons already set out. I have also been lobbied, specifically by the &ldquo;Tipperary Solicitors&rsquo; Bar Association&rdquo; in recent times about this particular element of the legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder why.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder why as well. The reaction is an interesting one because the legislation is set against the background of a compo culture, which we know exists.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Fuelled by the legal profession.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The courts are being clogged up with claims. A person will sue if they allegedly fall into a pothole. We have read stories of Dublin City Council being sued for millions. The fact remains that accidents occur and there are genuine victims. I hope the purpose of the legislation is not to penalise people who have been involved in accidents or are the victims of events which were not their fault. If people suffer an injury, they should be entitled to claim. I hope we can look at the issue in that context and the Minister will accept it is the concern of the vast majority of legal practitioners in this country.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of legal practitioners in my area who asked to meet public representatives. They made the case that the <Col N="1569"/>legislation, as currently framed, would result in an unfair situation for people who have genuine accidents.</P>
    <P>A year might appear to be a long time in terms of lodging a claim. I am not a medical expert but I am aware that an injury might not be immediately evident. For example, I had a car accident in 1989 and I am only now receiving physiotherapy for an injury I suffered but which was not apparent at that stage. That is only one instance of an injury which may not be immediately obvious. In such circumstances, a year is not a long period. We must look also at cases involving people seriously injured in accidents who may not be in a position to even consider lodging claims for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Norris that reducing the period to one year will lead people to lodge claims just in case injuries flare up. They will submit claims because they will believe they might lose out if they fail to do so before the end of a year. Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendments suggest that the period be set at two years, which is extremely reasonable. Two years is not a long period. It will allow victims of genuine accidents to submit claims and ensure that there is no injustice.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take a broader view in respect of this matter. I take his point that it is important to amend the law to combat the compo culture. We need to send out a strong message that making spurious or fraudulent claims is an intolerable practice and that everything must be done to combat it. I support public bodies investigating claims to ensure that those of a fraudulent nature are exposed. However, it must never be forgotten that the law is there to ensure that victims can be heard and that fairness will ensue. In our rush to resolve one problem let us not create another, particularly for people who are genuine victims of accidents.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am opposed to the entire section. However, perhaps the Minister will accept Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendments and I can withdraw that opposition. He has support from everyone in the House in terms of trying to deal with the fact that people put forward exaggerated, whatever about fraudulent, claims. In my profession as a doctor I have said to people, &ldquo;I am not a lawyer and I hope you will not be relying on what I can do for you in the courts&rdquo;. It is a fact that people bring forward exaggerated claims.</P>
    <P>This section could gravely discriminate against people who have been seriously injured and who, by the end of a year, would still be in no position to submit claims. Senator Norris referred to a letter from the Law Society which some other Members also received. I received a letter from Cheshire Ireland which is extremely concerned about this situation. Cheshire Ireland points out that it cares for adults, some of whom were involved in serious accidents, who have <Col N="1570"/>significant physical disabilities. The letter also states that frequently people who have suffered grave injuries and have been hospitalised or institutionalised for a significant period are neither physically ready nor in the frame of mind to consider pursuing a personal injuries claim until they have made as full a recovery as they are going to. It further states that in some instances their injuries have not resulted in a diminished mental incapacity but that they are severe in physical terms. It goes on to point out that Cheshire Ireland would be concerned that by obliging these people to take personal injuries cases within 12 months of the date accidents, they will be facing an onerous and exacting requirement with which many of them would be unable and unwilling to deal. I am sure the Minister does not want to see people in such circumstances penalised because the period in which claims can be made is being reduced to one year.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the fact that this section covers medical negligence claims which are not covered by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. In my opinion, and that of colleagues in the medical profession by whom I have been contacted, this may lead to an increase rather than a decrease in the number of medical negligence claims. A year is a short period for people to recover, in some instances, from operations or injuries. I suggest that we should not reduce the period to one year because people who have had serious accidents and suffered terrible injuries will be penalised. There are people who might submit claims because they believe they will recover quite well but who will decide to do so because they will believe that if they do not do so, they might run out of time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Terry stated, the real substance of the Bill is contained in this section. I support, to an extent, the sentiments she expressed in respect of her amendment. However, we must remind ourselves that this legislation was welcomed by everybody in the House on the basis that something simply had to be done because of the abuse of the system which has been fuelled by members of the legal profession. These individuals have cultivated a profitable industry for themselves in this area and they fought, tooth and nail, against the inclusion of many of the provisions in the Bill from the outset. Having said that, however, I have also received representations from the Law Society and I was sympathetic to some of the arguments put forward, particularly, as Senator Henry and others stated, in respect of medical claims. I refer to claims where people are incapacitated to such an extent that making claims is probably the last thing on their minds.</P>
    <P>Most reasonable people would want to ensure that where serious injuries occur, those who suffer them would have a fair way of processing <Col N="1571"/>their claims and gaining proper compensation. On the other hand, we must ensure that the many claims that are made without justification will be dealt with in a much more stringent way than at present. The establishment of the PIAB is a good measure in this regard. People in the legal profession have informed me that if they make a claim on behalf of an injured person and if they can have the case heard by a certain judge, they will achieve a better outcome than if the case was heard by a different judge. Insurance companies also try to have cases heard by judges who will favour them. Such behaviour introduces an element of lottery into the system which, in my view, should not be present. The downside of this behaviour is that exorbitant insurance costs have arisen for small businesses and industries. As a result of the escalating costs relating to employers&rsquo; liability and public liability insurance, people are actually operating without insurance. That is alarming for the public at large and for employees and the type of behaviour to which I refer must be arrested.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the one size fits all approach is correct. I would be sympathetic to the Minister reconsidering this matter in terms of what might happen in certain cases where good arguments are made for genuine claims, particularly those involving serious injuries. I do not know if it is possible to distinguish between the length of time it takes for a case to be heard by the High Court, where the quantum compensation being claimed is higher, as against that which applies in the Circuit Court, where a lower figure obtains and where, as a result, smaller claims tend to be heard.</P>
    <P>A person stoned out of his mind on drink or perhaps drugs who, when walking down the street, breaks his ankle from a fall caused by a crack in the pavement or a pothole he failed to see should not receive compensation. I am aware of instances where people of this sort have waited three years to make a claim, by which time it is impossible for the defendants to ascertain if and where the accident happened. It is, therefore, impossible for them to mount a defence. We must be careful that we do not undermine the intent and purpose behind the legislation. Perhaps we should consider whether different periods should apply in particular instances. The Law Society and various Senators have put a serious argument for extending the period beyond a year for cases of serious injury, particularly medical injury.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever expression one chooses to use. Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment raises <Col N="1572"/>an important point on which we would do well to reflect and there is much cogency in the argument put forward by Senator Jim Walsh that one may need a nuanced approach. While trying to deal with this we must not lose sight of the strategic function of this and other related legislation, which is to reduce the compo culture and the cost of insurance which is negatively affecting our competitiveness and the viability of jobs and enterprises, substantially in some cases.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind there are two categories of people, the small minority who abuse the law and the system and the vast majority who are generally reluctant to go to law if they can possibly avoid it. These do not instantly think of going to court if they hurt themselves or are injured. Going to court is a last resort for which they are reluctant to opt.</P>
    <P>The most persuasive argument for extending the period was mentioned by Senator Norris and others. It is a pragmatic argument. Will reducing the time limit so drastically to one year act as a precautionary and pre-emptive measure or will the advice be given to people to make a claim regardless of whether they want to in case they decide to go ahead with it in the future? If that was to happen, the measure would be counter-productive and instead of reducing the number of claims it would perversely succeed in increasing them.</P>
    <P>In some instances people are not sure they should claim. With medical conditions both we and others always live in hope that we will get better and that matters are not as serious as they feel. Unfortunately, we sometimes discover that is not the case and that an injury or condition is not as minor as we hoped. There is a <i>prima facie</i> case to be put and I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Terry for tabling an amendment on this matter. I have done a good deal of private soul searching on the issue since the Second Stage debate, which was constructive and fair-minded. As a member of the legal profession I must be careful not to be swayed by arguments which are <i>ad hominem</i> or come from a specific point of view to the exclusion of the public interest.</P>
    <P>Taking all of this into the balance, I have come to the view that there is merit in Senator Terry&rsquo;s proposal. The reason I have come to that view is, among others, that the State Claims Agency, which is located in the National Treasury Management Agency, has communicated with me to the effect that it believes the one-year period is, in the case of medical negligence cases, too tough a limitation period. The request to extend the period, therefore, has not just come from groups with what the cynics might think were vested interests or an interest in delaying legislation. The State Claims Agency is a body with no such interests and no axe to grind, yet it <Col N="1573"/>has communicated with my Department to state it is worried about the particular provision.</P>
    <P>This is a measure which limits access to justice just as any limitation period limits access to justice. There are good reasons for limitation periods. Justice must be justice for the defendant as well as the plaintiff. In any civilised society there must be some point at which defendants can safely assume they will not be sued arising from an incident. This is in the interest of the common good as much as is access to justice. People must know they are no longer, so to speak, under threat.</P>
    <P>However, with any statute, whether the Statute of Limitations 1957 or this Bill if enacted, I believe in limiting access to justice on behalf of plaintiffs. There must be strong, coherent and proportionate reasoning behind the limitation. We cannot simply decide it would be great for the insurance companies if the limitation was three months instead of three years because we are dealing with a balance of rights and interests and with different competing interests with regard to access to the justice system.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill has gone through a drafting and scrutiny process in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, it strikes me, when I think about the effect on medical negligence cases, there could be a question mark over its proportionality in constitutional terms, for example, where somebody in the rehabilitation hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has one year in which to decide on these weighty matters.</P>
    <P>I am not extensively lobbied by the Tipperary Bar association, but its parent body, the Law Society, has also made the point to me that cases of medical negligence are complex and require time to establish the facts. I know from my experience as a barrister that even an enthusiastic solicitor seeking to marshall all the facts and get all the relevant reports will be hard pressed to get much of the material lined up so that the barristers can advise the client, if it is a case that requires advice, on who the appropriate defendant should be and on whether it was the anaesthetist, the surgeon or the hospital who was responsible for the medical catastrophe. Also, obtaining medical reports here frequently requires going outside the country and the laying out of considerable amounts of money.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to members of the legal profession who carry much of the slack in terms of undertaking to pay fees for consultants in cases where there is a considerable risk to themselves that nothing will come of it. Often one must arrange for one&rsquo;s client to be examined by somebody outside the country, arrange trips abroad and join a queue if the client requires examination by a busy specialist in the United Kingdom or wherever. One cannot just click one&rsquo;s fingers and get an instant report from such a person, even in an ideal world.</P><Col N="1574"/>
    <P>Having said all that, the reason I find Senator Terry&rsquo;s reasoning attractive is that if we have a general limitation period, it must be generally understood. It must be understood by everybody as a general feature of our law.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that Senators Jim Walsh and Mansergh are suggesting that I could introduce nuances to provide different periods and circumstances etc. Medical negligence cases can frequently be married to personal injuries cases. If a medical worker fails to notice that somebody has broken a leg as a result of a motor accident, the potential exists for two linked actions to arise from the same incident. In such circumstances, would it be a good idea for the person in question to have a long period in which to sue the doctor, but a shorter period in which to sue the driver? There might be confusion if different periods of time were provided for the various categories. It would be an artificial arrangement if the last gasp of the plaintiff was to sue the doctor, but not the driver, after 18 months had expired. There would be all sorts of unintended consequences.</P>
    <P>I take Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s point that the purpose of the Bill is to reduce litigation. Practitioners who receive defensive legal advice may regard themselves as obliged to commence proceedings against the risk that they will be found negligent, three or four months later, for not having taken such a step. One has the worst of all worlds in such circumstances. On the face of it, one is attempting by statute to reduce litigation, but one is actually stoking the fires of defensive litigation.</P>
    <P>I am confronted with a dilemma when I take all of these matters into account. Is Senator Terry&rsquo;s approach preferable to the other possible approach, which is to introduce nuances to these matters and to attempt to put in place more specific provisions in respect of particular circumstances? I am attracted by Senator Terry&rsquo;s proposal because it means it will be generally understood that everybody has to operate within a certain period of time. Her approach would mean that people will not say &ldquo;I know there is some kind of complex law in this area and I am not quite clear which side of the line my case falls on&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A point made by Senator Jim Walsh also has a certain attraction. He wondered why we do not have a shorter period for small claims, which are not as serious. They tend to involve people who tripped or fell &mdash; they may have broken their wrist, for example &mdash; rather than patients in rehabilitation centres. A possible problem with Senator Walsh&rsquo;s suggestion is that it would turn small claims into large claims.</P>

	<P>One might go to the High Court to get around the problems created by the proposal.</P><Col N="1575"/>
    <P>It is relevant to point out that this Bill was published in discharge of the Government&rsquo;s decision to accept the MIAB report, which set out a substantial menu of proposed reforms. One of the proposed reforms involved the reduction of the limitation period and another related to the introduction of the letter of claim, provided for in section 7. The two issues are entirely separate. We need to sift out the cases, such as that referred to by Senator Walsh, in which a person announces that he twisted his ankle two years earlier when he stood in a pothole on Main Street in New Ross or somewhere else. In such cases nobody can contradict the person making the claim because it is far too late to investigate the circumstances. Such cases are addressed by the letter of claim provision. Although the provision does not provide for an absolute limitation period, it ensures that the lawyers involved in a late claim will find themselves at a serious disadvantage. It is a relevant consideration.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to Senator Terry&rsquo;s argument. I cannot simply accept her amendment on my feet, however, without reverting to my Government colleagues on the issue. I am sympathetic to Senator Terry&rsquo;s approach because certainty is of great importance in this matter. I admit that I contemplated allowing the Oireachtas to fix the claim period on a transitional basis, before moving it. The question of certainty is hugely important, however. The limitation periods we provide for are probably better set as a matter of law. They should not be variable by some resolution of the Oireachtas to delay the implementation of something. I am sympathetic to the proposal, as I have said, and I am grateful to Senators for their reasonable approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>I am still of the view that three years is too long a period. If one examines all the cases, one could make an argument for five years on the basis that a period of three years puts pressure on people to arrive at various decisions etc. We have to strike a balance in that regard. I am worried that the proportionality of the one-year period is a serious issue. The last thing any of us, particularly myself, would like to achieve is to end up in the Supreme Court in a couple of years to be told this<?oasys [jy?>measure constitutes a disproportionate and unconstitutional limitation of the right of action.</P>
    <P>I ask Senator Terry not to pursue her amendment on this occasion, but to hold it back until Report Stage, when I will accept it if I am so minded and if my Government colleagues think it is appropriate to do so. Alternatively, I will table an amendment in my name to achieve the same result.</P>

    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, pursuant to Standing Order 60A:</P>
    <P LI="2">1. Noting the information provided to the House by the Leader of the House:</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in August 2001, on receipt of information from Interpol obtained by the United States Postal Inspection Service during a search of premises in Fort Worth, Texas, concerning details of alleged customers of a company offering access to child pornography websites, commenced an operation in relation to persons allegedly so identified from this jurisdiction,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) that these details included the names, passwords and credit card and charge card details of certain persons,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) that one of the persons from this jurisdiction so named was a Brian Curtin, 35 Ashe Street, Tralee, Co. Kerry, and that subsequent enquiries indicated that this person was Brian Curtin, Judge of the Circuit Court, with a home address of 24 Ard na L&iacute;, Tralee, Co Kerry,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) that a warrant to search Judge Curtin&rsquo;s home under section 7 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 issued from the District Court on foot of an application by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 20 May 2002,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>e</i>) that Judge Curtin&rsquo;s home was subsequently searched on foot of the said warrant and that Garda&iacute; took possession of a personal computer and other material during the search,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>f</i>) that an investigation file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the Garda authorities in October 2002 and that the Director of Public Prosecutions instructed that Judge Curtin be prosecuted for knowingly having in his possession child pornography contrary to section 6 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998,</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>g</i>) that the trial of the said charge commenced on 20 April 2004 at Tralee Circuit Court and that on 23 April 2004 Judge Curtin was found not guilty of that charge without evidence being given in <Col N="1577"/>relation to the subject matter of the charge, the Circuit Criminal Court having determined that the aforesaid warrant was spent when executed at the home of Judge Curtin,</P>
    <P LI="2">2. Noting the contents of all of the correspondence between the Secretary General to the Government, Judge Curtin and his solicitors, commencing with the letter from the former dated 27 April 2004, and in particular the statement by Judge Curtin&rsquo;s solicitors in their letter of 13 May 2004 that, should the Oireachtas see good to make requirements of Judge Curtin, in due course, Judge Curtin will respond to that body appropriately,</P>
    <P LI="2">3. Noting in particular the letter of 21 May 2004 from Judge Curtin&rsquo;s solicitors to An Taoiseach, the response to that letter of 25 May 2004, the letter of 31 May 2004 from Judge Curtin&rsquo;s solicitors to the Secretary General to the Government, and a letter of the same date containing submissions on behalf of Judge Curtin,</P>

    <?oasys [xh?><P LI="2">5. Noting the proposal by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that this House, calls for the removal, pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution and section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, of His Honour Judge Brian Curtin, Judge of the Circuit Court, from office for stated misbehaviour, being his conduct in and in relation to subscribing to, accessing and use of websites containing child pornographic images and thereby rendering himself unsuitable to exercise the office of a Judge of the Circuit Court, but that this motion has been adjourned pending the conclusion of the investigative process herein described,</P>
    <P LI="2">6. Conscious of the responsibility and duty of the Houses, prior to the members of the Oireachtas forming a judgment as to whether they wish to vote in favour of or against such a motion, to cause an investigation to take place into the said matters so as to gather and ascertain the facts of and evidence relating to same, and to provide the opportunity to Judge Curtin to state and present his case to the said Houses,</P><Col N="1578"/>
    <P LI="2">7.

    <P LI="4">(v) Power to send for persons, papers and records.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The House approved a motion yesterday calling for the removal, pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution and section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 of Judge Brian Curtin, judge of the Circuit Court, from office for stated misbehaviour. Under the terms of the Standing Order approved by the House yesterday, it falls to the Seanad to decide if a select committee should be established in the manner provided to advance the process.</P>
    <P>I invite the House to recall the circumstances that have brought us to this point. The circumstances include the detailed information given in the motion moved yesterday by the Leader of the Seanad, the debate on which was adjourned. They also include correspondence between the judge&rsquo;s legal representatives and the Taoiseach, the Secretary General to the <Col N="1580"/>Government and the Cathaoirleach. It is clear from the correspondence that Judge Curtin was given every opportunity to provide an explanation of the circumstances, but regrettably he has not done so. In the light of these developments, the responsibility falls on the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider the matter of the judge&rsquo;s removal from office in accordance with the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is imperative that there is full public confidence in the Judiciary and in the integrity of the justice system. The Members of the Seanad are called on to play a part in helping to uphold the high standards of behaviour required of those charged with the exercise of judicial functions. To assist the House in deciding how to vote on the motion proposed by the Leader, we need to ensure that all the relevant evidence is available to us. I propose today that we set up a select committee for that purpose. The purpose of the select committee will be to take evidence in respect of the Article 35.4.1&deg; motion. The committee will be concerned only with gathering the evidence and is expressly precluded from any findings of fact or expressing any opinion.</P><?oasys [cl11.4]?>
   
    <P>The Standing Order also lays out the procedures to ensure that persons the subject of a motion pursuant to Article 35.4.1&deg; will be treated in accordance with fair procedures, both at the select committee and before the House.</P>
    <P>I propose the appointment of such a select committee because it is appropriate for this House to do so in light of the information made available to it to date. The task of the select committee will be to ensure that all relevant information is obtained and this motion sets out the powers it will have to enable it to do this.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, paragraph (<i>a</i>), line 41, to delete &ldquo;one year&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P el="0" Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Terry).<?oasys [is0p10]?></P>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response and his recognition of our proposal to increase the limitation period from one to two years. He has approached the matter from both a legal and sympathetic point of view. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that we do not discriminate against people who may, some time after an accident, suffer from injuries or problems <Col N="1581"/>not initially identified or diagnosed at the time of the incident. The Minister&rsquo;s approach is fair and will address the matter. I will take his response on board by withdrawing the amendment and moving it and the others in the group on Report Stage. This will afford the Minister some time to discuss the issue with his Government colleagues. I thank him for taking my concerns on board today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, thank the Minister for his thoughtful response. I have a question about one group of cases about which I am not clear and, again, they relate to the medical negligence sphere. As the Minister will be aware, the Medical Defence Union and the Minister for Health and Children are in dispute regarding historic obstetric claims. What is the position regarding claims for cases of obstetric cerebral palsy, which do not come before the courts for six years on average?</P>
    <P>Senators O&rsquo;Meara and Terry also raised the case concerning claims made by women in the Drogheda area who for many years did not know they had been injured. What is the position with regard to people with historic obstetric claims or those who do not realise they have an injury until many years after the event?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Henry has raised the questions I wanted to ask. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response and commend him on his open approach to the views expressed in the House and elsewhere on this fundamental element of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I seek the Chair&rsquo;s guidance on a matter and the Minister&rsquo;s response thereto. The Minister will return to Government to discuss whether to impose a limitation period of three, two or one years, after which he will return to the House for the Report Stage debate, which is very limited compared to Committee Stage. This amendment addresses a fundamental point, which also arises with regard to later amendments in my name on the pleadings issue and medical negligence. I propose that the House consider adjourning Committee Stage to a later date to allow the Minister to table amendments to later sections of the Bill. In other words, I wish to ensure that fundamental aspects of this legislation, for example, medical negligence, pleadings and so forth, are debated on Committee Stage, rather than Report Stage. I propose, therefore, that we adjourn Committee Stage to a later date to allow the Minister to discuss the relevant matters with his Cabinet colleagues and enable the House to have the widest possible debate on the amendments. If he returns to the House with significant amendments on Report Stage, which I presume he will, debate will be relatively restricted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the proposal.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1582"/>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>My suggestion probably subverts all proper procedures. Will the Minister conduct a dialogue, even on the side, with Senator Terry and others interested in this point before tabling amendments? This would in a sense be a halfway house between adjourning the debate and allowing Committee Stage to proceed, while also having an opportunity to explore the issue fully on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s helpful and open attitude to addressing the possibility of a real injustice being done in one area and trying to make a complicated issue simpler. I assume that linking the two year limitation period to the date of knowledge will address matters such as latent hurt and so forth, which emerge over the years. That would take much of the sting out of the issue.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly impressed by a submission I received from the Cheshire Foundation which explained the difficulties of people in circumstances of this nature. I have a good deal of experience of dealing with medical negligence cases. Most people do not seek legal action but want either an explanation or satisfaction and are driven to action because of the defensive nature of the medical profession and the bodies which represent it on insurance matters.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in this area and I am happy the Minister is proposing to address it, roughly along the lines suggested by Senator Terry. I hope he can convince his colleagues of the importance of doing so. Otherwise, as the Minister already noted, the outcome could be that people will bang in an action before the end of the limitation period in order to cover all the possibilities.</P>
    <P>While closure is necessary, we should seek a means of providing for exceptional cases in which persons acting in good faith come up against medical or administrative bureaucracy which creates a difficulty for them. I found myself virtually advising the other side by recommending that people issue writs because nothing else gets a response. I welcome, however, the Minister&rsquo;s appreciation of the importance of the point Senators have raised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>While I appreciate that certain restrictions apply to debate on Report Stage, as the Chair is bound by the order of the House, I cannot act on Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator Henry&rsquo;s comments, it is important to stress that the limitation period is from the date of discoverability not of the injury done. If a medical practitioner commits an act of negligence such as attaching the incorrect internal organ to another, the clock begins to run from the date on which <Col N="1583"/>the patient becomes aware of the injury or ought reasonably to have been aware of it and not the date of the operation. That is an important factor.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked why it takes six years for such cases to come to court. There is a longer gestation period in medical negligence cases. They are complex and involve considerable manoeuvring. The plaintiff&rsquo;s solicitor must ensure he has all his ducks in a row. Expert reports must be exchanged and other documents discovered. All these procedural steps must take place and take considerable time.</P>
    <P>I do not defend the imponderable delays of the legal system but I am not shocked that it can take up to five years for serious medical cases to come to a full hearing. I wish they could be heard sooner but such periods are commonplace in medical negligence cases. Procedures are followed with a view to being fair to the professionals involved. If a case is conducted at breakneck speed, it is both unfair to the plaintiff and the defendant that they should be rushed into litigation.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that a practising medical practitioner cannot make himself or herself available for months on end to defend civil proceedings. These cases can be catastrophic in terms of the time involved, psychological pressures and so on. It is not all one way traffic. If one is on the wrong end of a medical negligence suit and one&rsquo;s work is at the mercy of the opinions of one&rsquo;s colleagues, it can be traumatic.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara stated it would be better if the House adjourned Committee Stage so that we can come back to this issue. I do not know what are the procedures in the House but it is possible to recommit amendments on Report Stage in the Lower House. I defer to the Chair on that matter but, if that is not the case, the proposal by Senator Maurice Hayes to hold consultation in the margins would be another way to approach the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments can be tabled again on Report Stage but the debate is restricted in that Members may only contribute once on each amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought amendments could be recommitted. Regardless of the procedure, I will not accept an adjournment of Committee Stage. This issue can be dealt with in a practical, robust way. I could have used the easy, shock tactic of accepting Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment. She would then not be able to say she wants to think about it again. I want to progress the legislation in a considered manner and not rush it.</P>
    <P>The legislation is urgent and I do not want its passage to drift into 2005. I would like to conclude its passage in this House, bring it before <Col N="1584"/>the D&aacute;il and return it to the House, if necessary, in July before it is goes on the Statute Book rather than delay its passage. I will be practicable and flexible in trying to achieve that result. It would not be helpful to adjourn Committee Stage so that I could sort out this issue. It would be better if we proceed on the basis I suggest. Nobody will be short-changed in that process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not my intention to delay the House on procedural issues and I accept the Chair&rsquo;s ruling. The business of the day has been ordered but we were not aware the Minister was taking this approach. It is also not my intention to delay the legislation and I accept it is urgent and needs to be on the Statute Book as soon as possible. The House is not in the habit of delaying legislation. Opposition Members have co-operated with the Government in moving legislation along but we also take the approach that fundamental changes to our laws need to be explored as extensively as possible. It is essential, on balance, that the legislation should proceed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will communicate his proposals to the party spokespersons following the Cabinet discussions on this fundamental element of the legislation. We should be given plenty of notice of the amendments before Report Stage because we will only have one opportunity to contribute to the debate on them.</P>
    <P el="10">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P el="10">Amendment No. 5 not moved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) the insertion in subsection (1) of section 5, after &rsquo;disability&rsquo; the words &lsquo;or incapacity&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">If disability is accepted as a ground for affording a longer period, the legislation should not discriminate against somebody who is incapacitated for a period following an accident or serious illness. For example, an individual could become seriously depressed following an accident and might not be capable of putting his case. It would an injustice if such incapacity were not recognised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Disability in this context is not similar to disability in other contexts. It has a specific meaning in limitation law, which includes that &ldquo;he or she is an infant, he or she is of unsound mind, he or she is a convict subject to the Forfeiture Act or that he or she is a victim of sexual abuse suffering from consequential psychological injury&rdquo;. If somebody suffered from a profound psychological condition, which made it impossible for him or her to address the case or give instructions, it would come under the <Col N="1585"/>definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo;. Disablement in this context means disability from functioning as a litigant and does not relate solely to physical disabilities. I am grateful to the Senator for raising the issue but I assure the House the colloquially accepted meaning of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; does not apply.</P>
    <P el="10">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P LI="1">I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P LI="2">In page 8, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="3">&ldquo;(2) The amendment effected by this section shall not apply to actions for personal injuries arising from medical negligence or other actions falling outside the jurisdiction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, or to actions for personal injuries which are so serious as significantly to impair the plaintiff&rsquo;s capacity to institute proceedings within one year from the date of the incident concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment is the last in section 6, which refers to the Statute of Limitations, specifically to the issue of medical negligence. In light of the broad discussion we have had on the issue, I hope the Minister will look favourably on this amendment because it specifically meets the concerns raised by Members.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, the issue of medical negligence cases is a difficult one in respect of ensuring that one has a balance of fairness for the victim on one hand, while also having certainty that all sides are properly represented. As the Minister also pointed out, there can be a high degree of complexity in cases of medical negligence leading to delays in discovering an injury, knowing that one has arisen and was caused by negligence and putting the case together in such instances.</P>
    <P>This amendment specifically seeks to address these issues. It seeks that the proposed limitations shall not apply to the actions of persons arising from medical negligence or other actions falling outside the jurisdiction of the PIAB. The second part of the amendment refers to injuries which are so serious as significantly to impair the plaintiff&rsquo;s capacity to institute proceedings within one year. Some Senators have raised the issue of people who have accidents causing them to be hospitalised in a rehabilitation institute for a considerable period of time or to suffer from a brain injury and are, therefore, not in a position to give instruction to a solicitor. This amendment would increase the level of fairness, which I am sure is the intention of this Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have explained my position in this regard and I do not wish to pre-empt my position further by responding to this amendment. If I take an approach sympathetic to Senator Terry&rsquo;s original amendments on this matter, I would prefer not to start dividing the whole issue vertically. I am not tempted to deconstruct the Bill and provide a very complex law. A simple limitation period is the desirable approach.</P>

   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not being pressed today. However, when this amendment comes back it will be a fairly significant amendment to the legislation and because it will be Report Stage, we will not be able to have the broad debate all Senators would like to have.

	<P>We had a good discussion on the amendments to the section. I signalled this opposition to the section, which was intended to go for the jugular, shortly after Second Stage before I received any representations on the issue. Cheshire Ireland requested that the period of limitation should be two years rather than one and I am sure the Minister would agree that the organisation is not a vested interest but rather views the issue dispassionately and out of concern for the patients for whom it cares.</P>
    <P>I was taken by the Minister&rsquo;s point that there must be justice for the defendant as well as for the plaintiff. A very long time span is extremely difficult for a defendant. I will ensure the Minister&rsquo;s kind words of concern about the medical profession are passed on. I am happy to say I have never had one, but having medical negligence claims hanging over one&rsquo;s head has a terrible effect on people, psychologically and physically and on their careers.</P>

  <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 12 is an alternative to amendment No. 11 and we can <Col N="1587"/>take amendments Nos. 11 and 12 by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (1), line 19, to delete &ldquo;2&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;4&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with the letter of claim, to which the Minister referred earlier. The person intending to bring an action has not more than two months to lodge the letter of claim. The section states that the two months should be not later than two months after the date of accrual of the cause of action which, to be clear, I presume means the date the incident actually occurred, or the date of knowledge of the person in respect of the cause of the action concerned.</P>
    <P>Two months is an extraordinarily short period of time in which to lodge a letter of claim and this amendment seeks to substitute four months for two months even though four months is also a very short period of time. We know the Minister&rsquo;s intention is to ensure the process is speeded up and that the defendant is made aware of a letter having been lodged. The section also provides that, where the plaintiff has failed to comply with the section in respect of the two months timeframe, there is a considerable penalty. This is a significant and important section and my comments coincide with the intention of the legislation. As the Minister pointed out, we all welcomed the legislation, but the amendment seeks to ensure that it is fundamentally fair. In that context, by any objective standards, two months is a very short period of time in which to lodge a letter.</P>
    <P>Two months after the date of knowledge of the incident or injury is still a very short period of time in which to put together a letter of claim. I am not a lawyer but I would have thought that in many cases a fair deal of work would be involved in lodging a claim. Therefore, in order to give the genuine claimant a fair crack of the whip, I would have thought that four months is a better option than two.</P>

   <?oasys [dc20]?><Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s remarks. The most important issue for someone following an accident is his or her recovery period &mdash; it is what is foremost in his or her mind rather than seeking compensation or redress. Therefore, we are reasonable to suggest that the timeframe for the letter of claim should be increased from two months to four months. It is still a very short time, but is more reasonable. We must remember that many people, particularly in medical negligence cases, are not just seeking financial compensation, rather they are seeking an acknowledgement that something wrong has been done to them and want to ensure it does not happen to anyone else. It takes people time to even make the decision to lodge a letter of claim and, if it is a wider and more serious <Col N="1588"/>issue of compensation, a great deal of data must be collected. We are not being unreasonable in seeking to extend this period from two to four months.</P><?oasys [dc0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am opposed to these amendments. The purpose of the section is to encourage those who are contemplating litigation to put the other side on notice at an early stage. If one is being sued for a minor road traffic accident, one is put on notice that this is happening at a time when it is reasonable for one to find the witnesses or put down in writing one&rsquo;s side of the story. In this way, one is given some capacity to defend oneself. Likewise for a doctor in a medical negligence case, if somebody is contemplating suing, the doctor is in a position when the matter is fresh in his or her mind to make a note of what happened rather than have to struggle afterwards to recreate a memorandum of what happened.</P>
    <P>I draw to the attention of the House the consequences in this regard. Section 7(1) provides that a person who intends to bring a personal injuries action shall, not later than two months after the date of accrual of the cause of action or the date of knowledge, service notice. It does not affect anybody who is unaware of their situation. Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <?oasys [dc20]?><P LI="1">Where a plaintiff in a personal injuries action has, without reasonable cause, failed to comply with <i>subsection (1), </i>[If there is any reasonable cause the consequences in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) do not apply] the court hearing the action may, where the interests of justice so require . . .</P><?oasys [dc0]?>
    <P FLI="0">In such instances, subsections (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) may apply. With the greatest of respect, anybody who knows the general disposition of the court knows that section will not be interpreted in a draconian or unreasonable way. It will only be invoked where the interests of justice require that something be done in regard to the costs because the plaintiff, without reasonable cause, failed to put the defendant on notice that a case was being taken. It is not simply that there was a failure without reasonable cause. It is also that the interests of justice require that the defendant be assisted by the penalisation as to cost issues.</P>
    <P>In practice, it will not have a dramatic effect on genuine cases or people who did not get their act together. I do not think the courts would so interpret it. There is every reason to believe the courts will interpret it in a reasonable way. They will say that if a solicitor had a clear indication of the crash or an industrial accident, he or she should have written a letter to the other side stating, for example, that a person dropped a hammer on his foot at work last week and was not wearing protective boots. There is no reason that they should not be alerted within two months of being made aware of it. That is not draconian. Subsection (3) states:</P><Col N="1589"/>
    <P LI="1">Where a plaintiff in a personal injuries action has, without reasonable cause, failed to comply with <i>subsection (1), </i>the court hearing the action may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper.</P>
    <P FLI="0">What could be fairer than that? If a person does not notify the other side and allows it to go to one year or two years, there is not a dicky bird out of the plaintiff for 15 months over a two year period and suddenly there is a claim that something happened, the court is being specifically asked to inquire why this matter was not brought to the attention of the defendant in a timely way. There has to be a proper inference from the failure.</P>
    <P>It is not just that since one did not do it, the onus is on one to convince the court that something or other should be the case. What it is saying to a court is to be alert to the proposition that plaintiffs must, unless they have reasonable cause for not doing so, alert the other side. It is about getting people to face up to the issue. It is getting away from Senator Walsh&rsquo;s twisted ankle 18 months later psychology, where suddenly the urban district council receives a letter stating that 18 months previously somebody twisted their ankle on a section of road. That is not acceptable in this day and age. It is unfair to the defendant.</P>
    <P>Defendants have rights, one of which is to know that a case is likely to come up so that they can get together the foreman who was present on the day, or the witness or foreign visitor who saw the incident. They have the right to hunt down their witnesses as well. The two month period is reasonable. It puts plaintiffs and legal practitioners, because the remedies in subsection (2) are cost based &mdash; a matter usually in the minds of legal practitioners &mdash; in a position where they have a strong motive to give a clear indication that litigation is in contemplation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree generally with everything the Minister said. However, it can be achieved more fairly in four months. If the amendment suggested one year the Minister would have a case to make. The request that the period in question be extend from two to four months is not unreasonable. I am not a legal practitioner and do not spend time in the courts. I do not know the minds of judges. The Minister appears to have an insight into how the courts will interpret this section. I do not have that insight; I am simply going on what is written in the legislation. As legislators that is what we are required to do. I do not have an insight as to how the courts will interpret the section. They may not interpret the section as the Minister has stated, in which case there will be an unfair situation. I am sorry the Minister is not adopting a more broad minded approach to the amendments.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1590"/>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted these two reasonable amendments. We are not talking about the simple twisted ankle. We are taking this much more seriously and looking at genuine cases. We are all agreed on the need to cut out the fraudulent and exaggerated claims. We are dealing with serious cases where people take time and that time should be allotted to them. We are being reasonable in asking for a four month period.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (2), to delete lines 26 to 29, and substitute &ldquo;may deduct from any costs payable to the plaintiff such amount, if any, of additional costs as has been incurred by the late service or non-service of a letter of claim.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment refers also to section 7 and relates to the discussion we had. The purpose of the amendment is to make the deterrent as to costs more realistic. The Minister already referred to the issue of the deterrent as to costs. It is unrealistic to suggest that a plaintiff should not be entitled to any costs simply because they failed to issue a letter within the two month period. A fairer provision would be that they should be at risk of losing any additional amount of costs incurred as a result of the late service of the letter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am opposed to the amendment. The additional costs issue would be almost impossible to calculate. This is intended to be a significant incentive to legal advisers to litigants to get on with the job and to put them at risk if they do not send the letter of claim. How could one say extra costs were incurred by the letter arriving in month four rather than month three? One would need to be a philosopher or mathematician to work out the additional burden on the defendant arising from that month&rsquo;s delay. If one wants to recover costs, one has to get on with the job, concentrate on the issue and notify potential defendants. Section 7(2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are alternatives. Either one makes no order as to costs or makes a deduction from the costs. Most judges would choose the latter. In a brazen case where the defendant has been seriously damaged and there was no excuse for leaving the defendant un-notified, then a person acting for the plaintiff should be at risk of being seriously penalised. This will concentrate the mind of the plaintiff&rsquo;s solicitor wonderfully.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>As a former practitioner, the Minister has probably greater insight, but I am surprised at his remark about the difficulty of calculating the extra costs of the defendant. I <Col N="1591"/>think there would be nobody better to calculate the additional costs on the defendant and the defendant&rsquo;s legal adviser than the legal adviser himself. They are good at issuing bills and I do not know any office that does not calculate hours spent on a job, so it should be easy to calculate the additional costs involved. I do not accept that argument.</P>
    <P>I will not press this important amendment, but I will re-enter it on Report Stage. The legislation puts the onus on the plaintiff and the Minister refers to the plaintiff&rsquo;s legal adviser, but the Bill refers only to the plaintiff.</P>

	<P>The rules of court are not a matter for us and we have no means of making representation to people who make them. Perhaps in a moment of ultimate boredom, they might even read the proceedings of the Seanad. I was struck by what the Minister said earlier. I hope the rule of court would make it easier for doctors when they are in court. When doctors are in court, they are not treating patients. In another jurisdiction, it was found that the best way of reducing orthopaedic waiting lists was not to appoint more orthopaedists who are in short supply, but to provide through the rules of court for different means of proving the case. I hope that could be borne in mind.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support that suggestion. This gives rise to medical practitioners charging the same fees as the legal profession in some instances. Fees are very high. As Senator Maurice Hayes rightly said, it takes people away from their duties. Some medical practitioners specialise almost exclusively in court cases because they are more lucrative. We should try to avoid the tendency towards this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much agree with Senators Maurice Hayes and Jim Walsh in this matter. It is terrible that doctors are brought to hang around courts for days on end and then told they are not wanted and sent away. That is a terrible aspect of current practice and could be so easily avoided by proper case management, to see if their presence is needed. Later provisions of the Bill deal with that issue. It is really absurd. <Col N="1592"/>We have to get our act together in terms of a legal system. I see no reason a doctor should not be able to put his evidence on video, so that if it is needed it is there. If somebody wants to cross-examine the doctor at a later stage, he or she can be brought to court at a time that is convenient to him or her. The idea of leaving six, seven or eight doctors in a medical negligence case loitering around the corridor in the Four Courts for days on end is simply unacceptable.</P>

   </Speaker>

	<P>Section 17 of the Interpretation Act 1937 gives powers to rules committees to make new rules in court where a jurisdiction is conferred on a court or an existing jurisdiction is extended or varied.

    <P el="10">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) A Statement of Claim shall not be required in a personal injuries action in the High Court and a defendant shall join issue on a personal injuries summons by delivering a defence thereto within twenty-one days from the service of the personal injuries summons.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Under this Bill the personal injury summons will contain all the information which is currently contained in a statement of claim and, accordingly &mdash; this is the intention of the amendment &mdash; the Bill should make clear that a statement of claim is not necessary. I think it will appeal to the Minister because the Bill is very strong on time limits for the plaintiff and as the Minister has pointed out, on more than one occasion this morning, it should correspondingly specify a time limit for the defendant to deliver his or her defence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The statement of claim would not be, in my view, required after the new <Col N="1593"/>summons is served. It is for the Courts Service to amend its own rules and to provide that a separate statement of claim is not so required. These are rules of court and I do not think it is necessary for me by statute to start making provision for what should be in the rules.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>

	<P>I have great faith in the service and I believe it will recognise that it will be entirely redundant to require people to put the same material in two separate documents and that they should therefore amend the rules of court to state that the period for defence runs from the service of the new summons rather than the statement of claim, which is now involved in this type of litigation.</P>

    <P FLI="0">Some of the information referred to in this section, for instance, medical particulars under section 10(1)(<i>c</i>) would not necessarily known to a plaintiff and, accordingly, it seems appropriate to make clear that only the information known to the plaintiff is to be provided pursuant to this section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a rule of construction which is enshrined in the Latin maxim <i>ad impossibile nemo tenetur</i> &mdash; nobody will be required to do the impossible. If one does not know something, one cannot supply the information. I do not think a reasonable interpretation of the section could be that somebody was in breach of its provisions in respect of something they could not know. It is already implicit in the section that the information is only information that is available to a person and of which he or she has knowledge.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 10, between lines 21 and 22 to insert the following subsection:</P><Col N="1594"/>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Upon the request of a plaintiff in a personal injuries action, the defendant shall provide the plaintiff with full particulars of any matter alleged in the defence of the defendant and such other information as may reasonably be requested by the plaintiff within the knowledge of the defendant including full particulars of the plaintiff&rsquo;s earnings where such earnings were paid by the defendant, during such period as may be specified by the plaintiff.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is designed to correct an imbalance. The section is imbalanced in that it provides for particulars to be furnished by a plaintiff and not by a defendant. The amendment is designed to redress that imbalance. For instance, where a plaintiff was formerly employed by the defendant and the defendant failed to make available adequate payroll information. This amendment seeks to redress that type of omission.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is provision in the present rules of court for particulars arising out of any pleading to be served on the party who has served that pleading so a defendant is obliged to provide particulars of any matters stated in the defence. The Senator is going one stage further, that sometimes the plaintiff may require information from a defendant such as to their earning or so on. This is normally dealt with by letter and if the defendant does not come up with the goods so to speak, the court would take a very poor view of it. Sometimes, when one is a defendant in proceedings, if one simply says that one was not negligent, one is putting the matter at issue. One cannot ask someone to say why he or she was not negligent. There is a danger of people thinking that justice must be symmetrical. The onus of proof is on a plaintiff. The defendant, therefore, need not prove or disprove anything, except some positive assertion that he or she is making.</P>
    <P>Second, the whole process is not symmetrical, in that the plaintiff seeks damages from the defendant. In general terms, the latter does not seek anything from the plaintiff. To ask a defendant to particularise a defence on the basis that the plaintiff may be required to do so assumes there must be symmetry between two situations which are fundamentally asymmetrical. If one is a large-scale employer, one simply may not know much about how an accident is supposed to have taken place. To be inundated with letters demanding that one set up one&rsquo;s defence in such circumstances is not the same as asking the plaintiff to do the same for his or her claim.</P>
    <P>If, at the end of any civil proceeding, the court is left in the position that it simply does not know one way or another what the situation is, matters are not decided on a 50:50 basis. The plaintiff must lose, since he or she undertakes to prove <Col N="1595"/>things on a balance of probabilities. If something is left in doubt, the defendant should win. That is a principle of our civil law. In this case, to ask a doctor in a medical negligence suit, for instance, to give particulars of the reasons that he or she was not negligent is effectively to change the onus of proof, casting on the doctor the obligation in those circumstances to begin to justify all the actions taken. The doctor is not brought before the court to justify anything. Our system is that the plaintiff must prove matters on a balance of probabilities. It is not a system in which the doctor is told to prove that he or she was not negligent. That is not how our system works.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 11, subsection (1)(<i>d</i>), line 18, after &ldquo;alleges&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and full particulars of the acts of the plaintiff constituting any alleged negligence or contributory negligence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment makes a similar point, so I do not expect that the Minister will accept it. However, it concerns the requirements of a defence, which are more limited in this Bill than in the case of a personal injury summons. The amendment proposes that the defence should set out particulars of contributory negligence, for instance, in subsection (2)(<i>e</i>), which requires such particulars, but only in a counter-claim. Those particulars should be required in a defence which alleges contributory negligence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Such particulars can be sought under the existing rules of court. However, in very many cases, it is difficult for a defendant to particularise a claim of negligence on the part of a plaintiff. If, for instance, an employee puts his hand into a machine, the defendant, the employer, may say that he was guilty of negligence. However, if one asks him to say exactly why the employee was negligent in putting his hand into the machine, suddenly there is an almost philosophical problem from the defendant&rsquo;s point of view. He was not there, did not see what happened, and does not know precisely why the employee was negligent, but his hand went into the machine. That is how things happen. I will re-examine the issue to see if I am being guilty of unfair discrimination in that regard, but my current temptation is to take the view that, in the rules of every court, there is a procedure sufficient to allow particulars to be obtained by the defendant where necessary and <Col N="1596"/>where it is reasonable to expect the defendant to have them.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I comment at the request of the Tipperary Solicitors&rsquo; Bar Association, which points out that section 12 proposes to require all plaintiffs and defendants to lodge every proceeding in court. That was the procedure up to approximately ten years ago, when it was changed, having been found to be too onerous and time-consuming for plaintiffs and defendants and to lead to unjustifiable extra expense in personal injury actions. It also required far more work to be carried out by the court staff in dealing with each document. The present requirement that legal papers be lodged in the court when the matter is set down seems to be working well for plaintiffs, defendants, practitioners and court staff. The question is why the Minister has gone back in time, for want of a better phrase, in this regard. Perhaps he might comment on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have recently discussed this with the Law Society. The reason is to make it very clear what the pleadings were in a case and, in the next section, relating to the verifying affidavit. It is for the purpose of policing the false claims provision. When a plaintiff brings a claim against a defendant, there will be an official record of what he or she claimed and an official repository of the affidavit, so that people cannot claw it back or settle the case and get their files back from the other side. It is a policing mechanism to ensure that somewhere there will always be a full record of what someone has claimed in a personal injury action. There will be evidence of the making of the verifying affidavit so that people afterwards are in no doubt about where something is and whether it is in the office of someone&rsquo;s solicitor. We do not want a situation where the defendant will effectively be under some form of obligation to keep documents which might later be of use in policing the matter. We want a centrally stored set of proceedings and <Col N="1597"/>a verifying affidavit so that if there is any doubt afterwards concerning what the pleadings were and what the affidavit said, it is there rather than lost in some office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>That is understandable. The logic is clear, but is there currently a problem?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No. What the Law Society said is correct. It is turning the clock back, since all pleadings used to be lodged in files, and it was considered that, in most cases, that was a waste of time as the interested parties could be relied on to keep an eye on each other in any litigation. However, in the context of this new, fairly tough regime whereby, if one makes a false claim or swears a false affidavit, one exposes oneself to a statutory penalty of ten years&rsquo; imprisonment, we want a clear, official record of what the person claimed, and clear, official evidence centrally available that the person swore an affidavit in certain terms. We do not want a defendant to have lost the file or left it under the cat&rsquo;s bed in the corner of the solicitor&rsquo;s office so that the whole matter simply evaporates.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had many people chancing their arm in pleadings who bring cases to the door of the court and when confronted with the fact that they will be exposed, they simply walk away from the matter. What is important under this new regime is that it will not be a matter of walking away or the defendant not pursuing the issue in the circumstances. There will be an official record so that afterwards &mdash; even years later &mdash; a plaintiff or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when alerted to a false claim, would know where to go to find the papers.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (4)(<i>a</i>), line 45, to delete &ldquo;7 days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one month&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 21 is straightforward. The Minister refers to a tough regime in this legislation. That is fair enough. However, once again let us not have it so tough as to be unfair. I am not a lawyer, as I keep saying, but I would have thought that to swear an affidavit is a serious matter. One needs to be absolutely sure of what one is swearing, that every fact is checked and so on. These matters may need time. Seven <Col N="1598"/>days is too short in that regard. The object of the amendment is to substitute &ldquo;one month&rdquo; because seven days is too short.</P>

	<P>I have had representations from the legal profession to the effect that much documentation is involved and the time period is considered too short. Naturally enough, I would be interested to hear the considered opinion of the Minister, with his legal background, on this point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider whether seven days is too draconian. However, the section in its entirety is not draconian because it states that &ldquo;7 days after the service of the pleading concerned or such longer period as the court may direct or the parties may agree&rdquo;. There is a good deal of flexibility there. Legal people usually are reasonable with each other. They do not want to go to court and get a direction. They will concede that it may be submitted later. If seven days is considered too short, however, I will have a look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>

	<P>The point about this is that the court has directed it should happen. Therefore, if the court requires people to do &ldquo;unreasonable things&rdquo;, where are we? I do not believe it is necessary to include it. If a court directs one to attend a mediation conference, to say, in effect, that one now has reason not to do so suggests that one may disobey a direction from the court on the grounds that one subjectively believes oneself to have good reason to do so. I am not attracted by that idea.</P>

    <P FLI="0">Both amendments are designed to preserve the integrity of the rules of the court system. Dates for lodging pleadings and proceedings are normally specified in rules of court, which are made by a rules committee. The Minister may have referred to this already. The Bill, as currently drafted, would bypass the system and allow the Minister, by order, without reference to the rules committee, to override rules of court. That is why we tabled the amendment.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>At present rules of court are devised by autonomous committees and I have to countersign them. However, I have no right of initiative in these matters. I want to create a right of initiative for the Minister as regards these time periods. I do not want to be totally reliant on the rules committees in arriving at a set of time periods.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>This is similar to the matter raised in an earlier amendment. Is there currently a problem and the Minister needs the power of initiative in this regard?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to be in any way dismissive of the rules committees because their members are mainly volunteers and they work hard. However, sometimes there are areas <Col N="1601"/>where the Minister should have the power of initiative, as opposed to waiting until something is done and then signing off on it. This is one of those cases. I do not want to make any broader observations on the rules committees.

    <P>Government amendment No. 32:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 17, before section 21, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;21.&mdash;(1) the court shall in assessing damages in a personal injuries action have regard to the Book of Quantum.</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">(2) <i>Subsection (1)</i> shall not operate to prohibit a court from having regard to matters other than the Book of Quantum when assessing damages in a personal injuries action.</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">(3) In this section &lsquo;Book of Quantum&rsquo; means the Book of Quantum required to be prepared and published by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.&rdquo;.</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I had the opportunity to meet with and address the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on two occasions last year. In the course of those discussions it was clear the committee wished to ensure the courts had regard to the Book of Quantum being prepared by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. This has become very topical because a Book of Quantum is emerging. In the report it published last year the committee made a direct recommendation on that issue. I indicated at the time that I was receptive to the idea and this section is a response to the committee&rsquo;s recommendation. Section 54(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 makes it one of the principal functions of the board, &ldquo;to prepare and publish a document (which shall be known as the &ldquo;Book of Quantum&rdquo;) containing general guidelines as to the amounts that may be awarded or assessed in respect of specified types of injury&rdquo;. It appears logical that the courts should have regard to this <Col N="1602"/>Book of Quantum in assessing damages. There is a precedent in that there was a guideline for the Army deafness claims. It is not mandatory, a court is free to disregard it if it wishes but it asks courts to have regard to the Book of Quantum.</P>
    <P>If one is a judge in a Circuit Court in Tipperary town, with counsel from both sides addressing a case, and one is trying to decide how much a broken leg or hand is worth, it is useful at least to have a document which addresses that issue. It may be that the judge in his or her independent judicial function regards it as low or high in the circumstances of the particular case but it is in the interests of uniformity in the administration of justice that there should be some general document available to which the Judiciary can have regard, even if it is not strictly legally bound. Subsection (2) makes it clear this is not an exhaustive procedure or that the court cannot have regard to matters not covered by the Book of Quantum. It is a serious advance in an effort to bring consistency if not uniformity to the question of damages.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there be provision made to have the Book of Quantum reviewed periodically? Should it be reviewed annually or is there any provision to review it? It appears the Book of Quantum could remain in place without being reviewed for five years or more.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Book of Quantum is drawn up under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act. I agree with the Minister that some degree of order and certainty is welcome. The phrase &ldquo;The court shall in assessing damages in a personal injuries action have regard to the Book of Quantum&rdquo; suggests that it is required to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is to have regard to it, not to follow it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not a lawyer, that is why I need clarification on these matters. When I see &ldquo;shall&rdquo; I assume it is directive but &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; simply means to take it into account and not be obliged to follow it. If judges are required only to have regard to it why is it necessary to put that in the legislation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make it clear to judges that they are expected to have regard to the contents of this Book of Quantum, that it is their legal duty to have regard to it and to consult it. I do not want a price list that is invariable in every case which counsel could consult and say a case is worth a given amount and that is it. Injuries vary from case to case, for example, a broken ankle can be very serious or less so.</P>
    <P>It is beyond the wit of man and woman to devise an exact scale of damages in these matters. Early legal systems attempted to do it. In ancient <Col N="1603"/>Rome a man discovered that the liquidated damages for assault under Roman law had been rendered ridiculous by inflation so he went around striking people in the face and directing his slave to hand them the sum that was in the book of quantum in that system. That was the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>This is a major new step. It would be unlawful for a court to decide damages without having regard to the Book of Quantum, but it would not be unlawful to deviate from it. The High Court, on appeal from the Circuit Court, would be in a position to ask why was there a departure from the Book of Quantum and if there were grounds to justify it. It is an effort to bring consistency but not uniformity into the application of the law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an eminently sensible measure which will bring a certain element of consistency to awards of damages in an area where there is a significant degree of inconsistency depending on which judge is hearing the case, which should not be so. While we are establishing this the Personal Injuries Assessment Board must have regard to this Book of Quantum which will be the Bible for it in adjudicating on cases. It would be inconsistent to have the courts adjudicating on a different framework. While allowing for judicial discretion is good, if the Book of Quantum did not exist solicitors and others may encourage people to go to court. This will introduce some form of predictability in situations which in turn will make the PIAB system work better and prevent people seeing this as a cash cow and going to court on such issues. The House should fully endorse this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree this is eminently sensible. There are various degrees of severity of a broken ankle but the person&rsquo;s occupation should also be taken into consideration. For example, if I lost the tip of my little finger it would be very sore and upsetting for me but it would not be the same as for a concert pianist.</P>
    <P>I have compared awards given by the courts here to those given in the United Kingdom. Are they mean and are we flath&uacute;lach, or do we suffer greater anguish when we are injured because the awards for similar injuries here are much greater than those given in the United Kingdom?</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to waste time but Senator Henry asked me why awards here are substantially higher than in the United Kingdom. Several factors influenced this. Juries persisted in Ireland long after they were abolished for equivalent cases in the United Kingdom. Irish juries tended to give more than those in the United Kingdom when our currencies were at parity. It is very difficult to reduce this to an exact science but I recall on one occasion when I was practising being struck by the fact that the norm in the United Kingdom for the loss of an eye was between £15,000 and £25,000 whereas in Ireland my estimate was between £80,000 and £100,000. I presume these figures mean little now, but which is correct? I will not advance any views as to which is right and which is wrong. If I lost an eye I would favour the Irish system, but if I had to pay for somebody else&rsquo;s eye I might favour the English system.</P>

	<P>It will be updated periodically. I am not in a position at the moment to say how often it will be updated. The PIAB Act, which I do not have with me at the moment, covers that. It is not something which is frozen in time; it is a document which will issue from time to time.</P>

    <P>If one loses an income stream for the rest of one&rsquo;s life, at the moment in Ireland if it is a serious case an actuary comes to court and gives evidence by reference to actuarial tables as to what the appropriate multiplier for a capital sum should be. I am not in the slightest anti the actuarial profession whose members are skilled and wonderful people, but it is a waste of their time to have them hanging around courts to give fundamentally statistical advice by way of evidence when, as in certain other common law countries comparable to ours, it is possible to do so by a standard form table which can be varied from time to time to reflect realities. Somebody once asked &ldquo;What is the definition of an extrovert actuary?&rdquo; to which the reply was &ldquo;An extrovert actuary is one who looks at your shoes when he is talking to you&rdquo;.

    <P>In the old system before pleadings were no longer lodged, it was possible to look at cause books, and still is, to find out who has sued who. This provision is to allow for all of these matters to be on the Internet. Rather than define the <Col N="1609"/>Internet, I am proud of subsection (4) which states &ldquo;<?oasys [is0p2]?>&lsquo;internet&rsquo; means the system commonly known by that name&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The point made by Senator O&rsquo;Meara could be looked at by the Minister before Report Stage. One would presume it would be updated on an ongoing basis as cases are advised to it, but perhaps there should be provision in the legislation, for example, that information would be added to the register within so many days of receipt of notice. I accept that one does not wish to be overly prescriptive, but if there were difficulties within that office the register might not be updated for one or two months.</P>
    <P>Having such information available could also be useful in the processing of cases by either defendants or plaintiffs. Perhaps the Minister will examine the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

	<P>It would be possible to enter some time period after the words &ldquo;shall enter&rdquo;, in subsection (2). I do not want to be overly prescriptive but it is clear it has to be established and maintained and that is a rolling process. I agree with Senator Walsh that one does not want a rolling process that never seems to roll. Perhaps something of that kind could be done.</P>
    <P>There will be a search facility on the register so that the potholes of Ireland will in future be safe from Senator Henry.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 22, subsection (1), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>g</i>) the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Section 31 is a significant section which relates to the reporting of family law proceedings and the <i>in camera</i> rule, which has been a matter of almost as much discussion as civil liability claims, the <Col N="1611"/>Statute of Limitations and so on. A law practitioner has proposed the amendment to insert a reference to the child abduction Act for fairly obvious reasons. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on that before we move on to substantial amendments on this section.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment seeks to include the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991 among the list of relevant enactments in section 31(1) of the Bill. The term &ldquo;relevant enactment&rdquo; means those provisions for the hearing of family law matters otherwise than in public. Section 1(2) of the 1991 Act provides that the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts 1961 to 1988 and that Act, in so far as it affects the jurisdiction or procedure of any court in the State, shall be construed together as one. Section 45 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, which provides that justice shall be administered in public in minor matters is a relevant enactment under section 31(1) of the Bill. I am informed that the matter is already covered and that the amendment is not necessary.</P>

  <P el="10">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are related and may be taken together by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 22, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Access to proceedings to which the relevant enactments relate shall be permitted to <i>bona fide</i> academic researchers, subject to such terms and conditions relating to access as may be prescribed in regulations made by the Minister: provided that nothing published by such researchers shall contain information which would enable the parties to the proceedings or any child to which the proceedings relate to the identified.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">As Senator O&rsquo;Meara stated, this section is most important. My amendment is designed to ensure there will be access to the documents of the courts by bona fide academic researchers. The Minister and I recently attended the launching of a document by Baroness Onora O&rsquo;Neill about freedom of expression and freedom of the press. As the Law Reform Commission and others have pointed out, we want to build up, with this legislation, a body of jurisprudence. In addition, I would like the public to be in a position to know how serious are the cases that come before the family courts. However, we do not want those courts to become places where sensational cases, albeit it in an anonymous way, are reported. These are most serious issues and usually cause great distress for the families involved.</P><Col N="1612"/>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised that the Minister did not merely reinstate the Courts Service&rsquo;s family law reporting project into the legislation. What is contained in the section is slightly different. We must ensure that people who are involved in serious research on family law will have access to the papers of the court and that this will not just be seen as a reporting situation. I do not believe that is what the Minister wants.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is entirely correct. The current section 31 is cast more widely than I had intended when I sent the Bill for drafting. Rather than delay the matter at the time, when there was pressure to proceed with the legislation, I intended to revisit it at a later stage because it is somewhat vague and could lead to concern among some people that members of the public would sit in the back of the court and watch the proceedings of their cases to gather salacious gossip. I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to deal with this issue. I would have done so on Committee Stage were it not for a technical problem caused by the non-availability of certain personnel involved in the drafting of the legislation. I intend to deal with the matter on Report Stage. To return to Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s proposal, I will provide as much notice as possible to everyone of the line I propose to take in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I should have spoken on amendment No. 40 before the Minister made his contribution. Section 31(2) only seems to permit a report of proceedings and a report of the judgment. It contains nothing which would permit the publication of the results of systematic research or those of academic studies of trends or aspects of family law cases. Research of this kind has proven extremely valuable in other fields and we need to provide for it here if we are to learn from how the family law courts work. We have received a number of submissions from various groups and institutions seeking the inclusion of this provision. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister provide a broad indication of the kind of amendment he proposes to return with on Report Stage in order that we could discuss the matter now and that our remarks on the section would be relevant?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with what has been said. The Minister indicated that he will accommodate Members. There should be a system in family law whereby cases are heard in private and where nothing said in evidence could be used to identify parents or children. On occasion, there may be certain individuals involved who would be anxious to get certain matters into the public arena because of the discord that has arisen <Col N="1613"/>between parties. However, this should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to put to the Minister &mdash; it does not relate to the Bill but rather to this specific issue &mdash; relates to the failure to provide adequate accommodation for family law hearings. In my constituency of Wexford, people are obliged to stand on the stairs of the county hall while waiting for their family law hearings. Other cases, including criminal cases, are heard at the same venue. These people&rsquo;s privacy is being invaded. The number of family law cases has obviously increased since the legislation dealing with divorce, separation, etc., was introduced. It is important that we should catch up with the needs and requirements in the area in order to ensure that they are dealt with in a fashion which, on occasion, might assist reconciliation but which would not advertise discord.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned that people do not believe that resources are involved in this area. I hope the Bill will include a provision to the effect that adequate resources will be given to the Courts Service to bring forward such evidence that is considered useful. The Courts Service must be provided with whatever funds are required.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to give Senator O&rsquo;Meara and others a sense of where I am coming from in respect of this matter. Subsection (2) states that nothing contained in a relevant enactment shall operate to prohibit the preparation and publication of a report of proceedings to which the relevant enactment relates. If that meant a law report of proceedings, it would be one thing. However, if it meant a newspaper report, it would be quite another. Likewise, in respect of the publication of the decision of the court in such proceedings, the term &ldquo;publication&rdquo; could be radically different from what one might expect.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is a system whereby responsible people can be admitted to these type of proceedings for the purpose of research in respect of them. In addition, the outcome of decisions should be capable of being put in place in order that a corpus of existing law will be available from court to court to show how family law issues are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I also have in mind the concept that independent persons from the public, approved in some way &mdash; perhaps by the Courts Service or some other mechanism &mdash; could act as observers in cases of this nature. I rarely practised family law but I have been struck by the number of people who have claimed that the <i>in camera</i> rule has permitted inconsistency of approach and worse, without any real sense that the people who felt themselves to be on the receiving end believed there is anyone to whom they can turn to say that they have been unfairly treated or whatever. It is a good idea that family law matters <Col N="1614"/>should be conducted with persons present who would have some legitimate function in terms of acting as observers in the broad public interest. I am considering moving along those lines. In other words, I wish to tighten up matters in terms of what is involved in publication and what the term &ldquo;report&rdquo; actually means, and to facilitate research and independent and responsible observers being present in court to witness what happens.</P>
    <P>I most certainly do not want a situation to arise whereby a newspaper could send someone to a family law court to watch an interesting case to see how it is proceeding. Like it or not, it would create a sense of unease and apprehension for someone, particularly a person whose life is of interest to the public at large, if the intimate details of his or her matrimonial life were examined in front of people who might afterwards use the material they obtained to come at the story from another angle. Such individuals might also approach those who could actually produce the same story without breaching the <i>in camera</i> rule. This could be frightening. If a public figure who was a subject of family law litigation turned and saw political correspondents watching his or her family law case, it would be a deeply unnerving and frightening experience. It would certainly have potential to invade the right of an individual to privacy. We must strike a balance between all the conflicting interests.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that in family law cases, fathers, in particular, claim they do not get the same sympathy as mothers. I do not know whether that is true and pass no judgment on the issue. However, it would be nice to know some research project proved or disproved that theory. I would like to have the facts rather than, as happens now, be accosted on the street and told I cannot really know what is going on.</P>
    <P>The current absurdity whereby a person cannot be brought before a professional body to be disciplined by reference to what happened in a family law case is a scandal. This means where a barrister or solicitor misbehaves or is grossly negligent, there is a huge inhibition against proving the substance of the misbehaviour. This is another area covered by the ambit of this proposal.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the legitimate interests of people going into this situation to have their privacy protected. By the same token this does not mean they go into the legal equivalent of a black hole from which no information emerges in any circumstance and nobody knows exactly whether they were treated fairly or unfairly within the process. There is a balance to be struck and the Report Stage amendments I will table will be directed towards that series of issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from what the Minister said that while he is not accepting amendment No. 40 today, he is indicating that he recognises its <Col N="1615"/>substance and will bring forward a proposal along similar lines. I thank him.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister has responded. It was important to have some discussion on the issue before he formulated his proposed amendment. What he said about the admittance of responsible people for research purposes reflects the thinking of the legal profession that not everybody should be allowed into the court to observe what is going on.</P>
    <P>Section 31(2) states clearly: &ldquo;does not contain information which would enable the parties to the proceedings or any child to which the proceedings relate to be identified.&rdquo; In other words, even if a journalist was in court during a case, he or she could not identify the parties. Is that not still part of the legislation? I see where the Minister is coming from in this regard. We all know that in a small town people know other people&rsquo;s business. Therefore, in the case of divorce proceedings or whatever, the case could be reported without the parties being identified, but in such a manner that we would all know who was involved. I presume this is the Minister&rsquo;s concern with the current framework. That is fine but we must be careful not to go too far.</P>
    <P>A major concern is that in the area of family law we do not know what is going on. Not only the legal practitioners do not know what is going on in terms of case law, but the public does not know what is going on. Justice is not seen to be done. One of the fundamental principles of justice is that it must be seen to be done. If everything operates behind closed doors, we operate purely on the basis of anecdotal evidence. One group in the community, a certain group of fathers, believe they are hard done by and are the subject of injustice. This is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The framework arrived at must meet the concerns not only of the legal profession and public figures but also those of the broader community and the corpus of law must be recorded and reported. We referred already to a register in terms of the decisions of the court in personal injuries cases. I suggest the Courts Service could take on board the publishing of the relevant legal decisions in a manner that would provide easy access to them by legal practitioners, whether on the Internet or hard copy. Perhaps that would be helpful.</P>
    <P>I also wish to comment on the issue of barring orders and domestic violence, which are also covered by the <i>in camera</i> rule. There are concerns in this area with regard to the inconsistency with which the law is implemented. At the same time children, women and families must be protected. We must be careful when legislating in this area.</P>
    <P>As a former journalist I have an interest in how this relates to journalism. We had an excellent discussion in the House previously on the issue of the Press Council. There is a code of practice for <Col N="1616"/>the reporting of family law cases in the context of the <i>in camera</i> rule. Has the Minister had any discussions with the National Union of Journalists on this matter? If not, does he think such discussions would be useful? There appears to be an opinion abroad that no journalist can be trusted with a family law case. One lawyer said to me it would be fine if a journalist was from <i>The Irish Times</i> and that journalist could be allowed into the court, but not one from the <i>Daily Star. </i>Both the Minister and I know that distinction cannot be made. However, we should not completely rule out journalistic media coverage of the area. Is it possible to arrive at a framework which it is possible to implement and which protects the privacy of the individual and of the children involved, etc, but which also meets the important principle of justice being done in public so that the broader community know what is going on in our courts?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding amendment No. 40, the national network of women&rsquo;s refuges and support services put it to me that the following type of information needs to be gathered: the age, gender, nationality, ethnicity and family status of all applicants; the age and number of children involved; the number and nature of applications made and whether previous applications exist; whether domestic violence is alleged; the nature of legal representation, if any; the existence of Garda or health board intervention; and the outcome of the application. All this information should be gathered.</P>
    <P>Also, in cases where there is domestic violence there is need to examine whether a weapon was used and if so, what type of weapon. We should also have details of breaches of orders such as barring orders. We need to know too the outcome of an application to include sanctions imposed by criminal courts. Detail is sought so we can know in exactly which areas the public is under most stress and where social services are most needed to intervene. If the Minister is prepared to consider allowing the gathering of this sort of information, the data we get will have a large application.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Meara to some extent, but I diverge strongly from her in other respects. Those who encounter family difficulties which have to be resolved through the courts are entitled to absolute privacy. Reporters or members of the public are not entitled to be present, in any circumstances, at such a hearing. The Minister has rightly identified areas that need to be addressed because of inconsistencies. There may be a need to provide for those who are doing research, for example. I advocate that the Minister should take small steps, perhaps by prescribing the categories of persons who may attend and the purposes for which they may do so. If we are to broaden it beyond that, I do not agree that we should satisfy those who argue that the family law courts should be heard in public.</P>
    <P>The privacy of the people should be the over-riding consideration. Within that, we should find a mechanism whereby the public good can be served with consistency, good decisions can be taken and any difficulties can be ironed out. I would prefer if small steps were taken now and advanced in the future, rather than major steps being taken now which might lead to many difficulties for individuals and families. If aspects of family law cases are publicised, even without individuals being named, I envisage that details which are reported will enable people in local communities to identify those involved. This will certainly be the case in rural Ireland, by which I mean everywhere outside Dublin. The need to ensure that people cannot be identified in such a way should be the over-riding consideration in any legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>We will be satisfied if the Minister deals with the matter in the way he outlined. If the changes that are made now do not completely correct the problems that exist, we can make further changes in the future. I am afraid that if we push the boat out too far, we will cause injustices to be done to those involved in family law cases, who face stressful and difficult circumstances as it stands.</P>

	<P>A great deal has been said about these amendments. Like the Minister, I want to ensure that journalists cannot report on, and perhaps identify, individuals in the family law courts. We have to protect such people at all times. Amendment No. 46 relates to the categories of persons who can report on cases. The Minister has already addressed this subject.

We hear of many people who are unhappy with the manner in which such cases are dealt with <i>in camera</i>. Perhaps we can make improvements on the basis of the information that will be secured from those who attend family law cases. Will the Minister consider making arrangements to allow representatives of support agencies, such as Women&rsquo;s Aid, the Rape Crisis Centres and women&rsquo;s refuges, to attend cases so they can support people who have come to them looking for support?</P>

	<P>If the Minister allows researchers, academics and consultants to attend family law hearings, it does not necessarily follow that the proceedings will not be reported on, in a broader sense, given that some such people write <Col N="1619"/>for newspapers. It is a difficult area and it will be very difficult to frame it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is obvious that is it a good idea to allow some type of friend to accompany those involved in family law cases to hearings. People involved in organisations such as those mentioned by Senator Terry may fulfil such a role. One might want one&rsquo;s first cousin to attend as a supporter. We will have to deal with this matter flexibly. As Senator O&rsquo;Meara said, if we make provisions by category, the worst possible person in the world might fit into a category. A person who is allowed to attend as a &ldquo;researcher&rdquo; might be researching a biography of one of the people involved in the hearing. One might not breach a person&rsquo;s privacy while sitting through a family law case involving him or her, but one could write a book afterwards that relies on the facts of the case but does not mention where they were sourced. We have to be very careful. When I return to this issue on Report Stage, I will take into account the views that have been expressed today.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important matter. I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, who comes from the west, is present. I hope he bears good news and will be sympathetic towards the cause of Mayo General Hospital as he has many friends in the county.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This issue dates back to 1994 when the people of County Mayo took to the streets to protest about the level of service being provided in Mayo General Hospital, or Castlebar County Hospital as it was then known. They did so to get additional facilities and a better service for the people of the county. In 1996, my colleague from Castlebar and current leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, and I attended a meeting with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, at which he gave us a commitment that the Castlebar hospital would be included in the multi-annual financing for the Mayo General Hospital. This has been the position since and the hospital has developed into a state-of-the-art facility in many respects.</P><?oasys [cl11.4]?>
    <P>The people of County Mayo are very disappointed that the proposed opening of an orthopaedic unit on 1 July has been abandoned. The Minister of State will be aware of the county&rsquo;s size and population and the amount of <Col N="1621"/>work carried out by Mayo General Hospital. No reason was given for this retrograde step by the health board but I believe the forthcoming second Hanly report played a part in the decision.</P>
    <P>The current position is that the orthopaedic unit is fully built and furnished. It has the largest ultra clean air operating theatre in the country and all equipment with a lead time of more than four weeks has been ordered at a cost in excess of &euro;500,000. The budget for 2003 and 2004 was &euro;3.9 million and more than &euro;10 million has been spent on the unit to date. The only reason preventing the unit from opening as scheduled on 1 July is the failure to issue contracts to 68 nurses, physiotherapists, radiographers, porters, secretaries etc. The staff concerned have already been interviewed and selected and approval was sought and received from the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board at each stage of the recruitment process. She gave permission for the process to start, advertisements to be placed, interviews to take place and then for selected candidates to be notified of their success at interview but will not now issue the contracts to the successful candidates without receiving formal approval from the Department of Health and Children. Successful candidates have already been told to give notice to their current employers, a consultant surgeon has been employed and two full surgical teams are under contract to start work from 1 July and are, therefore, being paid.</P>
    <P>The credibility of Mayo General Hospital and the Western Health Board is at stake. What credibility does the board have when it appoints, and in some cases pays, surgical teams for a unit that is not yet operating? The consultant appointed has been paid from January this year, yet we are told the proposed opening has been shelved.</P>
    <P>It is even more of an outrage that people seeking orthopaedic services in Mayo General Hospital are being told they will be placed on a waiting list for treatment in Galway. This is a lie as they are not being placed on a list and will never be called to Galway. If the people of Mayo lose the orthopaedic unit in their general hospital, they will never get it back because no consultant will have the confidence to take a post in the county under the Western Health Board. The complicated procedure of recruiting 68 staff from all professions has also been completed. Where does this leave the orthopaedic unit in the Mayo General Hospital?</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed. The people took to the streets in 1994 and I have no doubt they will do so again on this serious issue. It is a scandal that people are being told lies by the Western Health Board and an outrageous waste of money to build a state-of-the-art facility, employ people to work in it and then shelve the project.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will have good news for me. I am disappointed and believe the <Col N="1622"/>people of the county will share my disappointment that the Minister for Health and Children, who is canvassing in Castlebar, will not visit the orthopaedic unit at Mayo General Hospital.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health and Children is out of the country. Rapid transport could get him to Castlebar but I do not believe that is the case.</P>
    <P>On his behalf, I am glad of the opportunity afforded by the Senator to discuss Mayo General Hospital. I refer initially to the unprecedented investment in services at the hospital over the past number of years. The Government has invested heavily in the infrastructure at the hospital. The second phase of a major development programme at the hospital began in 1998. The investment in this development which was completed within the last year was &euro;50 million. This provided the necessary facilities for the development of orthopaedic services at the hospital, including ward accommodation and a state-of-the-art orthopaedic operating theatre to carry out surgery. This development also included a new accident and emergency department, a medical assessment unit, a geriatric assessment unit, an obstetric and delivery suite, CT scanning facilities, a new helicopter landing facility, an improved mortuary and post mortem room, a new information technology system and a new administration and medical records department.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Government&rsquo;s record in developing hospital services for the people of Mayo. Annual funding for Mayo General Hospital is more than &euro;50 million. The Government has increased expenditure at the hospital by &euro;30 million since 1997. The hospital employs approximately 830 whole time equivalent staff. This represents an increase in staffing levels at the hospital of more than 300 whole time equivalent staff in the past seven years. The extra staff provide additional and improved hospital services to the people of Mayo.</P>
    <P>Activity at the hospital has increased year on year. The hospital&rsquo;s in-patient and day case activity for 2003 was more than 22,000 patients. By comparison to its activity in 1997, the hospital has increased its in-patient activity by more than 3,000 people and has almost trebled the number of patients it treats as day cases. A total of 27,000 people attended its casualty department in 2003. The hospital&rsquo;s out-patient department treats more than 33,000 people per annum. There has been an increase in the number of beds at the hospital over the past number of years. The number of beds at the hospital when the orthopaedic service opens will be more than 300.</P>
    <P>The new 33 bed orthopaedic unit will be a particularly valuable addition to the hospital and of great benefit to the people of County Mayo. Funding of &euro;3.9 million has been provided to the <Col N="1623"/>Western Health Board for the opening of the new orthopaedic service at Mayo General Hospital. One consultant orthopaedic surgeon has been recruited by the health board and that person took up duty on 1 February 2004. The health board has informed the Minister that discussions between the orthopaedic staff in Galway and Mayo are continuing in an effort to configure the best use of the facilities at Galway and Mayo. These discussions are taking place within a framework to develop an overall integrated strategic and operational policy for orthopaedic services in the region.</P>
    <P>Substantial funding has been provided to commission orthopaedic services at Mayo. The health board is in discussion with the Department about commencing orthopaedic services at Mayo General Hospital, particularly in regard to the effect the additional staffing required to commence services will have on the board&rsquo;s current employment ceiling. The Minister is committed to ensuring the new orthopaedic services are established at Mayo General at the earliest possible date.</P><Col N="1624"/>
    <P>The Minister established the acute hospitals review group, which has been described informally by some as &ldquo;Hanly II&rdquo;, in January last and has asked the group to develop a national hospitals plan taking account of the Hanly report, published last October, including spatial and geographic considerations. The Minister believes the group has an extremely important task to perform in mapping out the future role and function of acute hospitals throughout the country. Unfortunately, the group has not been able to meet and formally commence its work because of continuing industrial action by the Irish Hospital Consultants&rsquo; Association. The industrial action includes non-participation in work relating to the Hanly report. The Minister has repeatedly asked the IHCA to suspend its action but it has not responded positively to date.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the full commissioning of the orthopaedic service at Mayo General Hospital is not being delayed pending the report of the acute hospital review group, Hanly II.</P>
