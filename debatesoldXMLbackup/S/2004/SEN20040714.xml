   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call the Leader, as this is our last sitting day before the summer recess I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the panel of temporary chairpersons who helped out, the leaders, the Whips, all members of the groups, the staff of my office and the House and the media for their co-operation during the year. I wish all those I have mentioned an enjoyable break.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Cathaoirleach the same.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s comments. I wish everybody a happy break. We could all do with a break to spend time with our families, extended families and friends. I am sure we will all have a nice time. I hope the weather picks up.</P>

 <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business will be No. 1, State Airports Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages. Committee Stage will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1 p.m. Report and Final Stages will be taken between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. There will be a sos between 1 p.m. and the 3 p.m. The purpose of the longer sos is to allow Report Stage amendments to be prepared, following on from Committee Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Cathaoirleach in wishing all Members of the House an enjoyable summer break. We will have a break during August only, as most committees will meet in July. On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I wish the Cathaoirleach, his staff, the Clerk of the Seanad and her staff, all Members of the House, the Leader of the House, the various group leaders <Col N="1274"/>and the Whips an enjoyable summer period. It has been a long session, with many elections in the middle of it. People have worked hard, particularly in recent weeks when we have had to consider many Bills late in the session. Special thanks are due to the Clerk of the Seanad and the Seanad office for the extended work they have done in recent weeks. I thank the Captain of the Guard, the Superintendent and the ushers for their help during the session. As we move into the summer period, it is worth saying that it is good that the House has met this week.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The more often we can meet without the D&aacute;il on our back, the better. I suggest that we should not meet when the D&aacute;il meets in the interests of having the work of the Seanad get a fair airing in the media. I wish the Leader every success over the summer period, particularly as a reshuffle is coming up.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator joking?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what job she will get. There is a vacancy as an EU Commissioner. As the House will not have a chance to meet before nominations are made for the presidential election, I wish all prospective contenders on both sides of the House every success in putting their names forward.</P>
    <P>When the summer comes, it is inevitable that Deputy Cassidy will produce his annual report on insurance. I wonder if the Leader will organise a debate on insurance when the House sits again in the autumn.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have him here.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not be bold enough to suggest that. A debate on insurance would be worthwhile. A well-informed leak from the committee &mdash; I wonder where it came from &mdash; has suggested the Government&rsquo;s opposition to the introduction of a traffic corps on the national highways and byways should be reversed. I would welcome such a move. We should have a full debate in the autumn on the report, which was leaked to the <i>Irish Independent</i> today. We seem to get this report or a variation of it every summer &mdash; long may it be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party group, I wish the Cathaoirleach, the staff of the House, the leaders and Members from other parties an enjoyable break from the plenary sessions of the House. It is obvious that committees will be meeting in the next few weeks. Given the level of productivity and co-operation that has marked this Seanad, we can be proud of our work and achievements, particularly in recent months.</P><Col N="1275"/>
    <P>I believe the new President of the European Commission has asked the governments of member states to nominate women to the new Commission. He should not have to look much further than this House for somebody who has huge experience, particularly in the transport area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator applying?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to wish the Leader of the House every luck in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>One never knows. The Leader, who is very experienced and highly regarded, would make a popular choice.</P>
    <P>In view of reports this morning that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is unlikely to loosen the purse strings in the Department of Health and Children, perhaps the beleaguered Minister of that Department, Deputy Martin, should set up a meeting with Mr. J.P. McManus in a final attempt to open some of the unused medical facilities around the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others who have thanked the Cathaoirleach for the way he has conducted proceedings during the session and I include the Leas-Chathaoirleach in those thanks for his fair and balanced conduct of the House and his defence of Members whenever such was required. I congratulate the Clerk and the staff of the Seanad office who work very hard and whose work is generally unrecognised. It is only when one is in Opposition that their work on amendments and so on is appreciated. I have observed before that the burden on the Clerk is increasing all the time with additional responsibilities, including those relating to the Referendum Commission, and this must be reviewed soon. I join with Senator Hayes in thanking the staff of the Houses, including the ushers and others who have looked after us so well. I also thank the press, particularly Mr. Jimmy Walsh for his coverage in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter that surfaced yesterday, namely, the findings of the European Commission on the environmental record of this country and that certain cases are being taken at the European Court of Justice. I noted the response of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, yesterday afternoon. As a regular visitor to County Mayo, I have observed that overgrazing is a serious issue and there has been significant environmental degradation of the hills of that county. It is a welcome development that this degradation is being reduced but one must <Col N="1276"/>observe that the problem is a consequence of the imperative imposed by EU policy to overgraze. Payment was made on a headage basis so more sheep on the hills meant more money. The EU needs to look to its own record as the genesis of much of the environmental damage that was caused in the west of Ireland, which is not to say there were not also culpable individuals.</P>
    <P>During the discussion of water safety in this House last week, I raised the matter of the implications of jet ski usage. There is an environmental aspect to this, particularly in the case of the shallow lakes of the midlands where I believe serious damage is being done to some of the aquatic life. I would like the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss these issues in this House in the autumn and to indicate the Government&rsquo;s plan and its future strategy on these issues and on illegal dumping.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the tributes of the previous speakers to the Cathaoirleach. His sense of tolerance towards all Members during the last session, particularly during the Order of Business, was greatly appreciated. Those of us who have been Members of the other House can recognise and respect the difference here in that there are not the same impediments to raising issues of importance. Yesterday proved to me the benefit of the Seanad. I observed the debate on the State Airports Bill 2004 in the D&aacute;il but found the contributions from Senators yesterday an enriching experience in terms not only of the knowledge of the legislation that was displayed but also the wider knowledge of all the pros and cons of the matter. Members&rsquo; concerns were clearly expressed and are represented in the Committee Stage amendments which will be debated today for the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s consideration. This demonstrates the depth of debate that takes place in this House and we should recognise the quality of that debate and the good attendance, indicative of the tremendous interest in this and other legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business whereby No. 18, motion No. 18, which relates to undocumented Irish workers in the United States, would be taken without debate by agreement of the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Leyden&rsquo;s motion, which is a useful one and it is appropriate to take it today when there is only one item on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the good wishes to the Cathaoirleach, staff and Members of the House for an enjoyable summer holiday, irrespective of where they holiday. There will always be a welcome for all Senators in beauty&rsquo;s home.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1277"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Senator Coghlan and me?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators could go to Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s favourite hotel.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader be able to secure a hotel? I did not get an answer on that point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The honeymoon suite is always there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Hayes in his call for an early debate after the summer recess on insurance and I too read with interest the leak of the report this morning. We have a meeting today to discuss the matter and the report will be officially launched on Friday.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, I hope that during the summer recess the Minister for Finance might provide significant increases in the income threshold limits for medical card eligibility. He has been urged to so by the Minister for Health and Children with whom he will shortly have a meeting on the matter. Medical practitioners throughout the country and the Irish Medical Organisation believe strongly that too many people are on the margins and are not properly benefiting from the health system. As politicians, we are aware of how many people have lost their medical cards. I make this plea which I hope will be a unanimous one from the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Virtually every week one reads of another person who has gone missing and the list seems to be growing all the time. They are often either people of a tender age or elderly people and it must be difficult for families not knowing whether their loved ones are alive or dead. I raised this matter in the House approximately three years ago and at that time the Government provided money in the budget for the establishment of a service that would enable communities to be involved in discovering information about missing people. This should be formalised into a missing persons bureau because when one considers some of the more high-profile cases, it seems quite certain that the people involved are in serious trouble or perhaps worse. If we are not proactive in this matter, we will continue to see posters at railway stations and bus stops seeking information on missing persons. Something of a superficial nature will not work because we are dealing almost with an epidemic.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the Oireachtas committees might devote some time to this issue in the autumn session and invite some witnesses to speak about it. A focused approach is required if we are to arrive at a solution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated to Senator Leyden that the Fianna Gael party would be supportive of the motion he wishes to proposes and I wish <Col N="1278"/>to put that support on the record. The plight of undocumented Irish workers in the United States is a timely issue which has been debated in this House on numerous occasions. We must once more, as on so many occasions in the past, call on the United States authorities to look favourably on our requests. Previous programmes such as the Morrisson and Donnelly visa programmes were of tremendous assistance to people in this country and a similar type of scheme is warranted once again. I want to record our support for the motion submitted by Senator Leyden, which I hope will be accepted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator say he would welcome a debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>No. I welcome the motion and if it is formally moved we will support it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of the House have supported the view I have expressed on a number of occasions about the creation of an all-island football team as a means of drawing both sides of the island closer together. In light of the events of last weekend, there is no more unifying force than soccer or, as it is called internationally, the beautiful game. Gaelic football is a unifying force in the island but there are sectarian elements to the support of soccer in the North which, thankfully, is absent in the South. In light of that I am sure the Leader will agree that the initiative by the Football Association of Ireland last weekend to propose an all-island competition involving clubs from the League of Ireland and the Irish League is yet a further indication of the need for closer bonding and reconciliation between both sides of the island in a sporting sense. I hope the House would welcome this initiative and support it in any way possible as it is only a proposal and has not yet received any response from the northern authorities, the Irish Football Association. Perhaps the Leader might urge the Minister, in whatever capacity he has in this area, to encourage closer relationships between both sides. This is not a threat to either jurisdiction. It is merely a means of eliminating what is the last bastion of sectarianism in sport in this island, an example of which was the infamous 1994 match in Belfast, which Members will remember, and last week&rsquo;s incidents.</P>
    <P>I am sure you will agree with me, a Chathaoirligh, that the wonderfully generous gesture of a Limerick native in contributing to the Limerick county board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in thanking everyone for their assistance in the past year and wish everyone success in the summer period, particularly in regard to all the renovations taking <Col N="1279"/>place in the Houses which I hope will be to the benefit of everyone working here.</P><?oasys [cl11]?>
    <P>I was startled to read a newspaper report yesterday which proves that more people are using cars to get to work and to travel. Some years ago the figure was one third of the population but now it is over a half. Fewer people are walking and cycling to work and we should have a debate on that in the autumn.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Metro.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot continue to build roads. Lately, an extra lane was added to the Naas dual carriageway and there is no doubt that in a few years another lane will be needed. One wonders where we can go in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Underground.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to debate that issue. We need a metro and new rail systems. It is worth noting that 100 years ago we had nearly 3,000 miles of railway line; we now have only 1,000. Perhaps we should go back in history to learn lessons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, wished everybody a happy holiday. I take that as generic for everyone because it would be difficult to keep saying it. He called for a debate on what he called the leaked insurance report as soon as the Seanad returns after the summer recess. Such a debate would be interesting and useful.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara raised the question of nominating women to the new Commission. I am aware the European Commission has sought that; we can see the results of such nominations in this House. The Commission wants more female participation at all levels within the EU and that is to be welcomed. She also asked about the Minister for Health and Children setting up a meeting with Mr. J.P. McManus. The Minister will make his own strong case in that regard. Senator O&rsquo;Meara also extended best wishes to everybody.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis also extended his good wishes. He also raised the matter we discussed last week, namely, the environmental directive which is topical because we are being taken to court of it. At an early period, however, the EU encouraged overgrazing for sheep. In some instances it is the reaping of that which has now led to the need for this directive. That issue, and illegal dumping, should be raised.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Finucane, as did Senator Hayes and others, on the importance of the Seanad. We cannot set ourselves up as a Chamber that only sits when the D&aacute;il does not sit; that might be a little odd.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be much more useful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We highlighted that we are a Chamber of debating skills and that there is a <Col N="1280"/>purpose to the Seanad. The more journalists we encourage to come to this House, the better it would be. I agree with Senator Finucane that it was a very useful exercise even though Members on all sides were complaining last week about having to come back this week. However, the exercise was well worth it. It is working out well and we will see where it all ends.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden raised a point about No. 18, motion 18, on which, judging by the comments from the floor, he has all-party backing. If you are agreeable, a Chathaoirligh, the motion can be taken without debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Are you accepting the amendment?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am accepting the amendment and propose that the motion be taken without debate on an all-party basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>At the conclusion of the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>After the Order of Business. Senator Leyden&rsquo;s motion was seconded by Senator Norris.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the income threshold limits for medical card eligibility. I will talk to the Senator later about our little holiday.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the question of a missing persons bureau, which he felt should be set up in a formal structure and that an Oireachtas committee might debate it in the autumn. That would be very useful. I do not know if he is talking about a particular case but we could have a word about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford also agreed with taking the motion No. 18 without debate.</P>
    <P>I picked up on the point raised by Senator Mooney and I thought it was the epitomisation of what he raised here a week ago. I will draft a letter to the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism encouraging him to be vocal in his approval of an all-island soccer league or whatever they want to call it, which would be very useful.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the generous Limerick man. We could all do with such a patron.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Browne said that 50% of the population drive to work and very few people walk to work. I walked here this morning but that was more a matter of clearing my head. It is very useful to do so and perhaps we should have a debate on that issue. He also pointed out the miles of rail 100 years ago <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the current position.</P><?oasys [cl11.5]?>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your forbearance and the good business relationship you and I enjoy. In particular I thank the Senators on all sides of the House. This Chamber has been very productive and useful.</P>
     <P>In regard to the staff who service this Chamber, when we go into the office they make us very welcome in a free and easy way. They work flat out, particularly when there are many amend<Col N="1281"/>ments, reports and so on to be dealt with. We are very conscious of the work record of the staff in this House and as Senator Dardis recorded, the Clerk undertakes many duties, and that has a fall-back effect on the rest of the staff and the workings of the House. That is something of which we all must be conscious. I wish everybody a happy holiday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden moved an amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That No. 18, motion 18, be taken today.&rdquo; The Leader has indicated she is prepared to accept the amendment before we take No. 1. Is that agreed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As the seconder of the motion I believe there should be a debate because we should have the opportunity to support it. In the context of the mean-minded attitude we took as <Col N="1282"/>an Irish people in the recent referendum we want to keep other people out and be as restrictive as possible, and at the same time we want special provisions for our own people.</P>

  <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P><Col N="1283"/>
    <P LI="2">1.&mdash;(1) This Act shall come into operation on such day or dates as may be prescribed by the Minister.</P>
    <P LI="2">(2) Prior to the commencement of any provision of this Act the Minister shall prepare a detailed statement setting out the business case for the commencement of the relevant provision and such statement shall be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This first amendment is, in essence, the most important in that it seeks to defer the implementation of the Act until such time as business plans have been prepared and submitted. This has been the core of the discussion in this House yesterday and previously in the other House. It seems to be a chicken and egg argument.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, and on Committee Stage in the other House, the Minister made much of the fact that a number of different plans exist. He sought to have us believe these constitute a business plan for the purpose of the break-up of Aer Rianta and the setting up of three independent companies. It is important that we tease that out. We on this side of the House contend that there is no business plan for what is proposed. Nobody, be they consultants or the existing board, was asked to produce a business plan for each of three independent companies, particularly not for the two new companies at Cork and Shannon.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to point to the overall fiduciary responsibilities of State-owned plcs to look after the corporate interests of the company or that every State company looks ahead at all times and produces a ten-year or 20-year plan or a plan for the new millennium or whatever. That is not what this is about. What this is about is whether there exists, or whether there should exist before the break-up, a plan that identifies the risks and down sides and the opportunities and challenges which will immediately impact on the new companies in the two, three or five years immediately following their establishment on the break-up of the existing company. That is the critical question.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that there are specific issues relating to financial viability, which we will discuss in the context of later amendments, which affect some of the new companies. Examples are the lease of the Cork Airport from Aer Rianta or from the Dublin Airport authority, the SFADCo owned property in Shannon, and so on. Obviously it is right that they be taken into account. They are critical to the financial viability of the new companies. I am not aware, other than from the PwC report which I will come to in a moment, that these issues have been taken into account, definitively decided, and now form part of a business plan.</P><Col N="1284"/>
    <P>As I said yesterday on Second Stage, none of us doubt that it is possible to put together a business plan. It is possible, through all manner of wishful thinking, to say that various opportunities may arise and that there are possible downsides. What we are concerned about is the critical nature of that. We are concerned about what would happen if, having examined this seriously, the consultants or the boards conclude that the business end does not stack up and that there are far greater risks of non-viability than there are opportunities. To put it in more concise terms, what will happen if the consultants or the board decide that Shannon Airport will not be viable in three or five years&rsquo; time and requires some measure of cross-subsidy or, alternatively, requires to remain part of the group so as to ensure its continuing financial viability? There is no mechanism in this Bill at the moment that allows for a reversal. This amendment would in effect allow for an out by postponing the taking of the essential measures until such time as the business plans have been put in place.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I stated that this decision was initially taken as a public policy decision, not strictly as a business decision. I would not expect the existing board, which has run a monopoly and has left Shannon and Cork with 10% of the business, to come forward with a business plan under which both Cork and Shannon could operate independently. If it did, it would negate its position to date. However, there has been investment of &euro;60 million and &euro;70 million in Cork and Shannon in the past five to seven years and they are going into the future debt-free and with autonomous local management. If, in those circumstance, local management cannot now bring forward a successful business plan to ensure their success, I would agree that a case could be made against them. Those airports should not be there if they require a subsidy. I am very much against this amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. It might be better to speak in terms of a blueprint or terms of reference for drawing up a plan rather than in terms of a business plan. When this Government took office it drew up a five-year plan. While the Minister made some valid points last night about our not getting too bogged down about business plans, the boards must have some idea of where they are going. People in business know what they are at every day. This House agrees its Order of Business every day when Senators are informed of the items due for discussion and the timeframes allowed for each debate. Fine Gael will be supporting the Labour Party amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The considerable emphasis on the business plan is a red herring. There is a great difference between a business plan and a risk <Col N="1285"/>evaluation. They are not the same. The Minister was correct when he said yesterday and again on radio this morning that it is up to the boards to produce business plans. Nobody can impose business plans on boards about to come into operation. The legislation provides for publicly owned autonomous companies, guaranteed by Government, to compete aggressively and secure business for their regions and to thrive and prosper. I am sure the boards will fulfil that task diligently.</P>
    <P>The continuing inference that we are somehow stumbling in the dark into the future must be rejected. That is not the case. As the Minister outlined yesterday, Aer Rianta already operates to a business plan. The template for this already exists. It is definitely a matter for the boards to decide their future. We cannot impose business plans on them. They will do the job effectively.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was approached in 1979 and asked if I would become chairman of an interim board for An Post. Some ten people were asked to become members of the board. I do not believe we would have accepted a place on an interim board which already had in place a business plan in terms of what was to be done and how it was to be done. If this plan is to work, in particular for Shannon and Cork, ownership must rest with the boards. I do not understand the logic of suggesting we provide a business plan which we then hand over to a board to put into operation.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of boards to draw up business plans. I support the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion that the business plan be owned by the boards to be established. However, I disagree with the Minister about the structure being used. I want Cork and Shannon Airports to have separate boards but I believe they would benefit from operating under the umbrella of Dublin Airport. However, that is a separate issue. The boards must have ownership of their accounts and plans. I do not believe such boards would accept responsibility for merely putting in place what Aer Rianta or the Minister has already decided.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got it right in this case. The business plan is, as Senator Dardis stated, not the same as a risk evaluation. If Shannon and Cork Airports are to work, then ownership must lie with the individual boards. I would have difficulty supporting this amendment as I believe the Minister is correct on this one.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 seeks to delay commencement of the Bill and the establishment of the boards for the three airports. I would have a difficulty accepting the amendment as it would affect policy. Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 would have the effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a correction to the groupings as circulated. I have been informed that amendment No. 1 is to be taken on its own <Col N="1286"/>and amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, will be taken together. We are dealing with amendment No. 1 only at this point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have difficulty accepting the amendment as this provision is a fundamental part of the legislation. Senator Quinn put the case well. Responsibility for preparation of the business plans must rest with those required to carry out the job.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to hear a great deal more than that from the Minister. The Labour Party is not concerned about whether the plans are called business plans, strategic directions or risk evaluations. We are concerned about whether the Minister knows what it is he is asking Cork and Shannon Airports to do. I would like an idea of what it is the Minister believes will be the brief given to, for example, Shannon Airport authority. Will it be told to operate the airport as a low cost hub or to maintain current business and shed jobs to reduce the cost base? Will it be told to work on the assumption that the transatlantic stopover will cease? I assume the Minister has or will give some sort of strategic direction to the board. If we knew that, we might be a little less concerned about the business plan.</P>
    <P>What we want, and what this House is entitled to from the Minister, is a sense that he knows what he is doing in terms of giving to the boards of Shannon and Cork a clear instruction regarding the drawing up of the business plans. I assume that is what will happen because we will not amend the Bill. The boards must know what is expected when drawing up the business plans. I want to feel confident that the business plans will look credible in a year&rsquo;s time and I am not confident about that at the moment. Looking dispassionately at Shannon Airport, as the consultants have, it is easy to make the case that the company could be insolvent in two or three years time. That is from where most of the concern expressed by the workforce and Members of the Oireachtas comes. We are looking at the <i>status quo</i>. If the Minister is saying, as he stated vigorously in his response yesterday, that he will give the boards their own wings to compete in the marketplace then we must have a sense that he has in mind a strategy which he may have already transmitted to the boards designate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn summed up how this matter will be dealt with. It is important the boards designate take control of Shannon and Cork on the appointed day. However, in the intervening period they are the ones who have to take ownership of the development of the airports going forward. I believe they are uniquely qualified to do so.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that we must move from Government management of airports. The amendment states that matters relating to the air<Col N="1287"/>ports should be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval. That would be wholly unnecessary. I am unable to think of any other State agency that would require such a decision. The legislation provides safeguards in terms of requiring further clarification from the Minister for Finance in conjunction with the Minister for Transport to ensure whatever plans are drawn up are sustainable and viable. The Minister spoke about that issue at length yesterday.</P>
    <P>I am on record as saying I do not agree with the mechanism being put in place. However, I do not support the amendment. Senator Quinn has more than adequately dealt with the matter. The legislation provides safeguards to ensure the business plans have the capacity to deliver two viable airports at Shannon and Cork. The calibre of those appointed by the Minister to the boards should be sufficient to provide for the continued growth of the airports.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulty which the Opposition has is that it is working in the dark. There have been reports of leaks and references to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, yet we have not seen it in full. The Minister has not released to us any available documentation. The question I would pose &mdash; I am sure it is a question which would keep Senator Dooley awake at night &mdash; concerns what happens if Dublin Airport authority decides Aer Rianta International, currently based in Shannon, should be based in Dublin. How will Senator Dooley feel if the Dublin Airport authority business plan recommends that that facility be located in Dublin? I am sure he would like an input into the plan then. They are the type of issues likely to arise.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, no terms of reference have been drawn up for the boards. While each board will draw up its own business plan there is a danger they will overlap and try to take assets from each other. What will happen in that scenario?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Senator McDowell, there will be a memo and articles of association. This will lay out the purpose, objectives and aims of the plc, which will be Shannon, Cork and Dublin. This is the normal aims and objectives aspect of any company.</P>
    <P>On the business strategy, the board will have to devise this itself. They are aware in Shannon that the EU-USA open skies policy talks are a backdrop. They are aware there must be some agreement with Aer Lingus so that it will continue to service Shannon Airport, which is my wish. They are aware that section 8 of the Bill requires them to negotiate with Dublin and Cork on other issues in the interim. The people who have agreed to serve on the Shannon board are acutely aware of these business issues. These <Col N="1288"/>issues exist regardless of the policy; they will not go away. If I were never standing here with this policy, these issues would exist. The question has always been who is best equipped to tackle them. I have made it clear that I believe this approach is the best way to tackle the issues.</P>
    <P>I am not denying there are serious issues in regard to all airports, particularly Shannon, but these can be tackled. We can work out something on the US-EU stopover aspect. I am determined to get a good deal which will give Shannon some comfort, while allowing Aer Lingus to expand to new routes and new destinations. I am confident that, in discussing the future of Aer Lingus, we can build into it an understanding that whatever direction the ownership of Aer Lingus takes in future, Shannon will be taken into account in any arrangement arrived at. It would be a good time to make such an arrangement. We can build these aspects into whatever final settlements are made on a whole range of issues.</P>
    <P>I will ask the board to address each of these issues, particularly the issue of growing passenger numbers. The chairman reckons he can reach 4 million from the current 2 million, and the board will have to work out a strategy to attract these extra passengers to the airport. The board must also address how to negotiate and work with Government on the USA-EU talks and Aer Lingus&rsquo;s involvement in Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne asked what would happen with Aer Rianta International and so on. I have no doubt the three boards will be very practical. They will have to talk to each other about adhering to company law, which they are required to abide by and which delays the distribution of assets because of the insufficiency of reserves at the moment. Shannon Airport built ARI. I said on many occasions it is my wish that, consistent with company law, trying to deal with dividend issues and the restrictions involved, ARI is a Shannon product and should remain as such. The boards can work out between themselves whatever is possible within that statement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>If, for example, the individual airport boards have an area of conflict, which is quite possible, will the final arbiter be the Government or the Minister? Who will adjudicate in this instance?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 8 makes it clear that the boards shall discuss between them what Shannon and Cork shall do on behalf of Dublin in the interim period, pending the 30 April deadline. I do not envisage a serious issue arising which would cause the kind of difficulty to which the Senator referred. The legislation makes clear who owns what until 30 April, when another trigger may arise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the continued utterances from the Minister in regard to the element <Col N="1289"/>of the company known as ARI, to which Senator Browne referred. It is a Shannon venture. It began and was developed in Shannon by people who have long since departed from Shannon. It was their idealism, ingenuity and entrepreneurship which developed this company. It would be great to see it in Shannon, notwithstanding company law issues.</P>
    <P>It is clear in the legislation that where there is a disagreement between the boards, there is a capacity for the Minister to get involved and ensure the restructuring takes place in line with Government policy. If there is an issue in respect of ARI, I hope the Minister will be prepared to ensure his wishes are carried out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a note of Senator Dooley&rsquo;s penultimate contribution when he said he would be opposed to Government management of the company. He appears to have changed his mind and is now saying that if Aer Rianta were inclined to give ARI to anyone other than Shannon, the Minister would intervene immediately to ensure it would not happen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will be aware that there is a difference between micro and macro management.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course there is, but one man&rsquo;s micro is the other man&rsquo;s macro. It is a crucial issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a science.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will resist the temptation to score a point on that and want to make the point to illustrate a dilemma. Who makes the decisions, or are the decisions, in effect, already made? Senator Browne asked under what company ARI would come. There are other decisions regarding SFADCo properties in Shannon.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to take an aggressive approach because I appreciate the Bill will be passed. I am seeking to give the Minister an opportunity to put out information and to give us a sense of his strategic concept of how the policy will progress. I appreciate we will not get the Bill amended and there is no point in codding ourselves that anything other than that is the case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister pointed out this morning, that is a matter for the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that it were. I want to get a sense of a few of these strategic issues which are, in effect, decisions of the Minister &mdash; he may have already made them. The first relates to ARI. He was being disingenuous when he said it was a matter for the boards. Ultimately, it is a matter for him. The Bill gives clear power to the Minister to make decisions of that kind and to give a direc<Col N="1290"/>tion to the board. Is he indicating that he sees ARI as being within the Shannon company?</P>
    <P>Second, I would like clarity on the issue of SFADCo, and the property owned by SFADCo in Shannon. Is it the Minister&rsquo;s view that it will be transferred to the Shannon company, because the rental income that would derive from it is crucial in terms of the viability of the Shannon company in the future? Third, what is his view on the lease of Cork Airport? Does he envisage at this stage that the lease of Cork Airport will be a lease from the Dublin Airport authority to the Cork Airport authority?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot say much more on the ARI issue. My preference has always been to acknowledge that the ARI headquarters should be in Shannon, which was the driving force behind the ARI success. I have expressed time and time again my wish that this is where it should remain. As a result of company law regulations, which are copperfastened by EU regulations &mdash; the Senator will be aware of this aspect having spent a long time as finance spokesperson in the D&aacute;il &mdash; sharing out assets as dividends is forbidden unless there is a certain level of reserves to cover them. Aer Rianta International must remain in the ownership of the Dublin Airport authority because it is an asset that cannot be shared out as dividends until the reserves are at a sufficient level. The issue is complicated by that fact. I will be asking the boards to consider this urgently and to take into account my view that Shannon is where it should naturally fit. However, the law is the law and the boards must see how they can work that out. There are also other assets &mdash; the Great Southern Hotel Group and other subsidiaries hold assets internationally as well as nationally.</P>
    <P>The retail aspect of Aer Rianta International is also important, as well as its international ownership of airports and so on. It has been pointed out many times, although it has nothing to do with this legislation, that the borrowing level of Aer Rianta is extraordinarily high. It is quite likely that any board will need to consider reducing borrowing. I am sure the current board has considered this. It will also need to secure funds for future development. I would be surprised if the board did not consider realising some assets to try to cut the debt. I emphasise that the company will need to do that whether it is one company or three.</P>
    <P>Ownership of assets abroad has grown quite dramatically, representing hundreds of millions of euro in terms of capital gains. The issue for the board to consider now is whether it would make any sense to take the capital gains and re-invest them in our own airports. However, these are business decisions and I do not plan to lay any political decision-making on top of that.</P><Col N="1291"/>
    <P>Regarding SFADCo, I stated yesterday that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, is still in discussion with SFADCo and other interests in the region about how to proceed. Senators are aware that Enterprise Ireland is moving to Shannon. I am also aware of SFADCo&rsquo;s great work in the region. There may be a number of options the T&aacute;naiste and SFADCo can consider. Again, matters are complicated by the fact that large parts of the land on which the properties involved are built are in the ownership of the Department of Transport, in the form of the airport authority. There is an issue about the ownership of the land and any rental income therefrom. SFADCo has done a good job for the country and I hope discussions with the T&aacute;naiste come to a successful conclusion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister see the potential rental income as being vital to the viability of the airport?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The viability of the airport depends first on airport activity. It needs to attract airlines and passengers and raise the numbers from 2 million to 4 million. That is ultimately how the airport will remain viable. These other issues are business issues that support the balance sheet. I would not like to say that any one element is vital because the core requirement is to expand the business of being an airport. I am sure the board of Shannon would welcome the income, as would any board.</P>
    <P>The matter of the lease in Cork is a direct result of the company law situation. The board of Aer Rianta decided to invest in a new terminal in Cork Airport, which was much needed. I supported that decision, which was the right decision to make. It is a major investment &mdash; more than &euro;140 million &mdash; but the terminal will be of service for many years to come. The chairman designate of the Cork Airport authority has been in discussions with Aer Rianta and it is proposed that an affordable lease arrangement will be worked out. It will not be a lease in the ordinary commercial market sense, in terms of what one would usually lease a &euro;140 million building for, but a contribution by way of lease of what the airport can afford to pay towards the Dublin authority which, in effect, provided the terminal building. Due to the revenue reserve situation, Aer Rianta could not give away &euro;120 million worth of assets to Cork just like that. It would not be permitted under company law. This is a compromise which allows the Cork authority effective day-to-day control of the airport and provides some income for Dublin by way of lease payments. It is a fair compromise.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1292"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise with the Minister the issue of rates on the properties now that the three airports will be State airports.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We are moving away from the subject matter of the amendment, but I will allow the Senator to continue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>This will have a bearing on the preparation of the plans. As the Minister is aware, Aer Rianta currently pays substantial amounts of money through the county council for all the rates on Shannon Airport properties. In view of the fact that Shannon will now be a State airport and that most of the lands are in the ownership of the Department, will it now be exempt from rates, as it was before the new arrangements were introduced? What effect will that have on the preparation of plans? Can the new board of Shannon Airport say that it will not have to pay a couple of million euro in property rates to Clare County Council because it will be a State airport? I wish to clarify this because there is a substantial amount of money involved which represents a major source of revenue for the county council. There is some concern in Shannon that the airport will be faced with a considerable bill unless it reverts to its original position. The Minister may not be in a position to deal with this now but perhaps he will explain the position at some stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 1998 Act brought in rates for Aer Rianta, which has paid rates on all three State airports since that time. There is nothing in the Bill that changes that in any way. The question of rates on State properties is something in which the Minister for Finance takes a keen interest. It is a Government issue. It is a matter of rates policies generally and covers much more than just airports. This provision has been in place since 1998 so unless there is a change in that policy, the individual authorities will presumably be required to pay rates to their local authorities, as they have done since 1998.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is amendment No. 1 being pressed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Over the past few days I have read the Farrell Grant Sparks and Mazars report, which reviews the PwC report with which the Minister is more than familiar. It is damning in that it points out clearly that there is no existing business plan and states that it is highly unusual for a restructuring decision to be contemplated or finalised without outline business cases being made. Perhaps the word &ldquo;outline&rdquo; is critical. I am not sure we have heard anything from the Minister this morning which indicates that he has a firm notion about the outline. In that context I will be pressing the amendment.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P><?oasys [cl11.5]?>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 3 provides for the Minister for Transport to bear the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act with the consent of the Minister for Finance. What is the distinction between the costs of the restructuring, which is dealt with by a separate section, and the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act?</P>
   </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 3 is intended to cover administrative funds and not large restructuring funds. It enables the Minister for Transport to have expenses incurred in the administration of the Act paid out of public funds subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance. These may be incurred in establishing the boards, administrative expenses like fees for establishing companies and so forth. It also covers administrative expenses in putting the Act in place, such as hiring legal experts or accountants. It is to enable the companies to get going rather than covering the actual business of the companies. It is not intended to cover large restructuring sums as discussed earlier.</P><?oasys [cl11.5]?>

  <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, are related, and will be taken together by agreement. Amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendment No. 4.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (1), line 31 and 32, to delete &ldquo;, after the Dublin appointed day,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">These amendments relate to the appointed days for the airport authorities and propose to make the establishment of the Dublin appointed day subject to the consent mechanism of the two Ministers that already applies to the Cork and Shannon appointed days. These amendments would also have implications in the way business is done. It is implicit from the amendments that the Dublin appointed day will be later than I expect the Minister intends it will be. The Labour Party would like the strategic direction of the companies to be clear before any of the companies are established and to reduce the length of the interim when Dublin is acting as big brother to the other two companies.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the Minister rejecting the amendments, will he set out in some detail when he anticipates making the order for the Dublin appointed day? How long does he anticipate the interim will be?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1295"/>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 5 would have the effect of requiring that the Dublin appointed day order would come under section 5(1). It would also require that both Ministers would have to be satisfied as to the operational and financial readiness of all three airports before making the Dublin order as well as the Cork and Shannon orders. These amendments are contrary to the policy objective of establishing the Dublin Airport authority and the Cork and Shannon authorities as soon as possible. It is intended that the Cork and Shannon authorities will be formally established so that they can undertake the business planning for their airports in advance of the appointed days when the airport assets will be transferred to them.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 would provide in section 5(1) that the order setting the appointed day for Cork and Shannon authorities would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. This is unnecessary since section 17(3) provides for the laying of the appointed day draft orders for Cork and Shannon before each House of the Oireachtas. Such orders will not be made unless they are approved by resolutions passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>Assuming the House passes the Bill, when it is signed by the President a number of procedures will be put in place by the Department and legal and financial advice will be sought before the commencement of the three airports&rsquo; boards. I envisage doing that as soon as possible but it will take some weeks before the detailed work of establishing the boards will be completed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the memorandum and articles of association for the Cork and Shannon companies be submitted to the Companies Registration Office and the companies established before any of the appointed day orders are made?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Bill is drafted, the three plcs will be established immediately after the Bill is enacted. However, it may take a number of weeks to get through a number of procedures. As soon as is possible, the three plcs will be established and the memorandum and articles of association drawn up and agreed. On the establishment of the plcs I will sign the necessary orders for the boards to take office.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (3), line 41, after &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and viability&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1296"/>
    <P FLI="0">This is a straightforward amendment. Amendment No. 7 seeks in the same subsection after &ldquo;airports&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and subject to the companies being able to meet the requirements of <i>section 9(4)</i>&rdquo;. Section 9(4) clearly spells out the role of the new airport authorities.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to use these amendments to tease out some of the viability issues on which we touched earlier, in particular the capital reserves to which the Minister referred at some length. What is the situation? My understanding is that it is not possible to distribute any of the assets from Aer Rianta, as it is constituted, to Cork and Shannon because the reserves do not exist to permit that under EU law. If that is to change and the capital reserves are to be increased it will require drastic liquidation of assets on the part of the company.</P>
    <P>To be blunt, it will require, as the Minister said, disposal or realisation of assets. Does it in effect require the sale of the Great Southern Hotels or does the Minister envisage that it will be confined to the foreign assets of Aer Rianta International, as he said in our earlier discussion? These matters impinge on viability. It is critically important that before this process advances too far the boards and the Minister are satisfied about viability. That is why we have provided that the word be included in the Act when passed. Will the Minister comment on the situation regarding capital reserves?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 relate to section 5(3) and seek to provide that both Ministers must be satisfied as to sustainable viability and the viability of the three airports, as well as operational and financial readiness prior to the making of orders for Shannon and Cork appointed days. It is a matter for the new airport boards to draw up business plans and marketing strategies for their airports which will ensure their sustainability, viability and growth in the future. The directors of each of the new authorities have a fiduciary duty to ensure the viable operation of their companies. The Ministers for Transport and Finance, as provided for in section 5(3), must be satisfied as to the general state of operational and financial readiness for vesting of assets in the new Shannon and Cork airport authorities, and those orders must go before the D&aacute;il before any assets transfer.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator McDowell&rsquo;s query about the current situation, the financial advice available to the Department makes it clear that the level of reserves in Aer Rianta would not permit the dividing out of Shannon or Cork Airports tomorrow morning. The reserves are not large enough for that. I am reluctant to put figures on it but have seen broad figures of &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million for Shannon and maybe &euro;120 million or &euro;150 million for Cork but they are ball-park <Col N="1297"/>figures and could be very wide of the mark. Therefore, the reserves would not be large enough to make it possible to distribute the airports as dividends under company legislation.</P>
    <P>The board of the Dublin authority has several options. It can seek to make extra profits by sweating the assets, getting more business, building up the revenue reserves in that way, which will take some time, or it can move more quickly and decide to make some capital gains which would also build up the reserves. It could do that by disposing of some international assets or receiving a fairly long overdue dividend from Aer Rianta International to Aer Rianta or the Dublin Airport authority. That due dividend could help to build up the reserves which would allow us to trigger the Shannon and Cork dividing out days earlier.</P>
    <P>According to available estimates, and regardless of the arrangement we made with the trade union movement about 30 April, it would take six to eight months before the reserves were sufficient for Shannon&rsquo;s assets to be divided out. In the case of Cork because of the terminal it could take up to twice that time. That is the best description I can give of the mechanism in place. The trade unions asked for the April date and I was happy to agree to it but it is also our best estimate of how soon we could transfer assets. One is not allowed to transfer assets from a plc unless one has reserves to cover them. That provides the time and space in which to work out many of the issues, even if we never had the other negotiations about trigger dates and agreements of Ministers and business plans and the other important elements. Current company law constrains us within this time period. I examined whether that company law could be amended but it was clear that EU directives do not permit that. That is the best explanation I can give of how it works and the numbers involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Minister&rsquo;s last point that this gives us time and space in which to work out the change. It does nothing of the sort. It seems to do the exact opposite by putting a gun to the head of the boards to realise assets quickly and give effect to what will then be the Act. The Minister points out that it would be possible to grow revenue over time on which to build up the capital reserves but that will not happen within the timescale the Minister mentions, of eight months, or even twice that time. That would take at least some years.</P>
    <P>Are we by proxy effectively making a decision which will oblige Aer Rianta to sell the hotels or realise some of its foreign assets? Few of us would be put out if some of the foreign assets were disposed of although that might in turn impinge on the viability of Aer Rianta International but I doubt there are any strategic issues about which people will be very bothered. There <Col N="1298"/>are colleagues in parts of the country where the Great Southern Hotels are located who have a very strong view as to whether the hotels should remain within the State sector. Although generally I support the State sector my ideological commitment to it does not extend to hotels but some of my colleagues hold the view that this hotel chain should remain within the State sector. Does this decision effectively oblige Aer Rianta to sell the hotels?</P><?oasys [cl11.3]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have little to add to what I have already said. The company must consider whether it wishes to stay in the hotel business or move it on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not really an issue. It must do so in order to divest itself of Cork and Shannon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator quite rightly said it could do this by building up revenue reserves but I made the point earlier that if we never made these changes the current board, or its successor if there was no restructuring, must look at some cash realisation programme. The likely targets are some of the international airports it owns because they offer substantial possible gains. There are also substantial dividends in Aer Rianta International which have not been paid.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister put a number on that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Between Aer Rianta International and Aer Rianta, there is some &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million in unpaid dividends. They have the reserves to pay that amount if that course of action is taken.</P>
    <P>This is a public limited company, and I confess the proposed legislation is complicated. However, the issues are being resolved and the best advice is being obtained. The Aer Rianta International option concerns built-up dividends which are due in any event. That is one course of action under consideration. The option of international assets is another. However, none of this has to do with our business here today. Cash realisation is a live issue and any board, or boards, would have to deal with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We have received as much information from the Minister as we are going to get. We are making a decision by proxy to dispose of some of Aer Rianta&rsquo;s assets. It is a pity we are doing so without adequate debate because the board will not have much choice when push comes to shove. Will it be necessary for Aer Rianta International, as a subsidiary of Aer Rianta plc, to borrow to pay its parent company the due dividend? Do I understand the Minister&rsquo;s response to indicate it would? If this is the case, we are moving debt around. I appreciate the Minister must do so in order to stay within the <Col N="1299"/>rules, but it does seem a strange paper exercise in which to engage.</P>
    <P>Subject to the Minister&rsquo;s response, I do not intend to press the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be helpful to the Senator. I appreciate he wishes this to be an opportunity to provide information. Aer Rianta International is able to pay the dividend. I am not clear how it will fund the repayment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Aer Rianta International borrow or use other reserves?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The dividend is there and Aer Rianta International can afford to pay it. I am not clear whether the money is in the bank, in a drawer, in the reserves or elsewhere. I can check that information. It is in a position to pay the dividend, and that is part of the financial architecture of this scheme.</P>
    <P>All companies buy and sell assets. If companies buy assets, it follows that companies sell assets. Otherwise, there is contradiction. Companies buy and sell and trade.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with that, but does the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, think the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney falls under the same category?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to international assets. Companies often make decisions about whether to sell assets, such as aeroplanes, and buy more buses, or to use &euro;100 million to buy rolling stock, aircraft, jetties or terminals instead of locking the money in a site. These are sensible decisions. That is why investments are made. I favour maximum flexibility. Ancillary incomes are there for when State companies require funds, not for building empires. We debated this in regard to CIE for years. As to whether &euro;50 million should be used for bus services or left because the money may be needed at some stage for a garage, I am not getting into that debate now. However, these are important discussions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are important. Clontarf bus garage is a valuable site. It causes much hassle for people who live nearby. I do not think they would be overly upset if Dublin Bus were to divest itself of that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We must confine ourselves to discussing the airlines.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in enough trouble without going down that road.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is different. I agree with the general philosophy outlined by the Minister that if a company acquires assets it must also dispose of them, particularly when they were <Col N="1300"/>acquired as a business proposition. However, this is a different matter. It involves a company divesting itself of some assets so that it can divest itself of more because of company law. That is a peculiar situation. It risks leaving the company in a worse position by allowing for business decisions driven by an overall structure on which the company may not be keen.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 not moved.</P>
  <P>Section 5 agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (1), lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;on the Dublin appointed day&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;after the Cork and Shannon appointed days&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment refers to the name change. As it stands, the name change will occur immediately. We suggest Aer Rianta should remain the name of the holding company until the Cork and Shannon companies are up and running so as to avoid an anomalous situation whereby the Dublin company owns the Cork and Shannon companies for the interim period of nine months or a year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 8 seeks to delay the renaming of Aer Rianta until after the Cork and Shannon appointed day. This issue has been brought to my attention by Senator Dooley among others. I am sympathetic to this matter. However, it would be confusing if I were to allow the delay. It is better that we start as we mean to go on. The notion that Cork and Shannon authorities will be subservient to a Dublin authority for nine months will be a feeling rather than a reality. There is no point delaying the renaming. The sooner we do so, the better.</P>
    <P>In the memorandum of associations and my opening requirements of the boards, I will ensure the Irish title automatically follows the English title. Therefore, the title of the Dublin Airport authority, when established, will be &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Aerfort &Aacute;tha Cliath, and so on for Cork and Shannon. In all instances where the title is used in a legal or promotional sense, I will ensure the Irish title is included. That is important.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 9 concerns a similar matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 9 is out of order and the Senator may not speak on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak on amendment No. 8. The Minister must admit there is confusion, particularly surrounding the next nine months until the new boards are fully established. In the <Col N="1301"/>meantime, people will think that Dublin Airport authority is only responsible for Dublin. However, the authority will have a say in the business of Cork and Shannon authorities. With hindsight, it may make more sense to leave it as the Irish Aviation Authority in the interim period until Cork and Shannon are fully autonomous. The name is misleading and will cause confusion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spoken to the Minister about this section and I recognise there are difficulties. I do not have a problem with the name. I would have preferred some capacity for representation from the regions on the Dublin board in the intervening period of nine months or however long it lasts based on company law. There are technical difficulties. I thank the Minister and his officials who have been helpful to both myself and Senator Daly during discussions on the matter with him in the past fortnight. I would welcome any comfort the Minister can provide on the issue. Worker-director participation allows for this in some regard. If possible, I would like to see the directors, chief executive officers or chairmen from Cork and Shannon having some involvement with the board of the Dublin Airport authority. There should be some structure, if not right of access, to allow them to get together in the intervening nine months or longer, depending on some of the company law issues which have been referred to.</P>

    <P>Senator Dooley has spoken to me many times about representation on the Dublin board from Shannon and Cork. He has pressed the case very hard with me and I understand why he feels so strongly about it. I can try to meet his requirement as best I can by reminding everyone of section 8 which requires the three authorities to work out arrangements between them so that <Col N="1302"/>whatever functions can be undertaken by Shannon and Cork in the interim can be agreed and carried out by the two airport authorities. That will ensure almost daily contact at very senior level between the three authorities which should meet the requirement of keeping very close touch during the transition period.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 not moved.</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following subsections:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall remain as the main principal shareholder of the Dublin Airport Authority and after their appointed days the Cork Airport Authority and the Shannon Airport Authority subject to the provision contained at <i>section 10 (4)</i>.</P>
    <P LI="2">(3) Aer Rianta International and the Great Southern Hotels Limited shall remain as wholly owned subsidiaries of the Dublin Airport Authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is an important amendment in that it deals essentially with the ownership of the company in the future. The Minister, in proposing the Bill to both Houses, has been explicit in saying he has come to the view that Aer Rianta and the three successor companies will remain in public ownership into the future. It is no secret that not everybody is persuaded by his protestations on the issue. It is a great pity that, not just in regard to Aer Rianta but also Aer Lingus, we have had such a long but also inadequate debate in recent years when Government policy appears to have vacillated. When Ministers have changed their view there was a corresponding change of view within Government depending on which Minister was in power at a given time. We are left with a distinct lack of clarity in terms of the Minister&rsquo;s or the Government&rsquo;s future intentions.</P>
    <P>The proposed new subsection seeks to copper-fasten State ownership into the future. I strongly believe that the three State airports are an essential part of national infrastructure and that they should be owned by the State. I also believe &mdash; and I hope we will get an opportunity to discuss it later &mdash; that any new terminal in Dublin should also be owned by the State. It is not possible to have constructive competition on the one site. We should take the opportunity to copper-fasten State ownership of the three airports.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I object to the amendment because, based on the discussion we had earlier, I would like to see Aer Rianta International retained in the Shannon region and not transferred to Dublin, as the amendment would appear to suggest. I understand the Senator&rsquo;s aim is to protect public ownership of the subsidiaries <Col N="1303"/>and the authorities. However, that is clearly set out in the legislation. I welcome the fact that the airports will remain in State ownership. I do not want to see Aer Rianta International transferred to Dublin, if that is what the reserves issue would allow for. I want to see it remain in Shannon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>His fingerprints are all over this amendment. It would be foolish to tie ourselves down; we should leave it to the boards to decide. We should not say Aer Rianta International or the Great Southern Hotels Group should automatically go to the Dublin Airport authority. It makes sense for people to have options. Aer Rianta International should remain in Shannon as it is based there and would be a major asset to the authority. If it is taken away from Shannon, it could lead to a collapse. I have difficulty with this and do not support the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Browne&rsquo;s analysis. The purpose of the proposed subsection (3) is to statutorily underpin two companies as permanent State companies. However, Government needs flexibility in dealing with such issues and I do not consider it wise to put it into legislation. It is preferable to retain the flexibility that currently exists. Important business issues surround both of these companies and their locations.</P>
    <P>I accept what Senator McDowell is aiming to do in his proposed subsection (2). I do not have a problem with the concept but it is not necessary because the legislation makes it clear that the three airports will remain in State ownership. Effectively, we are doing what is required by the Senator in subsection (2). Subsection (3) would cause me difficulties for the reasons outlined; namely that it does not give any flexibility to Government in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to colleagues who made the point about Aer Rianta International, the purpose of subsection (3) of the amendment is not specifically to give ownership to Dublin as opposed to Shannon or Cork; it was intended to ensure State ownership would continue. Reference is made to the Dublin Airport authority as the successor company to Aer Rianta plc. I accept it is a case of belt and braces but, nonetheless, I consider it important that we would do so in view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves where workers in Aer Rianta and the three suc<Col N="1304"/>cessor companies are very unsure as to what will happen in future.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the amendment was also tabled in the D&aacute;il in an attempt to get assurances that the company would be retained in public ownership. I acknowledge that he gave that assurance in the House yesterday and today and I presume we will not get any further with it.</P>
    <P>Before the company would seek to divest itself of either Aer Rianta International as a whole or any of its significant assets, or for that matter any of the hotels, it should have recourse to the House which was the purpose of subsection (3) of the amendment. It would be a great pity, and I do not suppose Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers would allow it, for the Minister to get rid of the hotels without a proper public debate as to the benefits that accrue to Aer Rianta from having ownership of the hotels, in terms of the training and so on that goes on there. I would not like to see it happening without a full and proper public debate and it was in order to ensure we had such that we tabled this amendment. However, we will not take it any further.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (1), lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;or by the Minister under <i>subsection (2)</i>, or by a combination of both&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This legislation, when enacted, will mandate the company to do certain things, to transfer certain assets and to set up the companies in the way that has been set out in the restructuring programme. Having given the mandate to the company, it seems inappropriate that it will be shared in some way. In a sense, the mandate will be shared by the Minister and the company. There seems to be an implication that the Minister is not satisfied that the company will behave exactly as he wishes. In essence, I propose to remove the Minister&rsquo;s power to mandate the transfer of assets and the various other issues which are set out in section 7(1), such as liabilities and contracts.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 12 relates to section 7(1), which provides that the transfer of assets can be effected by the Minister, as well as the Dublin Airport authority. It would remove an added element of the flexibility to effect what will be a complex restructuring process. Amendment <Col N="1305"/>No. 13, which relates to sections 7(2) and 7(3), proposes to remove the power of the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make orders to give effect to the restructuring. The Bill is enabling legislation. The provisions which this amendment seeks to delete are part of a range of powers designed to provide maximum flexibility for giving effect to the restructuring. Senator McDowell has expressed his concern about not trusting the companies. One should consider the will of the Oireachtas, assuming the Seanad passes the Bill this afternoon. It is important that the Minister of the day should have a role in assuring that the will of the Oireachtas is carried through. I do not suggest that the companies will fail to do so, but it is important that we should have an extra assurance.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (6), line 19, to delete &ldquo;or in anticipation of&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes to remove any vagueness about the Minister&rsquo;s power to give direction to Aer Rianta, or another company, about any matter relating to the restructuring. I seek the removal of the phrase &ldquo;or in anticipation of&rdquo; because I am concerned that the provision could be abused by future Ministers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I take a similar view to that of Senator Browne. This section, as drafted, gives the Minister more than extra comfort, in essence. He will be given absolute power, in effect, to dictate the way in which the restructuring is due to happen. We need to strike a balance between giving the interim boards a certain measure of discretion in deciding how to set the thing up and allowing the Minister to micro-manage, to use Senator Dooley&rsquo;s phrase. This section of the Bill gives the Minister an extraordinary level of power not only to do things related to the restructuring, but to do anything that might be &ldquo;in anticipation of&rdquo; the restructuring. That seems to broaden it out even further, but the amendment before the House seeks to narrow it slightly to issues which are directly related to the restructuring, at least. The section as it is currently drafted will, in effect, allow the Minister to micro-manage everything that happens at the three companies between now and next April and probably beyond that date.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no wish to micro-manage this or any other issue. I assure the Senator that the sooner I can get it done and dusted the better, so the boards can get on with their jobs. The amendment before the House proposes to remove the Minister&rsquo;s power to give a direction <Col N="1306"/>&ldquo;in anticipation of&rdquo; the restructuring. Section 7(6) is important because it adds some flexibility to a complex restructuring process. The Minister will have the power to give directions to ensure that the restructuring is completed, in line with the wishes of the Houses. My legal advisers have suggested to me that we should have the power to give directions in anticipation of the restructuring. The restructuring is not a one-off event that will take place at noon on a certain date &mdash; it is an ongoing thing. There is a great deal of legal argument about when restructuring starts and finishes, or when one is in the middle of restructuring. The legal advice given to me is that if I can give directions not only about restructuring, but in anticipation of restructuring, I will have the flexibility required. I did not dream it up myself &mdash; it was suggested to me in particular legal advice and I accepted it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is concern about issues which might not be directly related to restructuring. I refer to issues relating to the second terminal, for example. The Minister may choose to give directions in respect of the second terminal or pier D. He may well tell me that he already has the power to do that. I am not sure that he has such a power, but he might clarify the matter. The Minister might say that issues which are not directly related to the restructuring issue will be the subject of ministerial orders in the near future. As of now, he has them almost in his back pocket and he may intend to throw them on the table when this Bill is in his back pocket. Perhaps the Minister might use this opportunity to confirm that he does not have the power to make directions about issues of obvious strategic importance, such as pier D and the second terminal. Does he intend to make orders in the near future in respect of such matters?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the intention. If the Houses approve legislation that provides for a restructuring process that establishes independent State airports, that is the will of the D&aacute;il and Seanad. It will receive the presidential signature and it will become an Act. It is important, to ensure that the Act is seen through and not frustrated, that the Minister of the day, whoever that might be, is given reserved powers to see through the restructuring. The Minister cannot ramble through and do that willy-nilly because triggers are built into the legislation. I refer to the 30 April deadline, the requirement for business plans to be approved and the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport. Such triggers are important. Any directions on restructuring will be subservient to the safeguards built into the legislation. The provisions in question are in place to ensure that the process does not stall, which could happen if a board fails to do something it should do to give effect to the legislation. I do not envisage that that will happen. It is a normal provision <Col N="1307"/>in most legislation, such as the existing Aer Rianta Act, which provides that the Minister of the day can give directions on a range of issues. It is a fairly normal part of ministerial powers in respect of State companies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like briefly to tease out an issue. The only discretion the board of the Dublin Airport authority will have will be linked to the capital reserves issue, which we discussed earlier. As the Minister rightly pointed out, the board of the authority will not legally be permitted to transfer some of its assets until the capital reserves issue has been sorted out. A board which is not eager to transfer the assets will have the option of not dealing with the capital reserves issue by liquidating some of the other assets. It might be possible, therefore, for such a board not to advance on the issues we debated earlier, including the possible sale of hotels, the realisation of foreign assets, etc. Am I right to say that if the board were to fail to make a decision on realising assets, the sanctions we are debating would give the Minister the power to direct the disposal of the foreign assets? Is it reasonable to assume the Minister will seek to use his power to do that if he is still in office?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the Senator&rsquo;s question is probably &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The Minister could give such a direction if a board were to fail to do that. Section 8 states that restructuring will take place and the Dublin Airport authority will enter into discussions with the other airports about delegated powers and matters of that type.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell&rsquo;s question is fair. If the Dublin Airport authority should decide that it is unconcerned with the spirit of the legislation and does not propose to divvy out any airports, it would then be incumbent on the Minister to exercise the power provided in the Bill to ensure the intent of the legislation was implemented.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unlikely the airport authority would go so far as to refuse to divvy out the airports but it is possible that it might not take the other consequential moves necessary to make the airports viable. This is where the difficulty arises and it is in such a situation that the Minister might find himself tempted to intervene to direct a sale of assets.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McDowell is quite correct and his explanation makes me twice as pleased that the legislation is as it is. If the Dublin Airport authority were to behave somewhat neglectfully towards Cork or Shannon Airports or have them lose out in certain carve-ups and so on, the Minister should intervene and reiterate that although Dublin is the big player, Cork and Shannon must be treated fairly as they set sail. This reinforces my conviction that the Minister must have the necessary clout to execute this <Col N="1308"/>intervention. I come from the west but represent Dublin and I know in my heart that Dublin has issues to deal with. The economic future of Dublin Airport is not in doubt and it will be brilliant. One can talk about bonds and so on but it is only necessary to consider the enormous traffic flow from Dublin, which will ensure it is an extremely profitable and successful airport. Shannon and Cork Airports must therefore be dealt with fairly by the Minister and Government and supported in every way possible. Senator McDowell has made a better case for the legislation than I could have done on the matter of the power of the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a problem with making the Minister&rsquo;s case in that I am happy to have it put explicitly on the record that the Minister has the power to direct the sale of assets and would not hesitate to use it. That is the provision I wished to include and we are agreed that it is covered under the legislation.</P>

  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (8), line 23, to delete &ldquo;Costs&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;All costs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with the costs of the restructuring operation. Section 7(8) stipulates that &ldquo;Costs arising from the restructuring may be paid by the Minister, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; The Bill represents a political decision by the Minister and the costs of restructuring, which may be considerable, should be paid by the Exchequer rather than saddling the company with those costs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 15 relates to sections 7(8) and 8(17), which provide that the cost of the restructuring will be paid by Aer Rianta or the Dublin Airport authority unless otherwise paid by the Minister. The effect of this amendment would be to render all costs payable by the Exchequer. The Minister for Finance and I are in full agreement that the Exchequer will not pay substantial sums in connection with the restructuring. However, minor costs such as those associated with the establishment of the Cork and Shannon airport authorities prior to their appointed day could be paid by the Exchequer, which is a standard provision in the Bill. The Exchequer will not pay all costs as envisaged in the amendment as that would be inappropriate and unnecessary. The pressure to keep the costs down will come from the airport authorities and it is appropriate that they include those costs in their budgets.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure that is reasonable. Perhaps the Minister could give us some indication of the level of costs involved and I presume the Department of Finance has performed <Col N="1309"/>some sort of risk analysis with regard to this. That the company is being broken up, assets and staff transferred, new systems established and some new staff employed to accommodate duplications in bureaucracy and administration will surely involve significant additional costs. These changes are a consequence of the Minister&rsquo;s initiative by virtue of a political decision by the Government and it is therefore unreasonable to impose those costs on the company. I can understand that the Minister for Finance thinks the Exchequer should not bear the costs because that is his job but the Minister for Transport should take a more reasonable view by acknowledging that it is his idea and it should be funded by the Exchequer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not just my idea; it was a decision reached by the Government after a year of discussion. The minor costs which the Minister must pay include those relating to the issue share capital of a public limited company, for example. Those types of pre-incorporation costs must all be borne by the Minister. Once the airport authorities are fully incorporated and the boards legally in office, any costs that emerge must be dealt with by them. I do not envisage significant costs but I cannot anticipate all those that will arise. The boards must work them out and strive to keep them to a minimum because they must be paid without Government assistance. It would be quite silly to have three airport authorities legally in office as public limited companies while the Minister for Finance is paying bills based on decisions made by those authorities. The authorities could decide to engage experts, hire lawyers or sanction significant building work, for example, as part of the restructuring operation and send the bills to the Department of Finance. That would be daft. It is entirely sensible that the boards should decide on the restructuring costs themselves and the best way to keep the costs down is for the authorities to pay them.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="2">9.&mdash;Within 6 weeks of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall do one or both of the following&mdash;</P><Col N="1310"/>
    <P LI="3">(<i>i</i>) lay a Report before both Houses of the Oireachtas, or</P>
    <P LI="3">(<i>ii</i>) appear before an Oireachtas Committee</P>
    <P LI="2" FLI="0">to confirm whether the provisions of this Bill will effect events of default regarding Aer Rianta&rsquo;s financial obligations, and detailing how and what measures he proposes to take to address this.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment arises from recent reports regarding the possibility of creditors recalling loans sooner than was originally agreed or revising the terms of loans because Aer Rianta will be changed from one company to three separate companies. The Minister addressed this issue in the House yesterday and said he had received no correspondence to support these claims. I asked that any information on this matter be made public and that was not done so I will press this amendment. There is much concern because we are dealing with debts of almost &euro;500 million and although I accept the Minister&rsquo;s word, I would be far happier if there was some supporting documentation. The Minister also dropped blatant hints that the leaked letter which alleged this problem came from within Aer Rianta itself and perhaps he might clarify this assertion today. It would be worrying if the information did indeed come from Aer Rianta, especially if that information is incorrect. It is unhelpful to all concerned. It has captured the public&rsquo;s imagination and is receiving extensive press coverage and it is the responsibility of Members of this House to ensure there is no difficulty down the line when the three separate authorities are established.</P>
  
   </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to see if some clarity can be attained on the matter of the bonds and bilateral loans. Most of the facts were set out yesterday but I wish to recapitulate them briefly to ensure I am not missing anything. It has been established that there was correspondence between Deutsche Bank and Aer Rianta at the end of July 2003. In that correspondence Deutsche Bank, as the trustee for the bond holders, expressed concern about the lack of certainty in the Government proposals and the impact they would have on the companies into the future. It sought a reassurance from Aer Rianta that the bonds were sound and, in effect, that the company would be restructured in the context of solvency.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a number of specific questions. First, will he reiterate what Aer Rianta said in that correspondence, namely, that it saw the restructuring as taking place in the context of solvency and therefore not being an event in default? Second, will he put on record whether he has had any intimation from Deutsche Bank, acting as trustee, or from the creditors generally, either in respect of the bonds or the bilateral loans, that they would regard any of the events <Col N="1311"/>contemplated by the Bill as events in default? Third, has the Minister any indication from Aer Rianta that it is concerned that the creditors might regard the events anticipated by the Bill as being events in default that would cause it to get into a spiral which might ultimately result in insolvency?</P><?oasys [cl11.5]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I see some merit in the amendment in regard to the discussions that have taken place over the past 12 months. Banks might rightly have been concerned before the legislation was published but in view of the fact that the legislation is published, the State remains the underwriter and that the Minister said yesterday that he has had no correspondence from any banks in the recent past, the fear being expressed is exaggerated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with amendments Nos. 17, 21, 22, 23, 48 and 49. Paragraphs (i) and (ii) of amendment No. 17 provides that the Minister shall lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas or appear before an Oireachtas committee. I am always available to appear before Oireachtas committees whenever I am required to do so to discuss any issue within my portfolio. We do not need to change an Act to require me to appear before a D&aacute;il committee. I am happy to do that. I have always done that, as indeed every Minister must. In regard to laying a report before the House, that can be solved by way of parliamentary question or Adjournment debate at any time, or even more substantively.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 is not considered necessary. As is normal in such situations, communications have and will be maintained with funders so as to ensure they are briefed appropriately on the restructuring. These matters are being and have been handled at the outset by the company and its advisers, in consultation with the Departments of Transport and Finance, in a professional manner. There has been no adverse reaction from any funders to these communications nor suggestions of any intention to initiate actions under event of default type clauses of the various loan agreements. The company, the two Departments and their respective advisers are fully apprised of the relevant clauses and these have been the subject of professional scrutiny from the outset.</P>
    <P>The Bill is enabling in nature and provides for the restructuring process to proceed in a measured and orderly way which will not lead to any destabilisation of the company&rsquo;s funding arrangements. I made that clear yesterday. The Bill contains a number of conditions that must be met first before the restructuring of Aer Rianta can be given effect. In this context, it will be necessary for detailed business and financial plans to be prepared by the new boards of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports. It is a requirement of the Bill that these plans be <Col N="1312"/>approved by the Ministers for Transport and Finance with each House of the Oireachtas also being required to pass a positive resolution on appointed day orders for Cork and Shannon Airports before restructuring can be fully implemented. These financial plans will, of necessity, include obtaining any necessary consent from the funders in accordance with the terms of the relevant facilities. When putting draft appointed day orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister will have to address all the issues emerging from the business planning process, including the concerns expressed today in regard to the funding aspects.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23, which relate to the business planning provisions in section 8(8) and (9), are similar. Unfortunately, I cannot accept these amendments as they seek to include the viability of the three airports as a criterion to be satisfied prior to the making of orders for the Cork and Shannon appointed days. As I said repeatedly, it is a matter for the new airport boards to draw up these plans and marketing strategies for their airports, which will ensure their sustainability, viability and growth in the future. Indeed, the directors of each of the new authorities have a fiduciary duty to ensure the viable operations of their companies. The Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance, as provided for in section 5(3), will have to be satisfied as to the general state of operational and financial readiness for vesting of assets in the new Shannon and Cork Airports but the issue of viability is one for the boards of the airports.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 48, this section as drafted provides that all orders made under Part 2 of the Bill must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas but that section 3(1) of the 1998 Act does not apply, that is, a resolution annulling an order cannot be made within 21 days. The section does provide that appointed day orders for Cork and Shannon Airports require a positive resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas before being passed. This approach ensures that both Houses will have control over the key stages in the restructuring process, that is, the setting of the appointed days for Cork and Shannon Airports. As regards other orders to be made under this part of the Bill, the approach is geared towards providing maximum flexibility for carrying through what is, as I said earlier, a complex process as efficiently as possible, allowing for the fact that transactions will need to proceed within a clearly defined timetable.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 49, airport by-laws are of local and limited jurisdiction and, under the Bill, will be made by either the relevant airport authorities or, in the case of regional airports, the Minister. Accepting this amendment would mean the Statutory Instrument Act 1947 would apply, thereby requiring the by-laws to be published in the bound volume of statutory instruments. Statu<Col N="1313"/>tory instruments are usually of general and national application, which would not be the case in regard to by-laws under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, the situation in regard to not laying by-laws affects the current position under the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 where there are no requirements to lay such by-laws. I ask Members not to ask me too much about the last statement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be aware that I voted with the Government earlier in supporting the view that the business plan should not be in existence before the interim board is set up. However, if a business plan is presented, I find it strange that the Minister has not included the words &ldquo;financial viability&rdquo;. I refer to amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23. The Minister appears to be saying that is taken for granted, so to speak, but I am not sure that is the case. I realise it will be presented to the Minister for Finance and on that basis it is unlikely to be taken unless there is financial viability. I would have thought the Bill would be strengthened by the inclusion of the words &ldquo;financial viability&rdquo; in all three cases and I urge the Minister to reconsider that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys [dc20]?><Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>On amendment No. 17, the Minister is very vulnerable. He has not done his homework and that has been shown quite clearly. He said he has not received any correspondence indicating there is a problem but neither has he received any correspondence indicating that there is no problem and that this issue has been carefully examined. The danger is that when the Bill is passed, a problem might arise subsequently. If I had documentation from the main banks involved or the people who are owed money stating that they are happy that the company is being broken into three separate companies and that it will not affect the term conditions, either in regard to repayments or the period of repayments, I would have no qualms about this aspect but we do not have that information. In fact, neither has the Minister if we listen to what he is saying. He is forcing all of us to take a leap into the dark and we all hope that nothing will happen. It is possible nothing will happen in that area but we do not know that for certain. I find it amazing that the Minister would not have contacted the main people involved to get a reassurance from them on this issue and that he is taking this approach. We will press the amendment for that reason.</P> <?oasys [dc0]?>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator tell us how often he gets letters from constituents indicating they have no problem? I do not get too many of those. I get letters telling me they are experiencing problems but they do not write to tell me that everything is grand. I spelt out the position clearly yesterday. Everybody in the financial sector in this country must now know about this issue. It has been in the headlines for weeks. I <Col N="1314"/>conclude that the bond holders and lenders to a State company are quite happy and satisfied. I do not know whether the Senator has any knowledge of the markets, but it seems to me if one has a bond drawn on a State company today and is getting paid, one is likely to stay quiet because it might be difficult to match that arrangement elsewhere. I state clearly that no concern among bond holders or creditors has been communicated either to me or to the Department of Transport. One piece of correspondence came to the company when this was announced a year ago. It was properly responded to by Aer Rianta at the time, with the company reassuring the correspondent that it was solvent and there was not an issue. That was the end of the matter and I am quite satisfied there is no issue here to be concerned about. Any creditor of Aer Rianta, whether bond holder, trade creditor or whatever, can be assured that he or she is fully covered. I am reliably convinced that this is the view of the bond holders also. They have my phone number and I have not heard a word from them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is worth pointing out that international lenders are involved. I accept the point made by the Minister. The bottom line is that one company owes approximately &euro;480 million. The Minister has admitted that all three of the new airport companies will face immense challenges. In some cases they will sell off assets, in others they will buy them. A great deal of restructuring is involved and I hope, if it goes right, there will be three viable strong independent airports. However, the danger is that matters can go wrong. That is when creditors get extremely nervous. We all know the case of a lady who had no difficulty in getting a &euro;10,000 loan from a credit union. There was no problem in giving it to her, but then matters went wrong and she had difficulty paying it back. Now it has become an enormous problem for her. Banks are great when an individual&rsquo;s affairs are going well. When they are going wrong they are quick to recall loans and change the lending conditions. I am, I hope, only erring on the side of caution in tabling this amendment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Department or Aer Rianta in discussion with the bond holders and the bilateral lenders and creditors as regards consents or waivers? Assuming these are forthcoming, will they involve significant cost to the Exchequer or to the company?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that Aer Rianta is in touch with all of its lenders. It has supplied them with copies of the legislation and kept them briefed on its progress. It is a matter for Aer Rianta to deal with its lenders. It would be appropriate neither for the Department or me to get involved in trying to do that on behalf of a State company.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1315"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are also guarantees by the State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am assured it is not a difficulty. I made that clear yesterday and I do so again today. I know Senators are trying to be helpful as are many media commentators. However, it is not helpful to continue to suggest, nationally, that there is any scintilla of doubt over the ability of a major State company with substantial lenders, such as Aer Rianta, to repay and live up to its commitments. Aer Rianta and the new companies are fully capable of living up to the letter of the bond holders&rsquo; requirements. That is my information. I do not believe I can go much further beyond wheeling the bankers into the Seanad this morning.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree there is no risk to the creditors because the State ultimately guarantees the loans. Even if they were to trigger the default mechanism because the company could not pay, the State has to step in, in any event. This is not likely to happen and there is no risk, literally, to the creditors. However, there is a potential risk to the company if for whatever reason &mdash; the Minister says it would be perverse, and it would be &mdash; the creditors were to exercise their rights under the notes. It is quite clear from the information in the public domain that they would be entitled to treat the restructuring as an event of default.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>That can surely happen to any company in the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This should have been sorted and the restructuring should have been squared with the creditors, particularly since they have the power to bring the process crashing down if they choose to exercise it. I accept the logic of the Minister&rsquo;s position that they are not likely to <Col N="1316"/>choose to exercise that power, but they have it and this should have been sorted before this. The consents or the waivers should have been in place before the legislation was put before the Houses. Given that is not the position, we are looking for the maximum possible level of reassurance from the Minister that the consents will be obtained, and at a reasonable cost.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The real potential victim could be the taxpayer who will have to bear the financial burden if matters go wrong. There is no doubt the creditors can be provided for. The State can bail out the companies if matters go disastrously wrong. I hope they will not. However, we have to protect the taxpayer and that is why we are pushing this amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no risk of any sort to the taxpayer. The Aer Rianta organisation is solvent. It has enormous assets which cover its loans many times over. It is probably one of the most secure companies here to which a creditor could lend money. I do not know of any bank which would not queue up to lend funds to a State company of this sort. The taxpayer has no concerns about this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the chief executive of the company not sound a word of caution about this, and did the Aer Rianta chairman not use the word &ldquo;draconian&rdquo;? I appreciate what the Minister is saying in terms of how fully covered the company is and I am inclined to accept that in line with the available advice. However, for some reason everything does not appear to be beyond doubt.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing further to add to what I have already said.</P>

  <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 19 is an alternative to amendment No. 18 and amendment No. 20 is related. Amendments Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, may be taken together by agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, lines 43 to 50 and in page 10, lines 1 to 23, to delete subsections (1) to (4) inclusive.</P>
    <P FLI="0">These amendments seek to explore what will happen during the interim period and where in essence the power lies. There is a difficulty built into the mechanism set out by the Minister in that for the interim period of nine months, the Dublin Airport authority will have big brother-type responsibility for Cork and Shannon Airports.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 seeks clarification on what will happen in circumstances where it is the view of the Dublin Airport authority that a particular transfer of responsibility to Cork or Shannon Airports may be required under the Bill in terms of autonomy and so on, but is not in the corporate interests of Aer Rianta or the Dublin Airport authority as it will be known in the future. The Bill must clarify what will be the overriding responsibility of the Dublin Airport authority at that stage. Is its primary responsibility the normal fiduciary responsibility of a board to look after the corporate interests of the Dublin Airport authority or does it have an overriding responsibility, legal requirement or mandate to give effect to the restructuring and, in effect, do things which in normal circumstances the board would not choose to do? In other words, would it divest itself of assets or give to the new companies assets which are the primary responsibility of the board of the Dublin Airport authority in the meantime?</P>
    <P>This dilemma for the board arises because of the structure used. It is important the board knows whether it is to act in the normal interests of the company or whether its primary responsibility is to deliver the Minister&rsquo;s restructuring.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 18 seeks to delete references to arrangements for the delegation of functions at section 8(1). I consider it important that the Cork and Shannon authorities have the option of agreeing such a delegation of <Col N="1318"/>functions between them. It would not be right to delete such references.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 would provide that the entering into arrangements by Dublin Airport with Cork and Shannon Airports on delegated functions would be optional for Dublin. This is contrary to the policy objective that prior to their respective appointment dates, Dublin Airport shall make arrangements with the other two airports to delegate the performance by them of functions on its behalf to the extent agreed between the parties.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 seeks to remove text from section 8(5) which sets out the responsibility of Dublin Airport subject to any delegation of functions for Cork and Shannon Airports pending the Cork and Shannon appointment dates. The amendment is unacceptable because until their respective appointment dates, Dublin Airport will have ultimate responsibility for the management and operation of Cork and Shannon Airports. However, as provided for in sections 1 to 4, Cork and Shannon Airports, through devolved arrangements with Dublin Airport, can in the interim period undertake certain management and operational functions regarding their respective airports and can prepare to assume full responsibility for the ownership and development of the airports on their appointed days.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to come at this from a different angle. The legislation, when enacted, will allow for a transfer of a great deal of authority to the interim boards. Am I right in assuming that the Minister wishes the maximum possible level of authority to be transferred to the interim boards as soon as possible? Are we likely to find ourselves in the position within a matter of weeks or shortly after the appointed days where the interim board will deal with staff issues and so on and people will to all intents and purposes be working to the interim board? Is that the reality?</P>
    <P>Completion of the deal has been postponed until 30 April 2005. Is the reality on the ground to be that the interim boards will in effect act <i>de facto </i>as the real boards within a matter of weeks of the legislation being passed? Is that what the Minister envisages? I raise the matter by way of amendment because there is a real dilemma in the context of the Dublin Airport authority having real responsibility for operations on the ground in Cork and Shannon Airports when it <Col N="1319"/>might not deem that to be in the overall interests of the company.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is of necessity finely balanced in this regard. Section 8 states that the Dublin Airport authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; pending the Cork appointed day enter into such arrangements with Cork Airport for the performance of functions on its behalf regarding Cork Airport as may be agreed between the parties. The clause for Shannon is exactly the same. The language used is clear.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Airport authority is required to enter into arrangements with Shannon and Cork Airports for functions as can be agreed between them to be carried out on behalf of Dublin Airport in an agency-type fashion although that phrase is not used in the Bill. Legal responsibility remains with Dublin Airport in the interim period.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister envisage that staff issues will be transferred to the interim board fairly quickly?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, the Bill is clear in that regard. That cannot happen until at least 30 April 2005. Staff cannot legally transfer until then.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>They cannot do so legally but it could be done on an agency basis by virtue of the delegation process in place. Does the Minister see that happening? Will the interim boards <i>de facto </i>do this work albeit on an agency basis legally? Decisions and operations on the ground will be taken by the local boards. Is that what the Minister foresees happening?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a difference between the legal and operational situations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The boards will be put in place and will be required to prepare business plans and to make an agreement with Dublin Airport as to what functions they can carry out on its behalf. I hope they can reach sensible arrangements in terms of what Cork and Shannon Airports can do while under the umbrella of Dublin Airport. Such arrangements must be of a day-to-day nature. I do not envisage any awkward situations arising in that regard.</P>
    <P>The boards will draw up business plans and will be able to carry out functions as agreed by the Dublin Airport authority, the legal owner, and the operating board in place. It is worth pointing out that the worker-directors on the boards will also have to be consulted about the arrangements. We are committed to discussing the preparation of business plans with the trade union <Col N="1320"/>movement and other stakeholders as we go forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>What type of issues will be dealt with by the sub-delegation process?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is dealt with in the legislation and is not necessarily an issue to be dealt with by me. I hope they will try to create new business. As I outlined already, staff cannot be transferred. They can continue to work in the airports but cannot legally be transferred until April 2005.</P>
    <P>They should first take urgent and vigorous steps to create new business. I am certain the three boards will be able to agree on what needs to be done. It is in their interests to do so. Dealing with that issue would be at the top of my list.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 19 to 23, inclusive, not moved.</P>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 are related and will be discussed together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 11, subsection (12), line 11, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, subject to the approval of the Dublin Airport Authority, prior to the appointed days for Cork and Shannon,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Section 8 as it stands entitles each company to make the necessary arrangements to put in place the restructuring process with the consent of the Minister. As a number of the decisions that will have to be made inevitably impact on the residual company, Dublin Airport authority, or Aer Rianta as it currently stands, the amendments seek to provide that their consent and approval will be sought, as well as that of the Minister, so that the companies&rsquo; consent is a necessary part of the whole structure in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 24 would amend section 8(12), where Cork and Shannon are performing functions on behalf of Dublin before their respective appointed days under section 8(1). The performance by these authorities of such functions, to include provisions of services and facilities related to such functions, will already be subject to the terms of an agreement in place between Dublin Airport authority and the other relevant authorities under that subsection. The airports will come into the issue directly in that way.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 would amend section 8(13) where an airport authority wishes to establish a new airport or become the owner or manager of an existing airport. This should only require the Minister&rsquo;s consent. No ministerial consent is required for the performance of delegated func<Col N="1321"/>tions of Dublin Airport authority under subsection (1). This is a matter for agreement between Dublin Airport authority and Cork and Shannon authorities as the case may be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to address the issue of a new airport. I accept what the Minister said on amendment No. 24. When reading the Bill, I was struck that this subsection was included because it appears to be an afterthought. It appears it was suddenly decided when drafting a Bill seeking to restructure the existing airports to throw in two or three subsections which relate to the possibility of a new airport. Nonetheless, it gives us an opportunity to tease out one or two issues relating to the new terminal. It appears this is hugely important in the context of the overall restructuring. The Minister said this morning that Dublin is certain to be thriving and successful in the future, and perhaps that will be the case. If what is a State asset were to be undermined by a terminal or another airport in private ownership, it is possible to imagine circumstances where Dublin Airport authority will be left with a wasting asset in Collinstown. It is unlikely but it is not too difficult to imagine that will be the case.</P>
    <P>I wanted to use the amendment as a vehicle to invite the Minister to set out his thinking in regard to the new terminal. He blocked spectacularly the development of pier D by Aer Rianta last year. He is on record as saying that he favours a new terminal. Perhaps he will let us know when he envisages a Government decision on the new terminal and giving a direction to the Dublin Airport authority in that regard in the near future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 8(13) provides that an airport authority can, with the approval of the Minister and after consulting the Minister for Finance, establish a new airport, become part owner of an airport and manage or operate an existing airport. Under subsection (10), an airport authority is given the power to manage, operate and develop any other airport established or owned by it under <i>subsection (13)</i>. These provisions mirror provisions in subsection 16(i) and (iii) of the 1998 Act. We are seeking to carry through the provisions in the 1998 Act to permit the same statutory permission to the authorities to become involved in this area, with ministerial agreement. This will give some flexibility to the authorities. Originally it was probably aimed more at the international market than the national market. As it is worded in the 1998 Act and now, it can apply to both the international and national market.</P>
    <P>The Government has been considering the issue of a second terminal at Dublin Airport. It will conclude its deliberations on the matter in the coming weeks. Extra capacity is needed at the airport and I hope to be able to say more about it in the not too distant future.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1322"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume there was a reason for including these subsections. Is it the intention to vest some of the smaller airports in either of the authorities, for example, Farranfore or Knock? Will the Minister clarify what will happen in Dusseldorf and other international airports where there is involvement already? Will Aer Rianta&rsquo;s overseas airport involvement be vested in Dublin, Cork or Shannon?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no new intention in the Bill other than to carry through what was in the 1998 legislation, which allowed Aer Rianta to invest in other airports and to get involved in their management. We are carrying that through to the new authorities, which is what is before us here. I have no plans to bring the regional airports into State ownership.</P>
    <P>In regard to Dusseldorf and so on, I explained earlier that the shareholding in the companies is held by ARI or some special corporate vehicles attached to ARI. This is where they will remain until the relevant board decides whether to hold on to the investments, sell them or make further investments. I envisage the airports will have maximum freedom to invest in and seek to manage other airports, if it appears to be a good business strategy for the airport in question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>When we debated the topic yesterday, the Minister was very clear that the whole purpose of the policy was to delegate responsibility to the individual airports. The Minister and I had a difference of opinion on how this would be structured. It appears the amendment would go against everything that is in mind, namely, to delegate responsibility and place on the shoulders of Cork and Shannon the responsibility for success. If they were to do so subject to the approval of the Dublin Airport authority, it would appear to go against what we are trying to achieve here. I do not understand the reason for the amendment. I understand those who tabled the amendments wish to see this delegation take place. I support the Minister in not accepting the amendment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross asked me about the possibility of a second terminal at Dublin Airport. I have made it clear that I believe a second <Col N="1324"/>terminal is needed and that it should be an independent terminal. The Government is examining this matter at the moment and in the near future we will be able to make a final decision about it. The Senator asked me about the position of Aer Rianta on this matter. I understand its preference is for a fully Aer Rianta-owned terminal. The company accepts that extra capacity is needed but its preference is for a fully State-owned terminal building. That is my understanding of its position as conveyed to me over the past year or so. I would like to bring this matter to a conclusion sooner rather than later in order to provide clarity in aviation policy.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues to be dealt with, including this legislation, restructuring and the possibility of a new terminal. Senators Dooley and Daly also raised issues to do with Shannon Airport yesterday and spoke strongly about Aer Lingus&rsquo;s plans for Shannon. I am determined to deal with all these aviation issues as soon as possible so that there can be maximum certainty when the new authorities come into place. I will try to keep up the pressure to have all these issues dealt with in the weeks ahead.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the Government has not yet made a decision on this issue and that the Minister has said he expects one within a few weeks. I assume he envisages a process of expressions of interest and so on in deciding on the independent individuals or companies. Does he expect that he will prohibit the Dublin Airport authority from being party to any competition for operating the second terminal?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not really want to get into this debate today, but the Senator has asked some straight questions. The Government is considering issues to do with the integration of the airport, where a terminal might be in terms of the master plan for the airport and residual freehold ownership issues. For example, the airport could have some type of emergency in which residual ownership is an issue, or it may need to change runways around. The Government is also considering the legitimate concerns of the trade unions about their members and their conditions of employment and the possible role of a regulator in terms of ensuring fair play and balance. The Government has not taken a decision on the second terminal at this time, although there is a statement in the programme for Government that it intends to examine the possibilities.</P>
    <P>I sought expressions of interest last year and 13 groups replied. As I said earlier to Senator Ross, I hope we can bring this debate to a conclusion <Col N="1325"/>as soon as possible in full consultation with all the stake holders including Aer Rianta, the trade unions, the workers, potential investors and the Department of Finance. I am determined to bring certainty to aviation policy without much more delay. There is too much uncertainty in aviation policy at the moment. Some of this is because of my reform programmes, but it is also due to current market conditions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not overly concerned about Dublin Airport, but there is a view, which I share, that a second terminal at Dublin Airport which is not in State ownership could create a competitive environment within Dublin Airport, which could have an adverse effect on Shannon and Cork Airports. We accept to some extent that there are potential benefits associated with an element of competition among the three airports as they stand. Putting in place a second terminal at Dublin Airport adds a further dimension which would concentrate much of the competition within Dublin Airport and between the two entities. That has a potential negative effect and is not something I would like to see happen. However, this will be a Government decision to which neither I nor Senator Daly will be a party.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 11, subsection (14), line 28, after &ldquo;services&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, subject to the transfer by the Irish Aviation Authority of the necessary expertise and assets,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This relates to the provision of services by the aviation authority. I was not sure about the point of the original section. It implies that the aviation authority might in certain circumstances withdraw the provision of services to an airport, thereby creating a vacuum. It should be necessary to fill that vacuum; the aviation authority should not simply walk off the pitch. There should be some requirement for the authority to continue to provide expertise and assets so that the services necessary for maintaining an airport are provided on a continuing basis.</P>
  
   </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will clarify this for the Deputy. It is envisaged that the Irish Aviation Authority will continue to provide terminal services at the three State airports in the future. However, should any of the airport authorities decide to secure those services from an alternative source, the airport authority concerned must secure the consent of the Irish Aviation Authority. It will not be a requirement in such circumstances for the new provider of ATC services to take over the expertise and assets of the IAA at the airport. The new supplier must be free to provide its own staff and <Col N="1326"/>equipment if it wishes to do so. This is mainly an enabling provision which will ensure that if an airport authority wishes to get services from somewhere else, it must secure the consent of the Irish Aviation Authority before doing so.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (5), line 39, after &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and following consultation with the Dublin Airport Authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">These amendments relate to the memorandum and articles of association of the companies. As the section is currently drafted, it provides that these are entirely a matter for the Minister. He mentioned earlier that he envisages dealing with these over the next few weeks. As matters stand, the Minister is not required to seek the approval, agreement of the company or, as far as I can tell, consult with the company before changing its memorandum and articles. As a matter of courtesy there should be some consultation and, ideally, agreement between the Minister and Aer Rianta before they are changed and the new ones put in place.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 9(5) provides that &ldquo;the memorandum and articles of association of Aer Rianta may be amended in such manner as may for the purpose of the restructuring be determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. This is an enabling provision in the event that any amendment is required to Aer Rianta&rsquo;s memoranda and articles to take account of the restructuring. After the Dublin appointed day, this subsection will no longer be relevant as Aer Rianta will have been renamed the Dublin Airport authority and it will not be possible for Aer Rianta to seek the approval of the Dublin Airport authority. The proposed amendment is not in keeping with the sequence of events envisaged under the Bill and therefore I cannot accept it.</P><Col N="1327"/>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 29, the reason for the provision that the initial memorandum and articles of association for Cork and Shannon is drawn up is that it is considered that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, should draft memoranda and articles tailored to the specific statutory remit being given to the companies during this transitional phase. After the appointed day for these authorities, their memoranda and articles will change to make them consistent with the Act of 1998 which, therefore, keeps the correct sequence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The sequence was not my concern nor did I intend to upset it. My intention was simply to ensure there would be a measure of consultation and agreement with the companies before their memoranda and articles were changed. As matters stand, the power is vested in the Minister without the need for consultation.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 13, subsection (8), line 8, after &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;following consultation with regional and local development associations and Chamber of Commerce and &rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The intention of amendment No. 30 is to provide that there will be consultation with regional and local development associations, specifically the chamber of commerce. We relate that, as the section does, to the articles of association.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the restructuring effort is to facilitate local and regional development. Its purpose is not just to facilitate the development of the airports but through them to facilitate the development of trade, industrial development and development generally in the regions contiguous to the two airports, Cork and Shannon. Given this and in a spirit of consultation and co-operation with the local interests, we should begin by requiring that the two boards, as soon as possible following their establishment, consult with regional and local development associations &mdash; which are easily identified &mdash; and the chambers of commerce on a range of issues of local importance. This arises particularly in the context of Shannon and I have no doubt the local commercial interests there will have a serious amount to say on how the airport might be managed and marketed in the years ahead. Similarly, we know that with regard to Cork the local chamber of commerce and business interests have been to the fore in making the case for the airport and its <Col N="1328"/>maintenance and development in recent years. This amendment seeks to give these interests some sort of statutory role, albeit a consultative one, in the process.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I sympathise with what the Senator is trying to achieve here. However, this is happening. Appointments for Shannon and Dublin have already been made and the Senator can see the quality of the persons appointed. Appointments will be made for Cork shortly and we will have similar quality persons there.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks that we consult local development associations and chambers of commerce. I did that in appointing the two designate boards. If we put the requirement to consult chambers of commerce into the legislation, it makes it too prescriptive. If we make that requirement we might get letters from the IFA, the NRA and everybody else who also want to be included and the Bill would stretch on for about 40 sections. It is better not to get into naming associations in legislation of this sort. However, I reassure the Senator that I have taken, and will continue to take, account of the opinions of regional and local development associations and chambers of commerce.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 9 (11) relates to the appointment of a chief executive by the boards. In Shannon, and I presume the same is true for Cork, there is already a director who is the equivalent of a chief executive. Will the Minister clarify how the position of the person who is currently the director or chief executive of Shannon will be affected by the appointed of the chief executive of the new board? Will we have a situation where we have a former chief executive, regarded as a director, superseded by a new chief executive appointed by the board? What will happen in this situation given the undertakings given that staff and the people involved will not be discommoded by the new arrangement? I would like clarification from the Minister on this matter.</P>
    <P>There is also detail in the Schedule relating to the appointment of the chief executive. In the Schedule the new chief executive can be removed by the directors, without the consent of the Minister. This is quite severe as we all know there have been problems with chief executives from time to time. Under the Schedule the chief executive would be <i>ex officio</i> a member of the new board. What relationship will there be between him and the existing director whom I regard as the chief executive? Will we have chief executive I and chief executive II?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1329"/>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Daly on this matter which I have discussed with him at some length. The concern is that whereas the Bill sets out clearly the capacity for the board to appoint a chief executive, there is somebody currently acting in that capacity. While the person does not have that title, he certainly acts in that capacity in the absence of autonomy being established.</P>
    <P>While I recognise the legislation sets out the capacity of the board to appoint a chief executive and that there appears to be nothing in the legislation precluding the current director applying for that job, I am not sure if this is strong enough to maintain and protect the level of commitment and service the current director, Mr. Martin Moroney, has given to the company over a long period. The current director at Shannon Airport was previously the director of Aer Rianta International. The current strength of the company is due to his great level of skill, energy and entrepreneurship. It would be unfortunate if, as a result of the restructuring and the new board&rsquo;s powers, his role was not recognised or taken on board. I hope the Minister can clarify and give some comfort to Senator Daly and me in this regard. Mr. Martin Moroney is an integral part of the company and its future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister also clarify the position of the woman acting in the capacity of chief executive at Dublin Airport who has the title &ldquo;acting chief executive&rdquo;? The Bill states that employees&rsquo; conditions will not be worsened and they will not be materially affected when it is enacted. On that basis, I presume that both incumbent chief executives at Shannon and Dublin Airports will not find their position materially affected by this Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>These are legitimate concerns. Through this legislation, the Government and I have no intention of interfering with the careers of the fine chief executives and directors at Cork, Shannon or Dublin Airports. There are a number of protections in the Bill which ensure this. Section 9(11) states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Prior to their respective appointed days, a Chief Executive may be appointed to Cork Airport Authority and to Shannon Airport Authority by such directors appointed under subsections (8) and (9) (if any) and section 29 (inserted by paragraph 14 of the Schedule) of the Act of 1998 applies to such appointments.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The legislation does not intend to discommode the leaders of these airports who I hold in the highest regard. At the same time the plcs must be free to make chief executive appointments, which is envisaged in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 12(12), negotiated in detail with the trade unions, gives the statutory guarantee that no employee of the company can be brought to lesser terms and conditions or services of remuneration than they have currently. In the case of the chief executive of Dublin Airport, I <Col N="1330"/>am informed that the terms and conditions have yet to be signed under the 1998 Act. I agree with Senators that the best security and consideration should be given to the three persons who have led the three airports for so long and so well. They have my confidence and admiration. The legislation seeks to protect them and ensure they will not do worse when the Bill is enacted. However, some freedom must be given to the boards to officially appoint chief executives. I will be helpful as I can to ensure the best agreement is reached between all parties concerned.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>A situation may arise where acting executives will be appointed to the three airport authorities. If the current incumbents are not to be materially affected, then there would be two people with the same status in the same airport.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of members of a board or chairmen taking on a quasi-executive role within State companies has bedevilled some of them in the past. How can it be ensured that such a negative impact does not arise with the three airport boards? Such scenarios also happen in the private sector. Recently, Independent Newspapers and Media had to come into line with best practice in ensuring the role of chief executive was separate from that of chairman of the board. A former Member, Dr. Brian Hillery, now holds the position of non-executive chairman of Independent News and Media. Maintaining a separation between the board and the chief executive, where defined roles are in place with no cross-approaches occurring, is critical. How does the Minister view the separation of roles between the board and the executive management?</P>

	<P>No representations have been made to me by any of the people involved.</P>

	<P>Nor me. I simply want to see common justice prevail.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am raising this because of a possible flaw in the legislation. I noted another flaw in the Schedule which allows the board to appoint and dispense with executives without any consultation with the Minister for Transport. Two problems may arise from this. First, the new chief executive could be given terms and conditions much more favourable than the present chief executive. Second, a board can remove an appointment within a week. No State company board should have that authority without having to consult the relevant Minister. If terms and conditions of employment must be approved by the Ministers for Transport and Finance, it is, therefore, reasonable that the Minister should have the power of involvement when a chief executive is dismissed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The directors at Cork and Shannon Airports are direct employees in the sense of being directors rather than chief executives. Boards will have to have the freedom to <Col N="1331"/>appoint chief executives. I am taking on board what has been said by Senators and I will make it clear to the boards concerned that they must deal with these issues justly and fairly. The position at Dublin Airport is technically an acting chief executive. Terms and conditions have not been approved yet and the Dublin Airport authority will be required to conduct an open competition. I will convey the strong feelings of the House for absolute fairness and justice to the company. I agree with the spirit of what has been said.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 13, subsection (1), line 30, to delete &ldquo;The&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;After the respective appointed days the&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The amendment relates to the issuing of share capital. It intends to clarify that the share capital will not be issued until such time as the Cork and Shannon authorities are up and running. I have never understood how Departments decide on how much share capital to issue in a share company, particularly when the Minister for Finance is the sole shareholder in the company. It has never been clear to me why it was decided that 38,000 shares should be issued. I assume it could be of relevance if there were to be any disposal or part disposal of shares in the future. It might also be important if an ESOT of some kind were to be formed within the company. Perhaps those who decided on this number thought of those issues but, if not, perhaps the Minister could explain the thinking behind it because I have never understood it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 33 would amend section 10(1) to specify the authorised share capital after the appointed day. This amendment is not in line with the approach of the Bill generally. Sections 6 and 10 are inter-linked. Section 6(2) and (3) provide that, after the passing of the Act, the Minister shall, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, form two public limited companies, namely Cork Airport authority and Shannon Airport authority. These companies are to be formed before the Cork and Shannon appointed days and will be responsible for undertaking the business planning in Cork and Shannon, and the other matters we discussed. The share capital requirements of the companies must be met as soon as the companies are formed, not after their appointed days. That is the latest position.</P>
    <P>As public limited companies, Cork and Shannon will require a minimum issued share capital. Provision is made elsewhere in the Bill for the issue of further shares by these authorities to the Minister for Finance, after the appointed <Col N="1332"/>day for each authority. That share issue will reflect the transfer of assets. Section 10 includes standard provisions for the share capital of public limited companies established under statute. The proposed amendment is not consistent with the policy underlining the Bill, namely that the Cork and Shannon Airport authorities will be established as soon as possible after the passing of the Bill and will be responsible for business planning and the other functions provided for in section 8, in advance of the appointed days. Companies legislation uses the figure of 38,100 to cover minimum share capital. I am not sure who calculated it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 14, subsection (1), line 30, to delete &ldquo;Each&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;After the relevant appointed days each&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This concerns a similar issue, namely to clarify the position of staff. The Minister has made clear that, in effect, the staff will be working to the interim boards of the new companies between now and next April. When exactly will the new companies appoint staff? This is relevant to the guarantees given to the existing staff in section 12. At what point do people working for Aer Rianta start working to the new companies?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The general approach to staffing issues in section 12 is to provide for the standard enabling powers regarding the appointment of staff including some minor powers to hire staff to be given to Cork and Shannon before the appointed days, combined with a range of specific provisions covering the transfer of staff to Cork and Shannon after the appointed days, and the future terms and conditions of staff at all three airports. Section 12 was discussed extensively with trade union representatives, and was debated during the passage of the Bill through D&aacute;il. Arising from these discussions, additional <Col N="1333"/>provisions have been included, and amendments made, to address the concerns raised. The Minister has therefore made every possible effort to address these in a reasonable and balanced way. Section 12, as it now reads, provides very adequately for the position of staff at the airports.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 concern enabling provisions at subsections (1) to (3), inclusive, each of which gives to the airports the power to appoint staff as they see fit. These are standard provisions covering the appointment of staff. The effect of the proposed amendments would be that the authorities could not appoint staff in their own right until after the relevant appointed day. In the case of Dublin this is unnecessary as the Dublin Airport authority will be established only on the Dublin appointed day and, therefore, this provision will be effective only from that day. In the cases of Cork and Shannon, however, it is considered appropriate that these companies have the power to take on at least a few staff during the transitional phase. It is expected that in considering such appointments and their terms and conditions, the authorities will have careful regard to their remit during this transition period.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 35 is not necessary as the wording is sufficiently clear. As regards amendment No. 36, section 12(6) is designed to provide a workable mechanism for addressing any disputes which may arise regarding the allocation of staff. The subsection allows for consultation with recognised trade unions and staff associations and it is envisaged that these consultations would have a bearing on the final decision made by the Dublin Airport authority. The subsection also includes the added safeguard of allowing the Minister to set criteria to be applied in resolving a dispute. In requiring the agreement of the trade unions and staff associations before staff could be designated, the substitute section could be very difficult to operate in practice with a possibility of protracted and open-ended disputes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am still unclear as to the position of staff recruited between now and the appointed days. Are they to be considered residual Aer Rianta staff who will get the benefit of the protections set out in section 12?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very detailed question, the response to which I must check carefully. Anybody who works for Aer Rianta remains there with the newly named Dublin authority until the changeover date, 30 April 2005, at the earliest. Then, subject to all the checks and balances built in, including the agreement of the Oireachtas, staff would transfer. There will be no staff transfers before 30 April 2005 at the earliest and then only after the checks and balances have been observed, if that is the will of the House, and the relevant Ministers are satisfied. I assume those conditions will cover staff taken on in the ordinary way. If the Senator permits me to double-check that, I will respond to him. I assume that would be the case.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1334"/>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said relatively few would be taken on in the interim. It would be of some importance to those individuals to know where they stand. The Minister also said they would in effect be employed by the interim boards and therefore, presumably, not form part of the staff at Dublin Airport authority and not explicitly get the benefit of the statutory guarantees here. It is important for anyone employed between now and next April to know that he or she is working in a grade comparable to those who already work with the company.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a significant difference between temporary, seasonal and permanent staff and that distinction will remain. Temporary staff will not be covered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that. Will people employed when these companies are set up, and next April or whenever the appointed day comes, be considered employees of Dublin Airport authority, then to be transferred to each of the three companies and enjoy the benefits of section 12(6) or 12(7)?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Subject to checking, if they are taken on in a permanent capacity, they will transfer to the authority of the airport to which they are assigned. That must be negotiated. If one is taken on in Shannon Airport tomorrow as permanent staff under all the normal trade union consultative arrangements, I assume one is then a member of the staff at that airport and whatever the legislation says about staff at that time must be worked through. In other words, one will transfer to the Shannon Airport authority after the end of April 2005.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister on this section because the shared services section in Aer Rianta employs many staff in the Shannon area and it is important that it be handled carefully. I would be concerned if there was any effort to transfer people from Shannon to Dublin. I know many of the staff members who live in the region and have mortgages and families there. We need flexibility and I am delighted to see that the decision will be taken in consultation with the unions and the worker-directors and the people concerned for the best interests of the staff. I welcome the provision for the Minister to set criteria because broad criteria may be needed, to include more than simply the business elements. Flexible criteria are required to accommodate people living in the area who have mortgages and young families. It would be inconsiderate to transfer them from Shannon to Cork or Dublin.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue I raised has not been resolved. I was confused by the Minister&rsquo;s initial response that it is appropriate for the interim boards to have the power to hire between now and the appointed day. This implies that those hired would be in limbo and not employees of <Col N="1335"/>Dublin Airport authority which has guarantees under the provisions of the Bill. As employees of the interim board, they would be in an in-between situation. In that instance, they might not have a guarantee that their conditions would be maintained. I would be happy if the Minister would put it on the record that the conditions of people employed by the interim boards will be maintained after the appointed date.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>I am trying to give the Senator clarity on this matter. Aer Rianta personnel who remain in Dublin or transfer to Cork and Shannon are covered under section 12(9) and section 12(12) which reassure them their terms and conditions will not be lessened.</P>
    <P>I am informed that personnel of Cork, Shannon and Dublin authorities who are recruited directly will not be covered under section 12(9) and section 12(12). However, I will get further clarification on this matter before we conclude.</P>

  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 not moved.</P>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 15, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(9) Any superannuation benefits awarded to or in respect of a person who was assigned or transferred to Aer Rianta from the Department of Transport and Power under Office Notice 4/68 and the terms and conditions relating to those benefits shall not be less reasonable than the entitlements existing immediately before accepting Aer Rianta conditions of employment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">When Aer Rianta was established in 1968 the Department at that time was the Department of Transport and Power. Some people transferred from that Department to Aer Rianta. Aer Rianta assumed responsibility for the management of Shannon and Cork Airports on 1 April 1969, but negotiations relating to the acceptance of Aer Rianta conditions took years to conclude. This is in compliance with the term of notice 4/68. The majority of staff signed up to Aer Rianta in 1973 and 1974. In the meantime Civil Service pension conditions were revised and approved in January 1972. Therefore, it is important the proposed amendment takes account of the matter. A small number of people are out of pocket by &euro;5,000 to &euro;10,000 in their pension as a result. Can the Minister clarify how many people are affected and the amount of money in terms of pensions? Can the position be rectified without this amendment being pressed? As Senator White mentioned the then Minister of Transport and Power, Mr. Childers, was involved in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is usual. It is interesting to note that people who transferred to Aer Rianta were given a pension that was one eightieth of their retiring salary for each year of service and a lump sum of one thirtieth of retiring salary for each year of service. Things have changed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this issue on Second Stage. Similar representations were made to me regarding the small number of personnel who transferred from the former Department of Transport and Power to Aer Rianta in 1969. They feel that as a result of this legislation their pensions will decrease by the amounts mentioned. It will also affect widows and other pensioners. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position as it is a cause for concern.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for moving this amendment. Senator Daly raised the matter on Second Stage yesterday and has pressed the point with me on many occasions. I considered the issue overnight and I understand that a representative of a small group of Aer Rianta pensioners who transferred to the company from the Civil Service in the early 1970s wrote to the Secretary General of the Department of Transport highlighting an anomaly in their pension scheme. Departmental officials examined the issue and concluded that a change to these pension provisions was not required. However, I am not opposed to officials re-examining the issue. As it has been raised on Committee Stage I will urgently look into the matter to see how the Department can be of help. The issue has no connection with the proposed legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We will discuss amendments Nos. 38, and 39 to 44, inclusive, together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 15, lines 39 to 45, to delete subsection (9) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(9) Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union or staff association concerned, a person in the employment of Aer Rianta, before the Dublin appointed day or who is transferred to the Shannon or Cork Airport Authorities on the relevant appointed day, shall be brought to no less beneficial conditions of service or remuneration (including conditions in relation to tenure of office) than the conditions of service or remuneration (including conditions in relation to tenure of office) to which he or she was subject immediately before the relevant appointed day.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The amendments relate to section 12 which deals with the existing workforce&rsquo;s terms of conditions of employment. There is a need to clarify the nature of consultation and negotiation with the trade unions. The terms and conditions of employment of existing workers are guaranteed. Are they guaranteed <i>ad infinitum</i> or until such time as there is agreement with the trade unions to change them? As it stands, it is intended that the boards will meet with the trade unions within a short period of time to renegotiate the terms and conditions of employment of the existing workforce. Subsection (12) specifically requires consultation with regard to terms and conditions of employment for a period of six months following the enactment of the Bill. Three of the proposed amendments seek to tighten this provision and require that the negotiation period is extended six months from the appointed day, namely the date on which staff are transferred. The amendments seek to ensure there will be a requirement of agreement with the trade unions before new terms and conditions of employment are established, rather than just providing for consultation with the trade unions which could be perfunctory. It is not clear what will happen should the parties fail to reach agreement within the required six-month period. Will the power to set conditions revert to management? I assume it will. In that instance, is management bound by a guarantee given in an earlier subsection that they cannot worsen the conditions of employment of individual workers? If management is not bound by that guarantee, then the guarantee is only effective for six months. That is not worth a great deal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael is concerned about this section of the Bill, and we have tabled amendment No. 43 to counteract it. We feel there is a mistake in the Bill and the amendment reads &ldquo;In page 16, subsection (12), line 31, to delete &rdquo;(4)&ldquo; <Col N="1338"/>and substitute &rdquo;(3)&ldquo;.&rdquo; The main difficulty is that subsection (4) deals with worker-directors while subsection (3) deals with the pay and conditions of the chief executive. This is a technical mistake in the Bill. We have received legal advice to the effect that the Bill is fundamentally flawed and is in conflict with the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 and requires amendment. We will push this to a vote because there is a flaw in the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsection (9) referred to by Senator McDowell has been very carefully crafted after extensive discussions with trade unions. Every word was carefully negotiated through a number of long nights. I am satisfied it is balanced in guaranteeing that staff will not be brought to any less beneficial conditions of service or remuneration, including conditions in regard to tenure of office, than those to which they were subject immediately before the relevant appointed date. That section gives substantial protection to staff.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 43 is not necessary because the drafting in section 12(12) is in order. The reference to section 29(4) of the 1998 Act is correct as this refers to the position before &ldquo;the Dublin appointed day&rdquo;. The new text of section 29, as inserted by paragraph 14 of the Schedule, only applies after that day so, therefore, that matter is correct. Overall, section 12 is designed to give maximum protection to existing workers at our three State airports. If the Seanad agrees, they will now have a statutory undertaking that they cannot do worse than they are currently doing. Many of us around here would love to have that guarantee.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am still not quite clear that the guarantee set out in section 12(9) is as solid as the Minister clearly believes it is. The subsection states: &ldquo;Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union.&rdquo; It then goes on to state that the conditions of workers will be no worse than they had been. However, section 12(11) states that without prejudice to subsection (9) the form of any new collective agreement shall be the subject of discussion for a period of not more than six months. What it does not say is what happens in the event that there is no agreement within that period of six months. It appears to envisage that there will be agreement on new terms and conditions within six months, but that is by no means a given. Neither is it clear whether the guarantee is only good for six months. It is possible to infer that, having sat down with the trade unions for six months and having failed to reach agreement, management would take back the power to establish the terms and conditions. That may not be governed by subsection (9) which on the face of it appears to give guarantees.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Minister&rsquo;s response to amendment No. 43 and the issue raised yesterday <Col N="1339"/>in the drafting section, whether it is before the commencement day is not the issue. The issue is a direct reference to the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998. A clear mistake has been made. With respect to the Minister, he has explained away the drafting mistake in terms of whether it is before the day or after the day but that is not the point.</P>
    <P>This is not a major issue but it is clear that if there is a reference to the role of the chief executives of each of these companies, it needs to be correct. One of the few tasks we have in this House is to ensure that where legislation is passed, it is not flawed. The advice given to our party on the matter was clear; there is a drafting error. Yesterday the Minister said that having consulted his own legal advisers in the Department of Transport and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, he was satisfied there is not a problem. However, it is clear that the reference is incorrect and I do not see why the Minister has a difficulty in amending it now. The difficulty probably relates to the fact that it would have to go back to the other House for approval and the Bill would not be passed until such time as the other House would ratify the amendment. We have a duty to ensure that when we pass Bills they are accurate. The Minister&rsquo;s explanation is not on the ball. It does not refer to the substance of Senator Browne&rsquo;s amendment. There is a role for the Parliamentary Counsel in this legislation. The House cannot pass Bills that are defective, even if the defect is relatively insignificant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been waiting to contribute on this matter which was highlighted in newspapers yesterday. Following from that I telephoned Ms Lane, the Clerk of the Seanad, who advised me to telephone the Office of the Attorney General. In the course of my investigations I learned yesterday that Matheson Ormsby Prentice had drafted the Bill. A Minister is entitled to bring a Bill to an outside body, although it is very rarely done and I never did so. In pursuit of his duty, the Attorney General must stamp each Bill which comes before Cabinet and he duly stamped the Bill at a late stage. I am also of the belief that this is a clear error. That is not to cast any slight upon Matheson Ormsby Prentice; its workers are not draftsmen from the office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel but an outside firm of solicitors. We want this point to be publicised.</P>
    <P>It is clear there is a deficiency and I say this in sadness rather than anger. This bears out what I said yesterday about the legislation being deficient and faulty, although no doubt we will all be drummed into the lobbies to support it. One of the scant duties we have is to scrutinise legislation. It gives me no joy to say that the legislation is deficient and faulty in section 12(12). The cross reference is to the 1998 Act which I introduced. I took out the Act and studied it this morning to check the reference. It is a drafting <Col N="1340"/>error by the well-known firm, Matheson Ormsby Prentice, which I am sure it would accept. I did not contact the firm because that is not my job but I will when the Bill is passed. This error makes the legislation both deficient and faulty.</P>
    <P>I know a lot about the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and he knows a lot about me. We could each make known a great deal of information about each other and that would go on for ever, although not in my case. Anyway, we will see. We have all of that in common. A fault can occur in any Bill. Even draftsmen of the greatest experience can make a drafting fault. There is a difficulty in that we are not empowered because the Minister must go back to the D&aacute;il. I would like him to listen to this point, please. If we know there is a drafting error and the Minister does not want to go back to the D&aacute;il, where does that leave us? If the staff of Departments and other offices to which I have referred, some of whom I have spoken to, know in their heart of hearts that the error which has been discovered is a genuine drafting error, is it not better to leave it?</P>
    <P>We should be satisfied that we have a proper Bill. If one is a &ldquo;not-content&rdquo;, as they say in the House of Lords, is it not better that the particular drafting error should be addressed now, rather than the Bill being challenged after it has been passed by the House? I repeat that the legislation is deficient and faulty. As Leader of the House, I have a right to point that out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>When I give talks in schools, I am often asked what the Seanad is about. I respond by saying that it is a safety net if things go wrong. I point out that some countries have just one parliamentary chamber, which can be good or bad, and I argue that we have two Houses of Parliament, so that if a faulty Bill is passed by the D&aacute;il we can amend it. Similarly, if a faulty Bill is passed by the Seanad, Deputies can amend it. This is a classic case of a small issue &mdash; it is simply a question of deleting &ldquo;(4)&rdquo; and replacing it with &ldquo;(3)&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I am sure the D&aacute;il can be recalled, with the full co-operation of all concerned, for a quick meeting to ratify any amendments to the Bill, thereby ensuring that Aer Rianta will be able to proceed on 1 September. If such measures are not taken, the Bill might be the subject of a court case and Aer Rianta might have severe difficulties on 1 September.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>The Bill will be challenged.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister accepts amendment No. 43, he will save a great deal of effort and work in the long run.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully acknowledge, as always, the rights and duties of Senators in pointing out what they regard as flaws in legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to state, in the strongest possible terms, that there is no flaw in section 12(12). Senator Browne&rsquo;s amendment No. 43 is not necessary. Section 12(12) was added to the Bill on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to address concerns that the legislation should explicitly provide that employees who continue to work at Dublin Airport &ldquo;after the Dublin appointed day, shall not, while in the service of Dublin Airport Authority, be brought to less beneficial conditions&rdquo; and terms, except by way of a collective agreement.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of clarity, section 12(12) also states that &ldquo;in the case of the person carrying out the duties of the Chief Executive of Aer Rianta&rdquo; &mdash; such a person is also an employee, of course &mdash; the terms and conditions applicable before the Dublin appointed day &ldquo;must be determined in accordance with section 29(4) of the Act of 1998&rdquo;, which is the relevant statutory provision.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill amends the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 with effect from the Dublin appointed day. Accordingly, the reference to section 29(4) of the 1998 Act in section 12(12) of the Bill is correct. The reference to section 29(3) is only applicable after the Dublin appointed day.</P>
    <P>Section 13(8) makes clear that when the Dublin Airport authority is appointing a chief executive officer following an open public competition, it must do so in accordance with section 29 of the 1998 Act, as amended by the Schedule to this Bill. That will take place after the Dublin appointed day.</P>
    <P>I wish to state clearly that the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and our outside legal advisors deliberately drafted section 12(12) in this way. There is no question of going back to spot an error, or suddenly having to amend the section. The wording of the section is the result of deliberate drafting on the part of the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and our outside advisors, all of whom concur exactly with what I am saying here. <Col N="1342"/>There is no flaw whatsoever in section 12(12) that needs to be amended in the manner proposed in amendment No. 43. That is included in the stamped copy of the Bill provided to me by the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel and our outside advisers.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge fully the rights and duties of Senators in indicating where they believe problems may exist. My job is to explain the situation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stayed close to his script in giving an explanation that was convoluted, to say the least. If this matter comes before a court, I do not doubt that the judge will simply refer to the last line of section 12(12). He or she will find that a mistake has been made, but there is no unintended mistake in that. It is beyond me to understand why the Minister has chosen not to amend section 12(12) at this stage, especially given the clear mistake and omission in the last sentence of the section. The section in question has been referred to by many Senators on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The problem was highlighted yesterday by the Leader of the House, who said that the legislation is &ldquo;rushed&rdquo;. One glitch has been spotted now, but how many other glitches are in the Bill? The Minister might consider that it is ultimately a matter for the courts to decide at some time in the future. It may be that another Minister is responsible for the issue at that time because there will be a Cabinet reshuffle after the summer. It is not good enough that the Minister has not conceded the point that has been made by Senators on all sides of the House and amended the legislation accordingly.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Two net issues are being discussed here. The first issue, which I was attempting to highlight, is the question of whether the guarantee in section 12(9) will survive a failure to come to an agreement after a six-month consultation period. We did not really clarify that matter, as we diverted into the other issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I meant to come back to that. Section 12(9) includes a guarantee that a person cannot &ldquo;be brought to less beneficial conditions of service&rdquo; or employment, &ldquo;save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union&rdquo;. Section 12(11) provides for negotiations for a period &ldquo;of not more than 6 months from the passing of this Act&rdquo;. The best way to explain it is to say that there will not be a diminution of terms and conditions unless there is a collective agreement. The Bill provides for a period of six months for such an agreement to be reached. Section 12(11) establishes in legislation the principle of collective bargaining, which was <Col N="1343"/>sought during the negotiations on the Bill with the trade union movement. The words on which we should focus are &ldquo;save in accordance with a collective agreement&rdquo;. The employees in question cannot be worse off in the absence of such an agreement. I presume that any agreement worth its salt will make employees better off, rather than worse off.</P>

   <Title>State Airports Bill 2004: Report and Final Stages.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Seamus Brennan. Before we commence, I remind the House that Senators may speak only once on Report Stage, except for the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on it. Each amendment must be seconded on Report Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 15, to delete lines 9 to 18 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;(6) Where any dispute arises in relation to whether a person or a group of persons is working wholly or mainly in connection with Cork Airport or Shannon Airport or where it cannot be determined whether a person or group of persons works wholly or mainly in connection with one or other of the state airports or in shared services, Dublin Airport Authority, following agreement with the appropriate recognised trade union or staff association shall designate the appropriate employer for the person or group of persons concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I re-entered amendment No. 1 from this morning to allow the Minister to clarify the point we discussed on Report Stage regarding employees who were effectively taken on by the interim boards in the period which are now the appointed days.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I promised the Senator I would check that matter and I will furnish the House the information <Col N="1346"/>before me. First, everyone who is a member of staff of Aer Rianta, before the Dublin appointed day, and continues as a member of staff of the Dublin Airport authority, is covered by section 12(12). Second, everyone who is working mainly in connection with Cork and Shannon Airports and who transfers on the Cork and Shannon appointed days, are covered by section 12(9). These people would include personnel in shared services under subsection (5) and anyone designated under subsection (6). Finally, personnel recruited directly by Dublin, Cork or Shannon authorities, who do not fall into the above<?oasys [jy?>categories, are not covered by sections 12(9) or 12(12).</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 24, line 44, after &ldquo;offered&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;to appropriate international standards&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with the section that sets out the various issues which the regulator may take into account in setting the landing charges at Dublin Airport. It is regrettable we did not have a greater opportunity to discuss this section on Committee Stage because it has serious implications for the way in which the regulator is obliged to go about his or her business in the future. The essence of the business so far, in the first two or three years of the regulation system, has been for the regulator simply to look at the assets of the company and decide what sort of return on these is reasonable in the circumstances. The Minister would be aware that under section 22 a whole range of additional features may now be considered in setting charges, including, for example, Government policy. The inevitable result of this will be that landing charges will possibly increase by a substantial amount and probably relatively soon.</P>
    <P>The amendment deals with paragraph (<i>e</i>) on page 24 of the Bill, which deals with the level of service to be provided at Dublin Airport and which the regulator is to take into account when setting the charges the airport may make. It is important that, rather than providing that services are merely &ldquo;offered&rdquo;, the provision specifies <Col N="1347"/>that the services at Dublin, the country&rsquo;s primary airport, should be maintained to the best international standards, that the regulator should take that into account and allow charges, as appropriate, to ensure services are maintained accordingly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator knows, the regulator must take a whole range of issues into account. I see what he is trying to add here, but it is not necessary in the sense that, as a matter of course, the commission and the regulator would take appropriate international standards into account. I am satisfied the section is widely drafted and encompasses the consideration of appropriate international standards. It would be wrong not to do so. I am also satisfied the commission would take international standards into account in reaching any determination.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We are constrained by the process we have to go through here, but what we are seeking to do does not necessarily flow from what the Minister has said because I believe the aviation regulator has taken a view recently that the investment intended by Aer Rianta at Dublin Airport was excessive and that it should not be entitled to take into account the full cost of its intended investment when setting landing charges. It is not inconceivable that the regulator could decide that the service was adequate at a certain level, whereas the airport might aspire to provide a better standard of service to customers. It is necessarily a given, but I do not intend to press the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 27, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">&ldquo;25&mdash;The European Communities (Access to the Groundhandling market at Community Airports) Regulations 1998 are amended in Article 14(3) by the deletion of &lsquo;and approved by the Minister in advance&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I move this amendment in response to representations made to my colleague, Deputy Shortall. It is in regard to installation charges more generally, not just landing charges at the airport. As a result of recent court decisions, a range of charges, including ground baggage handling charges, may now be imposed by Aer Rianta under EU regulations. The Minister&rsquo;s consent appears to be required for some of these charges but not for others. Will the Minister clarify this? One or other procedure should operate. The consent of the Minister should be required for all such charges, or it should not be required for any <Col N="1348"/>charge. This amendment seeks that the Minister&rsquo;s consent should not be required, but it is desirable that there should be clarity as to which charges require the Minister&rsquo;s consent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commission has been working on an amending directive which will be submitted to the Council of Ministers of Transport in the near future. The new directive will amend the existing Council Directive 96/67/EC on which the 1998 regulations are based. When the amending directive is adopted by the Council, further regulation will be needed to transpose its provisions into Irish law. At that stage I will be prepared to consider sympathetically the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion for removing the need for prior approval by the aviation regulator as suggested in this amendment. That would be the appropriate time to deal with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Schedule&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no amendments to the Schedule. Only amendments on Report Stage may be discussed.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that we did not have an opportunity to debate the Schedule, I wish to raise the issue of the borrowing limits set down under section 6 thereof. The limit set down for Shannon Airport authority is &euro;20 million. This has caused concern that it might constrain the board in what it can do. It is also provided in the Schedule that the Dublin Airport authority will appoint authorised officers to Shannon and Cork. Will they remain in office when the new authorities take over at Shannon and Cork or will Shannon and Cork appoint their own officers? People appointed by the Dublin authority might not be acceptable to Shannon and Cork.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the borrowing level, the figure of &euro;20 million was deemed appropriate by the Minister for Finance, myself and the Government in our discussions on the draft legislation. I confirm that it can be amended by order under section 36 of the 1998 Act. That figure can, therefore, be changed with the consent of the Minister and the authority could, if appropriate, request that it wants the ceiling raised. Borrowing limits are always the preserve of the Minister for Finance and this should not be seen as anything other than a technical arrangement in terms of Shannon.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1349"/>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for facilitating the House in debating at length and in considerable detail the provisions of the Bill. The Bill was seen as somewhat controversial, and it is very technical and complex in many ways. By being here throughout all Stages, including the full extent of Second Stage yesterday, the Minister has shown his commitment to this House. He has allayed the fears of many in this House, including myself, and has answered the questions that were raised. I thank him and his officials for making themselves available to Senators over the past weeks to discuss in considerable detail the many issues this legislation raised. Notwithstanding my concerns regarding the Bill, I believe it creates tremendous opportunities for Shannon and Cork Airports to take on the challenges that exist. They are by no means simple challenges, but the airports will now have the capacity to move forward in a way that will build on the business and tourism links in their area and ensure that the regions can continue to grow and develop along the lines set out in various Government strategies.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators on the other side of the House who have facilitated the debate on this Bill in every possible way. I again thank the Minister for clarifying the issues, and his staff for their assistance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everyone involved in the debate on the Bill. I thank the Leader for arranging the extra sittings this week. They were of benefit to everyone concerned. It would have been inappropriate to have had late sittings last week to rush this legislation through the House. We have discussed many aspects of the Bill in great detail. While we did not amend it, we managed to obtain clarification on many issues and, in the process, draw attention to a few other problems. We are all wiser now.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his courtesy and patience. It is remarkable that he stayed here yesterday for the full five or six hours. Some of his colleagues would not spend a fraction of that time in the House. It shows great respect to the House and its Members. Perhaps we are so interesting that he enjoyed staying here. I also thank the officials for their courtesy during the debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael was never opposed to giving autonomy to the airports at Cork and Shannon. However, we had grave concerns about some aspects of the Bill and we outlined them today. I suspect we will be proved right about some aspects. All we can do is wait and see and hope the new boards will formulate proper business plans that will allow the airports to develop and grow.</P>
    <P>I might not be back here in the autumn as spokesperson on transport as a reshuffle is due. Perhaps the Minister will not be here either as <Col N="1350"/>Minister for Transport. Nor might a few more people be here in their current guise, given the round of applause last night.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Speculation is not appropriate in this debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Either way, I look forward to coming back in the autumn and, whether I am official spokesperson on transport, I will maintain a keen interest in the area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in thanking the Minister for the courtesy he has extended to the House. I also thank the Leader for the sterling leadership she has given to the Opposition over the past few days. There were times when we felt entirely redundant, when the Government seemed more than capable of providing its own opposition.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important. The Labour Party&rsquo;s opposition to it is largely based on our view of it as the thin end of the wedge, as a portent of things to come of which we are likely to be a good deal less supportive. There are obvious concerns, particularly for Shannon. It will be necessary to set up the company in a way that ensures it will be viable into the future. I do not believe we have all the pieces of the jigsaw in place yet. There is certainly much work to be done between now and the so-called appointed days. I wish the Minister well. It is important from everyone&rsquo;s point view, particularly the point of view of the mid-western region generally, that he gets it right. I hope he does so without doing irreparable damage to the company as a whole. We must respect what is left, the still important business of maintaining and running Dublin Airport. It is important that the new companies are set up in a way that does not do violence to its capacity to do that. We are also conscious of the implications for Aer Rianta International, the Great Southern Hotels and so on. We are taking a leap into the dark and it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that it works out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister on behalf of the Progressive Democrats for bringing this Bill before the Seanad. This legislation is about bringing competition to the regions and to monopolies which have not had such competition heretofore. We are not defeatist about the Bill. We thank the Minister for his courage in taking it on and wish him well in his further reforms of the transport sector in particular.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Seanad for taking the Bill this week. As I said last night, I was wrong to suggest last week that we should deal with it then. Given the number of contributions made, it would have been wrong to rush it through last week. It was a good idea to take the extra time this week to deal with it. I am glad wiser people decided the Seanad should meet to debate the <Col N="1351"/>Bill properly. I have learned a great deal from the debate and appreciate Senators&rsquo; remarks.</P>
    <P>I thank the officials from the Department of Transport and other Departments who have put an enormous amount of work into this legislation. The level of detail and advice, financial and legal, has been enormous. I thank the Cathaoirleach and his staff for their patience and courtesy. I thank in particular the spokesperson who carried the debate. I also wish to say, and this is not just a platitude, that I listened to what has been said and in so far as I can as the process moves forward I will seek to instil in the boards going forward Senators&rsquo; and Deputies wishes as expressed in both Houses.</P>
    <P>I thank the staff of Aer Rianta for their many years of work. There is a great deal more to do albeit within different structures. Nonetheless it is work for Irish airports. I thank the staff on behalf of the Government and myself for their work in this regard. I thank the Leader of the House for her contributions. Since entering politics at the age of 25 or 26 years, I have always tried to ensure my differences with others are on policy matters. Those who know me know I fight for policies in which I believe. I do not have per<Col N="1352"/>sonal differences with anybody, particularly colleagues in my own party. I have nothing but admiration for the Leader of the House. My differences are policy ones. I have always fought hard and as long as people support me, I will continue to fight hard for the policies in which I believe. However, that does not mean I am fighting those who disagree with me on policies. I have always made that distinction and always will.</P>
    <P>This is only the beginning. There is much more to be done. It is a fresh start about which I am optimistic. However, I am deeply conscious that we must all work for the cause of bettering the country. That is what we do in framing legislation and asking the Houses to endorse it. I thank Members for the consideration they have given this legislation and for the courtesy shown to me during its passage.</P>
