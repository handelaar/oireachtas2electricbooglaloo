      <P>In sub-section (2), page 4, to insert before paragraph (c) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  the words &ldquo;or proves that he was unable to obtain remunerative employment by reason of physical incapacity of a permanent character&rdquo; were inserted after the word &ldquo;upwards&rdquo; where the latter word occurs in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) and.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this recommendation in order to draw the attention of the House to a class of persons who are unduly penalised by the new Budget. When he decided to increase the standard rate of income-tax to 7/6, the Minister decided, quite properly, that some concessions would have to be made to lower income groups, but he confined that not quite but almost entirely to persons with earned incomes. It seems to me that a person with an unearned income which does not exceed £600 and with no other income is definitely a person in the lower income group, and that it is particularly hard at this time that such a person should have his or her income-tax increased to 7/6.  Those people are just as much hit by the removal of the subsidies, or any other possible effects <Col N="1652" /> of the taxes which were intended to be met, in part at any rate, by special concessions to persons with an earned income.  It seems to me to be rather a pity that the Minister could not see his way to do something for persons in the lower income groups whose incomes are below a moderate figure, £600 or £800.  He took £800 in the case of persons with an earned income in order to give this special concession.</P>
    <P>The actual recommendation I have put down concentrates only on one quite small section, though the section itself deals with the allowances.  There was an amendment introduced in the Dáil which I welcome and of which I would like to express approval.  It increased the limit from £500 to £600 in the case of persons over 65 who had an earned income.  It seems to me that if you make that concession to persons over 65&mdash;they are, presumably, persons who saved money and who are living on earned income as a result of their own savings or the savings of near relatives&mdash;it would be only right and reasonable that if a person is not 65 but has retired because of permanent disability which has made him unfit to earn an income by means of his own labour, a similar concession should be made.  I know that there are difficulties in regard to making any concession at this stage on a Finance Bill.  This is not a Party matter in any sense but a matter to which the attention of the House and the Minister should be drawn.  If the Minister does not do it now, I think it should be done by him or some other Minister in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal by Senator Douglas would strike at the whole principle upon which a differentiation in favour of earned income is based.  The assumption in relation to earned income is this, that it is by its very nature precarious; it depends upon a man's ability to continue to earn. Therefore, it assumes that, being prudent, he will deprive himself of the enjoyment of some part of his real income, his earned income, in order to insure himself against the vicissitudes to which a person engaged in earning his daily bread must inevitably be subject. <Col N="1653" /> On that basis we differentiate in favour of income which is earned, earned by day-to-day effort out of which provision can only be made for the future by a process of self-deprivation and self-restraint.</P>
      <P>A person who enjoys an investment income is in quite a different position. If his investment income is substantial, the capital from which that investment is derived is substantial, too, and, to the extent to which the investment may be considered to be a good investment, the income of the owner of the investment is secure.  It is not subject to the exigencies of ordinary everyday life such as in the case of a person who is employed or who is himself an employer but who is engaged in a daily occupation in order to provide himself with a living.</P>
      <P>The question of what is known as the age relief which we have given has been mentioned.  That relief has been based on the broad assumption that in a great majority of cases the income which is enjoyed after a person has reached the age of 65 is, in fact, deferred earned income&mdash;income which accrues to the person who enjoys it as a result of savings made in the period during which he was earning.  Like all other broad assumptions, that assumption may not be correct in every case. We assumed that, broadly and generally, it is correct.  Therefore, when we increased the earned income relief in the present Budget it seemed equitable to extend that concession to this class of retired persons&mdash;persons who are assumed to have retired from active occupation and to be living on an income derived from past savings.</P>
      <P>When we are considering reliefs and concessions under the income-tax code, we can deal only with broad, general classes.  It is quite easy to differentiate between earned income and income which is derived otherwise&mdash;mainly from investments in land, property or industry.  These are broad categories. Income, quite clearly, can be ascribed to one or other of these categories and it is easy, convenient and practical to differentiate between income which, on the one hand, is earned and, on the other hand, which is derived from investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Once we get into the question of incapacity of a permanent character, the matter becomes very difficult indeed.  I think it would practically be impossible to administer it.  It is not so certain that a particular individual is completely and permanently incapacitated. After all, a person may not have the use of his hands or even the use of his eyes, but who is to say that such a person has not the use of his mental faculties and that he would not be in a position to earn? The more this proposal is examined the more manifest, I think, is the difficulty of administering it.  For that reason, I think the Seanad should not make this recommendation.  Certainly, I could not undertake to ask the Dáil to accept such a recommendation if the Seanad were to see its way to make it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often remarked on the unchanging character of Ministers for Finance.  The Minister said to-day that this amendment raises administrative difficulties and that, for that reason, he was against it.  For the same reason, the Minister is against fractions and against everything but very simple arithmetic.  He began his speech on a very high line: he spoke about principles.  In the end, he abandoned principles altogether and came down to the real objection, namely, that it might be a difficult matter to administer.  The principle which the Minister mentioned&mdash;he entirely ignored the new facts, facts which are not so very new either&mdash;was that unearned income is more certain than earned income.  Surely it is not so?  The difference, in this connection, between the position which obtained when I was a boy and the present situation is that nobody could possibly be as well off now as a man with some kind of a job, whereas long ago the reverse was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the old days, if people saved money they were sure of a certain income from it.  Nothing is more insecure now than invested capital and the dividends thereon.  The idea that a man with a pension is in an insecure position while the man who has dividends or capital is in a secure position is quite absurd.  The Minister's objection <Col N="1655" /> on principle has no foundation in fact.  He seemed to have a glimmering of that himself.  He said he was basing his case on the fact that the investments were good and that, to that extent, they would be secure.  That argument is quite foolish.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that one of the poorer classes of the community now is composed of people over 65 years of age, who have no pension and who are living on dividends.  These people are in a very bad position.  The removal of subsidies, for example, and the rise in the cost of living&mdash;I do not want to make a point of that&mdash;no matter how caused, hits those people very hard and, as a general rule, their income is a falling income instead of a rising income.  I think that the previous Minister for Finance recognised that position by giving certain concessions to people over 65 years of age who are living on unearned income. This recommendation endeavours to put into the same category people who cannot obtain employment because of incapacity of a certain character.</P>
    <P>We have seen all kinds of administrative difficulties overcome, and I suggest that the difficulty in this connection could be overcome too.  This recommendation should not be rejected because of administrative difficulties, and most certainly it should not be rejected on the basis of any principle so foolish as that people who are living on dividends&mdash;a small amount of dividends, for example&mdash;are in a more secure position than people with wages or pensions.  Whether that is good or bad leads to a wide scope of debate. My desire is to stress the fact that people of this particular category are in a very pitiful position.</P>
    <P>I do not know very many of them but there are some old people or people who cannot work and they are in a very lamentable position.  Their capital is dwindling and their dividends are dwindling and the Minister knows that thoroughly well because, in his position as Minister for Finance, he has ample opportunity for ascertaining these matters.  He could have given this recommendation a much <Col N="1656" /> more sympathetic handling than to allege that it is a breach of principles which are in themselves unsound or throw out the very ancient and hoary line that it offers administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are no administrative difficulties recognised by the commissioners when they want to get money. There never were.  That is all to the credit of the Revenue Commissioners. They will get your money under any circumstances and under any form of legislation.  That is their work and that is what they are there for, but if you look for any concession they will write you a seven-page memorandum saying there are administrative difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Hayes in this respect.  The people to whom Senator Hayes has referred have to save in face of the continuing depreciation in the value of money.  Money has depreciated so much during the century that saving is discouraged.  I think the Minister should grant the concession to those people who have to save in order to provide for their old age.</P>
      <P>There is another small section of the community in respect of whom something should be done.  I am referring to the widow whose husband has died and has to look after a family.  In looking after that family she has to work very much harder than the people who are put in the category of the earned income group.  If such a woman is living on unearned income, in order to bring up the children, I think this State, which is a Christian State, ought to do something for her. The number of such people is not large and any concession to them would get support from every section of the community. This woman works possibly 12 or 14 hours a day to support her children and yet the State comes along and says that the work that widow is doing does not constitute earned income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have included widows in this recommendation, if I had enough technical knowledge as to how they could be described in a simple amendment.  I did not make <Col N="1657" /> any serious effort to draw up a recommendation in the form which the draftsman would ultimately make because I knew that if this House accepted the recommendation it could easily be put in order later.</P>
      <P>I am not quite prepared to agree with the Minister's criticism of my wording when he said that the words</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or proves that he was unable to obtain remunerative employment by reason of physical incapacity of a permanent character&rdquo;</P>
      <P>might not apply to a blind person or a person who lost both hands.  I cannot conceive of any Revenue Commissioners claiming, under any circumstances, that a person who is disabled by loss of sight or of a hand was not permanently incapacitated because somebody might pay them as a reward for their brainwork.  I think the Minister was carrying the thing far too far.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally and underlying this amendment which deals only with one section of the people in whom I am interested&mdash;the whole section does deal with them&mdash;I do not agree with the Minister that at the present time when dealing with lower income groups of £400, £500 or £600 having an earned income as distinct from an unearned income justifies a differentiation of anything like a 25 per cent. concession.  I am not sure that it is justified at all.  I do not think that where you consider large unearned incomes which must, as the Minister says, represent a very substantial capital investment that there is a clear case for a substantial differentiation. My plea is that the State should take into consideration the people with low incomes.  Remember that an income of, say, £500 now is not more than £250 before the war. It is really a small income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister when he says that they are excluded from concessions because it is a principle to deal only with a general class. My object in concentrating on the people covered by my recommendation was in the somewhat vague hope that the Minister would regard these people as of a general class with the persons <Col N="1658" /> of over 65 years of age.  In this country and in all countries there are a very substantial number of persons mainly, civil servants and those employed by large firms who do not have to save for their disablement or for old age because they are entitled to pensions. I do not think that these pensions are at all precarious.  They are nearly always guaranteed by insurance companies in the case of firms and we are not uneasy that the State will not meet its pension liabilities.</P>
    <P>The best incentive for saving is to save something to provide against old age or disablement.  That is a greater incentive than anything else.  I am suggesting to the Minister that the principle of a concession similar to the earned income allowance has been accepted for persons over 65.  I am suggesting that the concessions should apply to persons who have not reached 65 and who are living on invested saving and who are disabled.  I think they ought to be included.  I am not arguing that my wording is perfect but it is sufficient to make clear what I want and think should be considered. In spite of the Minister's attitude, I hope he will carefully consider the matter.  I know of one or two cases&mdash; cases which brought this matter to my notice&mdash;where it will be very hard for these people to have to pay increased costs for food while at the same time income tax is at a standard of 7/6d.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am on my feet, I might take the opportunity to correct here for the benefit of the record a statement which I see on reading it is not quite accurate.  It is a statement I made in the Dáil.  It is one which I made under a misapprehension as to the point <Col N="1659" /> which had been raised.  We were talking on the Final Stage of the Finance Bill in Dáil Eireann when Deputy Dockrell put me a query which I quite frankly misunderstood.  I thought the query related to something which had been raised privately by another person.</P>
    <P>The point which Deputy Dockrell raised related to taxpayers who, in this country, are obliged to pay tax on their full profits from businesses carried on abroad.  The Deputy stated that in Great Britain the liability for tax was confined to taxes on the profits which were remitted.  In my reply I said that I had a great deal of sympathy with the taxpayers, that I indicated that I thought the matter could be dealt with administratively.  Actually, I had in fact, discussed this matter with the Revenue Commissioners and, on finding that the provisions of the law were as Deputy Dockrell pointed out, I issued directions that the matter should be examined with a view to possible legislation in next year's Finance Bill.  There is a case which is very similar to this where the Revenue Commissioners are able, strictly in accordance with the law, to remove difficulties which certain taxpayers have anticipated would arise, and it was that case which I had in mind when I was replying to Deputy Dockrell.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister inform me how the increased amount of £80 was arrived at in relation to the present value of money? The previous amount was £50.  Was the new amount just an arbitrary amount, or is it worked out statistically to be the proper amount?  What relation has the new amount to the previous amount of £50?  We are all aware that money has altered so much that the allowance should be much greater in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that I can take it that the Minister would agree that this new figure is merely an arbitrary one and that it does not represent the real value which should be allowed taking present day values of money into consideration.  £50 was allowed under the 1944 Act, and a larger sum than £80 should be allowed under the present Act notwithstanding what the Minister said about the allowance of £80 under the Social Welfare Bill, 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance under the 1944 Act was £50 and, under this Act, the Minister is bringing that amount up to £80.  On arriving at this amount, had the Minister in mind the value of money now in comparison to its value in 1944?  The Minister says the allowance under the Social Welfare Act, 1951, will be £80.  I would have thought that the allowance should have been made £90 in this case.</P>

      <P>On sub-section (2) of this section, might I ask the Minister a question?  Can the Minister tell us what will be the effect on transport costs of the proposed increased tax on hydrocarbon light oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how I can possibly answer that question. After all, the cost of transport does not depend solely on the cost of fuel. It depends upon a great many other things, such as rates of wages, conditions of employment, efficiency of management, and the condition of the vehicles in which the fuel is burnt.  In normal circumstances the consequence that flows from an increase in the cost of any essential material is to make people try to see if they can use the material more efficiently.  It would be quite impossible, on the basis of the multiplication table, to give the Senator any worth-while estimate in a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely an estimate could be given of what this particular tax would mean on transport costs. Having given the estimate, the Minister's second point would arise to the effect that there might be possibilities of effecting economies which would offset the increased cost.  The amount of the increase, in my opinion, would be easily ascertainable.  I suggest that the Minister is really humbugging Senator O'Donnell.  I trust that humbugging is a parliamentary word, and that the Senator is not easily humbugged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point arises with regard to this tax increase which, some years ago, would not have arisen at all.  We must bear in mind the fact that this tax will now have an effect upon agriculture which is becoming increasingly mechanised.  Therefore, any increase in this particular duty is having an effect upon agricultural production.  Perhaps the Minister's answer to that is that the farmers should become more efficient and thus offset the increase.  This section will certainly impose a tax upon our agricultural production, and it will tend to retard it.  It will also make transport dearer.  It is no answer to say <Col N="1662" /> that the amount of the increase cannot be calculated and that the effect of the increase will be to bring about greater efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a perfectly innocuous question, namely, what would be the reaction of the proposed increase in hydrocarbon light oil upon public transport costs. I did not ask the Minister to tell me that transport costs were made up of various other factors such as rates of wages, conditions of employment and so on.  I am already aware of that, and the Minister knows that.  I asked the Minister a particular question.  If he could not answer it, I would have accepted the fact.  I did not ask the Minister to inform me that increased costs would have the effect of more efficiency, but only to inform me what would be the amount of the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer did not surprise me.  Rather has it confirmed a suspicion which I have held for a considerable time and that is that the tax put on petrol was based on the proper figures, after proper consideration and with proper knowledge.  The Minister tells us it is impossible to obtain these figures.  The petrol tax has been increased by this Government and by their predecessors to the amount of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>I think that these increases have a far wider effect than the increase in transport costs and in agricultural costs.  They are a definite factor in increasing the cost for manufacturers, commercial travellers and all classes of people.  The people who are affected possibly least are the private motorists with whom nobody has any sympathy at all.  The Minister's statement shows that it is not possible to get the figures which will enable him to know the amount of harm or expense caused, the amount of damage done, by a petrol tax.  It has only one merit&mdash;that it is near the Minister and can be imposed and administered easily.  The Minister's answer is a very good argument against the tax imposed in this section.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That is a point of some importance.  This section is aimed at getting more money spent on beer.  There is no doubt at all about that.  It is not a temperance measure and Senator Colgan cannot lay any balm to his soul that, in supporting this Budget, he is supporting temperance.  He is doing no such thing.  He is supporting the expenditure <Col N="1664" /> of more money on beer by the man who will give less money to his wife to spend on household necessities.</P>

      <P>The Senator is like Deputy MacBride, who thinks of a number and then says: &ldquo;My concept is not based on any statistical data.  I think of a number and, because I think of it, I can proceed, on the basis of having first thought of that number, to deduce anything I like from it.&rdquo; The point would seem to be that the increase in the duty on beer has been followed by a decrease in the consumption of beer.  If that is the case, it must be that the bar-drinker is not spending more on beer but must be continuing to hand over to his wife as much money as before; he is consuming less beer for which, if you like, he is paying more per unit because the State is taking a larger share of what he spends on it.  I do not think the contention put forward by Senator Hayes that, because we have increased the duty on beer we are leaving the man with less to spend on food for himself and his family, can therefore hold.</P>

      <P>What I was trying to get at was that two people are going to suffer as a result of this taxation. If I am correct in my reading of the figures for the past three months, there has been a severe decline in the consumption of beer and spirits generally, and a severe falling off in income to the Exchequer as a result. Further, what is worrying me a good deal is the fact that an increase in unemployment has resulted from the decreased consumption of beer, and I am wondering whether, in view of that position this increased taxation is not going to worsen the position from the treasury and employment point of view, I am not particularly interested in the total abstainers' point of view, but I am interested in the employment aspect, and I am merely posing the argument that I do not think that it will improve the income of the treasury or the employment position.</P>

      <P>With regard to this matter of snuff, I pointed out in my speech on the Second Reading that poor people are suffering a good deal as a result of the increased tobacco tax.  I understand that this snuff is mainly made from the stalks of tobacco which are not consumed in what are known as the king's pipe.  If it were not used for the manufacture of this snuff, it would go back to be destroyed. I should like to explain for the benefit of Senators that the king's pipe, as I understand it, is a chimney attached to the Custom House, where the tobacco that goes back, and for which there is an allowance, is destroyed by fire, so that it cannot be re-used.  I understand that the particular portion of the tobacco which makes snuff is the stalks which would go back to the king's pipe for destruction if it were not used.  This is a hardship, particularly on the older people, old age pensioners and people in institutions.  The Minister might consider the effect of the tax on snuff manufacturers and he might even leave the tax as it was.  This makes a difference of from 2/- to 2/9 an ounce, which is quite a hardship on old people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes, it could be administered, but it could not be administered solely for the benefit of the poor old woman and that is just the point.  I am not suggesting that it could not be administered but I am suggesting that we might lose a great deal of money which could be taken from people who could quite well afford to pay it if we were to look after Senator O'Donnell's poor old woman.  When I say that we might lose it I do not mean that the Exchequer would lose it because the Exchequer has to get revenue and concessions can only be granted to one class of the community at the expense of everyone else.  When Senator Hayes or Senator O'Donnell advocates that we should be kind to people do not forget that that kindness is always at the expense of the general body of taxpayers.</P>
      <P>In any event, this is not a simple matter.  There are all sorts and varieties of snuffs&mdash;aromatic snuff, plain snuff, wet snuff and dry snuff&mdash; and I do not think that we could in present circumstances attempt to ensure that only the people who were in what might be described as penurious circumstances would be benefited by any remission of the duty.</P>

It is then consumed by fire and no duty whatsoever is paid on it.  That is the basis of all snuff&mdash;white snuff, black snuff, wet snuff and dry snuff. I am not interested in the categories of snuff but I do know that if the Minister does not make allowances so that snuff consumers can consume it&mdash; because if the price of snuff goes up consumers cannot go on consuming snuff&mdash;the stalk will be consumed in the king's pipe and he will lose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I recommend that this section be deleted from the Bill.  On the Minister's case which he stressed, that is, that he wants as much money as he can possibly get, this section should be omitted.  By virtue of the duty levied on this entertainment, dancing we shall, if this section is made part of the Bill, deprive the Minister of approximately £140,000.  This is the sum which might be expected to be obtained from the dance tax during the forthcoming year. We have heard that the Minister has said that this tax has been difficult to collect, but whether that is so or not I cannot say.  Personally I do not think there can be any great difficulty in collecting it.  Possibly there is great difficulty in collecting every tax, but whether is has been, will be or will not be a difficult tax to collect, it can be safely estimated to yield £140,000. Why should we allow the Minister to deprive himself of that substantial source of revenue at a time when he is going out of his way to say that he must obtain as much money as possible?</P>
      <P>I do not think we should allow the Bill to go through containing this section. If we delete section 14, we shall allow the Minister an additional £140,000 for the treasury.  Why he should seek by this section, by withdrawing this duty, to deprive himself of that considerable sum of money at a time when he has explained North, South, East and West, for perhaps some strange motive, that he must have all this money for which he has budgeted, I do not know.  For these reasons the Minister should gladly accept this recommendation and I will be very surprised if he will not.  I cannot imagine what case he can make against my recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has already been fully debated elsewhere and the Dáil is satisfied that this remission should be given.  It appears to me, therefore, that the onus lies on <Col N="1669" /> the Senator who put down this proposal to delete the section&mdash;because that is what it amounts to&mdash;to prove his case.  I do not think that he has proved it.  I do not think that he has made any attempt to show why this particular form of entertainment or amusment, not participated in by people for profit, should be discriminated against when we allow virtually every other form of personal entertainment to go untaxed.</P>
      <P>This prejudice against dancing of a Party in a coalition which purported to be broadly based on liberal principles is, I think, extraordinary.  If a person can do almost everything except dance it brings us back almost to the days of the Roundheads, when dancing was regarded as a civil offence. I wonder at the hardihood of members of the Senator's Party who oppose this concession for the young people of the country&mdash;because it is the young people of the country who will benefit from it &mdash;when last year they actually removed the tax upon wrestling.</P>
      <P>One of the concessions which my predecessor granted in his Budget of 1950, I think&mdash;not last year&mdash;was to remove the tax on wrestling.  In 1949 he put the tax on dancing but in 1950 he removed the tax on wrestling.  I do not know how the tax on admission to wrestling entertainments happened to persist, as I thought that we had taken off all these taxes on personal amusements. They were originally imposed in 1932 in pretty stringent circumstances and they were removed as rapidly as could be until 1946, when I thought they had all gone.  Certainly the last remnant of them in the tax on dancing as an entertainment was removed. It was reimposed in 1949 without any word of justification by my predecessor. Some people were, shall we say, prejudiced enough to suggest that one of the reasons this tax was imposed was that the Fianna Fáil organisation had been in the habit of holding popular entertainments from year to year, and that did not please my predecessor. Therefore, in order that he might strike at one political organisation he struck at everybody.</P>

I think even the Minister, even to his own Party, finds it hard to justify this step.  Even to look at it from a political point of view, it is a mistake.  At a time when the Government is forced to withdraw the subsidies on food and increase the price of the loaf of bread so 9d and the lb. of butter to 3/10, and when many people in the city and in the country will be unable to buy sufficient bread and butter, we are going to take off the tax on dancing.

      <P>That seems to be the sole approach to this question.  Can anybody here tell me satisfactorily why people living in villages or within three miles of a village, which might have a population of 501, should be taxed for dancing, while people beyond that limit will not be taxed?  The place with a population of 501 is only a village. I understand that that is a provision of the 1949 Finance Act, that people living in these villages or within three miles of them, will have to pay the tax on dancing, while people living beyond that limit will not.  I suggest that that is class legislation of the worst kind.</P>
      <P>I think it is a bad principle to bring in class legislation.  If dances are to be tax free in this country, then I submit that it should be extended to all. I have never known any proposal such as this&mdash;that has been calculated to bring in such a small amount of money as £140,000&mdash;which has given rise to so much discussion.  That, as I said, is because these people thought they had found in it material for propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This class legislation in connection with dancing, to which I have referred, has brought about a very undesirable position in certain parts of the country.  Halls have been built in out-of-the-way places and people go to those halls from towns which are more than three miles away, and I doubt whether their attendance at those dance halls is sometimes of any value <Col N="1673" /> to the people of the locality.  I have seen halls&mdash;some of which should not be described as dance halls&mdash;built in certain remote parts of the country in order to comply with the foolish proposal which was inserted by Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Finance, in his 1949 Finance Act. Therefore, I do not think this matter has warranted the amount of controversy which has arisen in connection with it.</P>

What justification have some Senators who have spoken on this section for taxing people who live in a village of, say, 501 persons and not taxing people who live three miles away from that village?  Are the people who live in such a small centre of population as a village of 501 inhabitants not as much entitled to free dancing as people who live in other parts of the country?  I cannot see why any distinction should be made in the matter, and no consistent man can see it.  People have to work hard, and sometimes even to drudge, in small towns and villages of 501 inhabitants.  As the Senator said, those people are entitled to their enjoyment on a Saturday night or a Sunday night, as the case might be. I draw a distinction between those people and the other people to whom I have referred.</P>

I think that the £140,000 would not go very far in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recollect a meeting between the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, and the Labour organisation on the question of excess profits. We spoke of the amount of money made by the capitalists.  The Minister said that if all the alleged excess profits were distributed amongst the workers of the country each worker would get an extra 3/-.  It will be seen, therefore, that the sum seemed bigger than it actually was.  I think <Col N="1675" /> the same can be said about the argument that the £140,000 derived from the dance tax should be devoted to relieve the people in Cabra in respect of the extra cost of their loaves.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to suggest that the young people who go to dances should pay a tax.  When Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance, brought this matter before the Seanad in 1949 there was great opposition to it by Fianna Fáil Senators&mdash;particularly to the matter of the three-mile limit from villages of 500 inhabitants.  It was predicted that dance halls would be built outside certain villages and, as Senator Kissane has said, that sort of thing is not good for anybody.  The dance halls are built in isolated places. The matter was bad in conception and should never have been passed into law.</P>
    <P>I think that if you want people to pay a tax when they go dancing you should be consistent and say that there should be a tax on every other form of amusement.  The Opposition argued that the dance tax should not be remitted, but they did not say anything about all the other types of entertainment which might be taxed.</P>

      <P>The Minister told me, on another matter, that taxation is necessary in order to get revenue. The business before the House concerns the getting of funds for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to the mentality behind the Bill I object.  The amount involved, £140,000, is a rather substantial amount and would give a considerable amount of relief in other directions.  There is no reason why it should have been given away.  With all due respect to my good friend, Senator Colgan, if there was propaganda made out of it, it was for the simple reason that the whole business smells badly.  Letters have been read here and I do not want to follow that line, but the whole business sounds bad.  I object to the removal of something which would bring £140,000 to the Exchequer on the basis that something else ought to have been taxed.  If the tax was not doing any harm it should not have been removed. I would not say that the whole thing <Col N="1676" /> was evil or rotten, but I would say that it was bad&mdash;bad politically and nationally. It is the sort of thing that should not have been done by any Government in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, when the Finance Bill was introduced, I expressed the opinion that it was wise and sound from various points of view to repeal that particular section of the Finance Act.  Everybody running dances up and down the country knows in his heart and soul that most people running dances made every effort to deceive the revenue authorities and paid as little tax as they possibly could.  I am sure Mr. McGilligan, when Minister for Finance, knew in his heart and soul that he was expecting impossibilities from the excise officer in any county if he thought he could go out to every town and county where a dance was being run, remain at the door from the time the dance started until it finished and check the figures and the number of people in the hall.  There is not a dance-hall proprietor in this country who did not go out of his way to put on as little stamps as he could on every ticket issued.</P>
      <P>I do not see why a town with a population of over 500 should be tax-free while villages and towns under 500 should have to pay tax.  That is really class distinction and class legislation, and I think we should not have that.  Consequently, I believe the Minister is quite right in repealing the section of the Act referred to because the Act cannot be administered, and when an Act cannot be administered it is better to have it repealed.  It is impossible to administer the Act and, consequently, I believe the Minister was right in repealing it.</P>
      <P>No matter what we may hear from various people up and down the country, I think that the Minister is doing the honest thing.  A lot of people do not believe for one moment the talk we hear.  There is nothing but honesty and sincerity at the back of the Minister's actions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this tax was paid, and paid up to the hilt, by the people who were running the dance halls.  In the case of small halls, where <Col N="1677" /> the tax was remitted, no tax had to be paid where the dances were run by committees.  Was it not as desirable to run dances in rural Ireland as in Parnell Square?  What is the difference? I think rural Ireland would be better served if Dublin were dead and the people left in rural Ireland.  I think it would solve one of our greatest problems.</P>
      <P>I know people interested in dance halls and they said they had to pay the full rate of tax.  They were all in towns in which it was easy for the Revenue Commissioners to inspect them.  The Revenue Commissioners would know the amount of stamps issued by reference to the post office. Some of their own daughters might be present at a dance and they could tell them that there were 400 people present and that 25 stamps were bought.</P>
      <P>With regard to the tax on bread, the £140,000 would not subsidise the bread, but I object to the principle of removing the tax on dances and putting it on bread.  Many desirable suggestions were made to-day, but we were told the Government had not the money.  I would much prefer to see widows, bringing up families, given some relief rather than allow the dancers to get away scot free.  The dancers would not mind giving a few pence towards that object.  Dancing is one of the cheapest forms of amusement in the country.</P>

The Fine Gael Party wish to kill Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and even Clonmel.  Senator Burke has made it quite clear what his ultimate object is.  Let us keep that in our mind for future reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come back to see actually what is happening. Roughly 40 per cent., in round figures, of the people of this country, if they go to a dance, have to pay tax.  The other 60 per cent., if they go, do not have to pay tax.  That is roughly how <Col N="1678" /> the incidence of the dance tax rests. Forty per cent. of the dance-goers of this country pay tax, the remaining 60 per cent. do not pay tax.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested by Senator Tunney, who said he has never been to a dance in his life, that the dancers are not called on to pay this tax.  Here is what the official publication dealing with the entertainments duty has to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Stamped tickets of admission may be either Government tickets (that is, tickets supplied by the Revenue Commissioners, which are imprinted or impressed with a stamp denoting the duty) or proprietors' own tickets to which are affixed at or before the time of sale entertainments duty adhesive stamps denoting the duty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It goes on to describe a form of Government tickets, to be used for the collection of the tax:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The price of admission and the rate of duty are printed separately on Government tickets&mdash;thus: Admission 6d., tax 2d.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then it goes on to describe the details of tickets and the particular type of ticket that must be used.  There is a special type of tickets for use to collect the tax on dancing.  The value of these tickets is set out as follows in the Revenue Commissioners' pamphlet:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Price of admission for dances only, 6½d.  Face value of the stamp on tickets, 1½d.  Price of admission, 8d, face value of stamp on ticket, 2d.  Price of admission, 9d, face value of stamp on ticket 3d.  Price of admission 1/-, face value of stamp on ticket 3d.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if a person pays a shilling for admission to a dance, simultaneously he has to pay 3d. by way of tax.  The patron pays this tax and not the proprietor of the hall.  The proprietor has the responsibility of collecting the tax.  This tax ranges from 3d. on 1/- to 6d. on 2/-, from 1/- on 4/- to 2/- on 8/- and so on.  It is levied at the rate of 25 per cent. on the admission prices. Will somebody tell me why it is that 40 per cent. of the taxpayers of this country should be compelled to pay this <Col N="1679" /> duty while the other 60 per cent. go free?</P>
    <P>I believe Senator Tunney is a member of the Labour Party.  I know he used to be a member of other Parties during his political lifetime.  He makes slighting reference to the dance halls in Parnell Square.  Apparently, he does not like the people who frequent the dance halls there, while he has no objection to the people who may go to the dances in the Gresham Hotel or attend Hunt Balls in places in the country which happen to be situated more than three miles from a town or a village with a population of 500.  The Senator has an intensive dislike for the people who go to dances in Parnell Square&mdash;those boys and girls of the City of Dublin who work in the factories, workshops and behind counters.  It is the working boys and girls of this city who frequent the dance halls in Parnell Square, in Anne Street and in other parts of the city where dance halls are situated&mdash; These are the people who pay the tax. If they go to the Four Provinces Ballroom in Harcourt Street, which is owned, I believe, by a trades union, they have to pay this tax.  Remember, it is not the trades union or the leaseholder of the dance hall who pays the tax but the patron.  In fact it is made quite clear to the patron that it is he who must pay the tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Besides applying to the patrons of these dance halls in Dublin City, this tax also applies to the people who go to dances in Finglas or even in Finglas Bridge, in Rush, Malahide, Windy Arbour, Blue Bell and Churchtown and Butterfield. In every one of these villages in County Dublin people who frequent dances have to pay a tax of 25 per cent.  Of course, if a person is fortunate enough to own a four-seater or a five-seater car he can afford the petrol and he can collect a party and travel three miles from his home and pay 5/ or 10/- to gain admission to a dance and he will not be taxed at all. However, if he happens to be a working chap and wishes to go to a dance <Col N="1680" /> in his native Finglas or Finglas Bridge, he has got to pay a tax of 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>That is what Senator Tunney, the non-dancer, wants to inflict on the working-class people of the country. So, of course, does Senator Burke. Apparently Senator Burke is quite content that the people who live in or within three miles of Clonmel, Thurles, Tipperary, Nenagh, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Templemore, Borrisokane, Fethard and Cahir, should pay this tax. However, if they live in a place situated outside the three-mile limit of these towns, they do not have to pay the tax.  For instance, a person living in Clonmel has to pay the tax.  However, if his abode is three miles outside the town in a place having a population of over 500, he does not have to pay the tax.  Is there any justice or equity in that?  Is it not quite clear that it should be either all or none?</P>
      <P>In 1946, we decided that it should be none.  In 1949, my predecessor decided that it should be some.  There was no rational basis for that decision which has led as everybody is aware, to many undesirable developments over the last three years.  This concession has not benefited the towns and villages.  If a young man or a young woman happens to go to a dance in a village where there are 501 people, they have got to pay the tax.  There is no use saying, as Senator Tunney has said that these dances were doing something to brighten rural life.  That is no excuse for the entirely undesirable discrimination between two sections of the people.  Very undesirable developments have taken place as a consequence of this lop-sided and unfair tax.  The Gardaí and others are finding it very difficult to cope with such developments.  If we remove this tax and the inducement to build these dance halls far outside towns and villages with consequent undesirable results, then I feel we will be doing a good thing from the social point of view and from the point of view of the country also.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the heart-breaking appeal for the unfortunate 40 per cent. of the people who have been bearing the <Col N="1681" /> dance tax.  I am still absolutely convinced that, in a Budget of these dimensions, it was a political folly&mdash;I do not mean necessarily Party political folly&mdash;to remove this particular injustice, however much the Minister may have been moved.  The Minister says that it is unfair and quite wrong that 40 per cent. of the people should have to pay a tax while 60 per cent. go free. I only wish he said that before we passed Section I, which deals with income tax.</P>

It was a pity that he drew that down, but I can assure him that I am not going to follow in that line.</P>
      <P>Despite what the Minister has said, I feel that 95 per cent. of the Irish people will never look on the removal of this tax on dances in the same manner as the Minister is looking on it. Senator Colgan stated that we should tax everything.  He mentioned Croke Park.  Surely, nobody will draw a similarity between dancing and the sport that takes place in Croke Park&mdash; a sport that is good for soul and body.</P>

      <P>The Senator will have plenty of time to speak.  I did not say that dancing was bad.  What I said was that the taking off of this tax is going to have a bad effect on the country, because the great majority of the Irish people will always feel that there was some dishonest trick behind it.  I am not even suggesting that.  I am a member of the Labour Party and I want to tell the Minister that I am very proud of that Party.  I am tempted to follow the Minister, but I will not do so.  I mentioned Parnell Square because that is the portion of Dublin where the greatest number of dance halls are situated, and I say that you cannot compare any portion of the city or suburbs of Dublin with a village in Kerry, in Donegal or in Tipperary. These are entitled to preferential treatment. <Col N="1682" /> It has been the ambition of, I believe, every Government to encourage the people to stay in rural Ireland and we should do all we can to help them in that direction.</P>
      <P>There is no comparison between a dance hall here and in the country, because, in the case of a person who attends a dance in the city, his wage is different from that of the man in the country.  Let Senators not forget that the people I have in mind are people, the majority of whom work for their fathers from Monday until Saturday night and who receive not one shilling in wages They work on small farms, on uneconomic holdings, and for that work receive no wages.  I want an answer from him to the question: Will these workers who will go to dances in Parnell Square, the Gresham Hotel or anywhere else in Dublin benefit by this remission?  If the Minister says they will and if he guarantees that the dance-hall proprietor will be compelled to reduce the price of admission, he will then be able to put up an honest case to convince the great number of people who have not, as yet, been convinced that this tax should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I am sure that any such suggestion is incorrect.  These people are reputable people and I cannot for a moment accept the suggestion that they would engage in the wholesale evasion of tax.  I am really amazed that they should have been attacked in this way, and if the Senator's argument on this is an argument at all, we might ask why should we have income-tax, if we can make an effort to evade payment of it or any other kind of tax.  The Minister has made it very clear to us what the rate of duty is at present.  He has explained <Col N="1683" /> that it is roughly 25 per cent., that a person going into a dance to-day pays 2/- tax in respect of a 10/- ticket. He has asked us to believe that to-morrow or the next day when the tax has been remitted, that ticket which now costs 10/-, will cost only 8/-. If I were satisfied that that would be <Col N="1684" /> the result, my opposition to the remission of this tax would perhaps not be so great, but I suggest that there is not the slightest doubt that the admission charge of 10/- to-day, which includes 2/- duty, will still be 10/- when no duty will be payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 45 and 48, to delete &ldquo;five hundred&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one thousand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>By virtue of Section 17 when a deposit receipt with bankers is in the name of more than one person and exceeds £500, on the death of one of the holders before the banker may pay the survivor, a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners must be produced with the receipt to say that all estate duties payable in respect of the money on deposit have been paid.  Prior to 1935 money on deposit receipt might be paid over on the death of one of two joint holders merely on production of a certificate of death or other evidence of the death of the deceased depositor.  The 1935 Act provided that a banker might not pay the survivor in a joint deposit receipt any moneys where the deposit exceeded £100 unless a certificate was produced from the Revenue Commissioners that all death duties had been paid in respect of the money on deposit.  This section proposes to extend that limit from £100 to £500, and I would ask the Seanad to accept the recommendation that that limit be extended from £500 to £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make this recommendation because I think the revenue will sustain no loss should the limit be raised from £500 to £1,000, and because it will facilitate people particularly in the country in dealing with money on deposit in a bank following the death of one of two joint holders.  The case I have in mind is where a husband and wife have a sum up to £1,000 on deposit; one of the parties dies and there is some difficulty in obtaining money, the only source available, perhaps, being the money on deposit. If this recommendation is not accepted, if the deposit exceeds £500, the banker may not pay out money in order to facilitate such a person unless <Col N="1685" /> he produces a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners that all death duties have been paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he did not expect any loss to the revenue by putting the surviving holder in a position to get money up to £500, and I do not think he will lose if he raises the limit from £500 to £1,000.  On the other hand, it would facilitate a survivor in dealing with money up to £1,000 if he had not to go to the trouble of getting that certificate.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say, possibly, that the Revenue Commissioners might lose, but I do not think they will.  I do not think that people who have had money on deposit can or do evade death duties in respect of that money. I must remind the House that death duties are not payable except in a case where the net estate&mdash;that is, the deceased's estate, less deductions for debts&mdash;exceeds £2,000.  Where it happens, as it often does in the country, that the money on deposit is the deceased's sole asset, or that money with a small farm, and the survivor becomes entitled to a sum up to £1,000, he should be able to cash that money without going to the trouble of obtaining the certificate.  I do not think that the Minister will be taking any great risk of losing revenue if he raises the limit to £1,000 instead of to £500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Seanad not to agree to this recommendation. The limit of £500 has been fixed after very careful consideration, and the Revenue Commissioners are not satisfied that the risk of loss would not be significant and considerably increased if the recommendation were accepted.  When I say risk of loss I mean the risk that a person might evade duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not very much substance in what Senator O'Reilly has said.  If a person happens to have such a substantial sum as almost £1,000 on deposit I have no doubt that if money is urgently wanted the bank manager will facilitate that person.  That is just ordinary business.  You cannot base the case for this recommendation on <Col N="1686" /> compassionate grounds.  On the other hand we cannot overlook the fact that if the amount of money on deposit is large, over £500, then it is a fair assumption that the rest of the estate is correspondingly large and will be liable to death duties.  For those reasons I would ask the Seanad not to accept the recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a question of the interpretation of the value of imported goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much fuller.  If the Senator will look at Section 15 (1) (a) and (2) (b) he will see:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of any enactment (whether contained in an Act or an Order) for the time being in force under which a duty of customs is chargeable on goods by reference to their value, the value of any imported goods shall, whether it is or is not otherwise specifically provided, be that laid down in the Third Schedule to this Act, and duty shall be paid on that value.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The change arises in this way.  At present the definition of value is that laid down in Section 25 of the Finance Act of 1938, which repealed Section 34 of the Finance Act of 1933 and substituted for it an enactment providing that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the value of any articles or goods for any of the purposes of this Act or any other Act (whether passed before or after this Act) relating to the customs or of any Order relating to the customs heretofore or hereafter made under any Act (whether passed before or after this Act) shall, in the absence of provision to the contrary, be taken to be the price which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, an importer would give for such article or goods if such article or goods were delivered, freight and insurance paid, in bond at the place of importation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, therefore, the Schedule gives a greatly extended prescription of the basis on which the value of imported goods will be computed.  The underlying intention in both cases, however, is the same.  The underlying intention in the case of the proposed new basis and that which is embodied in Section 25 of the Finance Act of 1938 is essentially the same, that is to say, that the duty will be based on the price which would be paid by a typical <Col N="1688" /> independent importer for goods delivered at the place of importation, freight, insurance and all other costs paid up to that point.</P>
    <P>We propose to substitute for that somewhat brief prescription of the manner in which this value on importation will be computed a definition which has been agreed on by the Brussels Convention for the purpose of assessing the value of goods for customs purposes.  This proposed new prescription or procedure has been formulated as a result of the study of the question by the European Customs Union Study Group, the idea being to try to establish uniform practice in all countries in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>The only point which was not clear to me was whether Section 4 in the Third Schedule contained any change, because if it were carried out too logically it would be almost impracticable.  You might easily be a shareholder in a public company in England and, therefore, have some interest.  I take it it is not meant in that sense, that it is in the practical sense, that is, that they are not to associate together for the management of the business.  If it is new, I think it would need interpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is to ensure, amongst other things, that in what are known as &ldquo;house to house&rdquo; transactions, the true value of the goods will be assessed for customs and that it will not be possible by reasons of these &ldquo;house to house&rdquo; transactions to claim that customs duty should be levied at something less than the real or normal value, that is, what a typical independent importer would have to pay for the goods if delivered to him at the place of importation with insurance, freight and all other charges paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the practice with regard to &ldquo;house to house&rdquo; transactions and I do not think anyone would question that.  The reason I asked whether there was any change was that Section 4 of this Schedule seemed to be more stringent than in the case of &ldquo;house to house&rdquo;<Col N="1689" /> buying in the past and I wanted to know whether there was anything in it or what was the object.  It may be that that was the phrase which was in before, interpreted in a general way, and I have no objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says that there is no real change in practice, that is all I want to find out. That is what I thought from reading it, but then I began to wonder about it when I heard the Minister's speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to read this particular Schedule.  I think that many people will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to understand portions of this Schedule.  It seems to me that the Legislature is doing the public a grave injury when they draft Bills affecting the life of the public in language which it is so difficult to follow.  I appeal for the drafting of Bills in clear and concise language, so that any ordinary man will be able to interpret it for himself.  It seems to me that we are endeavouring to become more and more obscure in our use of the English language.  I realise that it is very difficult to couch the phrases in a simple manner, but serious consideration should be given to the matter of clarity in respect of the implications of a section.  I remember that Lord Dunsany said a considerable time ago that the Civil Service had done more to ruin English than anything Macaulay wrote about the New Zealander long ago.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service has an extraordinarily obscure way of expressing something which should be clear and concise and easily understood by the ordinary man in the street.  What does the Minister mean by the following extraordinary sub-section (b) of Section 2 of this Third Schedule?:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the price made is not influenced by any commercial, financial or other relationship, whether by <Col N="1690" /> contract or otherwise, between the seller or any person associated in business with him and the buyer or any person associated in business with him (other than the relationship created by the sale of the goods in question); and ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 3 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where the goods to be valued&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  are manufactured in accordance with any patented invention or are goods to which any registered design has been applied; or</P>
    <P>(b)  are imported under a foreign trade mark, or are imported for sale (whether or not after further manufacture) under a foreign trade mark;</P>
    <P>the normal price shall be determined on the assumption that the price covers the right to use the patent, design or trade mark in respect of the goods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That section brings up the point which the Federation of Irish Manufacturers have raised time and time again, namely, the legal right to the use of an imported trade mark or a trade name.  We have held that the great majority of the trade marks and trade names used in this country are used illegally.  It is interesting to recall the findings of the Lord Chief Justice in Britain on a certain case many years ago.  We think that some reference should be made to the report of the Patents and Trade Mark Commission which was published some years ago.  It is important that the rights of Irish manufacturers to a trade mark should be covered.  If we specify in an Act that, by virtue of a sub-section of the Act, a right has been created to the use of a trade name or trade mark, we acquiesce in something which the Federation of Irish Manufacturers look upon as illegal.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister to explain the meaning of Section 4 of this Schedule?  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Two persons shall be deemed to be associated in business with one another if, whether directly or indirectly, <Col N="1691" /> either of them has any interest in the business or property of the other, or both have a common interest in any business or property, or some third person has an interest in the business or property of both of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the House, was anything ever more extraordinarily and abstrusely and obscurely phrased?  I realise that it has been common in all Parliaments to be as obscure as possible, but why not take the lead now and use more simple phraseology and make the Bills clearly understood so that the common mind can understand what exactly the Legislature is doing?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board to encourage and promote the development of tourist traffic in and to the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) is, in a sense, put in by way of illustration of the functions which the board will carry out under that general direction.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this particular paragraph in sub-section (2) is to empower An Bord Fáilte to assist in establishing local companies for resort development, to which I referred on another stage.  In taking into account any assistance given to these local companies, the board would have regard to the extent to which their work would benefit tourist traffic.  If it is not likely to benefit the tourist traffic, the board would not be interested in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference to tourist agencies, but I felt sure that there was no such intention.  I am not <Col N="1693" /> quite sure that technically it might not have that intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly no such intention.  The paragraph is put in, as I explained, for the purpose of enabling the board to assist local tourist resort companies.  The amendment proposes that the board should not assist such body or organisation if it did not have as its sole or principal object the development of tourist traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be that you would have in some small place throughout the country an organisation or a body which might be helping tourist traffic in a small and unimportant way.  The point of the amendment is to see that such a body would not really qualify for payments from the board, unless it had as its sole object the promotion of the tourist traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be restrictive. Take the Sligo Tourist Development Company or the Bundoran Tourist Development Organisation. These bodies take measures to improve the general appearance of the resorts they are in charge of and organise various carnivals, and so forth.  While, no doubt, they might bring trade to the town they would not admit that was their sole purpose.  We should not confine the board to give assistance to organisations whose sole purpose was to develop the tourist traffic.  What I have in mind would include other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think &ldquo;any form of agency&rdquo; is a terribly wide term in connection with the trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the board is precluded from giving assistance, in accordance with its own specific functions, to any organisation that might by its activities improve tourist traffic here.  The section starts off by stating in sub-section (1):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board to encourage and promote the <Col N="1694" /> development of tourist traffic in and to the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is only by way of illustration of what it can do in the fufilment of that purpose that sub-section (2) is in.  I frequently receive suggestions from organisations arranging international conferences in this country or organisations responsible for the development of particular forms of recreation, such as hiking, that the Tourist Board should assist them on specific activities which they might undertake and which would indirectly assist the tourist traffic.  I do not think we should exclude the board from doing that. While the board would have to make sure that any help it gave was directed towards the achievement of its main purpose, it might incidentally benefit the organisation concerned in a general way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise for being absent when this amendment was moved.  This is a matter in which I am interested.  I think that the section, as worded, is far too wide.  What the Minister said just now is undoubtedly true, that by having this section in the board can assist worth-while projects by bodies that are not primarily interested in the development of the tourist traffic.  My view is that the board should be without those powers rather than that you should have in an Act of Parliament a section which is as wide as this and which, with the best will in the world, enables the board to abuse the intentions behind the Act, and at the same time to act in a perfectly legitimate way and to dispose of the money at their disposal in a perfectly legitimate way.</P>
      <P>As members of the Oireachtas, we would be discharging our duty in a better manner if we sought, in such cases, to impose the limitation even though by so doing there might be one or two cases over a period of years where the board would find, because such a limitation as is suggested in the amendment had been imposed by the Oireachtas, they were not able to assist in some project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of paragraph (d) is far too wide&mdash;&ldquo;any form of agency in connection <Col N="1695" /> with tourist traffic&rdquo;.  If there was some limit, I would be more satisfied, but I think it is much too wide at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty in seeing what other form of wording could be used that would not be restrictive. The Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, also contained a section which gave the board power to, among other things, &ldquo;establish or assist in establishing of any form of agency in connection with tourist traffic&rdquo;.  I do not know if that power has ever been used by the Tourist Board.  I doubt if it has because its resources were limited.  I think Senator O'Higgins's suggestion would be far too restrictive.  It might be interpreted as meaning that the board could not give assistance to the type of organisations I have in mind, associations primarily formed to do civic work generally in their localities and by their specific activity help tourist trade in that area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 4, paragraph (f), lines 18 and 19, to delete &ldquo;other places of particular interest to the public&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;places of scenic, historic, scientific or other interest&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down by me at the express request of the chairman of An Taisce, the National Trust for Ireland.  That body, according to a letter I received from him, is of the opinion that the words suggested in the amendment would be an improvement and in particular they consider that the words &ldquo;scenic&rdquo; and &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; should be included.  Personally, I am not very keen about any particular form of words but I think that the words in the Bill were intended to be as wide <Col N="1696" /> as possible.  To meet this point of view, my amendment includes the words &ldquo;other interest&rdquo;.  I am not satisfied myself that the words &ldquo;to the public&rdquo; without any definition of &ldquo;public&rdquo;, might not turn out unintentionally to be restrictive.</P>
    <P>It may be that matters of scientific interest should be of interest to the general public.  I do not know that it would be truthful to say that they are. I do not see the need for the words &ldquo;to the general public&rdquo;.  The National Trust seemed to think that this might have to be interpreted by a court though, personally, I do not think so. I do not think the question of the meaning of the words &ldquo;general public&rdquo; is to be termed impossible.</P>
    <P>In order to make clear the reasons why the National Trust feel that these words should be inserted, it might be useful if I read a letter which I received from Professor Hackett, the chairman of An Taisce.  The professor says: &ldquo;As an example of a place of scientific interest with which An Bord Fáilte might well concern themselves is the Burren district.&rdquo;  The Tourist Board guide refers to the Burren district as: &ldquo;This area of base limestone hills, covering about 50 square miles, extends north and south-west from Lisdoonvarna. The thin soil of its hollows and crevices supports the most remarkable assemblages of diverse types of flora to be found in Ireland.&rdquo;  Praeger describes the sight of the acres of Doyas Octapetala in full flower as &ldquo;one of the loveliest sights that Ireland has to offer to the botanist&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This area is, therefore, a unique region scientifically and may well be exploited as a tourist attraction leading to the despoliation of its rarer plants. The Killarney fern, once plentiful around the Killarney hills, has suffered from the greed of collectors, both commercial and botanical, and is now extremely rare.  These regions want protection if as likely, they become of interest to An Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>As regards scenic places, An Taisce considers that Bray Head deserves to be made more available to pedestrians by the Cliff Walk, which should be ex tended to Greystones.  The passage along the old railway line is becoming <Col N="1697" /> difficult and at times questions of right of way or trespass may arise.  The farmers who have taken over land from the railway company have pushed their fences right up to the boulder clay cliff.  It may not be wise to be too explicit on this point.  I mention it merely to indicate that An Taisce have been concerned about the Bray-Greystones route from the scenic point of view.</P>
    <P>Professor Hackett goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the third adjective, &lsquo;historic,&rsquo; we have nothing specially in mind, unless our recent interest in Glendalough as a national sanctuary, opposing the Wicklow County Council in its petition to extend the graveyard, may be so counted.  The clause in its initial section may have been only intended to improve the means of access to recognised national monuments.  In this respect the proposed amendment is a &lsquo;stretch&rsquo; which might be useful in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel when a body of that kind asked specifically that this amendment should be inserted their wishes should be complied with.  I do not feel very strongly on this matter, and I merely raised it at the request of the National Trust.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I misunderstood the Senator's remarks.  When we were drafting this Bill departmentally we used precisely the words which the Senator is suggesting we should insert.  However, they were discarded in favour of the words now in the Bill on the advice of the Parliamentary Draftsman in order to give the board the maximum freedom of action.  The advice we got was that, in order to get that result, it was better to leave the definition as broad as possible and that any attempt to break it up could only have a restrictive effect, as the Senator suggests.  There is no doubt about the <Col N="1698" /> fact that, in the wording of the section as it is, places of scenic interest as well as places of historic or scientific interest can be developed by the board provided they have some tourist interest and provided that the opening up of these places, the making of access to them and the setting up of signposts at them would be likely to benefit the general objects of the board.  I would prefer to have the wider section.  Every Minister framing a Bill is always anxious to give the organisation he is setting up the greatest scope provided that, in exercising the powers given them, they are subject to an overriding consideration which, in this case, is set out in Section 1 of the Bill, namely, that it would be related to their job of developing tourist trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of what the Minister has said, and in spite of Senator Douglas's amendment, I feel that the section as it stands might be taken as restrictive.  I think that the board might be inclined to rule out districts like the Burren on the grounds that they are primarily of interest scientifically and not of interest to the public at large.  It might be of interest to mention the value which a dreary region in the South of France called Oamargue has proved.  This region, which is situated near Marseilles, is used as a nesting-place for flamingos. It attracts tourists from all over the world and has proved of extraordinary publicity value to that part of France. I feel there is reason to believe that the board may be narrow in their outlook and say that places are of a scientific interest and do not concern the public in general.</P>
      <P>The National Trust is doing a splendid job of work in this country, and I know the Minister would like to help them in every way.  Perhaps the Minister will give us an assurance that he will do all in his power to make the board take the proper view of the word &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;, which some people are afraid to do.  It would be very helpful to the National Trust if they would get such encouragement from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was put to me by a colleague of mine who is in An Taisce.  I felt that the Minister's defence would be that, in drafting the Bill, he was told by the Parliamentary Draftsman that the more general the phrases used, the more power would be given to the board.  The Minister knows that the more specifically it is put, the more restrictive it is.  I do think that the words &ldquo;of interest to the public&rdquo; are restrictive.  The public would not be interested in something which might have considerable historic or scientific interest for some people.  For example, archaeology has an extraordinary interest for professors of archæology.  A place having an attraction archaeologically might be of great interest to the public while, initially, it might not have had interest for them at all.  The same thing applies to a place of scientific interest.

      <P>I have been in communication with the chairman of An Taisce on this matter and I should like to put on record some of the things he said with reference to this amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Council of An Taisce have had the Bill under consideration and <Col N="1700" /> they are of opinion that they could more effectively persuade An Board Fáilte to take action in promoting these objects for which An Taisce was formed to support if the phrase in Clause 5 (2) (f) was altered. viz., &lsquo;and other places of particular interest to the public&rsquo; to &lsquo;and places of scenic, historic, scientific or other interest&rsquo; (to the public).  It is argued that a general phraseology is better in such a Bill.  To some extent this is so but &lsquo;particular interest to the public&rsquo; is too indefinite.  I can imagine any learned judge analysing it into nothingness.  The form put forward by An Taisce preserves the generality but gently leads An Board Fáilte to consider cases of scenic, scientific (nature reserves, and such like) and historic interest as of preeminent interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That body thinks it desirable to leave out &ldquo;to the public&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the general question I hope that the new board will be able to subsidise the owners of historic buildings who find it difficult to maintain them.  As the law stands apparently you are liable for rates on a building you own so long as the roof is on, and in order to escape paying rates many people owning historic buildings have been tempted, bribed or encouraged by the value of them to take the roofs off and sell the contents.  That is, I think, disastrous from the point of view of the country, because these buildings are amongst our principal national assets and should be amongst our principal attractions for tourists.  If the new board has the power to subsidise people for keeping the roofs on their houses instead of taking them off&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the Second Reading I raised the matter, particularly with reference to the means of access to places of interest.  I felt then, and I feel now, that the section as it stands might, as Senator Johnston has said, in a court prove to be defective.  I think it is of vital importance that the board should have the means of providing the public with access to places of scenic interest.  I gave one example in the course of my speech on that occasion&mdash;the Lough Dan valley, which is at the moment shut off and barred to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether, under (g), the powers with regard to signs are limited, or whether it would be possible for the board to do something which I think is extremely important from the tourist point of view, that is, to mark minor roads and major roads.  That has not been done by the Tourist Board and I have had complaints as to bad marking of roads from the point of view of motorists who are a very important part of our tourist traffic.  In Jersey, which spends a lot of money on tourists, I noticed that they had a white line in every case, at which motorists had to stop.  They enforce it by the use of policemen who have not got uniforms, but that would not be a function of the tourist board.  If they could have, as I think would be desirable, white lines in all cases and, in the more important cases, a notice drawing attention to the fact that there is a major road ahead, it would be a considerable improvement, <Col N="1702" /> something which tourists would appreciate because, whereas the local inhabitant ought to, but does not always, know the more important roads, it is quite difficult for a tourist, having left a major road, to know when he is coming back on to the major road.  I think the Bill would give these powers, but, if not, I think it should give them so long as they are for the purpose of assisting tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is thinking of assisting motorists rather than tourists, by the provision of certain safety devices for the benefit of motorists generally and while there may be a case for a number of these devices, the responsibility for providing them would hardly be on the Tourist Board. The intention is that the Tourist Board will undertake the financial cost of providing road signs.  It is intended that the Department of Local Government will remain responsible for the sign-posting policy, responsible for approval of the type of sign used, and that the erection will be done by the local authority but that the cost will be met by the Tourist Board.  The aim is to ensure the better sign-posting of roads.  It may be that there will be different policy with regard to roads and that we will adopt the route system as they have it in other countries, but whatever the policy is will be decided by the Department of Local Government.  The Tourist Board will come in to ensure that there are funds available to set up a proper sign-posting system.</P>
      <P>At present, signposts are erected by the contributions of a voluntary organisation and while that organisation has done very good work, the resources at its disposal were entirely insufficient to enable a thorough job to be done. I hope that, with the additional contributions which the Tourist Board will be able to make, a more thorough job will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Douglas's point of view.  It would be desirable if the Minister could do something about it, either directly or indirectly, because tourists who come to this country expect that we will have here a system of rules <Col N="1703" /> based somewhat on their own rules. Up to not many years ago, however, the volume of traffic here was so small that it was not necessary to make such stringent rules, but now I suggest that the Minister should bring the existing rules more into conformity with the general rules in Britain and France at the moment.  I have motored quite a lot on the Continent and in Britain during the past few years and I find that when you come back to this country you can do much as you please. Such a state of affairs could give rise to serious accidents and to inconvenience to tourists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Maintenance will be a matter for the local authority, but it is recognised that a continuing expenditure will be necessary and the board can undertake a continuing expenditure.  With regard to these safety devices and other road markings mainly designed for safety purposes, while I agree that there is need for considerable improvement in that regard, I am afraid I do not quite know where the responsibility rests.  I think the Department of Local Government is responsible for safety signs and I assume that the cost of these signs is borne on the Road Fund, but I am not quite certain that that is so, I am sure however, that the Department would be as interested as any of us in ensuring that provision of that kind is made by the local authority.</P>

      <P>There are signs saying &ldquo;To Dublin&rdquo;, &ldquo;To Dundrum&rdquo; and various other places.  It is permissible for these to be paid for, though I imagine the control will be in the hands of the local authorities.  The board, however, can pay for it.  If a local authority wants to be up to date and to put up a notice &ldquo;Slow&mdash;Major Road Ahead&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stop&mdash;Major Road <Col N="1704" /> Ahead&rdquo;, could the board pay for it? I am not suggesting that they should take the responsibility of saying where these should be&mdash;that must be the local authority's&mdash;but some of the local authorities have been doing it, although not to the extent to which they should and I should like to know if such signs could be paid for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 4, line 57, to add: &ldquo;Provided that no such entry shall be made without the consent of the owner of such land unless the board shall previously have made an order under Section 19 of the Act of 1939.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Section 5 we dealt with certain things the board can do and in Section 8 it is suggested that a person duly authorised in writing by the board may enter on land for the purpose of enabling the board to carry out its functions under paragraph (f) of sub-section (2) of Section 5.  That is the sub-section dealing with historic buildings, sites, and so on, which we have been discussing.  I am suggesting to the Minister that Section 8 should provide that power of entry should not be given to the board unless they have already made an acquisition order under Section 19 of the 1939 Act.  In Section 7 of the Bill we give the same powers to the board as exist under Section 19 of the 1939 Act.  If the board want to make a right of way through private property to give access to some of the buildings, sites, shrines, etc., set out in the earlier section, and if the owner does not agree, I am taking it that the Minister's intention is that the board should then make an order under Section 19 of the 1939 Act which empowers them to acquire the property and get the right of access in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am assuming that that is the intention. If that is so I suggest to the Minister that Section 8 should also contain a safeguard for the owners of the property, a safeguard in the terms of this amendment.  The wording of Section 8 certainly seems to be in conflict with what is obviously the intention of Section 7.  Under Section 7 we say that if the owner refuses to allow the board to do the proposed work the board may acquire under Section 19 of the 1939 Act.  We then say in Section 8 that a person authorised by the board may enter on land for the purpose of <Col N="1706" /> doing particular work.  That is not, obviously at any rate, related to Section 7, and I think that the intention is that it should be.  The acceptance of this amendment would cover the point I have in mind and would, I think, eliminate the inconsistency which exists between Section 7 and Section 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Senator's amendment and amendment No. 4 are based on a misunderstanding. The position the board is in by sub-section (1) of Section 7 is that if the owner of any land refuses to facilitate them in doing any work which they think should be done they have either to abandon the project or acquire the land compulsorily.  The intention is that before coming to the decision to abandon the project or to use compulsory acquisition powers they should have the right to inspect and survey the land to see what work is necessary. It would be unreasonable to accept the Senator's amendment which is designed to limit them so that they could not enter on land until they had compulsorily acquired it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister is misreading Section 8, sub-section (1), which gives power of entry not merely for the purpose of inspection and surveying but for the purpose of enabling the board to carry out its functions under paragraph (f), sub-section (2) of Section 5.</P>
      <P>That is the paragraph which enables the board to protect and maintain historic buildings, sites and shrines. In other words the entry may be for that purpose, not merely for the purpose of inspecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is based on a misunderstanding.  The position the board is in is that if they think work should be done at a place or monument of historic or general interest they will in the normal course try to make an arrangement with the owner to enable that work to be done. If the owner refuses to facilitate them they will have to decide whether they will use their powers of compulsory acquisition or abandon the idea.  This section is designed to give their officers power to inspect the land before the <Col N="1707" /> board come to that decision.  If they decide to proceed and use their powers of compulsory acquisition the land will of course in due course become theirs and the second of the Senator's amendments is unnecessary because at that stage the land becomes the property of the board and nobody else has the right to go on it unless he gets permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to argue the toss with the Minister over the same points, but I think he may be under a misunderstanding, not myself. It seems to me to be quite clear that Section 8, sub-section (1), provides that a duly authorised person may enter on land.  Why may he enter on that land?  It does not say for the purpose of inspecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the board who own the land there is no question of giving them power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the inconsistency to which I have referred comes in.  The board may enter on land for the purpose of carrying out their functions under paragraph (f), which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To protect and maintain and to aid in protecting and maintaining historic buildings, sites and shrines and other places of particular interest to the public and to facilitate visitors thereto by the provision of notices and the provision and improvement of means of access.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have here a paragraph which, to give a concrete example, empowers the board to create roadways or rights of way over private property.  I do not think that there can be any argument about that.  Section 8, sub-section (1), says that for the purpose of doing that among other things an authorised person may enter on land.  It would be all right if the Minister's view were adopted and the entry were only for the purpose of enabling the board to come to a decision as to whether they would acquire the land or drop the project.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Higgins's amendment would make the situation impossible.  Here is some monument or historic site of scenic interest which should be made accessible to the public.  The first thing to see is whether it is accessible to the public or not and to inspect it to see what it might be necessary to do in order to make it accessible.  Nine times out of ten that will be a matter of discussion and arrangement with the owner.  In the case of a refusal by the owner to facilitate the board, since the board's officer cannot enter on the land without consent, we say here that, if authorised by the board, he may do so.  The next stage is compulsory acquisition. Once they have acquired the property the officers can enter without any permission. Senator O'Higgins proposes that they cannot enter on the land at all until they have acquired it.  He gives the board power to acquire and then gives the officers power to enter, which would be unnecessary if they had acquired it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we quite clear about this, that we are definitely going to exclude an hotel which would cater mainly for commercial travellers? I am rather shocked to hear that and I should think that that will cause very great surprise to hotel keepers throughout the country.  I would have thought that everybody with an hotel would expect to get the benefit of these guarantees.  If it were necessary for him to get them and if the section is left as it is at the moment, the guarantees would appear to be limited to cases where it was proved that, in the main, the hotels were for holiday accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that holiday accommodation is available in this country only when the demand is there&mdash;from May to the end of September.  There are certain hotels&mdash;all hotels, I suppose&mdash;which during that period might be described as &ldquo;holiday accommodation&rdquo;; but because there are no holidays taken <Col N="1711" /> outside that period, these hotels would not be &ldquo;holiday accommodation&rdquo;.  The Minister might consider whether it would not be a good idea to include all hotels and guest-houses whether or not they would be restricting themselves to commercial travellers.  It is very unlikely that any hotel keeper would fail to provide what is popularly called hotel accommodation.  I put down the amendment because of the difficulty which might arise when title was being investigated.  The bankers might be advised that that particular hotel did not come within the provision of the Act in regard to a guarantee and that the Minister could not guarantee such an application for a loan in respect of such a premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that probability could arise at all.  The decision whether or not to recommend the guaranteeing of a loan rests solely with the Tourist Board.  The term &ldquo;holiday accommodation&rdquo; was very deliberately chosen.  It is wider than &ldquo;hotels&rdquo;.  It covers guest-houses, hostels and other accommodation of that kind.  More particularly, the term &ldquo;holiday accommodation&rdquo; was chosen to make it clear that the board was intended to use its powers under this Bill to facilitate those who were providing accommodation for holiday-makers and who regarded that as their business rather than people engaged in some other type of hotel or accommodation business.</P>

      <P>I seek to amend Section 41 because I think it will facilitate applicants for new licences.

      <P>Yes, but the amending of Circuit Court rules or any rules is not a matter that is very quickly carried out.  For that reason I suggest that this amendment will facilitate the applicants and enable them to see where they stand in the making of the applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately this Bill becomes law we may expect that a number of people will make applications for new licences. Under the rules of court they will be in a difficulty as to what notice of application they should serve.  I am aware that provision is made in regard to the service of certificate notice but there is no provision in regard to the particular time of entry of the notice of application.  I have provided here that the notice of application must be published not more than 30 days before the date on which the applicant intends to make the application.  That is to ensure that a person would not serve <Col N="1713" /> notice of the application for his licence to-day and make his application this day next year, when the Garda Síochána and everybody interested in the application would have forgotten about it.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 standing in my name are purely for the assistance of people making the application and those interested in opposing the application.</P>

Normally the fixing of these periods would be dealt with by rules of court.  Presumably, the rule-making committee would make the appropriate rules.  I am told that it is the general practice and I think it is agreed by all the legal authorities as being most desirable to leave to the committee things that can be dealt with by it and not to put them in a Statute.</P>

      <P>As far as it can be done, I quite agree that that is the desirable course.  However, the Circuit Court Rules Committee is composed of judges, members of the Bar and solicitors, with the County Registrar of Dublin as its secretary.  It is not easy to get such a committee together. Of course, only within the past few years we have completed our new Circuit Court Rules.  A lot of work was done in that connection.  I agree that perhaps it might be possible to amend them slightly and also that we should not provide for rules of court in a Statute.  One of these is that the Garda Síochána must be given a certain length of notice.  If the amendments are accepted in respect of these I shall not be doing very much wrong.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 41 to delete &ldquo;either&rdquo; and &ldquo;or off&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This part of the Act deals with the licensing of holiday camps.  I have no objection to the principle of licensing holiday camps.  Some people, perhaps, think it is very desirable.  I object to the granting of any licence that would enable holiday camps to sell intoxicating liquor for consumption outside the boundary of the camp.  When we consider the reason why we are legislating for the granting of licences to holiday camps, my amendment will be accepted without hesitation.  The idea of licensing holiday camps is to enable the visitors to the camps to enjoy a drink if they so wish, but the idea of licensing them is not to enable people to go in and buy drink to be consumed off the premises.  Some proprietors are complaining&mdash;and very properly so&mdash;that the lack of authority to sell intoxicating liquor had inconvenienced their residents.  I think that has been the only complaint that has been made in regard to the difficulty of getting licences for holiday camps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no point made so far as I know, so far as I have heard, either by visitors or by persons interested in a camp, that it was a pity they could not get drink in the camps so that they might drink it outside the camps.  I cannot see why, where the original idea was to provide a licence to enable <Col N="1716" /> drink to be sold to visitors in holiday camps, that licence should be extended to enable parties who go to the camps to get drink and take it away for consumption elsewhere.  I would suggest that we should license holiday camps only to enable them to sell intoxicating liquor to any person, either a visitor or a person rightly on the premises during non-prohibited hours, for consumption in the camps.</P>
    <P>Again, I cannot see why the holiday camp should have any right whatever or that there should be any demand to sell intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition is the same as that in the whole liquor licensing code and it would be objectionable to have another definition. It is also the definition that was in a Private Member's Bill introduced in 1949.  I think the Senator may be under a misapprehension as to what may follow on the enactment of this part of the Bill. Take the case of the best known holiday camp in Ireland.  The intention there was to license certain premises within the limits of the camp.  The effect of the amendment which the Senator proposes would be to make it impossible for them to sell drink for consumption within the camp but outside the limits of the particular premises that would be licensed.  I do not think that would be either desirable or necessary.  The camp proprietors have to avoid possible abuses. They have to ensure that the premises are properly conducted in order to obtain a renewal of the licence.  Local residents can make any objection if there is any abuse.  I think it would be desirable to permit visitors to the holiday camps to consume intoxicating liquor within the limits of the camp and not confine them to one part of the camp in respect of which the licence is granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw there might be some difficulty about that. For a moment I thought there might be a difficulty but there cannot be. &ldquo;On licence&rdquo; has a special meaning in the 1910 and other Acts and cannot affect the position here.  We can easily <Col N="1717" /> deal with it.  I have no objection and the licence application can be suitably dealt with and, if necessary, suitable provisions can be inserted that intoxicating liquor may be consumed by any person entitled to consume it in any part of the camp.</P>
      <P>My objection is not to the consumption in any part of the camp but to the holiday camp proprietor, who is dealing with people and concerned in the main for them, selling intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there would.  There would be other difficulties arising if the whole premises were licensed.  There can be no difficulty in suitably amending the section so that drink may be sold only in one part of the camp but consumed in all portions of the camp.</P>

      <P>My objection is that he should drink it outside the premises.  I have no objection to its being consumed on the premises.  In these holiday camps we are concerned with providing for residents and visitors to the camp.  We are not concerned with enabling these people to take drink outside the camps for consumption. We are concerned with enabling them to enjoy drink in the camp premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that <Col N="1718" /> they should not have the same licence as an hotel.  A holiday camp is completely different from an hotel.  An hotel offers an entirely different sort of holiday accommodation and does not deal with nearly as large a number of people as can be accommodated in a holiday camp.  A holiday camp will have no difficulty whatever in having its drinks consumed on the premises, anywhere on the premises, although they might be consumed off the part of the premises in which they are sold.  I agree that the holiday camp proprietors would be concerned with paying duty on the valuation.  The bigger the premises, the higher the valuation and, accordingly, the higher the amount of duty.  There will be no objection to my suggestion that the licence may be given for, say, an area of 50 square feet.</P>
