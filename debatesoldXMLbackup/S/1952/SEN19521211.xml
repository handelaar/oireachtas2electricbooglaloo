      <P>This Bill, as Senators will have seen, provides for the payment of pensions of £500 a year, as from the 1st April, <Col N="360" /> 1952, to the widows of two murdered Mayors of Limerick, Micheál Ó Cealleacháin and Seóirse Mac Flanncadha.  The proposed pension in each case is the same as that provided some time ago by another Act for the widow of the late Terence MacSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork.</P>
      <P>There is also provision in this Bill for the payment of a gratuity of £500 to Miss Síle MacCurtain, daughter of Tomás MacCurtain, another former Lord Mayor of Cork.  It was the intention to provide in this Bill for a pension for the widow of Tomás MacCurtain, but her recent regretted death has made that impossible.  Miss MacCurtain lived with her mother and cared for her during her illness, and for that reason it is proposed to pay her this gratuity which represents in amount one year's payment of the pension which would have been awarded to her mother.</P>

      <P>This is a short Bill, the purpose of which is to continue certain enactments which would otherwise expire on the 31st December.  Senators are familiar with the reasons for continuing these enactments and I do not think that it is necessary for me to detain the House with lengthy explanations, particularly as the position is set out in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As originally drafted, the Bill provided for the continuation of the expiring enactments only to 31st December, 1953.  An amendment was put forward in the Dáil extending this period to 31st December, 1960, and I saw no reason to disagree with it.  The present Bill is, to that extent, different <Col N="361" /> from its predecessors.  This change will not affect the preparation of the permanent legislation referred to in the explanatory memorandum.  The work will continue to go ahead and the permanent measures can be brought in when they are ready, thus making annual continuing legislation unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Except for the point I have mentioned, there is no new principle in the Bill.  I am sure the House will accept it.</P>

      <P>I should like to know why something is not being done with a view to codifying these two Acts, the Parliamentary Elections Act of 1868 and the Corrupt Practices Act of 1869.  I do not suggest that the Minister is responsible for all the postponements in regard to these two Acts, but we should be given an indication as to when the law in these matters will be codified.  Apparently, they are being brought in under the Expiring Laws Bills as they have been for many years, and it would appear, therefore, that very little, if anything, is being done about these matters.  Perhaps something is being done and, if so, I should like to hear from the Minister on it.</P>
      <P>I should also like to hear from the Minister something on the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act of 1925.  As I understand it, it is an Act restricting trade, and it seeks to prevent local authorities purchasing from or contracting with firms other than those firms who have terms of contract with local authorities.  If I am right in that, surely there is some restriction being placed on local authorities, and in these days when we hear so much about restrictive trade practices perhaps the Minister would let us know why it is necessary that this Act should be continued for a further period of six years. I think it is not right that we should continue these Acts for such long periods.  I think it is not right that year after year or, as it will now be under this new arrangement, every sixth year we should have these Acts re-enacted, as is being done.  Nothing is being done to bring them up-to-date or to put them on the Statute Book permanently or repeal them.</P>

      <P>The list of enactments referred to in the Bill is shorter to-day when compared with 15 or 20 years ago. It would not be correct to say that nothing is being done in regard to the two Acts to which Senator O'Reilly referred&mdash;the two Electoral Acts.  Work is going on in connection with them. I admit it is tedious and slow and in this matter of codification of the Acts the Department is not merely concerned with those two, but also with Acts of Parliament dealing with sanitary matters, housing, etc.</P>
      <P>All I can say is that the preparations that are necessary in regard to codification of the electoral laws are going ahead and, while I cannot give any indication as to when that work will be completed, I can assure the Seanad that everything that we can possibly do is being done.</P>
      <P>As far as the Combined Purchasing Act of 1925 is concerned, the Seanad is perhaps aware that there has been enacted a Combined Purchasing Act of 1939 which has not yet been brought into force and the Act which I am asking the Seanad to continue for the period mentioned does not, in effect, stop local authorities from making purchases from any particular firm or manufacturer if the local authorities concerned can purchase similar articles at similar prices to the prices at which they can purchase from other manufacturers. In that case, they are free to make such purchases.  There is no particular clause restricting their activities in that regard, as the Senator suggests.</P>

      <P>Yes.  So far as Section 65 is concerned, that is being covered in a Bill which it is hoped will be introduced in the next session.  The Combined Purchasing Act is covered by the 1939 Act, which is not yet in operation, and we are making provision <Col N="363" /> for clearing up the other two Acts dealing with electoral matters, but it is a very complicated question and will take some time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is primarily a technical one.  Its main purpose is to adjust the mechanism by which the panel members of this House are elected, so that that mechanism may function as smoothly as possible.  The contents of the Bill do not lend themselves to those statements of principle and general observations which are commonly associated with a Second Reading speech.  My explanations of the several provisions of the Bill and my reasons for them must necessarily be related to its successive sections.  While in the ordinary course of parliamentary procedure much of this might normally be deferred until the Committee Stage, it would seem desirable that these explanations should be put on record at the present stage in the case of this particular Bill so as to prepare for the special consideration which will no doubt be given to its contents at later stages.</P>
      <P>Under Article 18 of the Constitution, 43 members of Seanad Éireann must be elected from panels, and Section 7 of that Article provides for the constitution of those panels.  Before each general election five panels of candidates must be formed in the manner provided by law containing respectively the names of persons having knowledge and practical experience of certain specified interests and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of Article 18 provides also that not more than 11 and not less than five members shall be elected from any one panel.  These provisions are the constitutional foundation on which the <Col N="364" /> law governing the election of the panel members of Seanad Éireann has been and must be based.</P>
    <P>The present system of election had its origin in the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937, which regulated the registration of nominating bodies, the formation of the panels, and the poll at a general election.  By-elections were dealt with in a further Act in 1940.  In certain respects, however, the 1937 and 1940 Acts proved unsatisfactory, and in 1946 a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas was set up to examine the matter. Its terms of reference were wide, namely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To consider and make recommendations on the method of regulating elections of those elected members of Seanad Éireann who are required by the Constitution to be elected from panels of candidates, and the definition of the electorate for such elections.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The deliberations of the joint committee extended over a period of 15 months, and the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947, was the result of their report.  The 1947 Act is a long, comprehensive measure embodying the entire law governing the system of election of panel members of Seanad Éireann and including a number of important amendments of the earlier legislation.</P>
    <P>In the course of its operation a number of minor defects in the 1947 Act came to light, and an inter-departmental committee was set up to review the legislation, with special reference to the provisions which relate to nominating bodies and nomination committees and to the functions of the Clerk of the Seanad as Seanad returning officer.  The present Bill is based substantially on the report of that committee.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is, as its long title states, to amend and extend the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947.  The changes proposed relate to the registration of bodies as nominating bodies entitled to nominate persons for election to Seanad Éireann, the appointment by those bodies of nomination committees, and the procedure for nomination of candidates by <Col N="365" /> nominating bodies, together with a number of minor amendments.</P>
    <P>The need for the proposed legislation arises from two main causes.  First it is desirable to ease the responsibility placed on the Seanad returning officer by the 1947 Act of determining, subject to appeal, whether an applicant body is eligible to be registered as a nominating body.  It is proposed to do this by enabling the Seanad returning officer to refer doubtful applications to the appeal board set up under Section 12 of the 1947 Act.  Secondly, it is desirable to simplify the provisions of the 1947 Act in respect of nominations by nominating bodies at a general election. The Bill will substitute one formula for the several provisions in the 1947 Act governing the number of persons to be nominated by nominating bodies on the different panels.  The formula which is proposed is one which will obviate as far as practicable the need for having recourse to the nomination committees to reduce the total number of nominations for any of the panels to a manageable size.</P>
    <P>The Bill comprises 16 sections and a Schedule.  Section 1 defines the Principal Act as the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947.  Section 2 amends Section 16 of the Principal Act. Section 16, read with Section 11 of the Principal Act, deals with the annual revision of the register of nominating bodies by the Seanad returning officer. Amongst other things these sections give the Seanad returning officer a discretionary power to disallow an application for registration made by a body which is a branch of or affiliated or subsidiary to a body which is already registered or whose application for registration he has allowed.  It is proposed to make it mandatory on the Seanad returning officer to disallow every application for registration which appears to him to be made by a body which is a branch of or affiliated or subsidiary to a body which is already registered in the register, or the application of which for such registration he is allowing at the annual revision. Furthermore, the Seanad returning officer will be authorised to delete the names of branches and affiliated and subsidiary bodies from the register <Col N="366" /> when he allows the application of their parent body.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that no body which is at present registered will be affected by this provision unless a body of which it is a branch or to which it is affiliated or subsidiary applies for registration at some future annual revision, and the application is allowed.  Apart from the question of easing the burden placed on the Seanad returning officer, these amendments are desirable in view of the fact that since 1947 there is no limit on the number of bodies which may be registered for any panel.  Under the 1937 Act the maximum number of bodies which could be registered in respect of each panel was 15.</P>
    <P>The proposed new sub-section (3), which is being incorporated in Section 16 of the Principal Act, sets out categorically the powers and duties of the Seanad returning officer in regard to the allowance or disallowance of applications for registration at an annual revision and the deletion or amendment of entries in the register. It expressly requires the Seanad returning officer to delete from the register the names of bodies which apply for such deletion.  The Principal Act was not explicit on this point.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) of Section 16 of the Principal Act provides that the Seanad returning officer shall not make any deletion from or amendment of the register without giving notice to the body affected or without giving such body a reasonable opportunity of making representations in regard thereto.  It is proposed to waive these requirements where the body itself applies for such deletion or amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends Section 17 of the Principal Act, which provides for appeals to the appeal board against decisions of the Seanad returning officer.  The appeal board consists of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice to be chairman, the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of Dáil Éireann and the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Bodies whose applications for registration are disallowed and bodies whose registration has been deleted <Col N="367" /> by the Seanad returning officer have a right of appeal against such disallowances and deletions.  Section 17 also gives any body registered in the register and any body which applied for registration, whether the application was allowed or disallowed, the right of appeal against the allowance of an application for registration made by any other body.</P>
    <P>Thus, a body which applied for registration in respect of the Administrative Panel could, irrespective of whether its application was allowed or not, appeal against the allowance of an application made by another body for registration in respect of the Cultural and Educational Panel.  Section 3 of the Bill is intended to restrict this right of appeal against the allowance of an application for registration to bodies registered or which applied for registration in respect of the same panel, or bodies which are branches of or affiliated or subsidiary to the applicant body and which are registered or have applied for registration.  Furthermore, any body which has a right of appeal against a decision of the Seanad returning officer shall be notified of that decision.</P>
    <P>A further amendment of Section 17 of the Principal Act is proposed in Section 3 of the Bill so as to provide that where an appeal is made by a body against the allowance of an application by another body for registration, the appellant body must send a copy of its appeal to the body which made the application; and the latter may submit comments on the grounds of the appeal for consideration by the appeal board.  Where an appeal is made by a body against the disallowance of its own application for registration the body making the appeal must send a copy of it to every body which is a branch of or affiliated or subsidiary to it and which is registered or has applied at the annual revision for registration.  Any of the latter bodies may submit comments on the grounds of the appeal for consideration by the appeal board.  This provision is considered desirable, as such bodies would be excluded from the register if the appeal of the parent body were successful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> Section 4 of the Bill provides for the amendment of Section 18 of the Principal Act by the addition of a sub-section requiring the appeal board to include, where necessary, in its decision allowing or disallowing an application, a consequential direction to the Seanad returning officer to delete, or to restore or allow, the registration of any bodies which are branches of or affiliated or subsidiary to the applicant body.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that one of the main objects of this Bill is to enable the Seanad returning officer to refer difficult applications to the appeal board.  Section 5 proposes to insert a new section in the Principal Act, which will enable him to do this, and which will give the appeal board the necessary powers to deal with the referred application.  Provision is made whereby an objection to the application may be made to the appeal board by any of the bodies which could have appealed if the Seanad returning officer had allowed the application&mdash;that is to say, every body registered or which applied for registration in respect of the same panel, and every body which is registered or has applied for registration (irrespective of panel), and which is a branch of or affiliated or subsidiary to the applicant body.  A deposit of £20 (twenty pounds) is required from an objecting body.  This is the same sum as is required under the Principal Act in the case of an appeal.  The amount will be returned if the application to which objection is made is disallowed by the appeal board.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section includes provisions requiring the Seanad returning officer to inform the body concerned of the reference of its application to the appeal board, and to inform also any body which has a right of objection. If an objection is made, the objecting body must send a copy of the objection to the applicant body, and the latter may submit comments on the grounds of the objection for consideration by the appeal board.</P>
    <P>The reference of an application to the appeal board will be equivalent to an appeal, and no further appeal will be allowed.  If the appeal board allows an application, its decision shall, under the Bill, include where necessary, a <Col N="369" /> consequential direction to the Seanad returning officer to delete the registration of bodies which are branches of or affiliated or subsidiary to the applicant body.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill proposes to amend Section 22 of the Principal Act which deals with the appointment of nomination committees.  Section 22 requires each nominating body to appoint five persons to be members of the nomination committee for the panel in respect of which the body is registered. It is proposed to require that all persons appointed to a nomination committee shall be members of the body which appoints them.</P>
    <P>Under Section 22, the first appointment by a nominating body of members of a nomination committee is made either at an annual meeting of the body or at a meeting specially convened for the purpose.  Subsequent appointments are required to be made each year at an annual meeting.  As doubts have arisen as to the meaning of the expression &ldquo;annual meeting,&rdquo; it is proposed to define it as including a meeting to which all the members of the body are invited or a delegate meeting or a conference or congress. It is proposed to provide also for the making of second and subsequent appointments in the case of bodies which do not hold annual meetings.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Principal Act requires the interval between the annual meetings of a nominating body to be not more than 400 days and not less than 330 days.  This is not in conformity with the provisions of Section 64 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, which applies to a number of nominating bodies and allows a period of 15 months between annual meetings. It is proposed to remove any inconsistency by providing that the interval between the annual meetings shall be not more than 15 and not less than nine months.</P>
    <P>One of the consequential amendments in the Schedule&mdash;Reference No. 6&mdash;provides for a maximum term of office for 15 months for a member of a nomination committee.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains the second major change proposed in the Bill, that is, the replacement of the rather lengthy <Col N="370" /> provisions of the Principal Act, in regard to the number of persons to be nominated by nominating bodies in various circumstances, by one formula. The provisions of the Principal Act are designed with the ultimate object of placing on each panel which is put before the electorate a number of nominees of nominating bodies not greater than twice the maximum number which may be elected from the appropriate sub-panel, and not less than the maximum number plus two.</P>
    <P>For instance, of the 11 members who may be elected from the Agricultural Panel, at least four must be elected from each sub-panel and, therefore, the maximum number that could be elected from either sub-panel is seven.  In this case the names of not more than 14 and not less than nine nominees of nominating bodies must be placed before the electorate.</P>
    <P>To achieve this, each nominating body nominates a certain number of candidates, calculated in accordance with Section 26 of the Principal Act. The actual number to be nominated depends on the panel and the number of nominating bodies, but it cannot be less than two.</P>
    <P>Where the number of bodies registered in respect of a panel is less than three, the total number of candidates which is required to be put forward on the nominating bodies sub-panel is equal to twice the maximum number which may be elected from the sub-panel. One or two bodies cannot make this number of nominations, even if there is no duplication, and in such cases the Taoiseach must nominate persons to bring the nomination up to the required number.</P>
    <P>Where the number of bodies registered in respect of a panel is three or more, the total number of persons whom they are required to propose for nomination must be at least equal to twice the maximum number which may be elected plus four.  A meeting of the nomination committee for the panel must then be convened for the purpose of holding an election to reduce the number proposed for nomination to twice the maximum number which may be elected.  If it should happen that the number proposed for nomination <Col N="371" /> is less than twice the maximum number plus four, the Taoiseach is required to make supplementary nominations to bring the number up to that figure before the nomination committee meets to reduce it to twice the maximum number that may be elected.</P>
    <P>There are, for example, at present eight nominating bodies registered in respect of the Agricultural Panel. Each is entitled to put forward three candidates, that is, 24 in all.  Then the nomination committee has to meet and reduce the 24 to twice the maximum number that may be elected from either sub-panel&mdash;that is, 14.</P>
    <P>The final step is the &ldquo;completion of the panels&rdquo; which involves a ruling by the Seanad returning officer, with a judicial referee, on the nominations and the qualifications of the persons remaining on the panels.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that nominating bodies should as far as possible be real nominators and that the ratio between the number of persons proposed for nomination at any stage and the maximum number of persons that may ultimately be put before the electorate on the nominating bodies sub-panel should be kept as low as possible.  The proposals contained in Section 7 are aimed at simplifying the Principal Act in this respect and obviating as far as practicable the nomination of large numbers of persons who have little chance of having their names placed before the electorate. The proposed new provision, which will be applicable in all cases, is that the number of persons which may be proposed for nomination to a panel by each nominating body shall be not more than the number ascertained by dividing twice the maximum number that may be elected from the nominating bodies sub-panel by the total number of nominating bodies registered in respect of the panel, and if the number so obtained is not a whole number, the next higher whole number.  In Section 34 of the Principal Act the figures representing twice the maximum number that may be elected from the nominating bodies sub-panels of the various panels are conveniently set out and described as &ldquo;the appropriate number,&rdquo; and the Bill <Col N="372" /> refers to this.  It is to be noted that the proposal involves the repeal of the provisions of the Principal Act which require the nomination of a minimum of two candidates by every nominating body.</P>
    <P>The effect of the new formula on the Agricultural Panel will be to enable the eight registered nominating bodies to put forward two candidates each, that is, 16 altogether, instead of 24 as at present.  By virtue of Section 10 of the Bill, to which I will come in a few moments, the names of these 16 candidates, if their nominations are in order, will be placed directly on the panel which goes before the electors, and a meeting of the nomination committee will not be held.</P>
    <P>These amendments which I have outlined are the result of the fullest possible consideration designed to simplify and improve the procedure.</P>
    <P>It is proposed by Section 8 to permit a nominating body, if it so desires, to propose less than the maximum number of persons it is entitled to propose.  At present the nomination is void if the body proposes either more or less than the actual number of persons which it is entitled to propose for nomination.</P>
    <P>Section 9 proposes the repeal of the provisions in Section 28 of the Principal Act whereby the Taoiseach makes nominations to supplement nominations by nominating bodies in certain circumstances.  At present if the number of bodies registered in respect of a panel is less than three the Taoiseach must be called upon to bring the number of nominations up to the desired figure of twice the maximum number which may be elected from the sub-panel. This will be unnecessary under the proposed scheme, as the nominating bodies themselves will be able to nominate the desired number.</P>
    <P>If the number of bodies registered in respect of the panel is three or more the Taoiseach must at present make proposals for nomination if the total number of proposals for nomination made by the bodies happens to be less than twice the maximum number which may be elected from the sub-panel plus four.</P>
    <P>To illustrate this, I will again quote the Agricultural Panel.  If, instead <Col N="373" /> of the 24 possible nominations that could be made under the present system, only 16 are made, the Taoiseach is required to nominate an additional two to bring the number up to 18&mdash;that is twice the maximum number plus four.  The nomination committee must then meet to reduce this number to 14 by a poll.</P>
    <P>I would like, however, to draw attention to the fact that Section 37 of the Principal Act is not being repealed. Section 37 enables the Taoiseach to make, at the completion of the panels, supplemental nominations to either a nominating bodies sub-panel or an Oireachtas sub-panel if the total number of nominations for the sub-panel does not exceed by at least two the maximum number which could be elected from the sub-panel.  It is necessary to retain this provision, as it is conceivable that in certain circumstances the number of nominations might not be sufficient if, for example, there was duplication in the nominations or if some nominating bodies did not make any nominations or did not make the full number of nominations they were entitled to make.</P>
    <P>Section 10 will modify the rule which determines whether a nomination committee meeting must be called and will obviate such meetings as far as possible. The nomination committees are simply aggregates of representatives of the nominating bodies and where a manageable number of nominations can be obtained from the bodies themselves there is no point in convening a meeting of their nomination committee to reduce the number of nominations. This section and Section 7 are designed to ensure that the persons put forward by the bodies will all be persons who have a fair prospect of having their names go before the electorate.</P>
    <P>The amendment in Section 10 is simple.  At present the greatest number of persons which may be placed on a nominating bodies sub-panel is twice the maximum number which may be elected from it.  If more than this number are nominated, the nomination committee must meet.  It is proposed to allow an excess of one or two over this number to be placed on the sub-panel; that is to say, a nomination <Col N="374" /> committee meeting would be held only when there were three or more nominations in excess of the desired number. To go back to the example from the Agricultural Panel I have quoted, Section 10 would provide that where 16 nominations are made to the Agricultural Panel it will not be necessary to convene the nomination committee to reduce this number to 14.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill is consequential on Section 10 and proposes to repeal sub-section (2) of Section 35 of the Principal Act, dealing with the preparation of the provisional nominating bodies sub-panel in cases where a meeting of the nominating committee is not held, and to substitute a new sub-section to fit in with the new provisions.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding further, I would like to indicate the effect of the proposals contained in Sections 7 to 11 of the Bill on each of the five panels. There are 12 bodies registered at the moment in respect of the Cultural and Educational Panel.  At present these must nominate two candidates each, i.e., 24 candidates in all, and the nomination committee must meet and reduce this number by an election to six, that is, twice the maximum number of candidates that may be elected from the nominating bodies sub-panel of the Cultural and Educational Panel. Under the Bill, each body would put forward one candidate, i.e., 12 altogether. It would still be necessary to call on the nomination committee to reduce the number to six, but it is obvious that each candidate's chance of being put on the sub-panel is greatly improved.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the position in regard to the Agricultural Panel, but it may be no harm to repeat it.  There are eight nominating bodies registered, each of which must put forward three candidates, i.e., 24 in all.  The nomination committee must reduce this number to 14. Under the Bill each body would put forward two candidates&mdash;16 in all &mdash;and all would be placed directly on the sub-panel.  There would be no need to call a meeting of the nomination committee because the number of nominations (that is, 16) would not exceed by three or more twice the maximum <Col N="375" /> number (that is, 14) which may be elected from the sub-panel.</P>
    <P>For the Labour Panel there are four bodies registered at present, each of which must put forward five candidates&mdash;20 altogether.  The nomination committee must meet and reduce this number to 14.  Under the Bill, each body would put forward four candidates, i.e., 16 in all&mdash;and all would be placed on the sub-panel.  Here, again, there would be no need to call a meeting of the nomination committee because the number of candidates would not exceed by three or more twice the maximum number which may be elected.</P>
    <P>For the Industrial and Commercial Panel 16 bodies are registered at present.  Each must nominate two candidates&mdash;32 in all.  The nomination committee must reduce this large number to 12.  Under the Bill, each body would put forward one candidate, or 16 in all.  From this 16 the nomination committee would elect the 12 to be placed on the sub-panel.</P>
    <P>For the Administrative Panel two bodies are registered.  At present each may nominate three candidates, i.e., six altogether.  As eight is the appropriate number for the sub-panel, the Taoiseach must make two nominations. Under the Bill, each body on this sub-panel could nominate four members and it would not be necessary for the Taoiseach to make nominations.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill proposes to amend Section 43 of the Principal Act in such a way as to require that the panels of candidates shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in the same form as they are issued to the electors.  Section 43 provides that the panels when completed shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and that the name, address and description of each candidate shall be given.  Section 46 of the Principal Act requires copies of the panels to be issued to each elector containing, in addition to the particulars published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the name of the body or persons on whose nomination a candidate was put on the panel.  This necessitates two separate prints, involving additional work at a busy period for the Seanad returning <Col N="376" /> officer's staff, and unnecessary expense, all of which Section 12 of the Bill is intended to obviate.</P>
    <P>Section 13 amends Section 61 of the Principal Act, which has reference to the proceedings of a nomination committee which has met to elect a person to fill a casual vacancy in the membership of the Seanad.  At such a meeting any one member of the nomination committee present is entitled to nominate a person for election.</P>
    <P>If more than one person is nominated the meeting is adjourned for the purpose of taking a poll, on the result of which the Seanad returning officer issues a certificate of provisional election. It is considered that three is the minimum number of members of the nomination committee who should subscribe to a nomination at a by-election meeting of the committee and the amendment proposed in Section 13 of the Bill will provide accordingly.</P>
    <P>In view of the proposal that there should be three nominators, it is not considered desirable to retain the provision which allows the withdrawal of nominations at a nomination committee by-election meeting, and Section 13 provides for the repeal of this provision.</P>
    <P>The reason for Section 14 lies in the fact that at the ruling upon nominations for a nominating bodies sub-panel casual vacancy the only nomination paper which can be questioned is that of the person named in the certificate of provisional election and questions can be raised only by the Seanad returning officer and the person so named or his agent.  There seems to be little point, therefore, in publishing in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the certificate of provisional election and a notice stating the date and place for the ruling upon nomination as required by sub-section (3) of Section 63 of the Principal Act&mdash; nor in holding the nomination papers available for inspection, as required by sub-section (5) of Section 63.  It is accordingly proposed to delete these two sub-sections.</P>
    <P>As regards the Schedule to the Bill, a few items call for comment.  Under Reference No. 2 it is proposed to amend sub-section (2) of Section 16 of <Col N="377" /> the Principal Act by substituting &ldquo;at 5 p.m. on the 14th day of February&rdquo; for &ldquo;on the 15th day of February&rdquo;. This refers to the time when the period for the receipt of applications in connection with the annual revision of the register of nominating bodies shall terminate, and the amendment is designed, first, to provide that this period shall terminate before the day on which the annual revision begins, and, secondly, to fix a definite hour up to which the Seanad returning officer will remain available for the receipt of applications.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned Reference No. 6, whereby sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the Principal Act is amended to impose a limit of 15 months on the duration of the membership of a member of a nomination committee.</P>
    <P>As regards References Nos. 8 and 11, under Section 25 of the Principal Act, nominations are made by members of the Oireachtas, a member of the Oireachtas being defined in Section 2 of that Act as a member of Dáil Éireann or a member of Seanad Éireann.  Section 44, sub-section (1), defines the electorate at a Seanad general election as consisting of (a) the members of Dáil Éireann elected at the Dáil election consequent on the dissolution of Dáil Éireann which occasioned such Seanad general election, and (b) the members of Seanad Éireann and (c) the members of every council of a county or county borough.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution, a general election for Seanad Éireann must take place not later than 90 days after a dissolution of Dáil Éireann.  If, shortly after reassembly, the new Dáil should be dissolved, the Seanad election, consequent on the first dissolution, would still require to be carried out&mdash;to be followed later by a second Seanad general election.  The second dissolution of the Dáil would not affect in any way the right of Senators to nominate and vote in the Seanad general election, as they would still be members of Seanad Éireann until the new Seanad was elected; but the position as regards Deputies is not so clear, as they might have ceased to be members of Dáil Éireann before nominations and polling at the Seanad general election could take place.  It is, accordingly, <Col N="378" /> proposed to remove any doubt by providing that for the purposes of Sections 25 and 44 the further dissolution of Dáil Éireann shall be deemed not to have occurred.</P>
    <P>Reference Nos. 10 and 14 amend Sections 34 and 62 of the Principal Act respectively.  These sections outline the procedure at nomination committee meetings, and provide that the Seanad returning officer and his assistants, and the persons named in the electoral roll constituted for the meeting may be present at the meeting.  It is desirable to make it clear that the meeting comes to a close with the close of the poll, and, therefore, the only persons who shall be entitled to be present at the ascertainment of the result of the poll shall be, as indicated in the Principal Act, the Seanad returning officer and his assistants and the candidates or their duly appointed representative.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 12 contains an amendment of Section 45 of the Principal Act designed to make statutory what has been the regular practice, that is, the publication of the electoral roll for a Seanad general election in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>Reference Nos. 16 and 17 amend Sections 64 and 68 of the Principal Act which deal with the ruling upon nominations at Seanad by-elections. The provision proposed, viz., that the Seanad returning officer shall have due regard to all decisions if the judicial referee on questions referred to him by the Seanad returning officer, is similar to that contained in Section 36 of the Principal Act which deals with the corresponding stage at a Seanad general election.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 20 proposes an amendment of the First Schedule to the Principal Act&mdash;Rule 8, paragraph (2)&mdash;so as to include the Clerk-Assistant of Seanad Éireann and the Clerk-Assistant of Dáil Éireann among the persons having authority to witness declarations of identity.</P>
    <P>In regard to Reference No. 21, which proposes an amendment of Rule 8 of the Second Schedule, no alteration in the present practice is involved.  Rule 8 provides that whenever the number of candidates on a sub-panel who have been deemed to be elected is equal to <Col N="379" /> the maximum number of candidates that could at that time be elected in respect of such sub-panel, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  no further candidate shall be deemed to be elected in respect of that sub-panel, and</P>
    <P>(2)  the value of the votes of the remaining candidates on such sub-panel shall be transferred before any other transfer is made.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; is used in the rules both in relation to the transfer of a candidate's votes or surplus and the transfer of part of a candidate's votes, that is, of a parcel or sub-parcel during the count following an exclusion.</P>
    <P>It is desired to make it quite clear that the transfer to which paragraph (3) of Rule 8 refers is the transfer of a candidate's votes or surplus; in other words, the count in progress when the sub-panel is filled shall be completed before the votes of the remaining candidates on the sub-panel who cannot be elected are dealt with.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (4) of Rule 8, it is stated that the value of the votes of the remaining candidates shall be transferred in the same manner as in the case of a transfer on the exclusion of a candidate.  It is desirable to link this provision more closely with paragraph (3) and also to make it clear that each of the remaining candidates shall be treated as a continuing candidate for counting purposes until the transfer of his votes begins.</P>

      <P>It takes a certain amount of faith, having listened more or less carefully to the speech of the Minister, to believe that the object of the Bill is to simplify Seanad elections, but I would nevertheless ask the House to take my word for it, as well as that of the Minister, that that is the object and that the Bill, to a certain extent, does so.  It is quite obvious that this is not the kind of Bill on which a Second Reading debate would serve any useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of the Bill is that the method of election to the Seanad can be improved and we might pass that unanimously.  If so, obviously the <Col N="380" /> right thing to do is to pass the Second Reading and send this Bill to a committee, preferably a committee which can send for persons and papers, so that we could have direct evidence from officials who have been examining the Act and see how far we can get along.  I think it will require a good deal of thought.  I have read the Bill but have not digested it.  There are some things which I would like to suggest and there are also some matters not dealt with in it on which there might be agreement and which possibly ought to be dealt with.  All that, it will be generally agreed, is a matter for a committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that this is a Bill on which a Second Stage discussion cannot be of any great value.  The principle of the Bill as set out in the Minister's speech is to simplify the present method of selection from the panels.  The best course I think would be to have this matter considered by a Select Committee. It will take a good deal of time. A good deal of work will have to be put into the consideration of the various points.  I think that there are certain things that are not included in the Bill which might usefully be put in with the result that it would be a better Bill.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the opportunity has been given to have this Bill introduced in the Seanad, which is primarily concerned with its results or effects.  If the House agrees to give it a Second Reading now, it could be moved that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator Douglas and Senator Hearne, I was just wondering whether it would be possible for anybody to suggest such a revolutionary thing as the inclusion in this Bill of a proposal to change the electors.  At the present moment the Bill follows the same formula as before. The electors of this House are comprised of members of the Dáil, Seanad and the county councils.  There is a general feeling outside that this Seanad is not a vocational Seanad as it was originally set out to be, and that a new method of election in the nominating <Col N="381" /> bodies' section should be adopted, that the nominated bodies themselves should be able to elect direct.  It would be proper that in any committee such a proposal might be discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (9) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(9) The Minister may by regulation prescribe a 50 per cent, reduction of duty for the vehicles referred to in paragraph 4(c) and (d) of Part I of the Schedule and in paragraph 3 of Part II of the Schedule provided they are used on the public roads exclusively for traffic between a farmer's premises and the local creamery, or within a radius which does not exceed the distance from the farmer's premises to the nearest railway station or his accustomed market town (whichever distance is the greater).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> I put down this recommendation because I was very much impressed by the remarks that Senator Baxter made about the important part that locally-owned tractors and tractor vehicles are playing in the bringing of milk to rural creameries and in accommodating neighbours as well as their owners in bringing produce to the market and cattle to local fairs.  I think it is highly desirable that we should encourage in every possible way this kind of local traffic.  There ought to be nothing controversial about it and there ought to be nothing competitive about it with regard to the interests of the public transport system.  In fact, it is eminently suited not only to do valuable service locally but also to fit in with the general public transport system which, as we know, really needs new blood and new traffic very badly.</P>
    <P>If this recommendation were adopted the net financial effect would be that a tractor which otherwise would be liable to a tax of £8 would have to pay £4 and a tractor which would otherwise be liable to a tax of £31 10s. would have to pay 15 guineas.  The actual loss of revenue would be neither here nor there because, as the Minister pointed out, the total taxation of tractors is only estimated to bring in £31,000.  I think the effect in encouraging effective use of scarce equipment and in the saving of manpower, and the effects of that in promoting production, especially agricultural production, would far more than compensate for any indirect loss of revenue that might result.  I have much pleasure in making this recommendation to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>While we must appreciate the interest of Senator Johnston in putting down this recommendation, I think any Senator who reads it will admit, no matter how enthusiastic he might be to give certain favourable reliefs to those people employed in agriculture, that this section, as it is before the House, is entirely unworkable.  For that reason I would ask the Senator not to press it.  I cannot see how it could be worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is my opinion. Apart altogether from any other objections I might have to this recommendation, <Col N="383" /> I feel that it would be quite impracticable to work a scheme of that nature.  I doubt very much if it would even be fair.  Suppose you had a trader who was interested in the haulage and distribution of his own goods over a limited radius and let us suppose he employed a small tractor with the same carrying capacity as that of the two to three ton lorry, why should he get a preferential rate of tax?  Why should he get a rate of tax which would enable him to achieve the same purpose as that achieved by a businessman who would employ a two to three ton lorry and pay a tax of about £50?</P>
      <P>There are all kinds of objections to this recommendation.  I think it is entirely unworkable, and I am satisfied that if you attempted to work it, instead of doing justice, you would be doing in many cases a much greater injustice than the Senator is trying honestly to undo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it should be possible to grant the concession sought on such conditions as would cover the points in the Senator's recommendation? Having regard to the fact that the farmer gets 1/4 per gallon for his milk, out of which he has to pay 2d. for carriage of the milk to the creamery, the production of milk in this country will be on the down grade.  It seems to me to be a very exceptional type of case, and it should not be impossible for the Minister to accept this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has replied to a case that Senator Johnston has not made at all?  The amendment of the Senator seeks to achieve what the Minister says he cannot accept.  Senator Johnston's amendment deals with vehicles used in haulage between the farmer's premises and the local creamery and his radius does not extend outside that.  It would not be greater than from the farmer's premises to the local railway station. Senator Johnston visualises these vehicles in the possession of the farmer used only for carrying the farmer's produce within a limited radius and he does not visualise the case of the <Col N="384" /> trader distributing goods, that come in from outside, by means of a tractor to his customer.  I think there is a great difference between the transport of the goods which are the produce of the farm from the farm to the point of destination and the case which the Minister cites of a trader using a tractor to deliver a pound of tea from a shop to the customer.  I think the Minister has made no case at all against this amendment.  I have an amendment further down which is wider in scope and I will deal with that situation when we come to it in a more satisfactory way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to get from Senators when a farmer is a farmer and when a trader is a trader.  Under the code of motor taxation which this measure will replace, there was a concession given to what were termed &ldquo;agricultural lorries&rdquo;.  That was a special concession which, irrespective of the weight or carrying capacity of such vehicles, fixed a licence duty of £25.  That state of affairs continued for 26 years, and when a particular case came before the courts as to whether or not some of the persons paying this tax were, in fact, farmers, so far as I can recall, the courts decided in favour of the owner of the vehicles although, having some land, the owners were mostly concerned with business.  Is it now to be suggested that a farmer could not reside in a town and carry on business as well as the farm and use a tractor for business as well as for agricultural work? There is nothing wrong in the argument which I have devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not proceed with this recommendation any further, but I should like to point out in answer to what the Minister was saying, that there is an administrative problem involved.  There is an administrative problem involved in determining when is a farmer not a farmer, but the Minister has assumed the obligation of solving that problem in the very terms of this Act.  In Part II of the Schedule the privilege of paying the £8 tax instead of the £31 10s. tax is confined to a person whose only or chief occupation is farming.  Therefore, it is not beyond the responsibility and it is <Col N="385" /> certainly not beyond the capacity of the Minister to determine whether any given person is a farmer or not.  It is not an insoluble administrative problem, first of all, to convey a certain privilege in the terms of this recommendation and, secondly, to make sure that the privilege is not abused and is confined to the people that he wants to enjoy it.  I will withdraw the recommendation at this stage.</P>
      <P>Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (9) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(9) The Minister may by regulation prescribe a 50 per cent reduction of duty for vehicles referred to in paragraph 5 of Part I of the Schedule on condition that they are used exclusively within a prescribed radius from the owner's residence or business premises.  In prescribing such radius the Minister shall take into account local geographical and other conditions, and the accessibility of local centres where public transport facilities by road or rail are conveniently available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to explain as briefly as possible what is at the back of my mind in moving this recommendation. The object of this proposed change is to make it easier for privately owned road transport to co-operate with the public transport system.  I do not want to introduce any controversial talk about the public transport problem, but I think there would be general agreement that it would be desirable that there should be co-operation rather than competition between privately owned road transport and the public transport system.  It is reasonable to suggest that that co-operation will be forthcoming more readily if it becomes worth the while financially of important road transport interests to carry on their undertakings in co-operation with the public transport system and equally I would say that the psychological atmosphere of <Col N="386" /> this desirable co-operation would be furthered if Córas Iompair Éireann would withdraw their proposal to restrict compulsorily the movements of heavier forms of road transport.  The powers that would be given to the Minister by this recommendation, if it were adopted, are permissive.  He need not exercise them if he does not think it well to do so and it is quite possible that in the present set-up of the public transport system and its relations, or absence of relations, with privately owned transport, he would find little or no opportunity of exercising those powers, but I think it is reasonable to look forward to certain obvious reoganisations of the public transport system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that if locally owned transport that keeps itself within a certain prescribed radius is given a favourable rate of taxation that there are some, and possibly many, owners of road transport who would find it worth their while to qualify for that favourable rate of taxation by keeping the movements of the road transport within that local radius.  Within that local radius they would actually be able to reach out to road and rail centres of public transport, and the new reduced taxation I propose would favour co-operation between privately owned road transport and the public transport system.  I am sorry, Sir, it is not possible for me to indicate the particular reorganisation of public transport which would make this recommendation clearer and enable it to become <Col N="387" /> by no means a dead letter but a living means of bringing about more active and friendly co-operation between privately owned and public transport.</P>

      <P>The only remarks I want to make on this recommendation are that this idea of prescribing a radius should be avoided at any time possible as entirely objectionable and to my mind as utterly unworkable.  How could you provide that a person or persons who would possess this type of licence would operate inside the radius?  I agree that no matter what scheme of motor taxation you decide upon you will have cases where there will be some confusion and where evasion can be successfully practised.  In any measure of this nature, the Minister and Parliament should do everything in their power to ensure that the number of occasions on which such a state of affairs will arise will be as few as possible.  One of the first objections one sees to an amendment like this is that you are asking a Minister to prescribe a radius inside which these particular licences will apply.

      <P>I did not contemplate any single arbitrary distance &mdash;20 or 30 miles radius or anything of that kind.  I am quite aware that in some parts of the country a 20-mile radius might be adequate, while in other parts, such as Connemara and the West generally there would be no sense in having any less than a radius of 50 or 60 miles, having due regard to geographical circumstances.  But one might draw a line&mdash;it might be oval or elliptical&mdash;indicating the area within which the person might operate at a lower rate of taxation.  That would then be represented on a map of some kind of the local area which the vehicle would have to carry on a disc just like a taxi disc on the windscreen. <Col N="388" /> Anybody outside the bounds could easily be stopped by the local Gardaí. That scheme would be quite easy to administer.  In all such taxation which in any way affects transport we should bear in mind the general transport problem, and any change that one might make should not make the solution of other transport problems more difficult.</P>

      <P>This is a simple recommendation which explains itself.  It is suggested that there should be four-quarters of three months, instead of a very short one at the beginning of the year.  I know that people who pay quarterly have found it inconvenient to remember that the first quarter ends on March 24th. There may be extremely good reasons for it that I do not understand.  I put it down to see what the Minister had to say.</P>

      <P>I am told that this is provided for because the 31st March is the end of the financial year, and it is desirable to have the period so fixed, because of the congestion which might be caused on account of the need there is to have the money collected inside the period and to have it arrive in the Exchequer by the end of the financial year.  That has been the practice since 1920, and it is the practice in Great Britain.  If it was found to be a good practice in Great Britain or anywhere else, there is no reason why it should not be followed here.</P>

I know the State is very hard put, but is this going to make any real difference? That people should pay for one quarter to the 24th March instead of 31st March to qualify for the financial period seems to me inequitable. It seems to me to be one of those things carried on because it is done in Britain and is all right.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister as far as that is concerned, but I am suggesting we have had 20 years to change it.  It is inconvenient and the only reason why it is done is because money has to be got by the 24th March as distinct from the 31st.  It definitely is not convenient and I think most people will agree.  You do not have similar conditions in the other quarters. I thought possibly there was some good reason for it.  I am not going to press the recommendation.  If the Government consider that collecting <Col N="390" /> money from the 24th of March as distinct from the 31st is of prime importance, or of sufficient importance to cause inconvenience otherwise, it is not for me to say to the contrary.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested to me that when this was first established the reason for taking the 24th March was to ensure that the Easter period would practically always be included in the second quarter. When this was first decided on, motoring was not so comfortable an occupation. There will be cases where people are laying up cars for the winter period and not taxing them for the first quarter. That being so, cars taxed for the second quarter commencing on the 26th March would more often be taxed for the Easter holiday period than if the date were 31st March.  That has been advanced to me as the reason that this was first established.  I am not sure if that is the correct reason.</P>
      <P>There has not been a good case made by Senator Douglas for any change except a case of equity, that the other date would be more equitable.  Senator O'Donnell has made that case also.  It is a small thing and I am surprised that two well-to-do men would be so small about such small things.</P>
      <P>The average person does not seem to mind a lot.  There are cases where people do not tax their cars for the first quarter.  More often than not I think they tax only for the second or succeeding quarters, and so would be on the road for the Easter period. As far as I know, Easter is decided by the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox, again subject to correction, but that, I suggest, was the original purpose in establishing the 25th March.  I think that those reasons are as good as those suggested by Senator Douglas and Senator O'Donnell.  I think it is better to leave the matter as it is.</P>

      <P>I intervene simply in order to give a small amount of accurate information on the subject. I speak from memory, but I think my memory is correct.  The last speaker suggested that the 25th March as the close of the quarter dates back only to the beginning of motoring and is in <Col N="391" /> some way connected with the convenience of motorists for the Easter holidays.  The fact is that the 25th March is the old quarter day going back to the Middle Ages, Lady Day or the Gale Day for the collection of rents.</P>

      <P>Now, when the old calendar was reformed in the beginning of the 18th century and the date was moved forward to the 5th April, the 5th&mdash;not the 1st&mdash;became the first day of the financial year.  If there was to be real consistency in the collection of motor taxation so as to coincide with the financial year, it should be shifted to the 4th April from the 24th March.  I think it is correct that the origin of the 25th March goes back to the Middle Ages.  Lady Day was the close of the first quarter of the year, and it was in the reformed calender that the financial year was shifted forward 11 days to the 5th April.  Speaking subject to correction, I think that is still the beginning of the financial year, strictly speaking.</P>

As the law stands now, they get an extra week in the second quarter of the year and I see no reason why we should change that.  I do not know if Senator O'Reilly's contention is correct about Easter and I am not going to argue about it.  The man who has put his car up because he cannot afford to run it in the winter time gets an extra week in the second quarter. I think it should be left with him, as he is in essence the poor motorist.</P>

      <P>In fairness to Senator Douglas and myself, it should be pointed out that there is a moral aspect of this.  We are not interested so much in the financial aspect.  A man pays a quarter's taxation and it is extraordinary that in this modern age of civilisation we can get anyone to say that the State by law should defraud him of what he has paid for, though &ldquo;defraud&rdquo; is not the exact word. There is a very important moral aspect attached to this and Senator Douglas and myself have been prompted by no other reason than that moral aspect, which needs more serious consideration than that of working in a time to suit the State for collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the moral aspect of this business at all and was not anxious to speak again on the matter if it were not for what I regard as an over-emphasis of that point by Senator O'Donnell.  If the law sets out in relation to any matter, whether it is for the use of a motor-car or the use of an implement or a machine, that in respect of the licence duty I should pay for two months £5, for the next three months £6, and so on, there is nothing immoral about that.  If the first quarter is shorter than the second quarter and if the tax is the same for each quarter, there is nothing immoral about that, so long as the law provides for it.  If I do not regard the value I am getting as sufficient, I need not take it; but as long as the law provides it I cannot see where the moral aspect comes in.</P>

If it is considered desirable that there <Col N="393" /> should be a special concession in certain cases, I have no objection; but that is no reason why the first quarter should not be from the period from the 1st January to the 31st March.  I am now more convinced that there are no really good grounds for the present position at all.  I thought there were good grounds and expected to hear them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they must be taken together.  I put down this recommendation in the hope that it would be accepted.  This matter was debated at some length yesterday and also in the other House, and I want to say quite frankly to the Minister that I have no political motive whatever in putting the recommendation down.  There is a problem which I am trying to resolve in the way in which I think it ought to be resolved and can be resolved.  From the technical point of view of drafting, I may not, by this recommendation, achieve all I am setting out to achieve and if the Minister wants to say that I am building up a sort of political story around this plan of taxation, he is welcome to say so, but it is not a fact.  We are, by a process of taxation, making difficulties for certain groups of our people, and I do not think we are justified in doing so.  When we are vested with political authority, it is <Col N="394" /> most important that we should study carefully the use we make of this political power.</P>
      <P>I am seeking in these recommendations for permission for the people dealt with in sub-paragraph (c), the owners of tractors, people whose only or chief occupation is farming, whose vehicles are used on public roads, and then only for the produce of their farms to do this agricultural work, the haulage of similar goods, for another farmer for a reward.  There is a concrete case which I cited yesterday evening, and this is really a small problem.  I have not got all the figures, but the Minister has indicated that what is expected to be received from this levy altogether amounts to £31,000 approximately.  There were, in 1949, 10,000 odd tractors, and I am sure that the figure has considerably increased since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no figures, although they may be available, as to how many of these tractors are doing the kind of work which I know they are doing in my county.  I take it that this sum of £31,000 is the amount the Minister expects to receive under the revised taxation or is it the amount received under the existing scale of taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to see that, because, if there are 14,000 tractors, naturally the yield would be more than £31,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of these licensed for this sort of haulage is very much smaller.  The Minister has made use of the phrase here and elsewhere that these tractors might be going into competition with certain other hauliers, people who have lorries, and he does not apparently desire that it should be possible that one man engaged in the haulage of, say, farm products should have one rate of taxation and another man a higher rate.  The first point I make against that is that the man with a tractor will not set out from Bailieborough to Donnelly's factory in Dublin with a load of pigs, while the man with the lorry will.  You cannot make a comparison <Col N="395" /> between what the man with a tractor and trailer will do in his own district and what the man with the lorry will do.</P>
      <P>These tractors, as I know them, are used for local haulage.  They are doing a kind of work which is terribly important. It is labour saving; it is an immense convenience to farmers; and it is the greatest convenience of all to farmers in the most backward parts of the country, the men who are away in at the back of the hill and who if, he has four or five pigs to take to the factory, in the morning starts out with his horse and cart and is on the road all day when he could get his neighbour to do the work with his tractor and trailer and pay him.  He will take them in and the owner need not go in at all.  Similarly, in the case of fairs, if there are a few cattle to be brought in, the neighbour may be going in himself with an empty trailer to bring something back from the fair, but he cannot legally take those cattle into the fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister: if he, living on a farm in Cavan, wants to get something like this done, will he not want to be independent?  I have my milk taken to the creamery and it is quite impossible for me to pay back, by this sort of indirect method, the man who takes my milk every day.  I want to pay him cash.  I do not want to turn out my horse and cart or pony and cart on the road, and have my man spend half the day going to the creamery.  If there are, as there are, 15 men in the area, each will have to do that and we can calculate the loss of time involved, in these days when labour in the country is difficult to obtain, in locking up the time of 15 men in doing this work.  If any strangers from New Zealand passed along some of the roads down in Waterford, Tipperary or Kerry on a summer day, when the milk is being separated, and saw all the farmers there with their horses and carts, they <Col N="396" /> would wonder what sort of a country this was.</P>
      <P>I saw a Danish film the other day showing two horses and a dray hauling milk, and that is the practice in parts of Denmark still, and in Holland, too. I do not think I ever saw&mdash;and I have been watching milk being hauled to the creamery for a long time&mdash;two horses and a dray doing it in this country.  I do not know whether they do it in any part of the South.  The stage has been reached to-day when one cannot hire a man with a horse and cart to haul milk to the creamery in any part of the country.  What is going to happen?  We have enjoyed the facility of having a man with a tractor hauling our milk, and it is a practice which is growing, and the imposition of this additional duty is going to be a very great hindrance to production.  I do not think it is justified from the point of view of the tax yield, nor do I think it justified from the point of view of the amount of competition that it will mean with the man with the lorry.</P>
      <P>I have no experience, I confess, of a lorry being used to-day to bring the milk from the farmstead to the creamery.  I know that lorries are used to take the cream from the separating station to the central, but I have no knowledge of the other system and I do not think it is going to be done.  It did start in one end of our county, but it was found to be too expensive and I think it had to be discontinued.  It is going to be too expensive, because the price of milk cannot carry the charge of a lorry transporting it to the creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the net position so far as dairy farming is concerned.  In addition, I think you are going to handicap the transport of milk and that many people in backward places especially will be discouraged from sending their milk to the creamery. They will go into another type of economy and possibly feed the milk to the calves.  If they do that you will have less butter.  You may have more beef production, but it will be at the expense of dairying as we know it.  I do not think that would be desirable. I believe the Minister could make the <Col N="397" /> law in this regard such that it would assist production.  I really think that ought to be the purpose of legislators everywhere.  In these days, especially, it ought to be our duty and responsibility to assist our agricultural producers, especially those who are not big enough and whose economy could not withstand the capital investment in transport suitable to the needs of to-day.  Those people ought to get assistance.</P>
    <P>A large dairy farmer, perhaps, in some of the southern counties could have his own van.  He could take in 60 or 70 gallons of milk in his own van.  It is economic for him, but the man with seven, eight, ten, 12 or 14 gallons of milk in my county is in an entirely different position.  Any Senator who does not appreciate what this means should picture himself living near a bog or some other backward place thinking of having his milk conveyed to the creamery and having to depart in these days from the practice that obtained up to the present day.  I believe you will see the result of this reflected in the creamery position in our county.</P>
    <P>There is the other aspect, too.  The Minister knows our county as well as I do and as well as anybody knows any county.  He knows of areas which are seven or eight miles away from the market town.  I cannot for the life of me understand why a farmer owning a tractor should not be allowed to bring three or four head of cattle to the fair for his neighbour for payment.  I think the Minister can so make the law as to permit of this being done.  I do not think other methods of transport will be influenced by it.  Not one of these farmers would employ a lorry to bring his cattle to the fair or to take them from the fair back to his own place.  It has no influence whatever on the amount of traffic that lorries will carry.  Having regard to the plight of the country and the fact that everybody is crying for production, we should not hamstring production at its source.  A neighbour of mine cannot bring a trailer of turf from the bog for me for hire.  This is a predominantly agricultural country in which so many of our people are still rural.  I cannot <Col N="398" /> understand how the law is to operate.</P>
    <P>I am not the owner of a tractor or a trailer myself.  I ensile my grass.  A man comes to my place to cut the grass and takes it in his trailer.  Will he be entitled to do that now?  I do not know.  I do not think he will because he does it for reward.  I do not know where this law will lead us.  I hope the Minister will harken to the appeal made to him.  I hope that our productivity will not be hampered and that every convenience the farmer enjoys to-day will be available to them tomorrow.</P>
    <P>We want to keep the people living in the remote and backward places but there is not much more to be done to discourage them to such a point that they will not stay there any longer. Every convenience that is taken from them is making it impossible for them to remain there.</P>
    <P>These are the facts.  The revenue will not suffer.  With regard to competition, the owner of a tractor with a speed of five or six miles per hour will not make any difference to the man with the lorry.  I assert positively that 95 per cent of what the tractor trailers would haul in the rural districts would never go on to the lorries at all.  If the cost of bringing milk to the creamery is 2d. per gallon out of the 1/4 per gallon which the farmers are paid for the milk, you can estimate what influence that will have on the farmer producing milk.</P>

      <P>I do not think Senator Baxter has correctly put the provisions as they are in the Bill at all.  To my mind, there is a very generous provision made for farmers with a tractor. There is no clause which prevents the farmer who occasionally uses his tractor on the road from hauling home his farm produce and that of his neighbour. We should bear that clearly in mind.</P>

      <P>The concession given to farmers both in this and the previous Bill was given, we must assume, for the purpose of encouraging the farmers to go into mechanisation and to use the tractor on the land for developing and increasing farm produce in general.  The proposal put before the House this evening by Senator Baxter will have the very reverse effect.</P>
      <P>If the Minister accepted the proposal of Senator Baxter&mdash;those people are now as in the past getting favourable consideration by having a vehicle at the modest sum of £8 per year&mdash;and allowed those people to go into competition with other persons who would be compelled to pay an increased licence duty of say £15, £20, £30 or even £35 as the case might be, depending on horse-power, we would take off the land the very implements which this and the previous Bill encouraged to put on the land.  We would be making hauliers out of those people whom we would like to keep on the land.  If we accept Senator Baxter's proposal then, we will be encouraging the people who use the tractors on the land to use them on the roads.  We will be making haulage contractors out of the farmers.  If we accepted Senator Baxter's proposal, instead of there being increased production there would be a substantial reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Baxter.  Anything we can do to help to increase agricultural production would be all to the good and any form of restrictive practices we impose on agriculture are all to the bad in regard to our major industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will go into the haulage contracting business with a tractor running at six miles an hour.  The cost of paying agricultural wages would not allow a man to engage in that form of activity remuneratively.  There are times when things like beet and other products of farms have to be transported <Col N="400" /> and public transport is not always available.  Surely in those circumstances they should not try to prevent a man using his own tractor or hiring it to his neighbours for conveying goods of that nature.  I think it is in the interests of increased production to allow farmers to do that service for their neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to concede that Senator Baxter made a good and sincere case for his recommendation, but I greatly fear that there are many sides of this question which he does not seem to have considered and the implications of which appear to have evaded him.  It is my experience, and I am very conversant with the subject, that there are many tractors in rural areas which do a substantial part of their work in haulage of goods on the roads.  The net result is that in the spring of the year it is sometimes very hard to get tractors for agricultural work, such as ploughing, harrowing, etc., because the owners find it more economic to use them for haulage purposes of one type or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator tell us what they are hauling in his district? Is it agricultural produce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  In one case in the area for which Senator Baxter speaks, tractors are being used for the haulage of milk to the creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that yesterday if you had been here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to concede that, and I was impressed by the case which Senator Baxter made, but there are other sides to it which the Senator does not appear to see.  Senator Baxter has asked me what these tractors are hauling on the roads.  In addition to milk they are hauling turf as well as cattle to the fairs.  Some of them are hauling sand and timber as well as material for the building of houses, and surely that comes under the heading of general haulage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point I want to draw to the attention of Senator Baxter is that the <Col N="401" /> fundamental purpose of this measure is to get, with as much equity as possible, from the people who use the roads, the money to make the roads, and that principle should be kept in mind during this discussion.  I am quite prepared to say that if tractors being used for a certain amount of agricultural work are also used in a large part for road work, then they should pay for the damage they are doing to the roads in that haulage work.  I am satisfied that many of these tractors when used on the roads are actually doing more damage than lorries.  I know of one case where a tractor is being used on a cul-de-sac, a private road, and the other people using that road regard this as excessive use of the roadway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it then that they are all saints and scholars in Cavan?  I am told that in many areas tractors are being used for this sort of haulage work and it is a fact that because of that it is at times quite hard to get tractors to do the type of work for which they were intended.  We must be careful in dealing with these matters not to set up vested interests in public transport by legislation.  Even if Senator Baxter's recommendation is not accepted, I can tell him that what is happening now will continue to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only to-day I listened to a debate by public men who argued quite sincerely that agricultural tractors should be allowed to do such work as hauling sand, stone and that sort of thing for local authorities.  Is it not quite obvious that if agricultural tractors are to be used for that sort of operation, then there are going to be fewer of them available for farm work and, if he can get them at all, the farmer will have to pay more for the <Col N="402" /> work he wants done.  I would regard it as a fatal development if agricultural tractors were to go over to haulage work to the point of being employed by the local authorities and in doing work for which they were not intended and for which they are not paying a proper tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Size for size there are fewer tractors in this country than in Northern Ireland and if in the same proportion we had a requisite number of tractors we would have something like 50,000.  If we had that number there would never be any shortage of tractors for agricultural work and there would be sufficient for the other types of work.  The effect of increased taxes would be that there would be fewer tractors used and that would damage agricultural production very considerably.  The aim should be to have as many tractors as possible in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much concerned with the stresses put on the motives for this recommendation, or what they are.  There were before the introduction of these proposals four different rates of tax for tractors. There was the 5/- rate which will be continued; there was the 5/- rate where the tractor was used on the farm only&mdash;that 5/- rate remains.  Then there were two rates in respect of two types of tractors used by farmers for their own purposes on the roads.  These two rates were £6 and £10.  The only change that these proposals make in regard to these two is that there is now only one rate of £8 for all tractors used by farmers on the roads for purposes for which they were always used by farmers.  Then there is the rate of tax that was imposed on lorries used for general haulage purposes. There was a special rate of £21 for such vehicles.</P>
      <P>There were, therefore, in the past, four rates&mdash;a rate of 5/- for a particular purpose, a rate of £6 in respect of an agricultural tractor used by a farmer up to a certain weight, a rate of £10 for another type of tractor used by a farmer for the same purpose, from, say, five tons upwards and the haulage rate of £21 or £22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I resent here is the attempt <Col N="403" /> to establish that I am introducing here some new principle.  I am not introducing any new principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

The only change I have effected is to convert the two rates of £6 and £10 into a rate of £8, and it gives to the farmer exactly the same rights as he enjoyed since tractors were introduced into the country.</P>
      <P>To contend here that a tractor owner was within the law in hauling milk to a creamery for reward is completely and absolutely to misrepresent the legal position that has existed all down the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any use in producing argument&mdash;or is it a waste of time&mdash;to those who while professing to have innocent motives, in the course of hearing facts stated, want to make it appear that something has happened that I know has not happened and is not happening?  I know that the law has been that if a tractor owner with a £6 or £10 licence is brought before a court of law and if it can be shown in that court that he has carried merchandise for reward, he is liable to a fine.  In fact, people who have engaged in that type of business have been brought before the courts in every county of the Twenty-Six Counties and at one time or another have been fined. Such an individual from my own county has made representations to me within the last six months when he found himself in that position.</P>
      <P>I made a case to Senator Johnston in support of the stand I took in regard to one of his recommendations that we should not create a position where there would be ambiguity, confusion and difficulty in the administration of the law.  In designing these proposals the sole concern of my Department and my own concern was to do the utmost to eliminate these ambiguities and these concessions that existed in the past and that made it administratively impossible from the point of view of those whose responsibility it was to enforce the law.</P>
      <P>I agree that the tractor owner who will pay in future a tax of £8 is entitled to use that tractor on the road, any place he wants to go in the haulage of his own goods.  In other words, he is entitled to use that tractor in every conceivable way that a man used the horse and cart in the past.  He is entitled to help me to take in my crop. He is entitled to help me to take in my turf.  He is entitled, on a fair morning, to take a litter of pigs for me.  He is entitled to do any or all of those things but he is not entitled to accept a reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No attempt on my part or on the part of any individual will produce a code of law that will ensure that there will not be abuse under that head. How would it be possible to obtain a conviction against the farmer who would take my produce for reward?  I <Col N="405" /> admit freely that, just as in the past it was not possible to obtain a conviction against hundreds of tractor owners who were before the courts of justice, in future thousands of tractor owners, possibly, may be brought before the courts and it will not be possible to obtain a conviction against them because the evidence will not be sufficiently conclusive.  The difficulties which have arisen in the past in relation to that matter are the difficulties that undoubtedly will arise in the future.  There is no human mind that can design a code of regulations that will change that position.</P>
    <P>When speaking on a previous recommendation, I made it quite clear that it was undesirable that this should be the case and I made it clear that it was desirable that we should have as little of this in our laws as possible. I did admit that no matter how we strove towards securing that end, there would still be that residue or remnant that could not be provided for; that has been the position in the past and will be the position in the future, but it is a different thing to saying, in effect, that the owner of every tractor paying an £8 licence will be entitled to carry all sorts of merchandise for award.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  My amendment can refer only to agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Again we know the difficulty which arises in relation to agricultural produce and the difficulty which has arisen in relation to the interpretation of phrases like that in the past.  The only reason I have for speaking at such length is that I want to make it clear that, whatever case there is to be made for the proposal in this connection, I would resist any effort being made to show that there is something new being introduced. There is nothing new being introduced here.  It is a matter of trying to make a little more clear and perfect a code about which there have been some doubts and some ambiguities and about which there will be, even after we have done our best, a lot of doubt and many ambiguities arising from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> Senator O'Donnell talked about the haulage of milk to creameries.  Even still, in spite of all the tractors that have come into the country, a great deal of the milk supplied to creameries is being drawn by horse and cart.  I agree that the horse and cart is rapidly moving out of the scene.  But is it contended that you could give to the man who has a horse and cart or two horses and two carts on the road drawing milk for hire to a creamery and who decides to sell his horses and dispose of the carts and harness for a tractor&mdash;that you could give to that man entering it as a business the right to haul milk on an £8 licence?  Why should he have it?  What case is there that he should?</P>
    <P>There are now 16,000 farmers who own tractors, and are they not enjoying very considerable concessions in being enabled to use their tractors for the wide range of purposes to which I have referred, on payment of a licence duty of £8?  Even if what Senator Johnston would regard as a desirable result&mdash;and the quicker it will come about the better for the country, namely, that we should have 50,000 tractors at least&mdash;would not Senator Johnston admit that, in the event of such development, you would have to make roads for those tractors?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hope that they would be kept on the land and not on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were employed on the land, they would be paying the 5/- duty and not the £8 rate.  That was not the Senator's case.  If we had that number of tractors and if it was good for us as a community to employ tractors in the replacement of horses, we must have regard to the future use of the roads and the destruction that this increasing number of tractors will have upon the roads and the necessity there will be for having these roads maintained to carry that particular type of vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Is the haulage of similar goods for another farmer not the introduction of a new and desirable principle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="407" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They are entitled to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they entitled before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They were.  There is no change in that regard.  In the Dáil I made it clear, and I know of the circumstances in rural Ireland a lot better than other people.  It is the practice and has been the practice for farmers to co-operate in the haulage of milk to the local creamery.  I often wondered why in the South of Ireland they had not the same record for that practice as we had in the northern counties.  I often thought there was a lot of time wasted in the way they did that haulage in the south, but that was their business and, even if it did not impress me, they had reasons of their own for pursuing that practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, when I explained in the Seanad that farmers co-operated in the use of tractors just as they had been co-operating in the use of horses, I did not mean to convey that every farmer had a tractor.  I have no tractor myself and I would have a fair share of work for it.  What I tried to convey to the House and the country was that a farmer who had a tractor could co-operate with neighbours even if his neighbours possessed horses, just as they co-operated when they all possessed horses.  I did my part in co-operating with other farmers <Col N="408" /> to bring milk to the creameries with horse and cart.  If one of our number who formerly co-operated with us purchased a tractor, he was permitted to do his turn of a day or week with the tractor just as previously.</P>
    <P>To suggest to me that there is some change being effected in these proposals and that I am providing in these proposals for a new form of taxation, is entirely misleading.  Appeals and requests have been made to me that I should remove the system of taxation which is there in relation to tractors and make it possible for all tractors with an £8 tax to be used for any and every purpose such as the haulage of sand, timber and coal&mdash;that all this could be held to be, in many sets of circumstances, agricultural work.</P>
    <P>As I say, one thing I resent and resist is the attempt made to cloud this issue.  I hope by what I have said, even if it does not convince those who naturally do not want to be convinced, that at least I have on the record a clear statement of the facts showing that what is proposed here is in fact something which has been in existence and been practised for many years with certain minor modifications.</P>

      <P>Yes.  If that man disposed of his horses and bought a tractor and trailer, collected the milk from the same supplier and brought it to the same creamery, he would be drawing for reward and in that case would pay the tax.  But if four of us are neighbours and we agree to take our milk to the creamery, if I take it one week, Senator Hearne the second week, Senator Hawkins the third week and Senator Loughman the fourth week, and if I had a tractor and the others had horses, the fact that I was only doing it once in four weeks would mean that I was occasionally using it and I would, therefore, be entitled to use it at the lower rate.</P>
      <P>I could have a tractor and trailer and could be engaged in the haulage of live stock for reward.  I could have that vehicle on the road every day attending local fairs.  That would be a case of using a tractor for the same purposes as those for which a lorry would to-day be used.  On the other hand, there might be a tractor owner who would take cattle to neighbouring fairs.  That would arise once, twice or three times a month and would be &ldquo;occasional use&rdquo;.  He, therefore, would be entitled to take advantage of the £8 tax for such work.  That would be my interpretation of it.  &ldquo;Occasional use&rdquo; would be use for attending local fairs or doing an exchange with neighbours in regard to the haulage of turf, manure, hay, corn, or any commodity or crop in the production of which farmers engage.  The other type would be the man who is known to be on the road every day, doing it as a commercial proposition.</P>

      <P>There is a very important distinction to be made between financial reward and reward which takes the form of the exchange of neighbourly services.  We should encourage that exchange of neighbourly services, while being somewhat against the development of the use of tractors for financial reward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is again necessary to ask the Oireachtas to extend for a further year, that is, until December, 1953, the powers conferred on the Government by the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  In order that Senators may understand the reason for retaining those powers I propose to explain briefly the main purposes for which the powers under the Act will be required in 1953, that is, after the 31st December this year when, but for this extension, the powers would expire.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance will require power under that Act chiefly for the following purposes: First, to control the foreign exchange transactions. Separate legislation for that purpose is in course of preparation but has not been presented to the Oireachtas. Second, to guarantee the borrowings of certain semi-State bodies.  A Bill has been introduced in the Dáil to deal with that matter, but it has not yet received its Second Reading there and will not be enacted before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government requires powers under the Act to maintain various regulations dealing with traffic matters for which there has not yet been permanent legislation although permanent legislation is contemplated. The Minister for Social Welfare will require these powers for sundry minor relief measures which originated during the emergency and which it has not yet been found expedient to discontinue and in relation to which, in fact, it has not yet been possible to reach a decision as to whether their maintenance permanently will be necessary or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture requires power for sundry regulations connected with the dairying industry, the meat industry, cereals, feeding stuffs and a number of other matters.  It is not yet practicable to relinquish these powers and it cannot yet be said with <Col N="414" /> certainly that permanent legislation should be enacted to cover them. The Minister for Industry and Commerce will require powers in connection with price control, the suspension of certain quotas and tariffs and for the control of exports.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is, I think, aware that the Control of Prices Act of 1937, which is the only permanent legislation on the statute books for price control, was found to be insufficiently flexible in present-day conditions.  That Act has, in fact, been lying dormant since the outbreak of the war, and in the interval powers of price control have been operated under this temporary legislation.  That situation must continue until such times as new permanent legislation is enacted.  I indicated last year that, in my view, the time had not yet arrived for permanent legislation&mdash;I thought differently in 1947, but the character of price fluctuations in the meantime caused me to change my view.  The more leisurely type of price control machinery which we might adopt in normal conditions should not, in my view, be brought into operation until there is a return to more stability in prices.  I think there is some reason for hoping that we may reach that stage next year, but in the meantime it is better to retain existing powers under the Supplies and Services Act. The existing permanent legislation for the control of quotas and the imposition of tariffs is also defective in some respect in regard to flexibility, and the question of suitably amending that legislation is not being overlooked.</P>
    <P>Regulations relating to the control of exports are now few in number, but it is clear that some of the emergency powers relating to exports must be retained for a further period. Alternative permanent legislation for the provision of such powers is necessary, and that problem is also under examination.  The original emergency powers are still used for dealing with a number of other minor matters.  During the course of the past year, quite a number of the powers under the Act were relinquished. So far as these were exercised by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the main powers relinquished related to food <Col N="415" /> rationing, building control and the rationing of petrol, and there were a number of other changes of lesser importance.</P>
    <P>It is evident that substantial progress has been made towards shedding these wartime controls, but the Act is still needed for the purposes I have mentioned.  I do not think that I can say when that need will entirely pass.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to agree to continuing the powers conferred by this Act for a further year until December 31st, 1953, but I do not think that I would be justified in giving an assurance that it will not be necessary to come again to the Seanad and ask for a further extension next year.  Even if the need for emergency controls had passed entirely by the end of 1953, there still would be the problem of alternative legislation for quite a number of minor powers that have to be retained.  Many of these relate to matters which, if there had been no emergency, would have had to be dealt with in the normal course by legislation, and they will have to be so dealt with when the time occurs. That will have to be done gradually so as not to overburden the legislative programme.  There is a substantial volume of legislation to be dealt with next year, and with the best will in the world we will not be in a position to have all the enactments which would be required, if this Supplies and Services Act was to be relinquished, enacted before the 31st December, 1953.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil it has been the practice for some years past to use the debate on this Bill as an occasion for conducting a general review of economic conditions, and there was no departure from that practice on this occasion. There was a discussion in the Dáil which ranged over a wide variety of topics, some of which were never the subject of Emergency Powers Orders, but the debate was, in the main, directed towards such serious problems as the rise in the cost of living, the burden of taxation and the level of unemployment.  I have no desire to lead a discussion in the Seanad on these lines, but, on the reasonable assumption that some echoes of the <Col N="416" /> Dáil debate may be heard here, I think it would be no harm if I mentioned a few facts so that Senators debating these subjects may be induced to keep them in mind.</P>
    <P>The cost of living, of course, has risen during the present year.  It rose in the past 18 months, since May, 1951, to August, 1952, by 13 points in the cost-of-living index number.  Of that increase of 13 points, seven were directly attributable to the withdrawal of food subsidies in the Budget and the other six to factors outside Government control.</P>
    <P>In the three months preceding May, 1951, that is between February, 1951, and May, 1951, there was also an increase of seven points in the cost-of-living index number.  So that over the whole period from the beginning of 1951 to date an increase of some 20 per cent. in the cost of the commodities taken into account in calculating that index was recorded.</P>
    <P>The power of the Government by the exercise of controls to regulate that rise was exceedingly limited.  The previous Government, although they had established by emergency Orders a special investigating body and had maintained the remnants of an earlier general Standstill on Prices Order, was unable to prevent a rise of seven points in three months early in 1951 and, although the rise tended to show down subsequently, until the withdrawal of subsidies had effect, it nevertheless continued steadily over the period.  I could not say that it has ceased.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are no factors now operating to force prices up except internal ones.  The movement in prices of imported goods has been downward for some time, not a very pronounced fall, but nevertheless a movement in the right direction.  On the other hand, higher wages and higher taxes at home are countering the effect of that movement in import prices and it would be, I think, wrong to suggest that the full effect of recent wage increases has yet appeared in retail prices.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that that rise in the cost of living caused hardship for those of our people whose incomes were not adjusted in accordance <Col N="417" /> with the rise.  It is true that many classes of workers have secured adjustments and, no doubt, others will in the early future.</P>
    <P>The justification for the withdrawal of subsidies and putting the prices of the foodstuffs formerly subsidised upon a realistic basis was that it was better that they should be on that basis and wages adjusted accordingly rather than that a completely artificial and untenable situation should be perpetuated.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, necessary to emphasise that the rise in the cost of living which took place over the past few years in this country took place in most other European countries.  In Great Britain, since the beginning of 1950, the rise in the cost of living as shown by their index number was precisely the same as here.  On the other hand, other statistics suggest that the rise in wages was less than in this country, that the British workers did not get compensation for that rise to the same extent as Irish workers.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the Dáil that because of the rise in the cost of foodstuffs there has been a falling off in consumption of them.  I was unable to give the Dáil precise information in that regard in concluding the debate, but since then I have got some statistics which I think the Seanad will find interesting.</P>
    <P>Instead of there being a fall in the consumption of the foodstuffs previously rationed and subsidised, since the subsidies were withdrawn there has been an all round increase. In the case of creamery butter, the quantity consumed in 1952 in the five months' period from July to November was 3 per cent. higher than in 1951, the exact amount being 9,431 cwt., and that increase was recorded in practically every months of the period except the first, so that the trend was definite. The fact that there was not an increase in the first month was, no doubt, attributable to some extent to forestalling of the rise in price which people were aware was about to take place.</P>
    <P>In the case of flour and bread, a similar increase is recorded.  For the whole period from the 5th July to 22nd November the consumption of flour of <Col N="418" /> all kinds, shop flour, bakers' flour and wheatenmeal, increased by 51,643 sacks. That sounds like a substantial quantity of flour, but it is a relatively small increase in consumption reckoned on a percentage basis.  The total issues during the periods in each year were as follows: 1,071,357 sacks for that period in 1951, and 1,123,000 for that period in 1952.  The increase took place in respect of all classes of flour, the consumption of shop flour over the period increasing by 12,308 sacks, of bakers' flour by 28,009 sacks, and of wheatenmeal by 11,326 sacks.</P>
    <P>There is another feature of the picture of flour consumption to which I think it is desirable to draw attention. Within that overall period, from the 5th July to the 22nd November, there was a further increase in bread prices and flour prices following upon the payment of increased wages to bakery and flour mill workers on the recommendation of the Labour Court. That increase became effective in mid-September. Between the 21st September and 22nd November there was also an increase in flour consumption, an increase of 23,595 sacks.  Again it is to be noted that that increase was distributed under all heads, the increase in shop flour consumption being 16,866 sacks, in bakers' flour 2,161 sacks, and in wheatenmeal 4,568 sacks.</P>
    <P>In the case of tea, it is not possible to give consumption figures comparable with those which I have given in the case of butter and flour.  What we can compare is the figure of sales of tea by Tea Importers Limited, that is, the central importing organisation for tea, since rationing was abolished and the figure for annual consumption of tea under rationing.</P>
    <P>The figures for sales since July last are, however, affected by two factors, firstly, the unknown extent to which wholesale merchants may have sold from stock and, secondly, the general uncertainty which has prevailed in the tea trade regarding prices.  Since July last, however, the sales of tea by Tea Importers have been at the annual rate of 23,600,000 lb. as compared with an annual rate of 22,000,000 lb. under rationing.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will be relieved to know that the anxieties expressed <Col N="419" /> in the Dáil lest the adjustment of the prices of these commodities had caused a fall in consumption were unfounded, and that there has been, consequent on the re-arrangement of prices and the withdrawal of rationing an all round increase in consumption.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to refer to the subject of taxation which was also debated in the Dáil.  That subject has been adequately debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas since the Budget, but there is no doubt that our rates of taxation are very high in relation to the present stage of development of the national economy.  However, when I put a question to the Dáil as to whether any Deputy would agree that the Government spending should be held to its present level, there was no one who would support such a proposal.</P>
    <P>The members of the Dáil expressed an anxiety, which the Government very strongly shares, about the position in regard to employment.  The numbers at present registered at the employment exchanges show an increase this year over last year.  While it is known that there are a number of factors which affect the figures at the employment exchanges registers, nevertheless they are high enough to make it clear that measures which have been adopted to improve the national economy and increase the employment opportunities afforded have not yet produced the desired or expected results.  I would like to say, in that regard, that the special circumstances which prevailed in a number of industries about this time last year and early in the present year and which resulted in the closing down of a number of concerns and the commencement of short-time working in others, have passed.</P>
    <P>So far as the manufacturing end is concerned, the slump which affected textile, clothing, leather, boots and shoes and most forms of wearing apparel has passed and practically all of these textiles mills, tanneries, clothing factories and boot factories are back to normal working.  In fact, so rapid was the recovery and so large the volume of orders coming into Irish mills, that they have experienced <Col N="420" /> temporary difficulty in filling them, notwithstanding overtime.  Representations have been made to me by a number of interests that the inability of Irish mills to give expeditious execution of orders should be met by permitting special imports under licences.</P>
    <P>More satisfactory from the point of view of any over-all objective examination of the position is that the increase on the live register does not represent any diminution in the number of people in employment.  So far as it is possible to calculate the numbers of people in industrial employment from the number of employment insurance stamps purchased, the average weekly employment in 1951 was 14,000 greater than in 1950.  While I cannot produce a corresponding figure in respect of 1952, the officials of the Department of Social Welfare inform me that they have carried out trial checks and are satisfied that the figure will show a slight increase in the present year.</P>
    <P>The outcome of any objective examination of the position to which I have referred would lead to the conclusion that while the economic situation here requires our most serious attention and justifies even exceptional measures to relieve it, it is by no means as bad as is sometimes represented.  We have many urgent problems and a few long-term problems still to solve.  We have also the strength to solve them if we use it in the right direction.  I would like to feel that in relation to any of these matters, that the members of the Oireachtas can obtain precise information, and while most of the information available to the Government in regard to them has appeared in various publications, if there is any further supplementary information Senators would desire and they indicate that desire in the course of the debate, I shall be glad to give it to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a convention about this particular Bill that it gives an opportunity for roaming at large over the economic and financial position of the country.  The Minister, while hoping that we would not imitate the Dáil, and I hope myself we will not, has ranged over a considerable field.  It seems to me that one of the things which emerges is that our <Col N="421" /> supply of politicians is not particularly good and that our prospects for a further supply of them are rather bad. I would like to deal with the Bill and that particular point at the same time.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in opening the debate in the other House, made an appeal to members of the House generally not to conceal economic realities from our people and said that he hoped there would be a different approach to this Bill.  One different approach, and not an unsound one, might be to make the Bill end on September 30th instead of October 31st.  It would give the Dáil something to do in October and it might be brought into the Seanad after a short debate in the Dáil, allowing us perhaps to debate it at length in the month of October when people would not be in a hurry.  That is one suggestion the Minister might consider in relation to his appeal for a different approach to the whole matter.</P>
      <P>In opposition, the Minister's approach was, of course, to prolong sittings of the other House so as to physically wear down the Ministers and those supporting them.  That extremely bad example is perhaps being followed, although not quite so thoroughly or ruthlessly as the Minister in his younger days was able to do it. One can understand that in his present position, with the burdens he has to bear, he finds a necessity for a different approach, but apart altogether from his personal difficulty, there is a real necessity for a change. That idea was met, I thought, rather adequately by the Leader of the Opposition in the other House, but the atmosphere and the tenseness and nervousness created by the debate induced the Tánaiste to interrupt and seem rather unwontedly bad-tempered and touchy.  Perhaps that is understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could address himself to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, with regard to letting our people understand the realities of our economic and financial position.  Quite recently, apart altogether from any of his recent speeches, the Minister for Finance has covered up our economic and financial position with a wealth&mdash; or perhaps I should say a waste&mdash;of <Col N="422" /> verbiage and abuse.  Recently, in Belturbet, he dealt with Marshall Aid in a manner which no one could regard as having any shred of sincerity or reality&mdash;and in a way with which the Tánaiste could not possibly agree.  He places the burden of all our economic troubles squarely on the shoulders of the last Government and blames them even for accepting Marshall Aid, just as someone in the Dáil explained that the last Government got dollars and put them into the sterling pool. Marshall Aid did not involve getting dollars, it involved getting dollar credits.  When the Minister for Finance was talking about Marshall Aid, he forgot that the <i>Irish Press</i> had a heading one time welcoming Marshall Aid and also had a leading article welcoming Marshall Aid and explaining what we would get under it.  The complete irresponsibility of misrepresenting that position to our people, of even inferentially explaining that the Americans were rapaciously making something out of it&mdash;instead of helping us very generously, as the present Taoiseach said at that period&mdash;is to give to our economic affairs a completely unreal aspect.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the Fianna Fail Party acquiesced in the acceptance of Marshall Aid, and the notion that you could have got the money from Irish taxpayers is, of course, quite foolish, because Irish taxpayers could not have given you dollar credits anyhow, no matter how much sterling they had at their disposal.  A realistic showing of our economic position will not be possible unless we can abandon once and for all the language of abuse, unless we can come down off the Party horse and walk calmly amongst the people.</P>
    <P>During the last war, from 1939 to 1945, we were able to get co-operation amongst the Parties for certain purposes. It must be remembered that during the war we were not actually attacked at all.  Now we are being attacked&mdash;attacked by depression, by recession in trade, by a higher bank rate, by rising unemployment, by emigration and by various financial problems, some of which are beyond our control, and some of which are <Col N="423" /> within our control, and which anyhow call for a much better solution than mutual name-calling or fisticuffs.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in a general way and very briefly one could state the problems which strike a person who, like the Tánaiste or myself, thought at one time that an Irish Parliament and an Irish Government could make great progress towards solving our problems.  We have made very little progress towards solving our depopulation problem.  We are one of the few white countries with a declining or merely static population. There are only three counties in the country where it is going up, and those counties are near Dublin, and the increase there may be accounted for by the increase in Dublin.  We have a decline in the rural population, as anyone knows who goes to the country, apart altogether from the figures, and we have the knowledge that the lonelier the countryside gets the more people are inclined to leave it.  We have&mdash;and this seems to be the most difficult of all our problems and we are not doing anything at all to solve it&mdash;the latest marriage age in Europe or the known world.  There is no country which furnishes statistics of the marriage rate which shows people marrying at a later age than our people marry.  One girl in every three in this country remains unmarried, and that, perhaps, has a great deal to do with the emigration of women, which is, of course, the greatest loss to us.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is identified with industrial development, but it is true that no matter how successful industrial development may be, no matter how much co-operation his Government or any other Government have given towards industrial development, the employment given in industry is not catching up with the emigration from our rural areas.  That is absolutely and undeniably true.  And yet we can devote ourselves to wondering who is to blame, instead of devoting ourselves to solving the problem.  We have external assets and under capitalisation at home but, most extraordinary of all, a great number of our strong young people are emigrating from jobs &mdash;not going to get jobs&mdash;they already have them&mdash;so that the urge for emigration <Col N="424" /> in our case is by no means wholly economic.  In the case of girls, it may be associated with the fact that the marriage-rate is so low.  Another matter, which may have nothing to do with economics but which strikes a number of us very forcibly, is that after 30 years we are perhaps more denationalised than we were under British rule.  The Irish language and all that goes with the Irish language is very far indeed from being in the position that enthusiastic people thought they could put it into 30 years ago. Free young Irishmen are yielding now to foreign influences and becoming less Irish and more international than at any period of English occupation.</P>
    <P>While all that is going on, we are waging a form of Party warfare.  Mind you, I am strongly in favour of Parties and I am strongly a Party man myself, but there are various methods of waging this particular struggle.  We are waging a kind of Party warfare which jangles the nerves, tires the body and tends to weaken the intelligence. We have a parliamentary machine which has more to do than it was ever contemplated it should bear, and not only is the machine itself, particularly the other House, overburdened but its operators are overburdened, too.  There is a great deal said about politicians and how Government and Parliament should be run in this country.</P>
    <P>Some of it is malicious.  Some of it is quite ignorant, but a good deal is well founded, and we have to blame ourselves for it.  Perhaps we should consider for a moment, if I may be allowed, the position of the Tánaiste himself at the present time.  I do not agree with him politically, but I do not want to kill him.  His position at the present moment is that, for reasons which we all deplore, the Tánaiste finds himself in the position of being the acting head of the Government, which means that he is also the head of the majority Party in the State.  He is also the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He is also the Leader of the Dáil.  He has obligations to leave Dublin to perform various duties&mdash;some of which are public duties&mdash;arising out of his office, and some of which are Party political duties, which also are <Col N="425" /> necessary, as we all know.  As well as that, he has to sit in the Dáil for a week, like this week, or recent weeks, and discuss all kinds of things, in an atmosphere which, physically, I find overheated, and which is tiresome and heated in other ways.  It seems to me that the qualities the Minister would need to have, to be a successful Minister, could be enumerated in this way&mdash; he would need the strength of a horse, the skin of a rhinoceros and the patience of Job; and if he had all these together he would still need the tongue of Demosthenes and the brains of Aristotle; and even with all those, he would not bring a single member of the Opposition into the same Lobby with him.  Is not that true?  No matter whether he stayed late or early, or whether he belonged to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael it would not make any difference; it applies to them all&mdash;and the way things are going now he would need to have a private income as well. Surely there is something that should be done about that.</P>
    <P>It has been proposed as a remedy for that that there should be unity between the Parties.  That kind of suggestion is quite foolish. It is really a suggestion that people who, like the Minister and myself, were united at one time in the Sinn Féin movement should unite again to keep everybody else out of Government and Parliament&mdash;an extremely bad scheme, because surely the whole purpose of the Sinn Féin movement was to make Parliament and Government available for all kinds of Irishmen, to make, in the words of an Irish patriot: &ldquo;Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter rejoice in the common name of Irishman,&rdquo; and to give various kinds of people an opportunity to work in an Irish Parliament.  Unless we can find some better method of working it out than we at present have, we are going to exhaust and kill off the politicians we have and we are not offering any attractions to younger people to come into it.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Parliament here is a more orderly Parliament than most, but it is also true that our differences here are very much less, in spite of all the talk, the occasional arguments <Col N="426" /> and even the fisticuffs, than they are in England or France or Belgium, to speak of a few places I happen to know, and much less grievous and less vital than they are as between Parties in any of the small countries of Northern Europe which have a strong Communist Party which takes a line quite different from that which any Party takes here.  While we need not have unity and cannot have unity, we should at least be able to talk to one another. We should be able to have calm and courtesy, and, from the point of view of legislation, I think that one of the things we might have is an arrangement in the other House to talk to each other and have a scheme, through the Whips or by some other method, whereby they would have a programme and an arrangement, and not meet indefinitely, night after night and week after week, with nobody knowing when there was going to be a division and nobody knowing when he would be free for anything, fraying everybody's nerves and sending to the Seanad everything just before Christmas and giving us three hours to discuss this Bill when we might have three days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a Bill which I have not got time to talk about.  I have not time to discuss it in its real implications and I suggest that we might have a better debate, if we got this Bill in a different way and at a different time.  I suggest that the things we have in too great supply are Bills and legislation.  The Minister agreed with me on that before, and one of the things which the Parties might do between them is to agree to a stand-still order on legislation.  It would save money, save time, save talk, save light here and in the Dáil, and I do not think that anybody would be any the worse.  I have been nearly 30 years in this Parliament in various capacities and I have heard Ministers of various Parties bringing in urgent Bills.  I never knew a Minister whose Bill was not urgent, and I never knew a head of a Department who did not feel that Ireland would collapse, that <Col N="427" /> the sky would fall, if a Bill which he had taken six years to prepare could not be passed in six hours in the Dáil. That is quite a common thing.  Bills are hardly ever urgent, though this one is because it must be passed before the 31st December, but it is a <i>rara avis.</i> That is one thing that could be done which would relieve everybody&mdash;have a truce on legislation for 12 months.  Pass the necessary legislation&mdash;the Appropriation Bill, the Finance Bill and so on&mdash;and have nothing else and let people then start on a better scheme for legislation.</P>
      <P>That would be a very great improvement. I think there could be a new approach, as the Minister suggested, but it would need a new approach on the Minister's part and it would be necessary for the Minister and a great many other people to forget their previous conduct.  The Minister suggested in the Dáil to-day that they should forget the past aviation project and deal with the present.  That is what I am suggesting, that we should forget the past and deal with the present, with the present immense difficulties and the present system which has had one very grievous effect, that it seems to have disgusted a great many people with politics and prevented us from getting a supply of people who will eventually have to govern the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the ways would be to have a new approach in the Dáil which would make it less the endurance test that it is at present and more a combination of brains and intelligence in the service of the country.  If we did that, we would be able to ensure that good ministerial timber could function properly.  The Minister&mdash;I make him a present of this&mdash;certainly is good ministerial timber, and what he is asked to do at present he is asked to do, largely through his own fault, in a way which prevents him from being as competent as he might be.  If we had a better system, Ministers would be less harried, more helpful, and more competent, and more people would be attracted to politics, and, following the Minister's own idea, we could realise better the facts of our economic position <Col N="428" /> which should be explained to the people, instead of having a cloud of vituperation, accusation and counter-accusation cast over them.</P>
    <P>I should like, therefore, to agree entirely that we need a new approach to this kind of Bill and to our economic problems and I am confident that we could get that approach, if people who know a great deal about it were to sit down and think it out.  The first step in that direction would be to sit down and think out a programme and timetable for Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to observe the lead which Senator Hayes has given to the House.  I think that the majority of us will agree that the time has come when we should sit back and see in what way our Parliament has justified itself in its conduct over the past 30 years.  Many will agree that we have been found lacking in many ways.  It seems to me that the main purpose of such a Bill as this is to provide an answer to the fundamental question: What are we doing to improve the economic life of our people and what progress has been made or can be made in our economic life? Have we created a state of society in which the producer can satisfy the consumer and in which nothing will debar the consumer, even a fiscal policy, from what is his by right?</P>
      <P>Looking back over the years, the one thing which we have accepted all the time is&mdash;it is fundamental; something from which most people shy away; and something in respect of which those of us who refer to it are likely to be called crackpots, but something which is at the foundation of our society&mdash;control of our financial system.  I do not propose to talk at any length on that subject, but it is quite evident to all of us that all our Governments have eventually been defeated by the financial system because they failed themselves to take control of it.  The time has come when we must eventually face up to the fact that, whether we approve or disapprove of the present method of financial control, we must at least sit down and examine it in a cold and detached manner to see if its impact on our society is for the betterment of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> It is something which is above Party politics, something which is fundamental to ourselves, but we may eventually find&mdash;I say this in view of the plea for toleration made by Senator Hayes&mdash;that the crackpot of to-day may be the genius of to-morrow.  It has been a common attribute of all Ministers for Finance that they derided any people who argued for the examination of this fundamental aspect of our lives.  A sort of sneer has been thrown at anybody who suggests that the financial basis of our economy is wrong.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate the plea made by Senator Hayes that there might be more co-operation between all Parties both in this House and in public.  I have always stressed that there should be no Parties in this House.  I think the greatest damage that was ever done to these premises was the construction of the central gangway.  This Seanad is founded on a vocational basis and I am here on a vocational basis.  I hope the members of the House will treat me in that fashion.  I know that it will again be brought back to me that I am not realistic as if realism were a justification for the continuance of a House based on a political basis when it is based primarily on a vocational basis.</P>
    <P>Some days ago I heard the Tánaiste plead very eloquently for a management institution.  He pointed out that with the growing industrialisation of the country many industrialists were lacking in ideas that would be good for our country, and that a management institution should be set up.  I entirely agree, but I suggest that as well as setting up such an institution for these poor, misguided and ignorant manufacturers, a similar institution might be set up for Governments.</P>
    <P>We hear repeatedly accusations from one side or other of the House, whichever Government is in power at that particular time, that the Government is not doing its business right.  What we will be eventually faced with is to ascertain whether these Governments over the past 30 years have justified themselves or not.  As one who remembers that period, I know that no matter what Party was in power the <Col N="430" /> country improved beyond all measure. One has only to get down among the people to see the great improvement in our economic life.  I should like again to pay my tribute to the Tánaiste for the great part he has played in reviving the industrial life of this country.  To him more than to anybody else we owe in a personal way our thanks for his efforts to solve that portion of our economic problem.  I hope he will be as successful now as he was in the past.  I may differ from him on many points, but with his general policy and his objective approach I entirely agree.</P>
    <P>I hope that Senator Hayes' plea will be listened to by Senators on all sides. There is a feeling outside that this Oireachtas has become a mere plaything of politics, that it does not matter what anybody says, he just does not believe in it any longer and says it just because he belongs to a Party on one or other side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir, but I thought we were discussing this matter in the manner in which it was discussed in the Lower House, where there was a sort of general survey. I should like to say that I do not see how this country can continue successfully to develop its economic life so long as we allow Dublin to grow into an incubus which is becoming more and more so as time passes on.  We have here an extraordinary anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a city ever growing while the hinterland is being denuded.  As stated here to-day, we find, despite the interest of the Tánaiste, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and despite decentralisation, the young people leaving the countryside.  If, as a result of his industrial policy, he can do anything to stop the extension of the city and develop the countryside, which is mainly composed of producers, it seems to me that we will not then have a city of non-producers, as it were, sucking the lifeblood of our hinterland.  We are here discussing <Col N="431" /> the general economic life of the country, and it seems to me that what I now speak of comes under the head of supplies and services.  It is because the growth of the City of Dublin is part of that economic life that I am pointing out the danger of its continuing. I do not know in what way a legislator can legislate to stop that.</P>
    <P>We have a population of roughly 750,000 who are mainly non-producers and who are living entirely upon producers of the countryside.  The land and producers constitute the main body of our wealth.  Industrialists and others are only ancillary.  If we allow one-third of our population to come along and swell up this marvellous city of ours, we are creating a great economic evil.  It is a matter to which all Parties in this House should address themselves these days.</P>
    <P>I thought I could have referred to the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I thought it was one of those services for which the Minister was responsible.  Senator Hayes pointed out that industrial employment is not catching up on emigration.  I hope he did not mean to infer by that statement that it was the fault of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his predecessor. There are many reasons why industrialisation has not benefited the countryside as much as it should have done.  I am not too sure that industrialisation is not making rapid progress towards destroying the evil of emigration.  There has been continued decentralisation of industry and under the Act I mentioned a few moments ago&mdash;the Undeveloped Areas Act&mdash;if the Minister has not succeeded in turning back the tide of emigration, he has made a great effort to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not want to score points.  The Minister has referred to the rising cost of living.  He explained why the cost of living went up.  The cost of living has gone up and has gone up in other countries similarly.  As a result of that increase in the cost of living, people are finding it more and more difficult to live in their different strata of life. The position to-day in regard to industrial development is that there is a terrific lack of capital.  Bank policy <Col N="432" /> is stringent and everybody is living on what they owe everybody else.  Until we solve the fundamental issue of the control of credit and currency, I do not think that all these Bills, all these efforts we are making, will be of any avail until the &ldquo;crack-pots&rdquo; justify themselves ultimately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the previous speaker's line of argument.  It seems to me that the immediate issue before the House is whether or not we are justified in continuing certain administrative powers which enable the Government to operate the various matters referred to by the Minister and which I need not repeat and to that extent influence the economic position.</P>
      <P>I do not honestly believe that a long debate on all the aspects of the situation which would be strictly in order would achieve very much.  As far as I am concerned, I do not propose to take more than a very short time.  The idea put forward by Senator O'Donnell, that by some peculiar and mysterious way we could get rid of some regulation on currency which is crippling us, is quite a common idea at the moment but it reminds me of my young days when almost all my friends believed that if we could get rid of Britain we would have some kind of millennium, and they told me later that if we could get rid of Cosgrave everything would be all right and then if we could get rid of de Valera everything would be all right and eventually that if we could get rid of the inter-Party Government everything would be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to suggest is that we do not want to abolish Parties.  We want a measure of accord by which whatever particular Minister is in power and has to administer any Bill such as this particular Bill, it should be possible to have in relation to the Government a degree of co-operation which is not being granted at this particular time and which has not been granted for a number of years.  I say that because as far as my experience goes I think that the present Minister has generally shown a spirit of willingness to co-operate and has listened to any point of view put to him with regard <Col N="433" /> to his Department.  I would never hesitate for a moment to put to him a point of view and I would be very surprised if he would not listen to me and consider that matter.</P>
    <P>The main control powers have been set out by the Minister and my principal criticism of the Minister is that he gave us no indication of how far he intended to use these powers or how far it might be possible to use them to meet what I believe to be the serious situation existing at the moment.</P>
    <P>The fact is that there has been a very serious slump so far as business generally is concerned and many people are finding it extremely difficult to maintain their business and they see the prospect that there are almost certain to be substantially reduced profits in a large number of businesses and that of itself is liable to cause increased unemployment.  I cannot help feeling that it should not be impossible so to adjust or operate controls that there would at least be an encouragement to increased business or at least something that would turn the present trend.  The Minister has stated that he was convinced that there was an improvement as far as many classes of business were concerned and that he thought that the slump was ended.  I hope he is right, but I find some difficulty in being quite so optimistic because most of the manufacturers are dependent on the public buying, and if buying does not improve&mdash;and there is an unwillingness to buy just now&mdash;the position will become somewhat difficult.</P>
    <P>The main difference between myself and the Minister in regard to Bills of this nature is that he and the Government believe in price controls being continued even where there is keen competition in business and a plenitude of goods.  I think that in such circumstances effective price control machinery should cease to operate. It would be reimposed if the position altered, but if it is continued in a situation of keen competition and a plenitude of goods then there is the danger that it may defeat its purpose.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister spent a considerable time explaining what had <Col N="434" /> been done in regard to the prices of bread and flour.  I am not going to discuss that question because I do not know so much about it, but I was nevertheless interested in his explanations, and I am inclined to agree with the view he took.  What I do want to put to him, however, is that if one important and large industry is immediately investigated when there is an increase of wages and an adjustment of prices is made, I think the same machinery should operate in regard to other businesses and industries when there is price control or marginal price control.  There should be in any price control of this kind some system allowing for a reduced trade, or some method by which the price control would be adjusted in the other direction. Where you have marginal price control it is obvious, where you have a large turn-over, that you cannot have a similar margin when there is a substantial decrease in business.  I think that that is something which requires investigation.</P>
    <P>I am not sure there is much difference of opinion between myself and the Minister with regard to competition&mdash; where there is acute competition and a very definite trade stock.  The Minister has stated that he hopes to introduce new legislation with regard to price control when there is relative stability in prices.  How he is going to know that and when that time comes, I do not know.  I would like to know, and I am sure there are many others like me.  I am afraid that if we wait until we get relative stability of prices we will not do anything further.  I do not honestly believe that we are going to get any period of time at which we can say that we have a position of relative price stability unless there is a more stable international position.  I believe that while the present position is there we will always be liable to have changes in prices.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, unless you could know that we are not going to have another programme of substantial increases in taxation or another round of wage demands, you cannot say that you have a position of prices stability. There is no evidence at the moment of any relative stability in prices.  Having said that I nevertheless can venture to <Col N="435" /> say that prices are as near stability around the present time as they have been for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement when introducing this Bill which rather intrigued me and I would like to know more about it.  He said that he had made a suggestion that there might be a period of time in which our taxation might remain on the present level and nobody was prepared to agree with him.  I certainly would be prepared to agree with him and I think there are many others also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that Government expenditure might remain at its present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister said that taxation would remain at its present level.  That may be it.  I was not thinking of that.  I was not trying to make a point.  When I refer to Government spending remaining at its present level, I mean exactly the same as what I mean with regard to my own spending.  That is, if I am going to take a bus home, I will have to do without something else.  I do not mean that you simply stop spending money of any kind.</P>
      <P>If there could be an agreement for a year or so that there would be no increased level of spending, in other words, if something was necessary, it would have to be done, but something else would have to be done without, it would do this country an amazing amount of good.  If there should be nobody in the Dáil, as the Minister suggests, prepared to agree, there is a very large number of people in the country who would be extremely willing to agree, even though it meant that some pet legislation of their own would not be passed or that certain things that they were hoping to have done would not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very strong feeling abroad, which I share&mdash;that is why I am rather glad that Senator Hayes took the line he did take&mdash;that the present position of a Party system as it is operating here is operating simply to cause expenditure above the capacity of this country with, therefore, taxation above what we can meet.  If that be true&mdash;<Col N="436" /> and I think it is very near the truth&mdash; surely it is time that some of us put our heads together to see if we cannot stop it.</P>
    <P>This, I think, is closely allied to this Bill.  It is part and parcel of what has been debated and also of what I think ought to be debated on this Bill. If you had not, perhaps, a standstill Order, but an agreement that for 12 months or two years the present level of expenditure should remain, you would almost inevitably have a minimum of legislation and it would be largely through co-operating together in the operation of administrative action that Government would function. I would like very much to see it.  I wish I could be hopeful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill originated in a period of emergency scarcity and is still continued some six years after the period of emergency came to an end.  The best remedy for scarcity is more production.  Therefore, I think it is highly relevant to address oneself to the facts of production in our economic life and to suggest increases of it so far as they may be feasible in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>I may say that, compared with what he was some 20 or 30 years ago, I regard the Minister, from the economic point of view, as a regenerate sinner and, in fact, almost an economic saint. In particular, I welcome his recent recognition of the importance of the agricultural basis of industrial development and his appreciation of the important part that our agricultural effort must play in future development of the industrial pyramid.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, he reminds me of a story about a Chicago pork butcher who said to a neighbour: &ldquo;In this city we have not yet taken up culture, but when we do we will make it hum.&rdquo;  I would like that the Minister would take an interest in agriculture and I have no doubt that, under his protecting care, it will hum most musically and that in fact it will become the dominant note in our national economic orchestra with him as conductor&mdash;agriculture playing first fiddle, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only one or two points that <Col N="437" /> I should like to emphasise in the course of my subsequent remarks. First, I want to ask the question, what is it that inhibits the increase of agricultural output for, as everyone knows, as compared with 14 years ago the physical volume of agricultural output is practically the same, whereas the physical volume of industrial output has increased by some 60 or 70 per cent.  I want to emphasise the tremendous economic importance of an increase in agricultural output.  I mean especially the physical volume of it, ignoring for the moment the prices at which those things are valued.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best way in which I could bring home the significance of such an increase is by a certain comparison which I hope will not be regarded as invidious, because it will involve a comparison with our neighbours in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As compared with 1922, according to their official statistics, the physical volume of agricultural output in Northern Ireland in recent years had increased by some 30 per cent.  In our case we are still practically on the same basis as we were 20 or 30 years ago and I am not going to enter into the question of who is to blame for that.  I do not want to rattle any of the old bones of former controversies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to keep strictly in order, Sir.  What I do want to suggest is that if we could in some way have increased physical output of agriculture by 30 per cent., in the course of the last ten or 12 years, that would have meant that our agricultural income would be, in terms of present prices, some £50,000,000 more than it actually is.  Further, in view of the fact that there seems to be a steady relationship of some 30 per cent. between the agricultural income and the national income, it seems highly probable that if we could have increased the agricultural income by £50,000,000 in terms of present prices, as compared with ten years ago, the total national income would have increased by £150,000,000 in that period.  In other words, we would be <Col N="438" /> as well off as a nation from that increase of agricultural output as we would be to-morrow if, through some miracle, we could have all existing public services and every 1d. of taxation abolished forthwith&mdash;because the amount of taxation is of the order of £100,000,000 and the increase in the national income would be more than that if we could have brought about that 30 per cent. increase of agricultural output.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to make is that an increase of the physical output of agriculture seems to have a kind of multiplier effect in our economy.  Every £ that the farmer makes by way of additional income resulting from additional physical output seems to cause the production of at least another £2 worth of real goods by other elements in the economy.  I am not going to start to analyse why that should be but it is arguable that when our whole economy is well founded on the grass roots of agricultural enterprise, every increase in the physical output of agriculture will be reflected in a threefold increase in the total output of economic wealth in the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>We have had in the last ten or 12 years a very desirable increase in the physical output of industrial products of the value, in current prices, of some £65,000,000 and that is all to the good. Somehow or other an increase of industrial output, following on the policies that have hitherto been pursued, does not seem to have that same multiplier effect on the rest of the economy that an increase of agricultural output would have had and that is, to my mind, a reason why, even from the point of view of sound industrial development, it is desirable to concentrate first of all on the development of agricultural output, and why I welcome the Minister's recent obvious interest in the possibilities of an increase of agricultural output, and in the possibilities of developing industry on the basis of the agricultural raw materials that are the result of such increase of output, many of which were hitherto sold unprocessed to other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moral of it seems to be to increase the physical output of agriculture and automatically non-agricultural <Col N="439" /> output would be increased in greater measure.  To bring about such an increase, the first thing we want is more knowledge and we seem to want a kind of economic survey of agricultural conditions as a whole, both national and local in its scope, almost going down to the details of the individual efforts of typical farmers in every part of the country.  That might be a big order, if done precisely, a kind of William the Conqueror Doomsday Book, in fact.  If you want to get the immediate results, you must know the achievements of highly-organised farmers and consider how far it is possible to strengthen them, because all these local and highly-efficient farmers in doing what they are doing, can improve the output of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more characteristic of the whole agricultural scene than the fact that there are here and there local oases of highly-efficient agricultural production, sometimes occurring in a cluster of farmers and reflecting not only the activities of a single highly efficient farmer, but also the contrast there is between these local oases of highly-efficient production and the desert of rack-weeds and grass which represents the inactivity of their farming neighbours.  If by some method you could increase the scope of the activities of these highly-efficient farmers, whose numbers may be 10,000 or 20,000&mdash;but they are a minority&mdash;if you could increase the scope of their personal activities and facilitate them in acquiring more land where they have less land than they can make efficient use of, you would take definite steps towards increasing agricultural efficiency in the country as a whole and, consequently, agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware of cases where there is a local highly efficient farmer farming, perhaps, 20 or 50 acres who could quite well produce better results if his farm was 200 or 300 acres in size. That man may be surrounded by other owners of land who live in a city or town who are commercialists rather than farmers and who let their land on the 11-months system.  I have actual cases which I could give to the Minister privately where a farmer could buy land at a reasonable price <Col N="440" /> but the owner refuse to sell.  He would rather leave it derelict than sell it, and the nation suffers in consequence.</P>
    <P>We should, first of all, acquire a knowledge of where our individual efficient farmers are, what they are doing and to what extent they are handicapped by not having enough land to till.  We might also pass a law to enable these farmers to acquire by compulsion the land of their lazy, neglectful neighbours.  That is the sum of my contribution to this subject and I hope that I have not transgressed the rules of order, as I usually do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>One might suggest that the policy being pursued in this House is a welcome change for the Tánaiste. It must be very restful and slightly refreshing for him to come into the atmosphere of the Seanad and be received by the leader of the Opposition in the spirit in which he addressed himself to the Minister's appeal.  I do not know if the Tánaiste would always like to have it like that but he might feel we were beginning to get rusty if he did not have an opportunity of seeing whether his agility is as it was of old.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste, in the course of his remarks, told us that the economic situation here was difficult and required attention.  I would say that, generally, I assent to the point of view expressed by Senator Hayes.  I feel there is a real problem confronting the country in regard to the future of its political life.  This requires study and examination, for we can very easily leave a desert behind, and it is a problem for all of us.  I am going to concern myself immediately with one or two points mainly in support of the remarks of Senator Johnston.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that everybody agrees that the Tánaiste, in the sphere of his activity, works hard with a considerable degree of success, but there are people who have expressed the view that the degree of success achieved by the Tánaiste in his policy of industrialisation has actually handicapped the development of a stronger economy in the other arm of the nation's life. I wonder has the Minister thought much about that.  I suggest he would <Col N="441" /> and I suggest to him that the strength of our industrial arm in future is going to be determined by the vigour of the agricultural industry on which it rests. If you start from zero, it is very easy to show how you have increased and multiplied and to indicate the numbers of people and the increases in percentages of the numbers employed in various industries that did not exist in the past.</P>
    <P>We have evidence, of course, of the very considerable capital investment in industrial undertakings to-day as against 1930, but the amount invested in industrial undertakings at that period was rather small.  It is regrettable, too, that during all that period, when there was undoubtedly an improvement in the conditions in regard to industrial establishment, so little progress was made in agriculture.  It does not matter who is in power, but the truth is that agriculture is not making progress in this country. Speaking as a farmer and speaking of conditions as I see them from one end of the country to the other, the total volume of our physical production is no higher than it was 50 years ago.  It is true we have fewer people on the land and it may be that we could study this aspect.</P>
    <P>We probably have as much power on the land now as we had 50 years ago when the population was much greater, but even so, there is a terribly depressing situation for us and for those of us especially who are concerned about the future of agriculture, and I think it is a special problem for the Tánaiste as Minister for Industry and Commerce. Our industries cannot increase and multiply unless there is a greater volume of production in agriculture than there is to-day.  Because industry was on the march and the cost of industry had to be borne by the people at home, I felt that the extra burdens on agriculturists were a handicap in regard to agricultural productivity. That must be stated in relation to the present agricultural situation.</P>
    <P>It is true that during all the years of the Tánaiste's office as Minister for Industry and Commerce there was no counter-balancing force on the other side in regard to agriculture.  If there <Col N="442" /> were someone else there, working with the same drive, the same vigour and imagination that the Tánaiste displayed in his Department, I believe the situation would be immensely different and the country's economy much stronger than it is to-day.  I get no comfort out of the thought that agricultural incomes may be higher at present than last years ago, when that increase in income has not accured from an increase in the volume of output on the land.  There is no stability in that position for us.</P>
    <P>I think the future of agriculture is brighter than it was ten or 15 years ago.  As one can see the world situation to-day with regard to the output of food, I believe the future of agriculture is bright; but if we should experience a reverse in regard to agricultural prices the whole economy of this country can experience a very severe rebuff and our industrial development is bound to be retarded.</P>
    <P>I do not know what position industrialists would find themselves in, who are dependent on the exchange which agricultural exports can provide for the purchase of the raw materials which must be found abroad.  Agricultural productivity has not increased in 50 years, and that is true, if anyone measures the volume of it.  We might talk about an increase in income. There is nothing stable about that.  We may get reversals in regard to cattle prices.  We know that the sugar supplies of the world are higher at present than for a long time.  It is one crop of which there is an over supply. The wheat crop last year in America was vast in its yields and American and Canadian wheat growers are perturbed about the possibility of their being able to market the wheat crop which they harvested last year.  We know that the people who were a party to the wheat agreement were hesitant about going into another wheat agreement.</P>
    <P>We know, with regard to cattle stocks in the world, that the position is not anything like so happy, but it is a fact that meat is becoming quite a luxury, in fact almost as much a luxury as the turkey.  In a world where incomes are being shortened by the <Col N="443" /> claims and demands of rearmament, it is just not clear whether the present high prices of meat can be retained. That is a consideration for us and especially for the Tánaiste as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It requires very careful study and something radical must be done about it very soon.</P>
    <P>I see no efforts, I confess, in the agricultural policy pursued by the Minister in charge, that there is any hope of increased yields from our fields.  I suggest that what this country needs at the moment in agriculture is to be able to cut costs of production and raise the output.  I see no sign of either one or the other being accomplished. The instruments of production are not available to the farmer in a variety of ways.  If you look at our fields, anybody with an eye to see what the face of the land reveals with regard to its condition of health can see clearly what is wrong.  I travel from the City of Dublin to my home town and there are not half a dozen fields that I will pass on the way home to-morrow morning where you can see visible evidence of an abundance of potash, phosphates and nitrogen.</P>
    <P>Go to Cork or go from Dublin to Connaught and it is the same story. Anyone who knows anything about the results of the application of fertiliser to land will see it.  Go across the Border and you find the story is entirely different.  I am not going to hold the House on this, but I am convinced we have not yet attempted to face the problems involved in trying to increase our agricultural productivity.</P>
    <P>What Senator Johnston says is true: we need knowledge, education first and then we need instruments.  I see organisations like Macra na Feirme; I see those young men interested in trying to do better farming, trying to build up an organisation; and I wonder just what is going to come out of it.  Let any group of intelligent, progressive men get together to talk about what they are going to do in their districts; when they get together to plan, what is available to them?  In the first place, they want knowledge and they want information.  It is terribly difficult to <Col N="444" /> get that.  We have no educational plan at all with regard to agriculture that bears any comparison with what is being done in other countries, with the progress on the Continent amongst the small peoples, the Danes, the Dutch, the Swedes and the rest.  France and even Britain are much superior to ourselves in this respect.  The people in those countries are all getting the additional equipment which is not available to our people.  Our farmers do not really know, but it is not their fault and they ought to be given a better opportunity than is available to them just now.</P>
    <P>In regard to the machinery, we can get nowhere until we can make very considerable sums available by way of capital investment for agriculture.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce knows that a very recent report of the Industrial Credit Company revealed the fact that £14,000,000 was made available for industry since they started.  More power to them.  Did the Minister bother to look at the amount made available and utilised by the sister company, the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  They put out about £4,000,000.  Just look at the situation&mdash;11,000,000 arable acres and they have utilised £4,000,000 to get the machinery going there.  It cannot be done by efforts of that kind.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Tánaiste, for the sake of the country's economy as a whole&mdash; no one is going to say that he is not interested in the whole lot of it; that would be to label him with a level of intelligence much lower than his most bitter critics would label him with&mdash; that something must be done if the nation is to get a chance to develop and that unless something is done about agriculture quickly we will face a crisis.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the dead-meat trade at the moment&mdash;Senator Johnston referred to it&mdash;but has anyone bothered to study where the raw materials of this industry are going to come from after a bit? Figures were produced recently, where the number of cattle under one year in the last statistics was almost 60,000 fewer than it was the year before. Next year there will be 60,000 fewer two-year-olds and the next year 60,000 <Col N="445" /> fewer three-year-olds, representing on present prices £400,000 or, possibly, £500,000.  That is not the worst of it. Our cows and in-calf heifers were down by 25,000 last year compared with the year before and they were 25,000 fewer then than in the previous year, making 50,000 fewer of the breeding stock than we had two years ago. Where is the value of the immense capital to build up the dead-meat organisation, the utilisation of all the offals, the handling of the hides and the rest of it, if the whole business is going to dry up at its source?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Tánaiste that these are very serious problems facing this country, which from the agricultural point of view are not being tackled. Somebody somehow has to educate the farmer and convince him that there are possibilities of an immense increase in his output.  You must go to him and persuade him that that is so.  It is no use standing on the farmer's ditch until you are invited to go in and tell him.  You will have to cross the ditch and engage him in conversation about it.  If he is agreeable to do it, you will have to provide the instruments of production and, even then, he will be doubtful and hesitant, and I do not think there is any use at all in going to the agriculturist to-day to persuade him that he can build up a profitable agricultural industry at the rate of interest at which he has to borrow money.  For the life of me, above everything else done here, I cannot understand how the Minister for Industry and Commerce stands for that policy.</P>
    <P>I urge that these problems are hot and burning, and nobody who is interested in the future of the country, in the future of its people, the people who are going and the people who will go, if a change does not come about, can give any thought to this Bill without feeling an obligation on him to make some reference to the problems which these difficulties present us with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have really nothing to say that has not been said before in this debate.  My reason for rising at all is to repeat, or re-emphasise, in the presence of the <Col N="446" /> Minister, some of the things already said.  The Minister, in his short review of the economic situation, ended on a somewhat confident and optimistic note.  In doing so, I think he was right, because I think that the people who are over-pessimistic are probably doing harm to the spirits of people in the country and even to the credit of the country.  Over-pessimism at a time like this may do harm.  At the same time, I think the Minister will agree that, in the long period, there is every reason, if not for pessimism, at least for exercising our foresight to the utmost possible degree, because the long period outlook, as various Senators have said, does undoubtedly give cause for disquiet.</P>
      <P>The principal point in the Minister's speech to which I would refer, which really gives me my starting point for what I am going to say, is his reference to taxation.  He admitted that taxation is almost unbearably high, but he said that no person in the Dáil or Seanad will seriously suggest any reduction of expenditure and that we therefore have some sort of vicious circle.  I agree with what Senator Douglas said about the necessity and the desirability of going without one thing when we want another, but, at the same time, I am rather afraid that what he advocates is not practical politics at present.  We have to take things as we find them.  We have to admit that Government expenditure is bound to go up, whether we like it or not, that every section of the community is crying out for more services, which will involve more Government expenditure, and we may therefore take it that rising Government expenditure is almost part of the data of the situation in which we live.  In the same way, we may take it that rising wages are part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot look for a fall in wage rates at present or in Government expenditure.  In other words, we are living in an inflationary period and we have to adapt our mentality to that period, because if we do not accept it we will make great mistakes and go wrong.  The only possible way to prevent that inflation from doing great harm to the country, from causing <Col N="447" /> ruin, is, as all previous Senators have emphasised, by a great expansion in production.  The only possible way in which this increase in incomes, because that is really what it comes to, can be supported is by a considerable volume of physical production of goods and services which will support this great increase.</P>
    <P>In this country&mdash;I entirely agree with the previous Senators&mdash;the place where we must attack the problem is in our primary production.  I agree with Senator Johnston, who referred to the multiplier effect&mdash;that if we can get an increase in output in agriculture we will probably get a three-fold increase in output in the national income generally.  Also, of course, it is not necessary for me to repeat what has been stated this evening by Senators, who far from being critical of farmers, are always friendly to them in this House, Senators who speak for farmers that the record of Irish agriculture in the past 50 years has left a great deal to be desired.  The central problem of this country, whatever the cause&mdash;we need not attempt to go into it now&mdash;is admitted by everybody to-day to be the obstinate stagnation in primary production.  That has been stated so strongly by previous speakers that I need only to refer to it.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make, arising out of that&mdash;I am simply repeating what other speakers have said&mdash;is that I think that the plea made by Senator Hayes that certain departments in the national life might be taken out of Party politics is one to which we should all attend.  After all, in wartime countries put their defensive measures completely outside Party politics.  Even in a period of cold war, or a period of rearmament, the defence services are not the subject of Party debate.  At present, we know that, in most countries in the world, unfortunately, a great deal of money is being spent on atomic research and things of that kind.  They are not subject to Party politics, but are the subject of national agreement.</P>
    <P>There are other sorts of war besides the hot and the cold wars the world is fighting to-day.  It is a cliché, I know, <Col N="448" /> and a platitude, but that is no reason for not saying it, that we have to fight a war on want, a war on emigration, a war on unemployment and a war on agricultural stagnation.  We also have to fight a war in order to preserve our national independence, not against aggression or invasion from abroad, but against the fate of debtors who lose all their assets and have perhaps to go to borrow abroad.  It might, of course, be the end of our independence, if we get to the point that, in order to balance our payments, we have to go on bended knees to some of our neighbours for credit.  In other words, the whole national safety of the country is at stake.</P>
    <P>This is not solely a matter of scoring debating points.  I am firmly convinced that the whole future of this country, not only on the economic side but on the political and national side, the very preservation of our independence, is bound up with a great expansion in output in our primary industry.  There have been certain fields of expansion in this country which have largely been taken out of politics already&mdash;the fields of hydro-electric development, of turf development and sugar beet development. These are three large industries which I think are not now the subject of Party debate any more.  These are natural resources which have been developed independently without any great question in modern times.</P>
    <P>The Government have recently taken the question of judges' salaries out of politics.  Perhaps that is not putting it quite correctly&mdash;they have decided that the question of judges' salaries is not a proper subject for Party debate in the Dáil.  I suggest that there are certain other departments of national life that might equally be made the subject of an all-Party Committee.  They are too important to be bandied about and to be made merely the subject of debating points.  It seems to me that, if we could have an expansion in primary production here, practically all our problems would almost melt away. They would be almost automatically solved.</P>
    <P>If we had a growing national dividend, based on healthy expansion of primary production we could afford all <Col N="449" /> sorts of luxuries and extravagances which we simply cannot afford now. One thing we could afford is a considerable amount of public borrowing. The limitation on public borrowing in modern times is not any 19th-century hidebound dogmatism regarding the necessity of balancing the budget, year by year.  The limiting factor, I suggest, is simply the failure of the national dividend to expand.  It is almost axiomatic that, in countries with an expanding national income, an expanding debt may be a good thing.</P>
    <P>Another thing is that we can stand for quite a long time&mdash;almost continuously&mdash;a disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  A disequilibrium in the balance of payments if it is devoted to building up our productive investment, may not represent an unwise dissipation of accumulated reserves.  It may represent a wise utilisation of the savings of the people.  I am quite clear that what Senator Johnston said is correct.  There would be at least a three-fold multplier in the system generally.  Therefore, a primary expansion is not only desirable but absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>I wish to agree with Senator Douglas in disagreeing with Senator O'Donnell. To suggest that the limiting factor is finance, that the whole problem could be solved overnight by some sort of wand, some sort of wizardy in the banking system is, I think, an oversimplification.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I think the school of thought that is of opinion that some amendment of the Central Bank Act of 1942, some variation of the composition of the legal tender note fund or some clause of that kind passed through the Dáil and Seanad would solve the problem is an over-simplification and is getting away from realities.  People who believe in and preach that doctrine are really <Col N="450" /> underestimating the difficulties which face them.  No variation in the legal tender note fund is going to increase the output of potatoes or beet.  A great deal more than that is required.  I do not say that there cannot be constructive changes in the banking system.  I do not suggest that the Irish Central Bank or the commercial banking system is perfect.</P>
      <P>I do not think anything in this world is perfect.  We should be quite prepared seriously to consider constructive suggestions for the reform of the banking system, but the idea that there is some sort of restriction of credit, some sort of hidden hand in the financial field that is keeping down productivity in all fields is an over-simplification. That is escapism&mdash;refusing to face the difficult realities of the situation. To that extent I think it is almost dangerous talk.</P>
      <P>I wish to say that I do not want to delay the Seanad or the Minister.  In conclusion&mdash;I think the Minister himself, perhaps, will agree with me&mdash;I say that a valuable headline has been set in regard to some sort of co-operation of agriculture in the industrial field. The meeting at which I had the honour to be present in Dublin recently and at which the Minister spoke seemed to be a remarkable gathering.</P>
      <P>We had there a collection of people drawn from every sort of industry in Ireland with widely different political outlooks.  All came together for a common cause and united to increase the efficiency of industry with the object of reducing costs, increasing output and exports and pushing industry forward, as the Minister said, to the second stage of its development.</P>
      <P>It has been built up almost to the maximum behind the tariff.  Industry has now to go out into the world.  It is growing up and, like the young man, it has to face the competition of its fellows in a hostile world.  Therefore, it has to be built up, educated and allowed to go forward on its own.  The Institute of Management I hope will prove a success.  It is at least a well-directed effort to build up industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lesson to be learned in the agricultural field is this.  Here we have in <Col N="451" /> a secondary industry an effort to cooperate between the Government, industry itself and the educational authorities.  The whole basis of that great meeting the other day was that the Government, businessmen and the universities have something to give each other and all intend to help each other and give freely of their best.  The time has come for a similar effort in agriculture.  I do not think it is going to be easy.  The number of people necessary to bring together are much greater.  You cannot bring together the heads of the agricultural industry in the way in which the heads of the secondary industries were brought together in a room in Dublin.  At the same time it seems to me to be the right method of approach.  There must be co-operation at the highest possible level.  The agricultural question in this country is one which must be taken out of party politics.  It must be approached as a very difficult, urgent and technical problem&mdash;a technical problem which must be solved at a technical level.  There must be, as Senator Baxter says, capital and technique.  There must be control. There must be co-operation at every level.</P>
    <P>If this debate has done nothing else it has at least shown that Senators are aware of the urgency of the problem. It is a remarkable thing in the Seanad seeing one speaker after another up to this completely unanimous in this debate.  The urgent need of the country is a great expansion of agriculture and the person to bring about that expansion&mdash;I think I am interpreting the feeling of the House&mdash;is the already over-worked Minister we have with us this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the speech made by Senator Hayes was remarkable in that it started a standard of debate which existed some years ago, a standard to which I hope we will get back now so that matters can be discussed calmly and critically.  It is very welcome and I hope that standard of debate will continue.  It was quite good.  It was better than the debates which took place in the Dáil in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> This Bill gives scope for a pretty wide discussion but up to the present practically all the speakers&mdash;many of them experts&mdash;dealt primarily with agricultural production.  I was surprised and rather glad that this was so particularly since the scope of the Bill allowed a very wide field of discussion.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston talked about the need for an increase in the physical production of agriculture.  He was followed by Senator Baxter and Senator Professor O'Brien.  All those people are experts.  I might even suggest that Senator Baxter is a professor too, because he speaks like one very often.  I know that he gives quite a lot of study to agricultural matters and talks quite a lot about them.  Might I suggest that this talk about agricultural production seems to be what is really wrong?  This has been going on and on, ever since a one-time Minister for Agriculture said: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  That was about 30 years ago but has agricultural production in a physical sense increased?  No.  I agree that the value of agricultural production has increased immensely. I am prepared to argue that if there was a recession in agricultural prices in the world market this country would be faced with a most serious crisis and could not continue even to maintain the present standard of living on the present output.</P>
    <P>What is going to be done about this thing?  Talk is not going to bring us a solution of the problem.  All this talk has been going on for the last 30 years and I am afraid the time has arrived when we should have a serious inquiry into the whole system of agriculture. The American experts suggested that we had plenty of plans, but that we had apparently a lack of determination to execute them.  We have our Department of Agriculture and our committees of agriculture throughout the country, I am a member of a committee of agriculture, and I suggest that we should immediately begin a serious inquiry into the output we are getting in return for the money spent by the Department and by the various committees of agriculture.  I say that that must be done because we <Col N="453" /> have not got the increased output in return for that money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree.  But I am talking about a planned policy, without which we are not going to get any tangible results.  I know that recently the Tánaiste has been very critical of this whole matter and I am glad to see that because if we do not do something constructive very soon it will be too late.  Since the time when a Minister for Agriculture put forward the policy of &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough,&rdquo; we have really done nothing about improving the output. We have been advised by experts on agriculture how to get the increased output but for our own part we have done nothing about it.  One or two farmers in a parish could do much by setting an example to the others.</P>
      <P>All the talk on our part will get us nowhere.  We have been subsidising agriculture and agricultural products, but unfortunately the money spent in that direction has not been spent in the delivery to the farmer of phosphatic manures.  If that had been done it would have increased our agricultural production.  The farmers themselves were under-capitalised and could not do it and often because of lack of capital had allowed the good grass land to deteriorate.  In most counties at the present time we have small staffs employed by the committees of agriculture and other staffs employed by the Department of Agriculture on the land project and farm building schemes and I wonder if there is that measure of co-ordination between them which will give the best results for the money which is being spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all sincere when we express our concern for the welfare of agriculture and for greater production, but what are we doing to secure it?  In the congested districts there is a lot of mediocre land and there is a dwindling population.  Unless some of these areas are attended to they will be deserted entirely because the population will become so sparse that these <Col N="454" /> areas will become uneconomic and the people will not remain on the land.  It has been shown that there is a great potential yield from land treated with rock phosphates and if it was treated with these you could even get better results from it than from some of the lands in Meath.  I am prepared to agree that that could be so, but we have not evolved any workable scheme to ensure that these phosphates would be put into lands like those of County Leitrim. I suggest that if the subsidies spent on butter had been spent on providing these phosphatic manures it would have done much more good.</P>
    <P>There are many people talking about cattle prices and I have heard many say that if you give the farmer an economic price he will produce the goods.  The farmer does not produce the goods despite the fact that to-day agricultural prices are even higher than ever before in the history of the country.  I often wondered what was considered an economic price, but anybody I have ever asked about it has replied that it was something higher than the existing price.  That was an entirely wrong view.  The solution of the problem to-day is not along the lines of getting a price higher than the existing price, but on the lines of increased output on the existing prices. That can only be done by the proper treatment of the lands with manures to ensure increased output.</P>
    <P>If our creameries adopted a system of divided payments for their milk fats, part of it could be translated into artificial manures delivered to the farmers and that would help matters considerably.  There are creameries which have a system of two payments by which a bonus is paid at the end of the year and they could easily arrange to give portion of it by way of these artificial manures.  If we we can increase the number of cows we will be going a long way toward securing increased agricultural production.</P>
    <P>There are people who imagine that you could hatch calves in an incubator. That cannot be done as far as I know. In the lands that used to be dairying lands, such as Limerick, there is a decline in the cow population and I greatly fear that it is on the mediocre <Col N="455" /> lands of the dairying area of the North, such as Cavan and Leitrim, that this country will have to rely for the production of calves.  It is vitally important to increase the potential output of those areas that will remain dairying areas.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell made a lovely statement about currency and credit. It seems to be popular to talk about that matter at the present time. Apparently, the people who talk about this matter are not able to produce a blue print.  Why not have a dollar currency?  It is on the ability of this country to produce goods or to give services that any currency will rest. The person who put the salmon, the horse and the pig on our coins was a realist.</P>
    <P>I agree with the viewpoint expressed by Professor George O'Brien.  I do not think he heard me correctly when I said &ldquo;the Midas touch&rdquo;.  I think I have put across some of the points I feel strongly about.  I hope I did not unduly delay the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all may I say very briefly that I welcome Senator Hayes' speech to-night because a proper approach to the problem of politics is very desirable in this country.  About 12 months ago I stated in this House that we ought to have an agreed policy on agriculture, which is our principal industry.  I said at the time that in Britain there is an agreed foreign policy and no matter who may be the Prime Minister, whether it is Winston Churchill or Clement Attlee, their foreign policy with regard to this and other countries will be exactly the same.  If we have an agreed policy in regard to agriculture we will pursue a course to make that industry prosperous.  It has been for a long time in many respects the plaything of politics.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter referred to the reduction in the number of cattle.  I say that if we do not increase the price of milk we will not be able to maintain our exports in dead meat, cattle, pigs, poultry and other products.  I do not say that in any political sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I leave that point and return to what I believe is the matter which is strictly <Col N="456" /> before the House&mdash;that is our economic position.  In the economic sphere the country is suffering from two evils&mdash; high taxation and under-production. The weight of the burden of taxation has leant on our principal industry, agriculture, for over a century and a half.  In the past it was the rack rent paid to the landlord; now it takes the form of rates and often of high prices for the commodities that the farming community have to purchase.</P>
    <P>I believe that our local and central bureaucracy is over-staffed and that it is a dead hand on our main productive effort.  To some extent it is a case of putting the car before the horse. Everything that is required for the State, everything that is required for the man that works and lives in the town, whether he is a professional man, a businessman or an industrialist, has to be covered first and what is left over is given to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community number something less than 50 per cent. of the population and receive something over 30 per cent. of the national wealth. Senator Professor O'Brien asks us not to be pessimistic.  I am prepared to work with anyone.  That is why I am in politics.  I am not pessimistic about the future but let us be realistic.  We must try to create some optimism in the young men and women, the sons and daughters of farmers, optimism that will keep them living on the land.  It is no good having a city optimism, the optimism that Senator O'Donnell spoke about, the optimism that is making Dublin one of the gayest capitals in Europe.  That is not developing our national economy in the way in which we would like to see Ireland developing.  A little bit of gaiety is desirable now and again even for those who work in the country but that is not the goal at which we should aim.</P>
    <P>We read recently in the Press a report of the E.C.A. experts who were asked to study our economic position. They referred to the effect of taxation on industry and have stated that the tax on our industry is higher than in most countries in the world, with the exception of Britain, the United States <Col N="457" /> of America and Holland.  These countries are at the moment on a war time economy basis.  The report further states that we are a young country industrially and that we cannot afford this weight of taxation if we are to make substantial development.  They state that the wear and tear allowance given for the replacement of plant and machinery, in their opinion is inadequate.</P>
    <P>They go on to state that the weight of taxation is so high that the money required for investment in and development of new industries in our country is not forthcoming, that that money is being filtered away in taxation for State schemes, some of which are definitely of questionable productive use to the nation.  The chief criticism they have of the dominant role of Government in general investment was that a disproportionately large percentage of investment had been devoted to &ldquo;social overhead&rdquo; rather than to production-increasing enterprises. They say that the possibility of maintaining the current gross capital formation in Ireland under existing economic patterns was seriously open to question.  I suggest that these are matters to which the people should turn their attention.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has a bearing on high taxation: Are we getting value for the money that we take from the people in taxes?  I believe that in many cases we are not. I spoke recently to a very high official in local affairs and he said to me that he believes that local affairs will tend to bankrupt the country unless the Local Government Department continues to see that there is greater efficiency.</P>
    <P>Inspectors sent down by our Department of Local Government should report their findings directly to the council.  Our inspectors go down and view the roads made and houses built and never report to these bodies who strike the rates and levy the burden whether a good or bad job is being done.  We can take it that when that line of thought is there, a bad job is being done because one public servant does not like to report another public servant.  There is another matter to <Col N="458" /> which we should turn our attention: I recently came across the British Third Report on the cost of house-building, a matter mentioned here by Senators from each side of the House when calling upon the Government to have an inquiry into the cost of house-building here.</P>
    <P>They have found in Britain that it is necessary to have a permanent committee sitting on this matter in order that they may get efficiency.  I will read three lines from this Third Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We point out in Chapter 4 of this Report that if the pre-war productivity could be achieved approximately 25 per cent. more houses would be built with the same labour force and a saving of approximately £100 would be effected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that, if these people who have been charged with this problem believed that 25 per cent. more houses could be built, in this country, where the problem is not watched, the saving would be greater.  There is an outcry against high rents but this could be met by an inquiry conducted by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this may sound like pessimism, but I am prepared, with others, to work to remove some of these evils.  I believe that the evils which must be removed are those of under-production and over-taxation and until these are dealt with, you will not get people to live and work in rural Ireland.  We have been suffering in rural Ireland from gross under-investment which is usually caused by the fact that people have no confidence in the industry in which they are working. The tendency has been to mind land, a tendency which has been handed down from father to son because in the original state the landlord took from the farmers anything in the form of money made by thrift. When these people became tenant farmers some of that deposite remained and, with the several money upheavals, the farmer was not encouraged to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>We have had the longest period ever in our history of agricultural stability, and I think that if we had an agreed <Col N="459" /> policy on agriculture and a lower rate of taxation we would encourage our farmers and our industrialists to invest their money in projects which would be for the benefit of our people.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the few recommendations that I have made because I believe in some respects they deal with the kernel of many of our economic problems and, certainly, with the most serious of them.</P>

      <P>I wonder would it be possible to get an indication from the House as to the number of speakers yet to come?  The practice has been that this House adjourned at 10 o'clock but there is no Standing Order to that effect.  It is not desirable to break an established practice unless it is by agreement of the House.  If the House wishes to adjourn at the usual time, it will be necessary to sit tomorrow or next week.  However, the matter is entirely for the House to decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with most other Senators who spoke, I want to dissociate myself from some of the remarks of Senator O'Donnell. The remarks from which I want to dissociate myself are those in which he pleaded, not for the first time, with Senators to regard themselves as having no politics and to regard this House as purely a vocational institution. I am aware that the original conception of this particular Seanad was that it would be along vocational lines, but, whether we liked it or not, the fact is that, with the possible exception of those elected by the universities, this Seanad is elected by active politicians and active supporters of the various Parties.  I have no hesitation at all in considering that I was put here because of the politics which I profess and I have no hesitation in looking on matters coming before the House from the political standpoint should I so desire.  The Supplies and Services Bill, however, does not relate to the supply of personnel to the Seanad and I think we might go on to other supplies, but I am glad of the opportunity of making my view clear about Senator O'Donnell's persistent appeal.</P>
      <P>This debate, I understand, is one of the few occasions on which Senators get an opportunity to review general Government work and policy.  I think we are entitled to ask ourselves what was the position last time we discussed the Supplies and Services Bill, what has happened since then and what is the position to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will recollect that when we discussed this Bill a year ago the Minister and some of those supporting him were merely uttering coy threats to the existence of food subsidies, but the food subsidies were still maintained.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and the Minister for Finance in particular, were at that time engaged in making panic speeches and gloomy speeches, such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce condemned in the Dáil earlier this week; but despite the speeches then being made by those Ministers and by Government supporters as a whole, the real trouble <Col N="461" /> which was going to follow from their speeches and their policy had not yet come; it was only threatened.</P>
    <P>This time last year the cost of living had gone up considerably compared with what it had been when the present Government took office, but it had not gone up to the heights to which it has soared since.  That was the picture this time last year.  What has happened since then?  The panicky speeches made by the Minister and his colleagues in the Departments of Finance and Local Government have had their result and their effect.  The folly of those speeches has now become apparent to everyone.  The trade slump which was forecast by the speakers on this side of the House this time last year has since then become a reality. The unemployment which was forecast this time last year has become a reality.</P>
    <P>The report of the Central Bank for 1951, to which reference was made in this debate just a year ago and which was rejected by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Dáil a year ago, has since been implemented by the present Government, by the Tánaiste and by the Minister for Finance.  Those are the main features, the outstanding features of Government policy in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>We all remember the controversy and the stormy debates which arose out of this report of the Central Bank for the year 1951.  We all remember the main recommendations in that report, that there was to be a drastic restriction in bank credit, that there was to be a reduction in or removal of food subsidies, and that there was to be interference with the land rehabilitation scheme.  We all remember how, when it was demonstrated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil that it would be foolish to pay too much attention to that report, having made several speeches in which he referred to a present or impending crisis, the Tánaiste sailed into the Dáil and rejected the report of the Central Bank and informed the Irish Parliament that so far as he and his Government were concerned the measures which they proposed to operate in the coming 12 months were to be diametrically opposed to the <Col N="462" /> recommendations of the Central Bank. All of us will remember that, and I think the Minister cannot accuse me of any inaccuracy.</P>
    <P>But what has happened in the last 12 months?  Of the three main recommendations to which I have referred, the Central Bank recommendation that food subsidies were to be reduced or cut out entirely has been put into effect by the Government&mdash;not-withstanding that the Minister promised his policy would be diametrically opposed to the Central Bank, and notwithstanding the fact that it was diametrically opposed to the pledged word of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and all of his Government colleagues when, after the last general election, he and they sat down and published in all of the daily newspapers a solemn programme which they said they would implement if they obtained sufficient votes to form a Government.  Despite that 17-point programme in which No. 15, I think, specifically referred to the pledge of the Government to maintain food subsidies, the Central Bank Report in that respect was implemented.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank recommended, though perhaps not in so many words, that there should be some reduction in the impetus behind the land rehabilitation scheme.  What has happened?  In the first Budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, the moneys to be spent on that project were reduced, drastically reduced, and only this week we hear from the Government in the Dáil that the machinery used in connection with that project is to pass out of Government ownership.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to emphasise that the third main recommendation of the Central Bank, that there should be a drastic restriction of bank credit, was and has been implemented by the Government; and it is nonsense for any Senator to suggest to anyone who has any connection with business circles or agricultural circles that there has not been, over the last 12 months, a very grave restriction in bank credit.  That is what has happened in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, we have Government Ministers, for some reason <Col N="463" /> that I certainly cannot understand, still sniping away at the fact that Marshall Aid was accepted by the Government of this country.  As recently as the 8th of this month, we find reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> under the heading &ldquo;Pawned by Coalition&rdquo; the views of the Minister for Finance, as given to a meeting of a Fianna Fáil Cumann in Belturbet.  This is what the Minister for Finance says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the success of the recent National Loan, what justification was there for raising the Marshall Aid Loan at all?  In raising the Marshall Aid money, the late Coalition put this country in pawn and the only thing left to their successors was the pawn ticket.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister for Industry and Commerce would indicate whether, even on this particular matter, he agrees with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>All of us are quite well aware of the conflict, not only in personalities but in policies, as between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have referred to the fact that, although the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Tánaiste, sailed boldly into the Dáil to reject and throw overboard the report of the Central Bank for the year 1951, that report has been implemented nearly in full by the policy pursued by his Government under the direction of the Minister for Finance.  We know that that conflict is there.  I want to ask the Tánaiste does he stand over that kind of statement, that kind of speech by the Minister for Finance?  His Leader does not do so.</P>
    <P>I have here some cuttings for the year 1948&mdash;I have referred to this already&mdash;where the Taoiseach mentioned, in reference to the Marshall Plan, that it was an act of unparalleled generosity from one nation to another. In their issue of the 8th January, 1948, the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;which must be accepted, and is accepted, as the organ of the present Government Party&mdash; wrote a leading article on this subject, in which they said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Scarcely ever in history has a nation made such a generous offer as <Col N="464" /> the help America proposes to give to Europe under the Marshall Plan. American resources, to be sure, are vast, but so is her generosity measured on an equally grand scale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a special article in their issue of the 8th January, 1948, the Government organ carried a headline saying that the benefits of the Marshall Plan would get over the dollar shortage and aid capital development.  They went on to explain what the effect of the application of Marshall Aid in this country would be, the supplies that would come in, and so on.  That was at a time when the Fianna Fáil Party formed the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>All of us know that the initial steps towards obtaining Marshall Aid were taken by the Fianna Fáil Government. I am not criticising them for that&mdash; they were quite right to do it&mdash;but I want some explanation of the attitude of the Minister for Finance in his perpetual sniping at the great American nation and the generosity of the American people in providing us with Marshall Aid.  Does it reflect a change in Government policy?  Does it mean that the Fianna Fáil Party regret having accepted Marshall Aid in 1948?</P>
    <P>I know that another speaker is anxious to speak and I will curtail my remarks as best I can.  I feel that the year that has passed has been one of great hardship for the people of this country.  I believe it is a year in which the present Government, if they ever had it, lost the confidence of the people, and I believe that the powers asked for in this Bill are such as should only be given to and be used by a Government which has the confidence of the people.  It is quite clear that the present Government and their policies have been rejected by the people of this country, and in particular by the people of the capital city. If proof of that is needed, one has only to reflect for a moment on the figures of the by-election in Dublin NorthWest. The result of that election was a clear and unambiguous call to the present Government to get out.  I invite them to accept that invitation, to get out and give the people a chance of putting into office a Government in which they will have confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Higgins, I want to disagree entirely with Senator O'Donnell.  He said that we should not regard ourselves here as politicians.  Some of us should, and particularly some of the Senators on the opposite side who would agree with Senator O'Donnell.  We all know that the bulk of us here are politicians and we should be frank enough to admit it.  The Minister is a politician and we should not put him in the position of feeling a little coy about talking in front of non-politicians.</P>
      <P>This is the first occasion on which I have spoken in a debate like this and I understand that one can range widely over Government policy.  I should like to assure you, Sir, that I do not intend to do that and to assure Senators that I do not intend to touch on agriculture, except to say that, while most Senators have alleged that agriculture suffers from under-production, I feel that it certainly does not suffer from under-production of speech.</P>
      <P>In 1950, the unemployment figures show that we had reached the lowest figure on record in this country.  They also show that, by October, 1951, the figure had increased by 8,400 and that, by October, 1952, they had increased by 10,500 over the 1950 figure.  This is not really a true picture of the present unemployment position.  It is entirely, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many other people, more qualified to pass judgment, due to the policy of the Government, but as I say, it does not present a true picture, because anybody in business or, for that matter, out of business must be aware that at the moment many people are in part-time employment and will be in part-time employment up to the end of next week.  I suggest that the unemployment figure for the present period, as shown by the figures of the Central Statistics Office for, say, mid-January, will give a truer picture than the October figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures do not give a true picture because they take no account of the 5,000 unemployed who have been absorbed into the Army.  I am glad, as an ex-soldier, to see the recruiting drive succeeding, but I must emphasise that these 5,000 people who <Col N="466" /> entered the Army would, in the normal way, be on the unemployed list.  The figure takes no account of the increased number who have emigrated, and I suggest that, in examining the figures, Senators and people who take an interest in these matters&mdash;I presume that refers to all members of the Oireachtas&mdash;should bear in mind that the figure for unemployment must be related to the figures for emigration and Army recruitment.</P>
    <P>In connection with unemployment, I should like to say, in passing, that the man on whom his work bears most harshly at the moment, in my locality at any rate, is the manager of the labour exchange.  I am not exaggerating when I say that he is working practically until midnight.  Whatever the reason&mdash;I understand that he cannot get staff or possibly is not allowed &mdash;it is a fact that the hardest worked man in my locality is the manager of the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>The cost of living was referred to here and in the other House and it is, to my mind, a remarkable fact that we should have in this House Senators voting for increased taxation which must force the cost of living further and further in an upward direction.  I cannot understand the arguments which seek to excuse a vote which must force the cost of living up and, at the same time, seek to excuse the fact that the cost of living is going up.  The people who vote for measures which are bound to force the cost of living upwards and, at the same time, on another Bill, seek to adduce arguments to excuse the cost of living and to accuse other Parties of sending up the cost of living, certainly have not examined the effect of their votes.  I suggest that the present policy of the Government is being forced upon their own Party and that they are voting without examining the results of their votes.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, we had a Government in this country which had the very happy experience of calling home workers from England to engage in the housing effort here.  That Government, unfortunately, no longer exists but we now have a position in which the Government now in power have, by <Col N="467" /> their efforts, as everybody knows, prevented, in large measure, the building of houses by private individuals.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that they are also engaged in attempting to prevent the building of houses by public bodies.  I do not know whether I am in order in referring to local matters on the Bill.  However, I think the Cathaoirleach will pardon me if I quote from a few documents in my possession which might go some way to prove the statement I have just made that the Minister's Government is now attempting, having partly succeeded in stopping the building of houses by private individuals, to prevent the building of houses by public bodies.  I quote from the report of the Clare County Medical Officer of Health to the Ennis Urban Council, dated 1/12/52:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever one of the existing new houses at nearby Summerhill becomes vacant there is a keen demand for its tenancy.  It cannot be said that there are any frivolous applications or that more than one or two of the applicants are not in need of alternative accommodation.  I am satisfied that there is need for these 13 proposed houses and indications are that from now onwards the demand for this type of house will increase because of the falling off, almost to disappearing point, in the volume of small dwellings type of house building.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an extract from the report submitted to the Ennis Urban Council by the Clare Medical Officer of Health. It was asked for by the council in connection with a scheme to build 13 houses.  I quote further, with your permission, Sir, to prove the statement I have made&mdash;this time from the minutes of the meeting of the Ennis Urban Council dated 5/12/1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Council considered the above&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is, the minutes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;which were read by the clerk, who stated, in reply to members of the council, that 11 applications had <Col N="468" /> been received for a house at No. 1 clearance area which had become vacant in April, 1952, 16 for a house which had become vacant in January, 1952, and 11 for a house which became vacant in July, 1951.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will now quote from a letter from the Department of Local Government dated 8th November, 1952.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister is not satisfied that there is justification for the heavy capital expenditure called for in this case having regard to the stage reached with the council's housing programme and the type of letting involved and, accordingly, he is not prepared to approve of the acceptance of the tender for those 13 houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Department of Local Government is not satisfied that there is need for 13 new houses in Ennis when the county medical officer of health says that there are up to 20 applicants for every house that becomes vacant and that no application can be considered frivolous.</P>

      <P>It suggests to any reasonable Senator that the Minister is not prepared to sanction the building of houses in Ennis at an economic rent of 25/-.  It suggests to me that he of houses by local authority just as his is attempting now to stop the building <Col N="469" /> Government have attempted to stop the building of houses by private individuals. I will not pursue that subject any further.  However, as far as I can see, the policy of this Government is exemplified in an <i>Evening Mail</i> headline of this evening: &ldquo;Room to cash in on Air Service.&rdquo;  I would not venture to criticise the Parliamentary Secretary for his choice of words but I would suggest that is not the type of phraseology which should be used by any Minister, junior or senior.  It appears to me to suggest the mentality behind the Government&mdash;cash in on everything.  In other words, they must get cash.  They must tell the people they must get cash.  They cannot afford to have the people in the relatively comfortable position in which they were, enjoying relatively light taxation.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes criticised the provision of this Bill which extends the life of the Supplies and Services Act until December next and suggested that it might be more desirable to provide for the determination of the Supplies and Services Act at some other time of the year than December. He suggested October.  The fact is that the Act used to terminate in September each year and was extended at the request of the Seanad and I think of Senator Hayes himself.  I mention that, however, merely as an indication that we cannot always foresee what is the best arrangement to make in matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>I confess that I did not come here prepared to discuss the practice of politics or the functioning of the Oireachtas, but with a great deal of what Senator Hayes said I find myself in agreement.  I have the intention of bringing his remarks to the notice of some of my colleagues and I hope he will do the same.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the growth in the functions of Government over the past quarter of a century is imposing on the Houses of the Oireachtas and on the Cabinet strains which it was not contemplated they should carry and that at some time we <Col N="470" /> will have to re-examine the whole position.</P>
      <P>Turning now to the matters directly related to the Bill which were raised in the course of the debate, I would like to correct an impression which appears to persist in the mind of Senator Douglas that the Government believes in price control as necessary in the public interest even where competitive conditions have been restored in any particular trade.  I have very little faith in price control as a method of preventing prices from rising or even of ensuring that they will fall when costs justify it.  I have frequently expressed the opinion that many of our existing price controls keep prices up instead of the reverse.  It is not always easy to get rid of price control once you have it because not merely must you be satisfied that its removal will, in fact, have beneficial results, but you must be able to convince the public of it.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in the course of the discussion in the Dáil on this Bill the question of flour and bread prices.  It is the fact that in many parts of the country flour and bread are being sold at less than the prices fixed by Order. I think that if we removed the price control in respect of bread and flour and could take effective means of ensuring that there would be competition between bakers and flour millers that these lower prices operating in some districts would become general. I am quite certain, however, that if there was a proposal to remove price control in respect of bread and flour somebody would say that its effect would be to enable bakers and flour millers to make more profits.  That would be said by a sufficient number of people to make it undesirable to follow that course because by doing so an attitude would be created in the public mind which would be prejudicial to the Government and the aims of its policy. It is clear also, that the removal of official control does not mean that all control will disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad will, I trust, at an early date next year, have before it the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill.  I certainly think that we should have power to deal with business organisations <Col N="471" /> operating for the purpose of keeping up prices and to restrict competition before we can in any way weaken or remove the present machinery of price control.  What form of permanent organisation we should have to investigate price levels&mdash;and some organisation is necessary in a country of our size where the policy of protection by tariffs and quotas is operated&mdash;is a matter we will have to consider later, but in the meantime, I am quite satisfied in my own mind that it is necessary to preserve the special powers conferred under this Supplies and Services Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston referred to the static character of agricultural output and every other Senator who referred to that said that something must be done about it.  Senator Burke suggested we should be agreed as to what should be done, but I am afraid the historical fact is that every commission and committee set up to recommend a policy for agriculture as a whole or any branch of agriculture failed to produce a unanimous report and not infrequently produced more than one minority report.  I do not pretend to have any claims to be regarded as an expert on this subject. I have read most of the blue books that were published, studied most of the reports from the various committees and commissions, listened to the speeches in the Oireachtas, read Senator Johnston's book on the subject and I have certain views of my own which I would only venture to put forward in a tentative way.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien said that this static production is a technical problem, a matter of capital, technique and machinery.  I would like to suggest that it is not a technical problem and the mistake we have made lies in the fact that we have always approached it as a technical problem; that all these commissions and committees regarded it as such and directed their activities and energies to making recommendations dealing with agricultural production as a technical matter. There are other factors that lead me to that conclusion.  The first is the failure to secure a higher volume of agricultural output following upon the <Col N="472" /> development of agricultural technique peculiar to this country, and even to the part of this country for which we are responsible, which has not achieved the same increase of output as has been recorded in the six northeastern counties.  Why is it that in the present day, when an Irish Government is in control which has been not only benevolent but paternalistic to Irish agriculture, making large sums available every year for farm improvement schemes and building schemes, fertilisers, drainage, credit facilities and the provision of highly expert advisers, that the volume of agricultural production to-day is no higher than it was in the worst days of Irish landlordism?</P>
    <P>Clearly, that is a big matter and to me it is obviously a psychological matter.  I was impressed by a series of articles which appeared on English agriculture in the <i>Economist</i> where the writer tried to analyse the British approach to agriculture and the efforts which had been taken to stimulate production since 1948.  There was one big jump in production there during a short period after the war and then there was no further expansion from that on and that particular writer approaches the matter as a psychological problem.  He says that it was because there was an unwillingness on the part of the British farmer to respond to the inducements held out to him to expand further and that that was due to the fact that on the average the British farmer was satisfied with the standard of life that he had and that the benefits of a higher income would not be immediately reflected in his mode of life and could be secured only at a risk and effort disproportionate to that involved in giving him the standard of life with which he was satisfied.  I feel that there is some similarity in that approach to the position we have here.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said that if the farmer was paid enough he would produce the goods.  I would like him to prepare graphs showing agricultural prices and output over the past 25 or 50 years.  I do not believe that if he did so he would find the graphs <Col N="473" /> moving parallel: rather would he find quite the reverse.  I do not think that we are getting the production we should be getting in relation to the value of the assistance we are giving by guaranteed prices and the other devices which are designed to raise the standard of life of the farmer and designed to induce him to give increased agricultural output.</P>
    <P>These are only casual ideas which have occurred to me from time to time and I put them forward for what they are worth.  I think they show clearly that this is not entirely a technical problem and that on the whole the technical approach to it is not the right one and will not, in present circumstances, solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators who said that the success of all our plans for increasing the security of the national economy and raising the standard of life of the people depends on our finding the answer to that question: why it is that despite the efforts of a quarter of a century notwithstanding all the aid that has been given out of public funds to agriculture no expansion in the volume of output has resulted.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins, who for some reason thought it necessary to explain that he was a politician, made some statements that I am anxious to correct.  It is not true that the restriction in bank credit, if there was such a restriction, was implemented by the Government.  The published accounts of the banks show that the volume of loans and advances is higher than ever. The Government does not control and would not attempt to influence the decision of bank managements upon applications for bank accommodation. We may have influenced it by the extent to which we have ourselves used bank credits during the course of the past year.</P>
    <P>I do not know that Senator O'Higgins was correct in saying that the Central Bank recommended the reduction of food subsidies.  Whether it did or not, it certainly was not a reason why the Government decided to adopt that course.</P>
    <P>It is entirely incorrect that the Government set out to restrict the land <Col N="474" /> improvement scheme.  On the contrary, we took a scheme which appeared to us to be a bit of a fraud and made a reality out of it.  Let us compare the achievement of two Ministers.  In 1950/51 the then Minister for Agriculture got voted in the Budget £3,000,000 for that land improvement scheme and spent £500,000.  In this year the present Minister for Agriculture, having been given a similar amount, pushed the scheme so vigorously that to-day in the Dáil he was asking for more money, having spent the full amount voted in the Budget, to carry the scheme on to the end of the financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the contention by Senator O'Higgins that the Government decided to restrict the land improvement scheme.</P>
      <P>May I say a few words about Marshall Aid just to get some facts known? The Marshall Aid scheme&mdash;I was myself at the conference in Paris which initiated it&mdash;provided for the giving of assistance to States in Europe in two forms, either by grant or by loan. Sometime after the change of Government in 1948 I said that there had been no question of aid in loan form for this country while I was a Minister and I was contradicted and it was proved that I was wrong, that during the course of the election campaign a document had been received in the Department of External Affairs which indicated that aid for this country would be in loan and not in grant form. I mention that incident to emphasise that the question of accepting Marshall Aid in the form of a loan never came before the Government of which I was a member&mdash;the Government that went out of office in 1948&mdash;it was never considered by that Government.  I as a member of it did not even know that the document which brought up the question for decision had been received until after the election and the change of Government was over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May, 1948, however, our successors considered the question and decided not to accept aid in loan form.  That <Col N="475" /> fact is not, I think, well-known.  The views of different Ministers representing various Departments in that Government are on record and the decision of the Government is on record.  Having examined the whole question in the light of what was best in the interests of this country, they decided not to accept Marshall Aid by way of loan.</P>
    <P>Then there were negotiations in London leading to the 1948 Trade Agreement and in the course of these negotiations the question of accepting Marshall Aid dollars arose and there was an agreement that in order to avoid any nett draw upon the sterling area dollar pool the Irish Government would use Marshall Aid dollars to finance its dollar requirements while they were available and subsequent to these London negotiations there was a formal reversal of the previous decision not to accept Marshall Aid in loan form and a decision made to accept it instead.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious, therefore, that there were very serious considerations to be taken into account in that connection.  The Government that was in office in 1948, prior to these London discussions, thought that this country could get by without borrowing dollars under the Marshall Aid plan and that, taking a long-term view, it was better that we should endeavour to get by without these dollar loans and it was only when the difficulties of the sterling area of which this country forms a part were brought to their attention and the need to get dollars, no matter how they were obtained, whether by loan or by grant, emphasised, that they decided to accept loans under the Marshall Aid Plan.</P>
    <P>I think that we should not attempt to minimise the seriousness of the consequences for this country.  We now have this dollar debt on which we are paying interest and which we are due to start repaying in 1956.  I do not think that the economy of this country was expanded by the use of these funds to an extent equivalent to the additional charges which that debt has <Col N="476" /> placed upon it.  I hope that we will have so raised the national income by 1956 that we can take the repayment of that loan without hardship or difficulty but it is a burden which we would much prefer not to have to carry, a particularly heavy burden because it involves the payment of that interest and sinking fund charge outside the economy and particularly so because it involves payment in dollars.</P>
