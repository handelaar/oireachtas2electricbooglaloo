      <P>Fuair an Cléireach ón Sannaí Oifigiúil i bhFéimheacht deimhniú á rá go ndearnadh Liam Mac Maoláin, comhalta den Tigh seo, a bhreithniú ina fhéimhí an 16ú Meán Fómhair seo caite.  Mholfainn don tSeanad a iarraidh ar an gCoiste um Nós Imeachta agus Pribhléidí scrúdú a dhZanamh agus tuarascáil a thabhairt ar an éifeacht atá ag an mbreithniú deimhneachta sin maidir le Liam Mac Maoláin a bheith ina chomhalta den tSeanad.  Beidh ar chumas an Tí nuair a gheobhaid an tuarascáil aon bhreith is cuí leo a thabhairt.</P>
      <P>The Clerk received from the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy a certificate to the effect that William McMullen, a member of this House, was adjudicated a bankrupt on the 16th September last. I would suggest to the Seanad that the question of the effect of this adjudication of bankruptcy on Mr. McMullen's membership of the Seanad should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for examination and report.  The House on receipt of the report will be in a position to make any decision which it thinks fit.</P>

      <P>Tá orm a chur in iúl don tSeanad go raibh an tréimhse áirithe nócha lá dá dtagartar in Airteagal 23 den Bhunreacht, chun Seanad Éireann do bhreathnú Billí a tionscnadh, nó a meastar a tionscnadh, i nDáil Éireann, caite i gcás an Bhille Uchtála, 1952, ar an 13ú Deireadh Fómhair.  Mar gheall ar na cúrsaí áirithe i dtaobh an Bhille seo, ní dóigh liom, agus tá comhairle an Choiste um Nós Imeachta agus Pribhléidí agam chuige sin, gur gá don tSeanad dul thairis sin ach gur ceart dóibh leanúint ar aghaidh le breathnú an Bille sa ghnáth-shlí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to inform the Seanad that the stated period of 90 days for the consideration in Seanad Éireann of Bills initiated or deemed to have been initiated in Dáil Éireann, referred to in Article 23 of the Constitution, expired in relation to the Adoption Bill, 1952, on the 13th October.  In view of the circumstances attaching to this Bill, I do not think it necessary, and in this matter I have been so advised by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that the Seanad should <Col N="3" /> further advert to the matter, but should continue on with the consideration of the Bill in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a request from the Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers asking me to move an amendment to this section so as to secure that half the ordinary members would be women.  I did not put down an amendment, partly because I have refrained from putting down amendments to this Bill unless there is consent, and also because there was not time.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a mistake if women were not on the committee.  I should like an assurance from the Minister in regard to that point.  I think that, in the request which was made to me, it was argued that women are the natural protectors of children, and that on matters dealing with a home and knowledge of a foster-mother they would probably be very good judges.  They also made the point that women are the best judges of women, though I disagree with that viewpoint.</P>

      <P>Some women will be on the board, though I cannot say how many.  There is no reason why they should not be on the board.  I think we may take it for granted that at least one woman will be on the board.  There is no objection in the world to that.  I feel some woman should be on the board.</P>
      <P>Question agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 9 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 10, page 4, lines 39 and 40, to delete &ldquo;not less than six months and not more than seven&rdquo;<Col N="4" /> and substitute &ldquo;not more than twelve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the Bill an adoption order may not be made, except in the case of an existing adoption, until after the child has attained six months and not after it has attained the age of seven years.  I thought that I should amend that to enable the adoption order to be made before the child had attained six months and after it had attained the age of seven, but I have reconsidered the matter and have decided that, with your permission, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Senator withdraws, might I be allowed to make some comment?  The Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers asked me to raise this matter also.  I am not sure that it can be easily solved, but it is a matter of some importance.  As far as I can gather, they accept it as a general principle that the child must be more or less of tender age and they are not disposed to quarrel with the maximum of seven years&mdash;nor am I&mdash;but they are concerned about children who may be and are believed to be in homes, who would have been adopted but for the fact that there was a delay in passing the Bill or that there was no Adoption Bill.  They are particularly anxious that some power should be given to the adoption committee to exceed the seven in exceptional cases during the first few years&mdash;they suggest five years but I would be inclined to suggest two or three years&mdash;of the operation of the Act.</P>
      <P>The effect of that would be that the general principle of adoption would be the adoption of children between six months and seven years and that would be set out as the normal practice for the future; but power would be given to deal with children who would be adopted and could have been adopted and should have been adopted, where it may be rather hard that for the first few years we should restrict them rigidly to the seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, again, I had not time to put down an amendment, nor would I have put one down except where I had reason to believe the Minister <Col N="5" /> would agree.  I think there is a somewhat important point there.  I do not know if the Minister can see a way to meet it.  I am satisfied that the point made by these ladies is a good one, that there may be cases of children between seven and eight years who would have been adopted, and where the children have been in the care of homes, but for the fact that there was no Adoption Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that there was a great deal of consideration given to the question of age.  As far as the earlier age is concerned, there is nothing to prevent people informally adopting a child&mdash;I wanted to make that point if Senator O'Reilly had wished to continue with his amendment. People can take children in for 12 months without legal adoption and then adopt them afterwards.  It is generally agreed that seven years is the limit in which a child would be likely to feel himself or herself a member of the family.  That was the idea, to try to get them before it would be too late, so that they might feel they were members of the family.</P>
      <P>Seeing that there is no amendment being proceeded with, I suggest we should see how the Bill works out first. I have no doubt that some little flaws may be found in it later and we might need to have them rectified.  Let us give this Bill a trial as it is.  It has been well and carefully considered.  It is said that at the age of seven one comes to the use of reason and the child starts to feel himself more a stranger in the family if he is much older than that.  I think we should let it go at that and see how it works out.  I understand that in England there were amendments and there may be things to clear up here after a year or two when we have seen the Bill working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would agree that it is very hard to get in amending legislation in a case like this.  Once the Bill goes through, it tends to become fairly permanent&mdash;at least, that is my experience&mdash;and I just wonder whether we could not do something on this section.  There has been a great deal of delay, very wise delay, over this Bill, but certain children would have <Col N="6" /> passed the age limit within these four or five months, and it is going to be a little hard on them to find that the axe has fallen just before their qualification date.  I think the Minister would agree that it is unlikely there will be any amending legislation at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take some time, I have no doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would like, if possible, is to give the committee discretion, for a year after the coming into operation of the Act, to exceed the seven years.  I do not think it should be done except at the full discertion of the adoption committee, and I do not think the Minister would be taking any risk by putting in an amendment, which would come up on the Report Stage and which need not necessitate any delay, to provide for discretion for one year or two.  I would be satisfied with one, but the ladies think it should be more.  The real point that appeals to me is that of the border-line cases during the first year.  The Minister's general argument with regard to amendments has already been accepted by me in my attitude to the Bill, but that, unfortunately, does not apply in this case, since no one could think of this Bill being amended within a year or a year and a half.  In that case, this is something which we must provide for now or not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should be impressed by the Minister's statement that the younger the child comes into the family and is adopted as such the better for everyone.  I think seven years is the right age, that, after seven, there should be no question of adoption at all.  It is not fair, otherwise, to the child or to the family. We should be out to encourage such adoption, but if we ask that the age be stretched from seven to eight we will be asking too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing to stretch the age from seven to eight. In a good number of cases there is reason to believe that, if this Bill had been passed six months ago, children would have been adopted.  They were ready to be adopted and all I want is to put something in to cover such <Col N="7" /> abnormal cases.  I do not want to change the law.  I want to deal with those who were approaching seven when this Bill was brought in and were in homes, and where there was delay because the people preferred to have legal adoption.  I am asking the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Senator Douglas, I think he is asking for an extension from seven to eight.  If we make the Bill retrospective in order to bring in some cases&mdash;I do not believe there would be many&mdash;you will then meet other cases.  I suggest we should stick rigidly to the seven years and if there are cases cut out, they have just got to remain so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reply to Senator Colgan is that this is a Bill from which we hope a good deal of good will flow.  I would not agree with an extension from seven to eight, but I can well see difficulties arising within the first 12 months.  I would not go further than that.  This Bill could have been passed six months ago and then certain children could legally have been adopted.  Because of its being passed six months later, certain children will not be able to be legally adopted.  There will always be hard luck cases.  Even if the suggested amendment were brought in by the Minister on the Report Stage, there would still be hard luck cases.  Since the introduction of the Bill and due to the fact that it has taken such a long time to reach this stage, there might be a great many children who could legally be adopted, where some people were looking forward to legally adopting them and now find it would be impossible.  That is the only point I would like to stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretMaryPearse" hpid="Miss Pearse Miss Pearse">
      <NameTxt>Miss Pearse</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Douglas and Senator Hearne have said.  The consideration of the Bill has taken a long time.  There will be families who have looked after children for some time and who would like to adopt them.  They already love them and that is their home, but they will be precluded from adopting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator <Col N="8" /> Douglas and other Senators.  I think we have a difficult amendment to draft.  I do not think that anybody but the Minister, in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman, could do this.  An interim arrangement is suggested. It is not suggested to raise the age from seven years to eight years.  A particular period of time, a year or 18 months, should be given and the board empowered to use their discretion.  The only way it could be done would be for the Minister to consider it.  The drafting of this, I think, would be a very difficult job.  If the Minister is sincere, he could probably get an amendment drafted to do this in respect of cases that are now pending, but not extending it generally.  I agree with Senator Miss Pearse on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another amendment to Section 19 which I am prepared to accept, but as regards any new adoption legislation, it would take a great deal of consideration.  We had a great deal of consultation in connection with this Bill and I think it is better to adhere to what has been done.  I can assure Senators that we have given a great deal of consideration to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to know that the Minister is going to accept the amendment to Section 19. Although I raised this matter of Section 8 to be on the safe side, it struck me that if there was to be an amendment it would be by an extension of Section 19; but that is a detail.  There is no question of pressing; it is simply a question of considering whether there was a new point of sufficient importance for the Minister to consider. The Minister is not being pressed.  It struck me that the matter I raised was something which the Minister might be wise to look into.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 5, line 32, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;; and, at the end of the sub-section, to insert &ldquo;the Baptist Union of Ireland and the Brethren, commonly known as the Plymouth Brethren&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In moving the amendment, I wish to make it clear that I am proposing the addition of these two religious denominations for two reasons&mdash;because they have requested me to do so, and because they have assured me that they have received the written approval of authorised representatives of the four denominations already mentioned in the section, viz., the Church of Ireland, the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church and the Religious Society of Friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made it very clear in the debate on the Second Stage that he could only agree to the addition of other religious denominations to those named in the section if he was satisfied that the consent had been obtained of all those already named.  I accepted this position as a reasonable one under the circumstances.  I have had conversations with individuals belonging to some other religious denominations, who suggested that the denominations to which they belong should be <Col N="10" /> included in the section.  In each case I informed these persons of the Minister's statement, and told them that if they desired their denomination included in the Bill, steps would have to be taken to obtain the consent of the denominations already included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are some other denominations which I would be glad to see named in the section, but I am not proposing the addition of any others, because I have no evidence that denominations other than the two in the amendment took steps to obtain the necessary consent.  I would also like to make it clear that I raised this matter on my own responsibility as a member of this House, following representations which were made to me.</P>
    <P>Lest there should be any misunderstanding, I wish to say that I did not act as an intermediary on behalf of any religious denomination, nor did I seek to obtain consent on behalf of any denomination.  The Baptist Union of Ireland and the Brethren each approached the denominations named in the Bill, and each obtained the necessary consent.  I believe they have also placed that evidence before the Minister.  I, therefore, move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that this should be incorporated in the Bill.  I know it has the approval of the religious community to which I belong.  It is just unfortunate that we have to draw the line at a certain point.  Various bodies may complain they are not included, but they really have no ground for complaint.  The Minister has been very patient over this section, and it was discussed in the Press.  I think we have reached the point where we should draw the line under this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Stanford has put his finger on a point about which I was worried.  When you name anything or anybody in an Act of Parliament there is always the danger that you will exclude somebody else no matter how you try to bring him within the ambit of the Act.  I think there will always be somebody who will say: &ldquo;Why were we not brought in?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> I am not impressed by Senator Douglas's argument or the point which Senator Stanford made that people should not feel aggrieved unless they had made representations to be included.  These people will say that they should have been invited.  Once you start naming various religious denominations, you will, with the best intentions in the world, leave somebody out who will ask why they were not included.  It is no answer to say that they did not ask to be included.  They will say &ldquo;Why were we not included.&rdquo; The point I want to make is that once you start naming certain religious denominations and leaving out others, you leave yourself open to criticism subsequently when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Colgan would consult the Constitution of this country he will find that in the section on religious denominations certain denominations are named and others not.  I am sure very careful advice was taken in framing that Constitution.  I think it gives a sufficient precedent for naming some denominations and not naming others.</P>

      <P>I should like Senator Colgan also to know that, in some cases of denominations who have not been included, representative people were consulted and were made aware of the position, and they did not see their way to take steps.  I hope the Minister agreed with my statement&mdash;I think he did&mdash;because I was very anxious that it should be absolutely clear, in case there should be any reference to it again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 19 (5), page 7, lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is intended to provide that an application for a proper adoption order may be made within a period of two years from the date of the passing of the Act, instead of a period of only 12 months.  As the Bill stands, an application in respect of an existing adoption for the making by <Col N="13" /> the board of a proper adoption order would have to be brought within 12 months from the commencement of this Part of the Act.  It is the experience of a number of people that parties entitled to rights which must be exercised within a particular period very frequently forget the period, and I feel that 12 months is a little short and that parties should have the right to make an application to the board for an adoption order within two years.  I feel that it is a reasonable amendment and the Minister should let us have it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that the amendment would be unduly restrictive unless the Senator proposes to leave in the phrase &ldquo;or within such further period&rdquo;?  If that is left in, there is no real reason for extending the 12 months to two years.  The power to do that in certain cases is still there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I might ask, then, why the period of 12 months was put in the Bill, if the board have the power.  I dislike giving boards power to do things if they think they should do them.  We have many cases of courts and boards having authority to extend the time period if that court or board thinks it proper to do so.  In making the laws here, we should say what is our view, what is the view of the Legislature, and I suggest that if Senator Quirke is correct in what he says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It can hardly be a case of mistaken identity.  If what Senator Hearne says is correct, we should not have 12 months in the section at all.  It is we here who should determine the period within which things should be done and we should not leave it to boards to allow things to be done within such time as they may think reasonable.  Why should we ask them to lay down the law?  We are here to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this is a reasonable amendment.  Most of us have found that people overlook seeking to exercise <Col N="14" /> their rights within a particular time. The period of 12 months is too short and they should be given two years.  If they are given two years, they cannot complain that their rights were not properly safeguarded by us, and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all impressed, because the Senator is still leaving discretion to the board.  His amendment substitutes two years for 12 months, but it leaves in the phrase &ldquo;or within such further period as the board in any particular case may for reasonable cause allow.&rdquo;  They are still going to decide in three years, so that the whole basis of his argument goes by the board.</P>

We should give people the right to apply for the order without taking into consideration what the board might or might not do for at least two years.  After that the board may or may not give the permission&mdash;I do not mind, so long as we have given the applicant two years.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Reilly has made a weak case.  All he is interested in are people who forget and who do not do what they should do, but the very people who forget within 12 months will also forget within two years, and if we are to try to legislate for people who do not do what they should do, we will get nowhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any force in that argument.  The question is whether a period of 12 months is sufficient or should it be extended.  I was inclined to think that the period was sufficient, but I feel that no harm could be done by extending it to two years.  The only difference, in effect, will be that persons will have another year in which to send in a request and have it considered by the board as of right.  Otherwise, they would first have to request <Col N="15" /> the board to give them permission to make an appeal.  It is entirely a matter of machinery and is not of very great importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is not of very much importance, but I am surprised that the Senator thinks it worth while moving the amendment, because the provision &ldquo;within such further period as the board may in any particular case consider reasonable&rdquo; ought to cover it, but if he presses it, I will agree.  I think it better to leave it at 12 months and let the board decide in any particular case. It would be all wrong to tie them to a particular period when he says they should have discretion.  We cannot foresee all the cases that may arise. A particularly hard luck case may crop up and it would be very foolish not to give the board some discretion with regard to it.  I accept the Senator's two years, still leaving in the discretion.</P>

I do not want to stress the dangers of grave evils arising from such advertisements, but we all know that the possibility of such evils is very great.  The Bill&mdash;it is set out in Section 40&mdash;authorises only responsible bodies, public assistance authorities and adoption societies, to issue these advertisements.  These bodies are free to let the individual <Col N="18" /> who is desirous of adopting a child know and that is a far better method than to give the individual the right to publish advertisements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Order is to amend two Articles&mdash;9 and 13 of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1951, to rectify certain omissions from that Order.  The Order also includes provision to reassess the pensions of certain ex-members.  The details are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> Article 4 (a) of the Order amends Article 9 of the 1951 Pensions Order. When the latter Order was being framed, provision was made under Article 9 for the payment of extra gratuities, calculated at the rate of ½ per cent. of annual pay for each year of service prior to 29th December, 1951, to members of the force who retire and receive ordinary pensions. Provision was not made for the payment of this extra gratuity to members of the force who might be awarded special pensions, on retirement, by reason of injuries sustained in the course of their duty.  Provision is now being made for the payment of the extra gratuity to such members.</P>
    <P>Article 4 (b) of the Order amends Article 13 of the 1951 Pensions Order. The latter Order provided that, if a member of the force to whom a retirement gratuity had been paid served again, the amount of any retirement gratuity to which he later became entitled would be reduced by the amount of the gratuity previously paid to him.  No provision was, however, made in the case of a member who might die during his second period of service, for the deduction of the gratuity previously paid from any death gratuity to which the deceased member's legal personal representatives might become entitled.  This is now being done, and is necessary to prevent the payment of a gratuity twice in respect of the same period of service in the force.</P>
    <P>Article 5.  The Garda Síochána Pensions Act, 1947, permitted members of the force who retired from the force and who were allowed to rejoin, to count the period they were absent from the force as approved service for pension purposes, provided that a certificate was issued under Section 8 of the Act that their retirement had been due solely to political reasons.  They were not, however, permitted to receive increments of pay in respect of the periods they were absent.  Provision is now being made to reassess the pensions of any such members who may have retired before the 1st January, 1952, as though their annual pay, on retirement, had included increments of pay in respect of the periods they were absent from the force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> The general effect of the Order is to make improvements in the Garda Síochána pensions code, and no further comments are, I think, necessary.</P>

    <Title>Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, which was negotiated in 1948, to be implemented.  An earlier Convention, which was negotiated at an international conference held in 1929, was implemented here by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1933, and came into operation in 1934.  In 1948 a further conference was convened in London on the initiative of the British Government to consider the revision of the 1929 Convention and to bring it into conformity with modern safety requirements.</P>
      <P>The new Convention was signed by the delegates of 30 nations, including Ireland, and was expressed to come into force 12 months after 15 countries, including seven with not less than 1,000,000 gross tons of shipping, had conveyed their acceptance of it.  The necessary number of acceptances have now been secured, and the Convention will come into force on 19th November next.  It is proposed to accept the Convention on behalf of this country as soon as this legislation, which is necessary to implement it, has been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the present, all the International Conferences dealing with this question of safety of life at sea have been convened on the initiative of the British Government but that work will now presumably be transferred to the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation when that body is set up.  The Convention for the establishment of that organisation has already been accepted by this country. Throughout the progress of the departmental examination of the 1948 Safety Convention there was close <Col N="22" /> consultation with the shipping industry here in the matter of the new safety requirements.  Before the Irish delegation took part in the Conference, both shipping and labour interests were consulted and when the Convention was in final form, and before this Bill was prepared, the organisations representing both sides of the industry were consulted again.</P>
    <P>All points of difficulty were discussed and this is an agreed measure as far as the industry is concerned.  It will be appreciated that our aim, on the one hand, is to ensure that advantage should be taken of the modern aids of science and that &ldquo;safety first&rdquo; should be the guiding principle of the sea and, on the other hand, that the burdens imposed on the Irish shipping industry should not be too onerous.  In accepting the principles of the Safety Convention we are joining with the other maritime nations in maintaining adequate standards of safety.</P>
    <P>The 1948 Convention, like its predecessor, the 1929 Convention, applies only to passenger ships and to cargo ships of a certain size and then only when such ships are engaged in international voyages as defined in the Bill.  In some respects the powers sought in the present Bill go somewhat beyond those required to implement the 1948 Convention.  For example, the provisions of Sections 11 and 15 in relation to life-saving appliances and radio would enable, if orders were subsequently made, certain requirements of the Convention to be applied to cargo ships of less than 500 tons gross which do not come within the scope of the Convention.  I have, however, given an assurance to the interests concerned that before any rules are made which go beyond the strict requirements of the Convention either because they set up a higher standard than the Convention requires or because they apply Convention requirements to ships outside the scope of the Convention, there will be the fullest consultation with both sides of the shipping industry.</P>
    <P>I am anxious, however, that we should keep abreast with modern developments in the safety sphere and that the regulations which will be made will be as far-reaching as is consistent <Col N="23" /> with practical considerations of shipping space and cost of equipment.  It is in compliance with the recommendation of the Conference which prepared the Convention that we should endeavour to apply its principles as far as practicable to non-Convention ships.</P>
    <P>The Seanad will probably be satisfied if I deal with the provisions of the Convention which introduced major advances on the standards set up by the 1929 Convention.  Section 10 of the Bill provides for the making of construction rules, prescribing the requirements in respect of the hull, equipment and machinery of passenger steamers.  An important new provision in the Convention relates to structural fire protection in passenger ships and effect will be given to this requirement by regulations.  The requirements in regard to construction and also to life-saving appliances dealt with in Sections 10 and 11 of the Bill apply only to new ships, the keels of which are laid down on or after the date on which the Convention comes into opertion. We are required by the Convention, however, to consider the arrangements on existing ships which do not comply with the provisions of the new Convention.  In that respect this 1948 Convention follows the precedent set down in the 1929 Convention.</P>
    <P>In the 1929 Convention cargo ships came into the picture only in respect of the requirement to carry radiotelegraph apparatus.  The 1948 Convention goes further and for the first time includes regulations requiring the carriage of life saving and fire appliances on cargo ships of 500 tons and upwards and provides for the issue to cargo ships of safety equipment certificates covering appliances of that character.</P>
    <P>There will be a number of interesting features in the regulations to give effect to these provisions relating to life-saving appliances.  In future, lifeboats for all new ships must as a general rule be not less than 24 feet in length and have internal buoyancy.  If more than 60 persons are to be carried, motor lifeboats or boats fitted with approved means of mechanical propulsion must be provided.  Every passenger ship, <Col N="24" /> irrespective of tonnage, and every cargo ship of over 1,600 tons gross will be required to have at least one motor or other mechanically propelled lifeboat of approved type.  In large passenger ships, lifeboats permanently fitted with radio equipment must be carried.  On the smaller passenger ships, and on all cargo ships as well, there must be portable radio sets for use in the lifeboats.  One of the more important provisions which has been introduced is that in future all new ships of over 150 feet in length must be fitted with mechanical davits.  These davits must be sufficiently strong to enable lifeboats to be launched with their full complement of persons and equipment, even should the ship be listing as much as 15 degrees.  Powers to provide these provisions of the Convention are contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The major change in regard to radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony is that when the Convention comes into force all passenger ships and all cargo ships of 1,600 tons gross and upwards will have to keep continuous watch on the distress frequency either by means of qualified radio officers or, if no officer is listening, by means of the auto-alarm, an instrument which on receiving a distress signal will operate a system of alarm bells.  The Convention also extends the compulsory installation of radio to cover cargo ships between 500 and 1,600 tons gross. This latter requirement can be met by fitting either a radiotelephone or a radiotelegraph installation.</P>
    <P>Another important change is the requirement concerning the compulsory installation of direction-finding apparatus.  Under the earlier Convention, only passenger ships of 5,000 tons gross and upwards had to carry these direction-finders, but under the new Convention the requirement will be extended to all ships of 1,600 tons and upwards, passenger and cargo, when engaged on international voyages.  This is a major advance because a direction-finder is not only a valuable aid in fixing a ship's position, but can be used to guide a ship to a vessel or even to a lifeboat sending out a distress message.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with radio navigational aids, such as radar, other than <Col N="25" /> direction-finders.  The use of these radio aids on board ship is not made obligatory under the Convention, and it is not proposed to make such installations obligatory under the Bill.  The purpose of the Convention, and of the regulations which we will make under this Bill, when passed, will be to ensure that where radar or any other radio navigational aid is carried on board ship, such equipment should be fully efficient.</P>
    <P>Sections 20-31 relate to surveys and certificates and I think it will be sufficient if I explain in very general terms what precisely is involved.  The Convention applies to the ships of countries whose Governments have accepted the Safety Convention when the ships are engaged in international voyages.  The rules to be made under this Bill will apply to Irish ships on international voyages and in certain circumstances to coastal and other classes of ships.  Most of the rules will apply to foreign ships when in our ports.  Ships not on the Irish register may be required to produce certificates issued by the Governments of the countries in which they are registered. There are four main types of certificates, viz.:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Safety certificates which will be issued in respect of passenger ships on compliance with the requirements as to construction, life-saving appliances, radio and direction-finding equipment;</P>
    <P>(2)  Safety equipment certificates which will be issued in respect of cargo ships on compliance with the requirements as to life-saving appliances;</P>
    <P>(3)  Radio certificates which will be issued to cargo ships on compliance with the requirements as to radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony; and</P>
    <P>(4)  Exemption certificates which may be issued to either a passenger or cargo ship when they are exempted from full or partial compliance with any of the requirements.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this part of the Bill cover the issue of all the necessary certificates and ensure the recognition of corresponding certificates issued by other Convention countries.  Both the safety equipment certificates and the safety radio certificates are new types of certificates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> The fees to be charged for inspections made and certificates issued will be prescribed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The settlement of the fees for the various services will have regard to the need to recover to the Exchequer a reasonable proportion of the cost of the service rendered and will also have regard to the corresponding scale of charges in other countries with which our merchant shipping have to compete.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters covered in the Bill to which reference should be made.  Section 37, imposing an obligation on masters of Irish vessels to assist persons in distress at sea, replaces a similar provision in the 1933 Act but amends in two important respects, the existing obligation.  In the first place, it extends this obligation to cover aircraft in distress on the water; and secondly, the obligation to provide assistance on receipt of distress information from any source whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Section 38 relates to the carriage of dangerous goods.  The provisions of the 1929 Convention relating to dangerous goods applied to passenger steamers only.  Under the new Convention, regulations may be made setting out certain broad requirements relating to the carriage of dangerous goods in both passenger and cargo ships.  The Convention requires the Governments of accepting countries to supplement these provisions by rules providing in particular for the packing and stowage of such goods.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with the carriage of grain.  This is the first time that provisions governing the carriage of grain have been included in an International Safety Convention.  Provision is, however, already made in our legislation for the safe carriage of grain cargoes in Irish ships wherever they may load and for the safe carriage of grain cargoes on foreign ships loading or arriving at Irish ports.  The Bill proposes to repeal existing legislation relating to the carriage of grain and to replace it with new provisions set out in Section 39 in accordance with the requirements of the Convention.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that the <Col N="27" /> Bill gives fairly wide powers for the making of rules and regulations.  The Bill is, in fact, an enabling Bill.  I think that is unavoidable owing to the large body of technical detail involved which it would be impracticable to include in the Bill itself.  It is provided, however, that every order, rule and regulation which may be made must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled in the usual manner by a resolution there. Many of the rules to be made will, however, be little more than amendments of existing rules and, as I have already informed the Senate, these will be settled in consultation with the industry itself.  In cases where specific requirements are not laid down in the convention and there is a discretion, we will probably be guided to a large extent by the practice adopted in other neighbouring maritime countries.  In general, I think it can be said that the safety equipment carried on our ships is already of a high order and it is anticipated that no undue expense is likely to be incurred by any shipowners bringing their vessels into line with the new requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill of very great importance and I am surprised that some of our front bench Senators have not given us the benefit of their wisdom and eloquence on it. There seems to be a curious silence on it.  It is not the lowering or the increasing of tariffs or the equipping of bigger and better airfields that is in question, but human life is at stake. It is with some trepidation that I rise to open the debate when I expected only to intervene at the end of a long and serious discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two points I would like to raise, more in the form of queries, perhaps, than of suggestions. This is a difficult Bill for a layman, both on account of its technical nature and the fact that it is an amending Bill.  Will the Minister give us one or two assurances on important points? The first point concerns the provision for the inspection of lifeboats.  This, I take it, is covered under page 7 of the Bill, Section 11 (1) (q), &ldquo;the examination at intervals to be prescribed by the rules of any appliances <Col N="28" /> or equipment required by the rules to be carried.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My experience of cross-channel shipping and other shipping is that the lifeboats look almost like permanent fixtures.  At times, I see no signs of careful oiling or of recent handling of the equipment.  Perhaps my inexperienced eye has been deceived in the matter.  Would the Minister assure us that these lifeboats are raised and lowered and carefully tested at reasonably frequent intervals?</P>
    <P>I should also like to know who inspects those lifeboats and who is responsible for the inspection?  Are they men trained in the ways of the sea who know exactly what to look for, or who are they?  I presume that is covered under the original Bill but it is a matter of the very greatest importance to us who must still travel by sea and not by air as we are not very affluent people.  I hope the Minister can give me an assurance on that.</P>
    <P>Further, I would like to have an assurance that there are enough life-boats to take care of the normal complement of a ship.  There have been serious cases in the past where there simply had not been enough life-boats for the people on board.  Is that covered by law?  I would like an assurance on that.</P>
    <P>The experience of a friend of mine which he mentioned to-day causes me to ask another question.  He was on the <i>Innisfallen</i> when it sank in the Mersey in December, 1940.  It was found that only one or two boats could be lowered in the time at their disposal.  What saved the lives of almost all the people on board was the provision of rafts.  Is it carefully safeguarded in the Bill that there will be plenty of rafts in cases of emergency of this kind?  I should like some assurance from the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>A third point is the question of lifebelts. In the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> within the last few days there was an illuminating article on a new type of lifebelt&mdash;a great improvement on the rather flimsy canvas articles that have been provided in the past.  Is there a possibility that the use of these new rubber lifebelts will be enforced under this Act?  I will ask the Minister to keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> There is another point in regard to which I would crave the indulgence of the Chair to raise.  He might think it is not directly relevant, but it could, I think, be taken under Section 38.  I refer to the question of oil damage from ships going past our shores at present.  This is becoming a very serious menace, through the deposit of crude oil or what is called &ldquo;sludge&rdquo; on our shores.  Anyone who has visited the west or south coast in the last few years knows just how serious this is.  Beaches are spoiled and property is damaged.  Bird life is very seriously endangered, and fishing is, I think, harmed.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to an article in <i>The Times</i> recently, if he has not seen it already.  The article in question appeared in <i>The Times</i> dated the 23rd August, 1952.  It points out that certain county councils in England have become liable for very serious damages as a result of oil contamination on clothing on beaches under their control.  In many cases, they have had to put up warning notices disclaiming liability.  We have all seen the sad sight of seabirds lying dead on the shore, their wings clotted and rotted with oil, and it seems to me that something must be done to face this problem very soon.  I do not suppose it could be worked in under Section 38 of the Bill, as it does not exactly endanger human life, but the Minister has said that the Bill gives fairly wide powers.  Would it be possible in any way to deal with this oil menace under this Bill?  Probably not, I think, but could the Minister reassure us by saying that he has some legislation in mind to deal with this serious menace?  It is not simply a sentimental matter of the poor little birds suffering and that kind of thing; it is going to be a very serious source of damage to the State.  There are various expedients for stopping it, but it would not be right to go into details now.  I welcome the opportunity which you, Sir, have granted me of drawing attention to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, following Senator Stanford's remarks, that what struck me about the Bill was the very efficient way in which it seems <Col N="30" /> to be drawn up, so far as the safety precautions required are concerned.  At present, the public mind is very agitated by the disasters which have occurred on the railways in England. Thank goodness, we have not had any here, but there is a feeling that safety precautions have been very much relaxed in the past few years, especially since the war, and that the safety rules are not being observed. One of the most obvious things which seems to require attention on the railways in England is the question of timing.  Everything seems to be late; in other words, there seems to be terrific inefficiency.</P>
      <P>I could not help feeling, while the Minister was making his remarks, that a very great deal of trouble had apparently been gone to in preparing the Convention and I am very glad that we here are going to subscribe to it and ratify it.  I very much welcome the Bill and I support it fully, but I think Senator Stanford has put his hand on one important point, the matter of inspection.  I have not read the Bill fully, but it seems to me that there is not much use in making elaborate rules in respect of any sphere of activity&mdash;I am sure there is provision, but it is no harm to stress the point&mdash;unless we are going to see that they are carried out and Senator Stanford is quite right when he says that not only should proper provision be made for inspection but there should be the right kind of inspection. It should not be mere cursory inspection. We already have a very good record in Aer Lingus, where there must be a very fine system of inspection and where the safety precautions seem to be very well observed so far. I hope the same will be done in connection with this Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did intend to say something about the lifeboats, but Senator Stanford has already spoken on the point.  I have noticed, whenever I walked up and down the deck of the old mailboat, at any rate, that the ropes on the life-boats looked as if they had not been used for umpteen years, and if one of those boats were filled with passengers and put over the side, the ropes might easily break and cause disaster instead of avoiding it.  I welcome <Col N="31" /> these proposals as being a very efficient set of proposals.</P>

      <P>All sides of the House will welcome the Bill as one which proposes to give effect to an international agreement.  It is a Bill more for Committee Stage than for Second Reading, but we are all very pleased to hear from the Minister that, so far as life-saving precautions are concerned, our ships are as well equipped as most are, and the various sections which propose to go further in the matter aim at keeping abreast of the times. We should all congratulate the Minister on his decision to do so.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis na lochtaí a fuair an Seanadóir Stanford ar an scéal, is é an tuiscint a bhaineas as an mBille gur Bille fónta é agus gur Bille é a dheimhníos dúinn go bhfuil an Rialtas agus an tAire atá i mbun gnóthaí eolasach ar na nithe atá ag teastáil.  Molaimse cur an Bhille seo os ár gcóir.  Tá rian ann go raibh imní an scéil ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas agus is fónta an rud a thabhairt faoi ndeara ann go bhfuil an dlí a bhí ann cheana agus a bhaineann le mórloingeas le cur i bhfeidhm ar loingeas i bhfad níos lú agus ar beagnach an uile cineál loingis a théann thar cuanta na tíre seo amach.  Is eol dom dár ndóigh, go bhfuil soláthar déanta cheana féin maidir le loingeas na hÉireann chun go mbeadh na nithe sin, sábháil anamnacha na ndaoine agus compord na ndaoine, faoi chúram ceart, ach is é an rud fónta atá ann ná go bhfuil leathnú déanta ar na cumhachtaí a bhí ag an Rialtas cheana chun scrúdú agus léirmheastóireacht a dhéanamh ar loingeas.  Molaimse é sin agus is dóigh liom gur chóir dúinn bheith buíoch don Rialtas an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le ní nó dhó eile ba mhaith liom beagán a rá.  An Seanadóir Stanford, gearánann sé faoi ola a doirtear ar an bhfarraige agus a dhéanann dochar ana-mhór ar éanlaithe mara agus ar na cóstaí.  Ní thuigimse an bhfuil aon leigheas againn air sin.  Dár ndóigh, is mílte fada amach ar an bhfairrge mhóir a doirtear an ola sin agus is amhlaidh a thagann sé <Col N="32" /> isteach in aice leis an geósta.  Ní heol dom go bhfuil cumhacht ag aon duine doirteadh an ola sin a chosaint.  Níl fhios agam, taobh amuigh den teora trí mhíle ón gcósta, cionnas d'fhéadfaimís é a chosaint.  Rud eile dhe, measaimse gur de thoradh timpiste an doirteadh seo agus nach le toil chinnte nó toil uile nó díobhála ag aon duine é.  Is dóigh liom gur tubaist é agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon leigheas ag duine ar an scéal.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile ann gur mhaith liom, mar ba mhaith le Seanadóirí eile, go bhfuighimís beagán eolais ina thaobh. Is é sin ná: cad é an gléas scrúdúcháin, an gléas breithniúcháin, atá ann chun a thabhairt faoi ndeara ar lucht loingis na nithe atá sa Bhille agus na nithe is riachtanach leo a bheith le fáil ar a gcuid loingis?  Níl fhios agam an é Bord Cuain Bhaile Átha Cliath a dhéanfadh an tsuirbhé nó Bord Cuain na Gaillimhe a dhéanfadh é thiar i nGaillimh nó Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, a dhéanann a lán rudaí, a dhéanfadh é i leith loingis.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, ar mhaith liom eolas d'fháil ina thaobh: an bhfuil údarás againne scrúdú nó léirmheas a dhéanamh ar loingeas atá cláraithe i dtír eile seachas Éire?  Má thagann loingeas paisnéirí go Cuan Bhaile Átha Cliath, go Corcaigh nó go Ros Láir, an bhfuil údarás againn daoine a chur a bord le deimhniú dúinn féin i leith na rialacha maidir le sábháil agus compord an locht paisnéirí?  Má thagann bád trádála ón Fhrainnc nó ó Mheiriceá an bhfuil údarás againn dul ar bord na loinge agus locht d'fháil ar aon easnamh ar an ngléas sábhála, má tá a leithéid ann?</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom eolas d'fháil ar na nithe sin ach maidir leis an mBille molaim an Rialtas mar go ngabhann siad chucu féin údarás níos leithne ná an t-údarás a bhí acu le loingeas a bhreithniú agus a dheimhniú i dtaobh longa beaga trádála a thagann anseo le gual, le hearraí nó le haon last eile, go mbeidh soláthar déanta acu i gcóir sábháil na ndaoine atá ag déanamh slí bheatha mar fhoireann iontu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I am not quite sure of the significance of the use of the term &ldquo;steamer&rdquo; in the <Col N="33" /> title of the Bill, but the Bill is intended to apply to all merchant ships whether they are propelled by steam, electricity, atomic energy or any other power.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator Stanford will be reassured regarding the points raised by him if he re-reads Section 11.  Under Section 11 there is power taken to make regulations dealing with life-saving appliances and among the regulations which will be made will be those defined under paragraph (b) which relates to the number and description and the mode of construction of boats, life-rafts, life-jackets and life-buoys, and under paragraph (e) the quantity, quality and description of other buoyant apparatus to be carried in addition to boats, rafts and life-buoys, and under paragraph (n) which relates to the practice in ships of boat drills and fire drills.  In respect of most of these matters there are regulations in force at present.  The new regulations will carry on the provisions of the old but will supplement them in so far as modern technical development makes it possible and in so far as experience shows it to be necessary.</P>
      <P>The inspections are carried out by inspectors of the Department of Industry and Commerce and by ships' surveyors. They are very competent and highly-trained people.  The certificate of safety which is issued to a vessel in respect of its life-saving appliances operates for a period of 24 months only &mdash;that is a provision of Section 20&mdash;or for such shorter periods as may be prescribed, and it may be extended as a special concession only for one further month.  Within each two-year period, therefore, the ship has to be surveyed again in respect of the suitability of its life-saving appliances and get a new certificate that they are adequate and in proper order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of life-boats carried will also be prescribed in relation to the authorised maximum number of passengers which any vessel may carry.  The inspection of ships, both our own ships, whose safety certificates are issued here, and foreign ships which come into our ports, is carried out methodically and conscientiously.  In fact, quite recently an American ship which came into the port of Dublin, after suffering <Col N="34" /> some storm damage, was prevented by our officers from leaving because it had not the requisite minimum life-saving apparatus on board, and it was not permitted to go until that defect had been made good.</P>
    <P>The obligations we accept under the Convention are first to survey our own ships, to see that they conform with the requirements of the Convention, and certify them when they do; and second, to see that no foreign ships use our ports unless they comply with the requirements of the Convention in these respects.</P>
    <P>The matter of oil damage to our beaches is hardly relevant to the Bill, but as it was raised I would like to say something about it.  It is quite obvious that we can do nothing by legislation except control the discharge of oil sludge in our own territorial waters, ports and harbours, and harbour authorities have at the moment ample powers under existing legislation to prohibit the discharge of sludge in harbours, estuaries or rivers. The problem that has arisen, however, is not due to any breach of these harbour regulations.  The practice of oil tankers of washing out their tanks on their return journeys has created this problem, but experience seems to show that they do it as much as 50 miles out, and that the sludge comes ashore even when the washing is done as far away from land as that.</P>
    <P>I have communicated with all the shipping companies who use our ports, drawing their attention to this problem and urging them to co-operate in preventing any practice which would accentuate it, but it is recognised that it is a problem which can be settled, if at all, only by international action.  I think that some investigation carried out by the British authorities showed that sludge came ashore upon beaches even when the washing of the oil tanks was done in the middle of the Atlantic.  At any rate, investigations are proceeding on the part of the British authorities to find out how this sludge drifts on the water, and what measures could be taken to divert it from the shores of Europe.</P>
    <P>There is an international committee <Col N="35" /> considering the matter and we have offered to co-operate with that committee in any way we could in eliminating this problem which, as Senators know, is not merely one for this country&mdash;in fact it has been experienced far more acutely on the south coast of England than even on our own southern beaches. If there were anything we could do to stop it it would be done but it is so obviously a problem outside our control that the only steps we can take is to offer to co-operate fully and wholeheartedly in any international action that may be adopted.</P>
    <P>As was stated, the Bill is a hardy one that lends itself to debate here.  Once the principle is accepted there is not much more to do about it.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make Orders, rules and regulations from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the International Convention which we are accepting.  These rules and regulations will, of course, be the same or will be kept as close as possible to the rules and regulations made in other European countries.</P>
    <P>The form of the Bill is necessitated by the fact that changes in these rules and regulations are occasionally required and that it is better for an appropriate authority to make them, in consultation with the interests concerned, rather than have technical legislation here which few of us would pretend to understand and have it made subject to amendment from time to time as change is required.</P>
    <P>The form of the Bill is similar to that of the 1933 Bill and, I think, similar to the legislation being enacted in every country to give effect to this Convention.</P>

      <P>The control of imports of motor vehicles and assembled parts of vehicles designed for the carriage of passengers has been in operation here since 1934, but we have not had up to now similar restrictions upon the importation of vehicles and bodies of vehicles designed for the carriage of goods.  Some time ago the National Union of Vehicle Builders and the Coachbuilders' Association, representing both parties concerned in the production of commercial motor vehicles, represented to me that it was desirable that similar quantitive control of imports of commercial vehicles should be established as in the case of private cars.  They were concerned at the extent to which completely assembled commercial vehicles were being imported, even though they were subject to customs duty. While they claimed that motor vehicles of this character should be assembled here and the bodies for them constructed here, as cheaply or cheaper than elsewhere, there were such advantages in certain cases, particularly in the matter of expeditious delivery, that the tendency towards the importation of complete vehicles was growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two types of bodies used on these commercial vehicles&mdash;the pressed steel body which is similar in character to the body of a private saloon car and where only assembly work is involved here and the coach-built type which can be completely manufactured in this country. <Col N="37" /> Following receipt of the representations from these organisations, I consulted the Irish Motor Traders' Association.  I found that they supported the application which, they conceded, would result in considerable employment in the assembly trade as well as in the coach-building trade. Apart from any direct increase in employment in the motor works and coach-building yards, the operation of the quota Order should also expand the internal demand for various motor car parts including tyres, tubes, springs, bulbs, batteries, glass, paint and upholstery, all of which are manufactured here but which would come in already fitted to the completely assembled cars.  In view of the nature of the representations made and the fact that the representations were being supported by the body that might have been expected to oppose it if there were any substantial argument against the course recommended, the Government decided to make this quota Order.  Under the quota Order certain quotas have been established.  They are utilised entirely to enable the different firms engaged in motor assembly to bring in prototypes of new designs for reproduction here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>As the immediate past President of the Society of Irish Motor Traders, I want to endorse what the Minister has just said.  This little Bill removes an anomaly.  Since the assembly of motor vehicles in this country was started some years ago, many vehicles had to be assembled here to a greater degree than in the case of others.  Because of a loophole in the old arrangement, certain types of commercial vehicles came in here quite freely.  We did not adopt any dog-in-the-manger attitude about the matter but many vehicles, competitive in type with others that were being built or assembled in this country, were being imported when there was no need to do so other than that by quick importation they were able to get business whereas those people here who were complying with the spirit as well as the letter of the law were taking longer to build and assemble the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a highly technical matter and the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of it were argued <Col N="38" /> with the Minister himself.  After full investigation we feel that this is a desirable measure.</P>

      <P>The House will recollect that last year and early this year there was rather considerable depression in the woollen and worsted industry. Various measures were adopted in order to restore the position.  Steps were taken to restrict the importation of woollen and worsted cloths, the quota being reduced to a nominal size. It was found, however, that those measures were not effective because deliveries, in increasing quantities, of artificial woollens and worsted cloths made out of spun fibre yarns were coming into the country.  These cloths, while of very poor quality, were so low in price that they were interfering with the sales of genuine woollen and worsted cloths and appeared likely to continue to do so to an increasing degree in the future.  The position in that regard was, of course, intensified by the fact that the textile slump which affected us was world-wide in its effects and considerable quantities of these cloths were stored up in warehouses throughout the world, the owners of which were seeking an outlet for them anywhere they could get it and at almost any price.  We decided, therefore, to amend this quota Order No. 13 so as to bring within it woven piece-goods containing more than 85 per cent. of weight of spun artificial silk stable fibre exceeding eight ounces in weight per yard but excluding certain piece-goods of a kind which we desired to continue to import.  The necessity for the Order, therefore, was the fact that the importation of these spun rayon cloths manufactured to resemble woollen and worsted cloths was seriously militating against the recovery of trade in our woollen industry and <Col N="39" /> the urgent representations which were made that, if their unrestricted import was permitted to continue, the steps that we had already taken to restore the woollen and worsted industry to normal conditions would be nullified.</P>
      <P>At some stage the possibility of producing spun rayon fibre in this country will be considered, but it is a matter for the future.  The quota fixed under this Order for the present period, of 75,000 square yards, is believed to be ample to cover the requirements of this cloth for particular purposes&mdash;either for the manufacture of soft toys or of certain types of boots and shoes and also to meet certain industrial users of a rayon type fabric.  There is no desire, of course, to restrict the deliveries of these spun rayon cloths to anybody who requires them as a raw material in manufactures of that kind. It is only to prevent their importation when made to resemble woollen and worsted cloths to the detriment of our own woollen and worsted industry that restriction is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to woollen and worsted yarns is, I think, well known to the House. Because of the textile slump and the stock of woollen and woven fabrics in the country, the worsted spinning industry was badly hit.  No orders were being received by the worsted spinners and the spinning mills went on to short-time working.  We tried to remedy that situation by imposing a customs duty on imported yarn.  There was no customs duty in force, because normally the prices of worsted yarns used here are fully competitive with those of imported yarns.  The customs duty was not, however, effective enough.  Again, because of the textile slump in Great Britain and elsewhere, there was an accumulation of yarns already made there and occasional lots were being offered at prices so low that they could be imported here duty paid at less than the economic price of manufacture here. It was not so much that the volume of yarn so coming in was considerable, but the expectation amongst the people concerned here, that the slump might continue and that in a month or two months' time they might be able to purchase yarns at still lower prices, <Col N="41" /> stopped them from placing orders for those yarns with their own spinners. The purpose of this Order was to make it known to them that there was no advantage to be gained in not placing orders with our own spinners, that the import of yarn from abroad was going to be regulated in any case.</P>
      <P>There was another reason why it was necessary, in any event, to control the import of worsted yarns and to keep that control in force for some time. My predecessor, towards the end of 1950, in the light of the international situation at that time, had an approach made through the Industrial Development Authority to the principal firm of worsted spinners in the country and that firm was asked to carry a stock of wool tops substantially in excess of the maximum stock the firm would normally carry for trading purposes. The firm undertook to comply with that request and purchased a very substantial quantity of wool tops over and above their normal needs.  Unfortunately, the wool market broke shortly afterwards and the firm found themselves in quite considerable difficulties because of the stock of high-priced wool tops that they were holding.</P>
      <P>They approached me in regard to it and an arrangement was made under which I undertook to facilitate them in liquidating this stock of high-priced tops over a period of time&mdash;two, three or four years.  That involved the inevitability of worsted yarns being somewhat higher in price here during that period than they would have been if the wool tops had been purchased at the bottom of the market instead of at the top.  The situation is not completely satisfactory, but I cannot see any other way out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to prevent it having any adverse effect upon the development of an export trade in worsted fabrics or hosiery goods, an arrangement was made by which yarns would be supplied to firms doing an export business, to the extent that they were doing such business, at the world price.  The situation has not passed yet.  It is true that the volume of orders for worsted yarns is such that the manufacturers delivery date is getting further and <Col N="42" /> further behind.  We have had to consider increasing the quota under this Order.  The recovery of trade has been quite definite and real.  The full effect of the losses taken on these emergency stocks has not yet been worked off however so that for some time there will be for worsted yarns used for the home market a higher price than would operate if the tops for the making of these yarns were purchased now.  That is rather complicated but I have tried to make it clear.</P>
    <P>The future of wool prices is so uncertain that nobody could attempt to forecast it.  Any recovery in raw wool such as appears to have taken place lessens this problem of ours and brings nearer the date at which the yarns produced by our spinners will once again be at the world price.  That time will come in any event.  But the situation is one which prevents us getting the full effect of the fall in wool prices in our worsted yarn prices for the time being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware of the fact that many hosiery manufacturers just cannot get yarns due to the fact that the firm which is supposed to have had an excessive quantity of tops has no tops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it had excess tops.  The firm had this emergency stock.  That is gone but the losses are still there.  I am not saying that the actual tops are still in use. They were taken into use at a lower cost than would have had to be charged if the original cost was recovered.  It is to the liquidation of the loss involved I was referring not to the actual physical stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give friendly thought to an application from hosiery manufacturers who are not at the moment in a position to get their supplies from the spinners of tops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done that.  We have made a new quota to cover the period up to the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt whether the quota is sufficient to cover their <Col N="43" /> requirements.  There is another point I should like to raise.  The prohibition of the importation of yarn had a most extraordinary repercussion upon certain hosiery firms here who had tried to find an export market.  The Minister was quite right in what he said up to a certain point, that if a firm had an export market they were to get supplies from their Irish suppliers at the existing external price.  That did not happen.</P>
      <P>In confidence, I can give information in respect of a very reputable firm which lost an export order as a result of this quota.  They had bought wool at 13/6 as against 20/6 a lb. for the same yarn from their Irish suppliers.  I know it is not the Minister's policy to stop the development of the export market. I think it would be worth while investigating and finding out why there should be such a big difference between the price of the yarn of the top spinners here and the price of the yarn on the external market.</P>
      <P>In another connection, retailers are experiencing difficulty.  There are certain types of yarn and wool which our machines are not capable of spinning. It seems to be an infliction on the public that they should be prevented from having that kind of wool if we are not manufacturing it here or providing a suitable substitute.</P>
      <P>There ought to be exceptions made to the Order in connection with these types of wool which are not available on the home market.  Very often we shout about the high prices by manufacturers, but the difference between hosiery prices and what they could be is due to a great extent to the fact that most of our hosiery manufacturers had to buy their yarns from the top spinners at their own prices.  They had no alternative.  I fully appreciate that spinners are essential to our country and I think they need every help and protection.  Whilst we are doing that, I think the Minister might make it clear to the country that if hosiery prices are comparatively dearer than they should be it is due to the fact that we had to pay a higher price for our raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> This matter of wool is very important to us.  Both types of manufacturers are members of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, but in this instance I am only putting up the case as it affects the hosiery manufacturer.</P>
    <P>As far as labour content goes, the hosiery people give a far greater labour content than the top spinners. Any action taken against the top spinners should not be allowed to react on the hosiery manufacturer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear Senator O'Donnell quoting cases. I was going to speak about what I thought was a fault in the quota system.  Senator O'Donnell has given the actual cases.  He is a member of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers. I have been very closely associated with distribution.  We are all very suspect in this matter but that should not be.</P>
      <P>I feel that the quota system is of its nature very rigid.  Once a quota is instituted the Department seems to have to deal with it in a purely rigid way.  That is to say, everybody has to be lined up in the same box whereas business is not just like that.  Some man might have a case for a very big quota while another man might not have a case for a quota at all.</P>
      <P>There are cases where makers-up are not able to get the quality of wool they require for their machines.  Even when a special case is made, the quota is given in a very parsimonious way.  The feeling seems to be that if a case is made for 3,000 or 4,000 lb. of wool, 1,500 is given.  I feel there should be a proper assessment made of the requirements of a particular firm and if they really want 4,000 lb. of wool they should get it provided the case is properly made and gone into.  In my experience, nobody is ever given the quota they ask for whether he has a genuine case or not.  That has been my experience ever since quotas were instituted.  Business is so full of trouble nowadays that what I would like to see is freer examination of these things and some more freedom in the giving of quotas, where there is a genuine case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the interests of Irish manufacturers themselves, because one of the faults of the quota is that very <Col N="45" /> often it closes the market completely. The Minister mentioned that exceptions were made in cases where they were needed for other industries, but I notice that, whether designedly or not, he left out the distributor.  The distributor very often finds, if he is confined completely to goods produced here, that he loses in the matter of variety. In a small country like Ireland, every distributor has more or less the same people coming into his shop day after day.  If they see the same Irish goods, no matter how good they are, on show, without anything to change the pattern or the picture, they cease coming in and trade drops off.  We had that clearly shown in regard to woollen piece goods.  Everybody knows that at the moment, although there is a heavy quota and practically none are allowed in, sales are at the very lowest ebb and show no sign, or very little sign, of improving.  I feel with regard to woollen piece goods that if more goods were allowed to come in, of a carefully chosen variety&mdash;and that proviso with regard to variety could be enforced&mdash; the trade in woollen piece goods would improve considerably, which would be to the benefit of our own manufacturers. I feel that quotas can be overdone because they can close a market and stifle the market inside as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the warning about fools rushing in where angels fear to tread might apply to me in rising to speak on this matter, but it strikes me that Senator O'Donnell speaks from the point of view of the manufacturers and Senator McGuire from the point of view of the retailers. What I should like to hear from the Minister is an indication as to when this country's requirements in woollen and worsted yarns can be met without importation and when there will be more competition in the trade so as to ensure that there will be no fictitious pricing of these yarns.  The Minister indicated that a particular firm had a very big stock of wool tops which might be regarded as stockpiling and apparently that position was brought about by his predecessor's arrangement to accumulate a quantity of this raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, when the bottom fell out <Col N="46" /> of the wool market and when rock-bottom, so far as prices were concerned, was reached, around June of 1951, the price of woollen goods did not come down.  When wool prices began to soar on the Australian market, even though the goods being manufactured in this country were not being manufactured from yarns made from the wool which was going up in price, the manufacturers here increased their prices in sympathy with the rise in price of the raw wool on the world market.  That possibly could be regarded as an effort to cushion themselves against the impact of the higher price of the wool which they will buy in the future and an insurance against loss should prices tumble, but the fact was that, when woollen goods were increased as the price of wool increased, the increase was in almost a direct proportion, but when the bottom fell out of the market, the manufacturers here did not reduce their prices in the same proportion.</P>
    <P>That suggests that there is not enough competition in the industry and I am sure a couple of firms in this country could more or less arrange a fixation of prices in that regard.  There is the safeguard that restriction and a certain amount of importation would balance it out, but the real solution and the best solution is to have more competition in the trade.  I suppose that that is mere wishful thinking, but it would obviate the difficulties to which Senator O'Donnell referred and ensure that the consumer would be able to buy at somewhat lower prices.  I should like to hear from the Minister if he can give any indication as to when something in that line may be expected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing has given me more difficulty during this past year than the problem of worsted yarn production. I found that this stock of wool tops had been purchased on a specific request from the Government and with an assurance that if any difficulty was occasioned to the firm concerned by reason of their compliance with the Government's request, they would be helped out.  I felt that the obligation was on me to redeem that undertaking and to help the firm out.  The position <Col N="47" /> was not made any easier, as the House will appreciate, by the fact that the request to carry this emergency stock of wool tops was directed to one firm, whereas there are other firms in the country manufacturing worsted yarns which were not embarrassed in that way.  There was no easy solution and there is not a solution yet, nor will there be a completely happy situation until the losses resulting from the importation of that emergency stock have been liquidated and then I am confident that our worsted manufacturers will be again producing yarn, as they were before, as good and as cheap as any that can be imported.</P>
      <P>It is true that for the time being our hosiery manufacturers selling in the internal market have to pay more for their yarn than the price at which they could now import it&mdash;not a great deal more but enough to make some difference in the price level here.  The effect of that situation has been offset to some extent by the rise in wool prices internationally since.  A quota Order would not have been thought necessary at all in normal circumstances.  There was manufacturing capacity for worsted yarn in this country adequate to our requirements and thoroughly efficient. There was no need for protection of this kind and there would not have been but for the abnormal situation which arose.</P>
      <P>The Order had necessarily to apply to all yarns of wool or hair as there was no means by which the Revenue Commissioners could distinguish between one type of yarn and another but it was recognised that there are certain types of yarn not manufactured here which are required for certain purposes and a quota was fixed to permit of the importation of quantities of these types of yarn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main problem was not to impede our export trade.  We had developed a fairly considerable export trade in worsted cloth and hosiery goods and there looked to me to be considerable possibilities in that field.  An arrangement was made with the yarn manufacturers that they would supply cloth against evidence of export at the price quoted in British trade journals as <Col N="48" /> the ruling price for worsted yarns.  It was appreciated that quantities of yarn would be on offer in Britain at less than the standard market price but there seemed no way in which that could be countered.  Any firm here could easily get a quotation for yarn at less than the standard quoted price in Great Britain if that were all the evidence needed to get an import licence and, therefore, the only safe basis on which to work was that of the quoted prices in the British trade journals.  Where there were special circumstances justifying the importation of yarn for an export business the necessary licences were given.</P>
    <P>The special circumstances I have in mind were those of a firm which sent patterns of its products abroad, patterns made out of imported yarn, and had secured orders on the basis of those patterns and wished to supply goods conforming in every way with the patterns.  These firms were facilitated in importing the necessary quantities of yarns used in the production of the patterns.  It would have been bad business to put them in a position where they were forced to supply against those orders goods different in any way from the patterns on the basis of which the orders had been received.</P>
    <P>There have been frequent discussions between all the interests concerned, the worsted manufacturers, hosiery manufacturers, yarn producers and certain commercial export firms that are not themselves manufacturers, and an endeavour has been made to get an arrangement in this matter by agreement.  We have got, I think, 99 per cent. agreement for the measures we have taken and where there was any divergence of view it was because of some individual whose case was so special that you just could not make a regulation of general application to cover it and even in these cases some special steps have been taken where possible to ease the problem created for them.</P>
    <P>I do not want, however, any misunderstanding to arise regarding prices, the matter to which Senator O'Reilly referred.  I do not think it is true that our worsted and hosiery manufacturers increased their prices here in sympathy <Col N="49" /> with the world prices of wool when it was going up to its peak.  All the evidence is to the contrary.  If they did not reduce their prices when the world wool market slumped it is because most of them were closed down at the time. The goods then being sold in the shops of this country were goods which had been either manufactured or imported a considerable time before that when prices were higher, but there has been, I think, as anybody familiar with the trade will agree, a quite noticeable fall in the price of most woollen products during the course of the year.  I do not want to forecast that that fall will continue. The probable indications appear to be to the contrary.  I do not think that any of our worsted or hosiery manufacturers are going to be open to the accusation in this year of having made too much profit.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one question arising out of this speech.  Could he give any indication as to the period during which it would be necessary to keep this Order in being so that the losses will be recouped.  When might we hope to come back to normal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most difficult question to answer.  If I could be assured that wool prices were going to remain stable during the next four or five years I would naturally be disposed to spread the recovery of the loss over the longest possible period so as to get the least impact upon current prices, but if, as seems to be likely, there is a recovery in wool prices the period will be much shorter because the nearer the prices of wool get now to what they were when these tops were purchased the less the loss will be.</P>

They were intended to be used solely for classes of yarns which are not made here and if any importer used it to import a type of yarn which is so manufactured he has no grievance if he finds himself without the special varieties.</P>

      <P>I spoke in public some time ago about the position of our cotton industry.  It has developed tenfold during the past 20 years but there is still very considerable scope for further development.  It is only since 1946 that production of cotton yarn has been undertaken although there are now four firms in the business.  It is desired to encourage in every way the production of cotton products from raw cotton rather than from imported cotton yarn and for that reason this quota Order was made.  The market for cotton yarn will, of course, increase as the cotton-weaving industry expands up to the point to which we think it is practical to go and consequently there will be, we hope, further extension of the cotton spinning end of the business also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of yarn produced here according to everybody in the trade is very satisfactory and the prices at which it is being sold are in line with <Col N="51" /> British prices.  The only disadvantage to our yarn spinners as compared with British yarn spinners is that the arrangements now in operation in Great Britain, since the raw cotton market was more or less nationalised by the British Government, permit of yarn spinners drawing their supplies of cotton on a day to day basis while our yarn spinners have to buy three months or six months ahead and carry a stock of that dimension.  Our spinners have an advantage when the price is going up because they will always have bought ahead and have cotton stocks at less than the current prices whereas the yarn spinners in Britain buying on a day to day basis are at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it is clear that our spinners are at a disadvantage when prices are going down.  They will have the higher priced stock bought ahead whereas the British spinners are getting current prices on day-to-day deliveries.  It is because of the uncertainty which that position creates for our spinners that it was thought necessary to control the import of cotton yarns by quota order. A customs duty would not be nearly as effective nor as desirable an arrangement. It was thought possible, by this quantitative control, to maintain the position by which, over any reasonable period, our cotton yarns would be produced here at prices similar to those prevailing in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>There is, in fact, some reason for saying that our yarn spinners would, on occasion, have a slight advantage over British spinners and would be able to produce cheaper.  Certainly, the new mills which have been established&mdash;the plant at Athlone which was the first, the new plant at Ardee, the Boyne plant and the very efficient mill which I had the honour of opening officially a fortnight ago&mdash;are as efficiently equipped with the most modern machinery as any plant in the world and, assuming that they can buy raw cotton on a competitive basis, can produce yarn here as cheaply as elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The same position arises here as in the case of the woollen and worsted yarn.  Again, the secondary <Col N="52" /> users here have been affected to a great extent by the creation of these new factories to which I wish every success and towards which there is no hostility whatsoever on the part of the secondary users.</P>
      <P>Cotton yarn is about the most delicate yarn that one could touch from the financial point of view.  It varies from day to day in keen markets by eighths of a penny a lb. and needs to be very carefully watched from the point of view of prices.  I think it can be said that it is used in nearly every article of clothing which we wear nowadays. The four mills mentioned by the Minister are very new, and, I am told, are excellently equipped and built.  I am also told that they will in time be able to compete more than successfully with outside competition.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, I again make a plea for the secondary producer.  I have in mind the manufacturers of interlock and other cotton piece-goods in the underwear industry.  We have in this country factories which are certainly as efficient as any in Europe producing interlock underwear.  These factories would seriously be affected by any drastic curtailment of supplies of the counts of cotton which they require.  I am not quite sure that any of the mills here are fully equipped to deal with certain counts that are required.  The new mill in County Cork which was formally opened by the Minister a fortnight ago will in time possibly be able to cater for such yarns but my plea is on behalf of the secondary producers who, in the meantime, may be restricted.  I hope the Minister will ensure that they will not be held up until substitute supplies are made available from Irish sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to emphasise that there is no ill-will whatsoever on the part of the secondary producer towards the primary producer.  The secondary producer is the ultimate consumer of the Irish spun yarn and is anxious to cooperate with his home supplier but I would stress that the secondary producer is going through great difficulty at present because of the new quota.  I am aware that the Minister was good enough to increase the original quota <Col N="53" /> by 50 per cent. in order to give them a chance to carry on their business.  In nearly all cases, secondary producers give a much higher quota of employment than primary producers.  It is obvious, therefore, that if secondary producers are hit, the labour which they employ will be adversely affected. It might have the effect that 1,000 female workers would lose their employment just for the purpose of creating employment for 50 men.  I am not saying that that will happen but it could happen.  I trust, indeed, that the Minister will ensure that secondary industries will not suffer ill-effects as a result of this quota.</P>
    <P>I understand that the 1938 and 1948 Trade Agreements with Great Britain are being reviewed.  I hope that the matter of dual pricing in so far as it effects raw cotton will be kept under observation.  The Minister talked about the rayon quota.  I think that rayon is beginning to be worn much more so than cotton and that it is gaining in popularity.  Irish manufacturers are suffering a great disadvantage because they have to pay a higher rate per pound for rayon yarn which they import than their competitors across the water pay to their home suppliers. I understand that that matter was not covered by the 1938 and 1948 Trade Agreement.</P>

      <P>I think it is true to say that the development of rayon weaving and of the hosiery trade has almost reached a point where the manufacture of rayon yarn in this country seems to be practicable.</P>

      <P>We have been exploring various possibilities in that regard. <Col N="54" /> As the House is aware, this is rather a difficult time in which to arouse interest in the prospect because most of the firms abroad have taken a fairly bad beating during the slump.  I hope that some progress will be made in that direction in the near future.  I am very conscious of the fact that in calculating the size of the market for single cotton yarn we are, to a large extent, guessing. Because of that, we fixed a very short first quota period.  We have worked on three-monthly periods since this Order was made.  We did that in order to achieve maximum flexibility so that if we found that the quotas were inadequate they could be adjusted.  Fairly liberal quotas were made on the basis of 750,000 lbs. per three months.  We think that the quotas represent about half our present user of single cotton yarn.</P>
      <P>It is true that the position is different in regard to different types of yarn. Most of the existing mills are doing the coarser yarns&mdash;the lower counts. They are only now venturing into the manufacture of finer yarns.  Consequently, these quotas are intended to be available to the hosiery manufacturers who are the principal users of the finer yarns.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be taken as complaining about civil servants, but may I ask the Minister to ensure that where applications have been made for licences they will receive prompt attention?  I have heard that it takes a very long time to get the licences and that, in the meantime, the industries are held up for supplies.</P>
