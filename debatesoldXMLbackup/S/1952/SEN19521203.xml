      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of this Bill will be found in Section 3, which is designed to remove doubts in regard to the application of Part IV of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act of 1938 and to extend its scope in order that certain former Ministers of the First Dáil Eireann, or their widows, may be eligible to receive pensions.  As well as this, Section 4 of the Bill, as amended in the Committee Stage in the Dáil, will have the effect of rendering eligible for pension widows of persons who have held, during any period since 1919, ministerial or secretarial office for a period of less than three years and who have hitherto for this reason been ineligble for widows' pensions under the terms of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1938 was enacted following the report, dated 24th November, 1937, of a committee of inquiry into ministerial and other salaries which had been appointed in 1937.  This committee recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that Ministers of State should be made eligible to receive pensions and that <Col N="58" /> service as Minister prior to 6th December, 1922, whether under Dáil Eireann or under the Provisional Government, should be reckonable for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>When the Act was passed and its application came to be considered with a view to determining eligibility for pensions, a doubt arose as to whether the office of Director under the First Dáil could be a ministerial office only if it was an office as member of the Cabinet or the office of Chairman. There was a provision in Section 18 of the Act for the reference of any questions arising as to the holding of ministerial office before 6th December, 1922, to a committee consisting of the Taoiseach, or some person nominated by him, the Leader of the second Party or some person nominated by him, and the Chairman of Dáil Éireann or some person nominated by him.  An application did come before that committee in respect of services as Directors, but no record exists of a report by the committee, and I am making bold to presume that the reason why no report was submitted was because the committee felt quite clearly while it was the spirit and intention of the Act that the office of Director should be covered, the letter of the law, on the other hand, forbade them to make a report to that effect.</P>
    <P>None the less, the fact remains that no report exists, and however inconsistent it may be, I, who have had most intimate association with the drafting and submission of the 1938 Act to the Oireachtas, am not satisfied that ineligibility for pension could have been established beyond doubt.  That a Director should be eligible for a pension was clearly in the mind of the Government of the day.  It was, in fact, mentioned by me in this House that the office of Director, being a ministerial head of a Department under the First Dáil, and existing from 2nd April, 1919, to 26th August, 1921, would be covered by the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the records in my Department why the service of the Director was intended to be covered by the 1938 Act.  Dáil Éireann has agreed with the Government that it would be invidious to exclude such service and, accordingly, provision for the <Col N="59" /> removal of the doubts which have existed, and the correction of the really anomalous position hitherto prevailing, is included in Section 3 of this Bill.  If the Cabinet of the First Dáil had been constituted on the basis which now exists, whereby all Ministers, members of the Cabinet, receive pensions, this difficulty would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 2 to enable any period between the nomination of the person in ministerial office and the ratification of such an office by the Dáil to be regarded as pensionable service.  In normal times there would be little or no interval between the nomination of such persons and the submission of their names to the Dáil for ratification, but in the circumstances such as existed from 1919 to 1922, it was not possible to hold a meeting of the First Dáil, and in some cases the Minister was placed in charge of a Department several months before the meeting took place at which ratification of appointment could be sought.  During this interval, however, those Ministers were exposed to all the risks associated with their office.</P>
    <P>Once again, on the strict interpretation of the legal position and the Article of the Constitution of the First Dáil, these Ministers could not be regarded as having held ministerial office for a pensionable period within the meaning of the Act, and in order to render this service reckonable, Section 2 has been drafted.</P>
    <P>The 1938 Act provided that a minimum of three years' service should be required to qualify for pensions in respect of ministerial office, service prior to the Truce of 11th July, 1921, being reckoned in double measure for this purpose.  The amending Act of 1949, however, provided that if a Minister died in office, a pension might be awarded to his widow, even if he had not completed three years' service.  We think that that principle&mdash;and Dáil Éireann has agreed with the Government in this matter&mdash;should be further extended, and provision is being made in this Bill to enable a pension to be awarded to the widow of a person who held qualifying office at any period, but who did not die in office, even <Col N="60" /> though such person's service might not have amounted to three years.</P>
    <P>I think the justification for this course will be patent to all members of the Seanad.  As we know, when a person accepts ministerial office, or as, in some cases, has ministerial office thrust upon him, he has naturally to make a break with his former career. If he is a director of public companies or even of private companies, he has to resign his directorships.  If he has been carrying on a business, the probabilities are that his business, lacking his own personal attention and direction, will suffer very severely, and therefore persons who accept ministerial and parliamentary offices are subject to disabilities and disadvantages which very often are visited, as we know from personal experience, upon their wives and children and, after their death, upon their widows. The provision which the Government proposes to make in this Bill is, I think, of the most modest that would be justifiable.  We merely make provision to ensure that, when a person who has held a ministerial or parliamentary office dies, his widow will be safeguarded against extreme penury, and that is the justification for the course we are taking under Section 4. I commend the Bill to the Seanad and I should very greatly appreciate it if the Seanad would be good enough to let me have all stages this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable Bill.  Its main purpose is to see that certain people who served under the First Dáil, that is, more than 30 years ago, will be deemed to be eligible under the Act of 1938.  In the case of the First Dáil, it was not possible, of course, to be as specific or legally correct as we can now be, seeing that we now have an Attorney-General's department, a draftsman's office and a regular meeting-place for the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  In 1919, 1920 and 1921, there were no such arrangements.  The Dáil itself, as the Minister has pointed out, was not able to meet regularly and neither was the staff able to work in an uninterrupted fashion, and I think that &ldquo;uninterrupted&rdquo; is a very mild way to put it. It is therefore unreasonable to insist <Col N="61" /> on the niceties of legal language in applying an Act of the Oireachtas to people of that particular period.  The Dáil Government, in effect, was an underground Government, leading what would have been called in recent times a resistance movement.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the committee the Minister mentions which was set up after the 1938 Act and on which there was a representative of the Taoiseach.  I was the representative of Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, and I remember that we did agree upon certain things and had no difficulty whatever about them, but no further meetings of the committee were summoned and&mdash;it shows how these things slip from one's mind&mdash;I cannot remember whether we did or did not consider the question of the Directors; but whether we did or not, I am in entire agreement with the Minister now that the word &ldquo;Director&rdquo; as used in 1919, 1920 and 1921 was equivalent to the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and that it should be so ruled.  The circumstances were quite unusual.  The period was a long time ago, more than 30 years; the people concerned who will benefit are all of advanced years; and the Bill, therefore, is one to which no objections can possibly be taken.  So far as I am concerned, I see no objection to giving all stages to the Minister this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word or two in appreciation of the Minister's action in introducing this measure.  When we look back at the people who served the country in these difficult times, I feel that it is a question of paying a debt of honour to men who had to take grave risks to keep things going and to safeguard the position so that we now benefit by their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I read in the Dáil that a suggestion was made with regard to something in the nature of retrospective payment.  The Minister could not agree with that suggestion, but I should like to suggest that if there are any people, and particularly widows, who are in poor circumstances, who, by reason of the delay in giving recognition to them over the years find themselves in a position of extreme penury, some consideration ought to <Col N="62" /> be given to them, in recognition of the services rendered by those who were dear to them and who have now gone. I do not know what people are involved or how many people are involved, but if there are extreme cases of hardship, some provision might be made in the way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill because I know that people who now qualify under it have, for many years, lived in very distressing circumstances by reason of the fact that the previous Bill did not cover their cases.  I want to put two queries to the Minister Could he estimate the number of people affected by the Bill and could he give us an indication of what the pensions involved will cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Bill.  Those of us who can go back to the period before the establishment of the State, as we know it now, and who knew many of the people involved, as I did, know the extent of the absolutely unselfish service, without any conceivable thought of gain, and without any conceivable thought of gain even if they succeeded, that was given.  That is something which younger people nowadays, when so many people are after jobs and looking for this, that and the other, do not realise&mdash;the extent of the unselfish spirit which was practically universal at that time.</P>
      <P>The only criticism I have of the Bill, if it is a criticism at all is that I have on many occasions felt&mdash;I would not mind what Party was in power&mdash;that there should be some type of civil list by which persons who are relatives of persons who served during that period and who are in needy circumstances could be dealt with, as Senator Colgan said, on the basis of an honourable debt, without having to bring in a Bill.  It is something which we rather lack here.  The amount of money involved would be relatively small and we would all have sufficient confidence in each other, in spite of Party differences, to know that a civil list of that kind would be administered wisely and properly.  I wish it were possible to bring it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> As I say, I am positive that the amount of money involved would be small.  I am sure the Minister has done everything he can to deal with every case he knows of, but it would not surprise me if, in the next year, some other case turned up in respect of which everyone would agree there was a national obligation but which might not come under the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a case which does not come under the Bill and which, so far as I know, does not come under any other Bill.  It is the case of the widow of a man who gave great service to the country in the early part of the century, William O'Brien, who, everyone will agree, gave great service to the country.  I understand that his widow is living in poor circumstances in another country. I assume that it could not be done under this Bill, but I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the desirability of doing something to help that lady in her distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with the sentiments expressed by the Minister and by the Senators who have spoken on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Colgan, this question of trying to make some compensation for the very belated acknowledgment which the widows of some persons will receive under this Bill was raised in the other House, and I gave it my most sympathetic consideration.  I gave it my most sympathetic consideration, but I had to come to the conclusion that I would not be justified in violating what is established practice in regard to superannuation Bills, viz., that it is highly undesirable that retrospective effect should be given to them.  In one particular case, of course, while it is true that the person did not enjoy the benefits of the 1938 Act, I believe now that, in fact, provision was made not merely by the present Government, but by their predecessors and that employment had been provided for such person.  It is one of the principles regulating the grant and payment of ministerial pensions that, <Col N="64" /> where other provision or employment is provided and where moneys are paid out of funds under the control of the Government, the ministerial pension will be abated by a corresponding amount so that, in effect, the person who suffered most perhaps by reason of the framing of the 1938 Act has received what may be described as a compensating benefit through the administrative action of the Government of that day and succeeding Governments since.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator O'Donnell I cannot say precisely how many people will come under the Act.  I do not think they can be more than seven or eight at the most but at any rate the total cost is not likely to exceed more than £2,800.</P>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the suggestion that has been made by Senator Douglas that there is urgent need to establish the principle of a civil list in this country and I think my views on that matter are well known.  But if we are going to do it it would have to be done as a non-Party measure and perhaps at the spontaneous wish of all Parties in the House rather than at the instance of the Government.  We do know that there have been various suggestions for a civil list made from time to time and it is not an easy matter to determine how the matter was going to be finally resolved.  It might be that the best way to tackle the subject would be if some members of the House were to move that a committee to consider this question be set up and speaking for myself I think I could say that such a move would receive the sympathetic consideration of the Government.  It would enable us to deal with the case of the lady who has been referred to by Senator O'Callaghan and the case of another lady Mrs. Diarmuid Lynch and there are I am sure a considerable number of names which would occur to us in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many indeed who rendered signal and significant services to the country prior even to 1916 and even until 1930 and who for one reason or another have not been able to secure any recognition within the necessarily narrow limits of Acts of Parliament. <Col N="65" /> Such cases may only be dealt with under the broader and freer way in which a representative committee might administer such funds as would be provided for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I would hope that following the mention of the matter here in the Seanad some definite action will be taken to establish that machinery.  It is something in which this State is lacking very seriously.  Moreover, it is not merely persons who have figured in our public life who should be looked after.  There are people who have rendered great service to this nation in the arts and sciences, and so on, who have been equally overlooked, and it is not to our credit that that position should continue to obtain.</P>

      <P>As Senators know, under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, Orders made in relation to increasing or decreasing duties on imported goods have to be confirmed by subsequent legislation. This Bill is to confirm 22 Orders that were made under the 1932 Act.  The Bill relates to 22 Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, and the commodities covered by these Orders are as follows: razor blades, drinking glasses, crystal glassware, knitted woollen fabric, venetian blinds, woven labels, certain plastic lamp-shades, artificial silk piece goods, component parts of dolls and dolls' clothing, glue gelatine and size, abrasives, certain hack-saw blades, leather, certain tanks, cisterns, etc., plaster statues under ten inches in height, adhesive gums, malt extract and preparations of malt extract and fish liver oil, cotton wool and wadding made partly of cotton and certain manufactures thereof, component parts of braces made of elastic, iron and steel wheelbarrows, hand-carts, etc., etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The customs duties imposed on crystal glassware, venetian blinds, adhesive gums and iron and steel wheelbarrows, handcarts, etc. are new protective duties.  The Orders relating to razor blades, drinking glasses, knitted woollen fabric, glue gelatine and size, tanks and cisterns, leather, malt extract and fish liver oil increased <Col N="67" /> the existing customs duties on these commodities.  In the Orders relating to lamp shades, artificial silk piece goods, brace elastic, woven labels, dolls' clothing and component parts of dolls, hacksaw blades, statues and cotton wool the scope of the existing duties of these commodities was extended to cover additional lines or to prevent evasions of duty which had occurred.  The duty on abrasive materials has been reduced.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not it has been the practice of the Minister to explain in detail at this stage the effect of each of these Orders but I think it might be well for me to refer to the purpose of at least some of the Orders that have been made.</P>
    <P>Possibly one of the most interesting is the duty in relation to drinking glasses.  Possibly Senators know that it has been decided to go into production again of the famous Waterford glass.  Naturally, that will mean a certain period when, in the course of training workers and getting over other initial difficulties, the company would have to meet certain difficulties in the overcoming of which they would require certain assistance.  In order to mark time while workers are being trained in the manufacture of crystal glasses, which is a highly skilled process, the company has gone into the manufacture of ordinary soda glass tumblers of the usual half pint size.  It has been possible to purchase imported glasses of this type at considerably less than the Waterford factory can make them but the imported tumblers are of much lower quality than the Waterford company is making.  The Waterford company's glasses are dearer for two reasons: first, they are of a better quality and secondly, they are hand made.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Order is to increase the duty on imported glasses in order that the Waterford factory's goods, which, up to quite recently, were incapable of being disposed of, can be disposed of so that this very desirable line of production can be gone into.  The primary object of the crystal cut-glass manufacture is for export.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> I think Senators will agree that, in the short time that it is expected the company will require to get on its feet &mdash;possibly one to two years&mdash;the duty is highly desirable.</P>
    <P>Some of the Orders refer to certain evasions of duties that have taken place, for example, the duty on plaster statues and statuettes.  The duty imposed heretofore related only to statues of 12 inches in height and over. For some time there had been an increasing import of statues and statuettes of ten inches and thereabouts. The Order now made relates to imported statues of ten inches and over.</P>
    <P>Another notable case of that type is the duty on hacksaw blades.  That was one of the duties which was contained in the Bill that I had the honour to pilot through the Seanad on the last occasion.  The duty referred to hacksaw blades of half-inch width. The new duty proposes to catch hack-saw blades of ?-inch width and over. After the duty on half-inch width blades was imposed last year it was found that blades of 7-16ths of an inch width were being imported freely. Naturally, they were affecting the output of the home manufacturers.  It was found on investigation that blades of 7-16th inch width were being made for the first time, obviously to avoid the duty on the half-inch width blades that was imposed last year.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the details of each of the other Orders, but if Senators would like further explanation or elucidation of any of the Orders I will be glad to let them have it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who are interested in the industrial progress of this country will welcome the Orders that it is proposed to make in this Bill. Apart from any selfish motives that might be attributed to myself, they are welcome because they are a guarantee of increased employment of our own people in our own country in the production of goods.  That aspect is very often forgotten.  The purpose of the protective policy implemented by this Government and its predecessors is, in the main, seen in the continuous and growing employment in industry which has been in operation here for many <Col N="69" /> years, though I understand there has recently been a fall, due to extraordinary circumstances.</P>
      <P>I think these Orders are good, from the broadest national viewpoint.  At the same time, I would address myself to the Parlimentary Secretary and ask that, where secondary industries are affected by the protection of an article which is made by a primary industry, and where the labour content is higher in the secondary industry, facilities should be given for the secondary industry to import any primary commodity needed which could not be supplied by Irish industries already in being.  I mention that because I notice included in it are certain items of spun rayon under the heading of artificial silk piece goods liable to preferential duty or full duty at 50 per cent.  I must pay a tribute to the Irish mills for the manufacture of spun rayon cloth, as in the course of trade I have been able to inspect the products of a mill which has only some years ago gone into the production of this type of cloth.  Great credit is due, not only to the directors but to the workers, who in such a short period have conquered the difficulties of manufacturing such a substitute for cotton.  At the same time, there are many types of that spun rayon cloth which that mill and other mills cannot produce and which our secondary industries need.</P>
      <P>While I assume there is a licensing clause applicable to all the Orders, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the departmental officials to interpret that clause in the broadest possible sense, in concurrence with representatives of the Irish mills. Where there is anything that an Irish manufacturer in a secondary industry can buy at home, I agree he should and must buy it at home, but I am sure there are primary manufacturers in Irish mills here manufacturing this cloth who would not want to see a secondary manufacturer suffer by reason of the fact that they cannot produce the particular type of goods he requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all in agreement with the principle underlying the Orders, but as one associated with industry and knowing the labour content in secondary <Col N="70" /> industries, I feel that we can do good service to such industries by not interpreting in the strictest sense any licence attached to these Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself not entirely in sympathy with the point of view expressed by the Senator who has just sat down and somewhat critical of the general procedure as outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary in recommending this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an example of what might be called piecemeal legislation. It proceeds on the unconscious assumption that if, in the case of 20 or even 100 industries, you can prove that you have increased employment, you are thereby making a net addition to employment in industry as a whole.  What I want to suggest is that, in our efforts to deal with specific economic problems, we should always advert to the general effect on the economy as a whole and not concentrate solely on the benefits to be derived from the industry that is protected. That is the most insidious danger to our national economy.</P>
      <P>If you can show that you are preserving or creating employment in a particular industry for 20 or 30 more people, the evidence that those 20 are working at that occupation is available. The benefit to the few is concentrated and evident.  If, at the same time, you are doing damage to the rest of the economy, the damage is spread so evenly and so thinly over the rest of the community that no one is acutely conscious of the damage in his own personal experience and therefore it requires a very close analysis to ascertain its total amount.  We should, therefore, be careful to see that we are not doing greater damage to the economy as a whole than is compensated by the benefit derived from employment in the protected industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the tax that concerns the Waterford glass industry, because this is an industry which has certain historic associations with Ireland and there is every reason to encourage and protect it.  We hope the Waterford glass industry of the future will be as famous as the Waterford glass industry <Col N="71" /> of the past.  There is a case for protecting infant industries which are considered suitable as permanent elements in the economy of the country, but I deprecate any attempt to get away with 20 new taxes and have them carried by propaganda appropriate only to Waterford glass. I should wish to illustrate my view by references to one or two industries to which the Parliamentary Secretary made no reference.  It is, of course, a cliché to say that agriculture is our dominant industry and most people would agree that it is in the highest degree desirable that those aspects of our agricultural production which have been most laggard in recent years should considerably expand their productive efforts.  Two of those aspects are the production of poultry and the production of pigs.</P>
    <P>I am going to relate these things to one of the new taxes.  One of the limiting factors in the production of pigs and poultry is the weight of pig feed or other feed that the woman of the house can carry out in a bucket to feed the pigs or the poultry.  That may seem rather laughable, but anybody with experience of economic life in the country will realise that there is something in it.  The minute the poultry population on a farmstead exceeds 20, 50 or 100&mdash;where one is concerntrating on poultry or pig production&mdash;it assumes a different aspect entirely. No matter how strong or willing the housewife may be to carry out the feed, she feels that she cannot do it without a handcart or donkey cart.  In a modern large scale poultry farm you find considerable use for handcarts and other things like that as a means of saving human labour.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of these taxes will certainly be that handcarts or trollies will not be cheaper but probably dearer.  If that tax has the slightest effect in discouraging an increase in the production of pigs and poultry, I say that that particular tax is doing more harm to the national economy as a whole than would compensate for the employment of a few more people making handcarts in another part of the country.  I would like to emphasise <Col N="72" /> again the extreme desirability of relating this kind of piecemeal legislation to some general economic policy which has in view the general interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is neither an employer nor an employee in a protected industry, I would not like the Parliamentary Secretary to get the impression that all members of the House welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>The plain fact is that to most of us it means somewhat higher prices in most things.  Frankly, I regard these Bills with a spirit of mournful acquiescence. I do not think we can do much to prevent it, but I do not want the impression to be given to anybody that there is a feeling of joy throughout the country that these tariffs are going up all around as they are.</P>
      <P>I suppose I could not confess to being an old-fashioned free trader without incurring some scorn, but the fact of the matter is that I am.  I do not think that anyone can deny but that from the point of view of the consumer this protection simply means higher prices on the whole.  I do not want Senator O'Donnell to give the impression that all is joyful in the House on that account.  It is, perhaps, to a great section of the community a joyful matter, but some of us people who are on fixed salaries, if you like, simply have to pay more for what they will buy.  There is the danger&mdash;I see it round me&mdash;of these tariff walls allowing people to make excessive profits and I would urge, as the one practical suggestion in these remarks of mine, the Parliamentary Secretary to keep the eye of a lynx on the possibility that some of these tariffs are higher than is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right thing is that our industrialists should have a fair chance to sell their goods at a fair price.  When they are making an unfair margin of profit, as they sometimes do, it is bad for the country as a whole and bad for morale, because one gets the impression that there is not free competition if the industries of this country are really doing well.  They must pit themselves against the best that every country can produce.  If they are <Col N="73" /> cushioned against competition by excessive tariff protection, it will only do harm to the quality.  I am afraid that is happening in some circumstances. However, I can only repeat that, despite our satisfaction at a policy which ensures the employment of as many men as possible, I accept this Bill personally in a spirit of mournful acquiescence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised that, at this late stage, we heard more than one speaker throw out again the hoary old cliché: &ldquo;As good and as cheap.&rdquo;  Many of us engaged in industry would be the first to declare that many of the goods made either from the fundamentals or processed here were to a degree uneconomic, but I would like to take the House back to the period of acute shortage of various manufactured goods during the war when the community was very glad to have available to it the goods produced either in their entirety or partially by those much-criticised people, the Irish manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Those who are not in industry forget one important thing.  Were it not for the protection afforded by successive Governments to our infant industries this country of ours would still be as it was, the dumping-ground for our big cross-Channel industrial neighbour. Many of the goods thrown up to us as being cheaper than the Irish-made article are not cheaper when compared with similar conditions.  Those foreign goods are cheaper in many instances because they have been dumped here out of excess or out of goods that could not be sold by the British manufacturer in other markets throughout the world.  These things should be known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the previous speaker studied the reports from the E.C.A. experts that appear from day to day in the columns of the <i>Irish Press.</i> Surely those reports have already blown sky high the suggestion that the Irish manufacturer or those engaged in any form of industrial enterprise are making excessive profits.  Not in any one case is the Irish manufacturer getting more than a fraction of the profits shown to the standard in the <Col N="74" /> United States.  I am not going to delay the House.  I do not say that every industry, judged merely as an economic unit, can be fully justified. It can be justified if we are ever going to get out of the position in which we were before the industrial revival, when we were merely the dumping-ground for foreign goods.</P>
    <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act is to ensure that we will have factories dotting the country to make more goods for our own people to consume and use. If our products cannot in some cases be sold as cheaply as the products of manufacturers across the water this is due to the fact that they have 1,000 units of production while there is only one available to the Irish manufacturer. I do hope that we are going to see an end to this carping criticism of our Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the duty which he has brought in to protect and help the re-established Waterford glass industry. I am very closely associated with Waterford in many respects.  I believe that the action taken by the Minister and the sympathy which has been shown from all sides of the House to the re-establishment of that industry will be much appreciated by the City of Waterford.  I was glad to know that when they asked for a tariff in Waterford they said that this high tariff would be only required for a period of one to two years.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of interest in regard to the remarks made by Senator Stanford.  Early this year the Australasian countries got into monetary difficulties, and they were unable to pay for large quantities of manufactured goods that were ready for despatch to Australia and New Zealand.  These goods were dumped in this country, in many cases over 30 per cent. and 50 per cent. tariff walls.  They were sold below production costs in this country. Because the British manufacturers had these goods and could not bring them home and use them as ornaments in their houses, they had to sell them in the nearest market at whatever price they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary would be <Col N="75" /> very vigilant in cases like that.  I believe that where things like that happen the Minister should be able to put on an embargo.  Many of our industries suffered considerably financially from that dumping.  I believe its repercussions will be felt in the returns from the State revenue for the year ending 5th April next.</P>
    <P>All Parties in this country agree that the vast majority of industrialists are doing a good job.  If there are one or two who offend occasionally it is not fair to blame the rest.  I do not want to start a debate on protection of free trade.  I understand that the House has sufficient business to keep it going for two days, and were I to open up a debate on protection or free trade the House would want to keep going for some weeks.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of suggestions I should like to make to the Minister. I am aware of at least one article which is not now made in the country on which there is an import duty. What is happening is that the manufacturers and traders who require that product have to apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce for a licence.  The granting of that licence is recommended by the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Revenue Commissioners and the licence is granted.  The licence is granted in all cases but the importer, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Revenue Commissioners have to go through that formality in order that goods may be imported. There is no known case where the licence has been refused.  There may be cases; if there are I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have them investigated and the import duty removed.  It is only a waste of public money and it is interfering with business.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would ask him to be vigilant about is the quality of some of the goods manufactured here.  For example, he did mention hacksaw blades and I would like him to see that the quality of these is as good as the imported article.  There are many things manufactured here which are of higher quality than the imported <Col N="76" /> article; I believe the specification for cement here is higher than in any country in the world.  The specification for hacksaw blades should be on the same basis.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary of a little incident in an industry in which I am interested. We require specialised saw blades for certain purposes&mdash;they are not hacksaw blades&mdash;and we found that they could not be sharpened and tempered here because the people here did not know the type of steel they were made from.  When manufacturers send steel to a person who manufactures saws he gives them specifications of the steel and the method of tempering required.  If these blades are sent to somebody who does not know the specification or the method of tempering that person will not be able to do a good job upon them.  That illustrates difficulty of putting an embargo on specialised items like that because you may hold up an industrial process through want of equipment costing a few pounds, and you have to go through interminable regulations when only a few shillings' worth would be involved.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the removal of duty on articles which were once made by industries that have ceased to operate in this country, because it causes great difficulties to traders and manufacturers and last, but not least, to civil servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have for a long time been doing Senator Stanford an injustice.  I always thought he was a dyed-in-the-wool Tory.  I remember an election being fought in 1906 when the Tories' battle-cry was &ldquo;tariff reform&rdquo; and the Liberals were all for free trade, so I should have thought of Senator Stanford as a Liberal rather than a Tory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right being a free trader in a country like England, but you cannot be a free trader in Ireland because, beside you, there is a country with 48,000,000 people, highly industrialised, and if free trade were operated, there would be injustice here.  Free trade is all very well <Col N="77" /> provided everybody else is happy. When you look around the world you see that practically every country protects its own products.</P>
    <P>I believe in the policy of Arthur Griffith, the Sinn Féin policy, that one should have a strong agricultural community and a strong industrial arm. Griffith also preached another policy, a policy of passive resistance, and like the story of free trade, passive resistance was all right when every person remained passive.</P>
    <P>I happen to be a representative of the workers and I noticed in Senator O'Donnell's speech, and to a large extent in Senator Burke's, that both are protectionists when it concerns their own particular industry.  I hope I am not doing an injustice to Senator Burke, but when he spoke I felt he might have some interest in the Waterford Glass Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you have not. What is the prime purpose of a protective duty?  It is to create employment for our people.  I remember attending a lecture by an old Tory, the late Major Crean, a very great protectionist, and he told the story that in America they imported tinplate from Wales and the Government there put a tariff of 100 per cent. on tinplate, but it did not affect employment in the United States, and so they put on another 100 per cent.  Then somebody realised that it would not be a bad idea to make tinplate in America and they finished up by making all the tinplate they wanted and, in addition, established an export market.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke mentioned that certain things were not manufactured in this country.  If people cannot get these things in here, they will have to be manufactured, and it is up to somebody to manufacture them and if there is a duty high enough they will be manufactured here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an industry is not established or has failed, let us increase tariffs and not issue licences for the importation of things which we manufacture. Senator O'Donnell is primarily concerned with his own end and talks about primary and secondary industry, <Col N="78" /> but he does not care what happens secondary industry so long as his particular industry is all right.</P>
    <P>In dealing with Irish manufacturers we find some of them of a difficult type and more difficult than manufacturers with British connections, whom we find more sympathetic in dealing with schemes for the workers than we found some of the new manufacturers attacked in the Dáil a few weeks ago. One particular man who made a lot of money&mdash;he is dead now&mdash;was most reluctant to pay anybody, and paid the lowest wages he could get away with, and he left a huge fortune.  The man who will not pay a fair week's wages is no use to the country, especially when he wants to make profit behind tariffs.  We are all opposed to such men, and an eye should be kept, a friendly one, and not an eye which would be always looking for something which was not there, to see that these people who are protected will give service to the community both in relation to the quality and the price they charge.</P>
    <P>Human nature being what it is&mdash;none of us is a saint, though he may think he is&mdash;there is always that tendency in every one of us to get rich quick, if we can, and the quickest way to get rich quick is to shove up the price of an article of which you have a monopoly, and so the community suffers.  The prime motive in the imposition of tariffs is and should be to create employment for our own people, and I suggest that there is no use in talking about free trade or of opening the ports and letting everything in, if our people are flying out.  We are bringing in the things we want and exporting the people who should be making them here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphatically disagree with the last speaker when he says the best way to get rich quick is to shove up the price of an article. The best way, from a manufacturer's point of view, is to get the largest possible production at a price which the people will buy a quantity, so that you thereby get a reasonable profit.  Senator Summerfield is an optimist if he thinks that any report, American or otherwise, will blow sky-high the idea <Col N="79" /> that everybody except me is making too much profit.  It is popular at the moment and no report, however impartial, will get it out of the heads of the people that the other people are making too much profit.  Personally, I think it has got to the stage of being somewhat unhealthy.  I mention it only because I should like to remind the House that, so far as manufacture is concerned, there is still the prices branch, which is active, in the Department of Industry and Commerce. Every manufacturer has to submit his accounts annually and satisfy them that he is keeping within a particular margin of profit.  That has been the law for a very considerable time. Everybody in this House ought to know it, but it is surprising how few people advert to it when they begin to talk about profits and prices.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnston rather puzzled me. He made a general statement with which, I think, everybody will agree&mdash; I certainly do&mdash;that, in considering protection, one must advert to the general economy as a whole.  Then he objected to piecemeal legislation and to Bills being brought which varied tariffs or brought in new tariffs.  I think he objected to 20 at a time.  I have become convinced that, in dealing with protection, there is no other method than an immediate Order made by a Minister.  Let it be investigated and discussed after, as we can do now on these Bills, but I am satisfied that, in a country of this size, any public examination of a proposed tariff, in advance of the making of that tariff, would defeat its purpose for probably four or five years.  I should like it to be the other way, but I am pretty well satisfied that that is impossible.  That should not prevent an examination of all tariffs, having regard to the economy of the county as a whole, and I should be the first to say&mdash;I think the Minister would agree, if he were here &mdash;that if it can be shown that a particular tariff would have a really adverse effect on agriculture, it should not be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is that you have a Civil Service inquiry, and any of us who have had anything to do with tariffs know that that generally takes from six to nine months from the time the idea is first mooted.  It is the publicity I am referring to, and I have reluctantly&mdash;because I would like to have these things examined publicly&mdash;come to the conclusion that there is not any better way.  At any rate, nobody has produced a better method.  The method at the moment is that, within nine months, an Order must be confirmed by legislation, which gives an opportunity for public discussion.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult, publicly or privately, to judge fairly and accurately the merits of a particular tariff, unless you have a great deal of information, and it must also be remembered that one may affect another.  If, as a result of manufacture here, the price of an article is higher, it may affect another industry, because that article may be the raw material of that industry, and all these things have to be considered as to their possible effects.  I do not think that, in considering any form of tariff, it is practicable to relate the size of the tariff to a price differential. The only real object of a protective tariff, as distinct from a revenue tariff, is to prevent, or practically to prevent, the entry of goods so as to provide for home production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; was used by Senator Summerfield, and it is used a good deal by manufacturers.  I think they would be well advised not to use it. because it is now misunderstood. It is very often thought by the public to mean that something wicked is happening in another country and, therefore, that that other country is behaving unfairly.  What we know as dumping simply means that, as a result of over-production or a particular set of circumstances in another country, goods are sent out at a price which is uneconomic and which would be economic in any country.  To that extent and where that happens, one can say that every commodity is liable at some time or other to be dearer here, because it may not be possible to <Col N="81" /> import it when it is available as a clearing line at a cheap price from outside; but I am not prepared to accept the assumption of Senator Stanford that prices for the same quality here are by any means always higher, or, even to any great extent, higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally.  I was not attacking the Senator and I do not wish to misrepresent him.  One of the problems which most manufacturers have to face is the importation of a very inferior article at a low price. Many of us are at our wits' end to know whether we ought to produce what we know to be a bad article at a low price in order to meet this competition. On the whole, I think we are better without it, but that is a detail on which there will be one decision in one industry and another decision in another.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to find that Senator Johnston can look with a favourable eye on a tariff if there is some historical connection with the industry.  I am sure he will be pleased to know that I have at home a leatherbound book which gives the wages about a century ago of the silk weavers in Dublin.  The same factory is now producing spun rayon yarn.  It is, strictly speaking, not the same as real silk, but it is produced in the same factory, so possibly Senator Johnston will be inclined to make a special exception on historical grounds in that case.</P>

    <P>I should like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;it is probably not necessary&mdash;that he should not pay too much attention to Senator O'Donnell, or, for the matter of that, to Senator Burke.  My experience is that, as soon as it becomes perfectly clear that goods have been tariffed which are not manufactured here and which &mdash;this is the point&mdash;are clearly distinguishable from goods which are manufactured here, both Governments here have been perfectly ready to take off the tariff and, in fact, have been only too glad to do so.  Nearly all the difficulty, however, in my experience&mdash;and <Col N="82" /> I have had a considerable experience&mdash; is that care must be taken not to license goods which would have the virtual effect of defeating the tariff by, admitting substitute goods simply because, in the strictest sense of the word, they are not the same as those manufactured here.  It may be a good or a bad thing but I think a country of 3,000,000 cannot get the variety of the larger country.  Whilst I do not admit that we should have inferior or dearer goods, we should realise that if you have tariffs there will have to be less variety.  That is one of the prices you have to pay for tariffs and licences.</P>
    <P>So far as silk rayon goods are concerned, there is a licencing provision, and I think I can say that there has been general agreement on the part of the manufacturers and co-operation with the Department in regard to licences for such goods.  It is true that there is some uneasiness on the part of manufacturers in this regard; because there are a number of varieties of these goods and because they are different in design or texture, it might be possible for some people to get a licence to import these products on the plea that they are not produced here.  There must be a limit to the amount of variety when there are tariffs and protection.</P>
    <P>I know there are a lot of difficulties in this matter of licences and, though not a supporter of the Government, I would like to say that as far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned they go to great pains to understand the complexities which industry has to face in dealing with all applications for licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person who can hardly be described as an old Tory or an old Liberal, I would like to say that I agree with the remarks of Senator Stanford.  I think it is proper that we should have here a sense of concern in the passing of this Bill which enables the Minister to impose duties and to increase duties on articles which the consumer must purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of the protected industries it seems to be the case generally that anyone who protests too much about protection is severely criticised. <Col N="83" /> Usually such protests are very fiercely resented by the owners or proprietors of the protected mills or factories or those with the slightest interest in the protected industry.</P>
    <P>It all comes to the point that one needs a great deal of courage to say a single word in regard to tariffs and their application to goods.  The interested parties will tell you, if you do so, about the amount of public capital in the business and their employees, and they will say: &ldquo;You must not hit me because if you do so my employees will be hurt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford is right in indicating that we should be concerned here, perhaps mournfully so, with the ease with which a measure of this type goes through the House.  Every day the imposition of a tariff seems to be followed by an increase in price of the particular commodity.  The imposition of a tariff should not immediately precede a rise in prices.  When people seek tariffs they should not have in their minds that it is a licence to increase the prices of the commodities they are producing, but the fact is that inevitably when a tariff is imposed the price of the goods to the consumer goes up. In many cases protection has become synonymous with increased prices.</P>
    <P>We are told that effective steps are taken in the Department to see that only a proper and fair margin of profit is earned by the producer and factory proprietor.  I do not want to say that the industries here are making increased and outlandish profits because I do not know whether they are or not. Certainly the efforts of the Department might be directed towards seeing how it is that immediately a tariff is imposed the price to the consumer goes up.  There is no reason, in my opinion, why that should be so.</P>
    <P>One of the most successful industries in the country is agriculture and that has been built up and carried on without any protection at all.  Our farmers are making a fair job of agriculture without any assistance and if even 100th part of the efforts of the Department of Industry and Commerce were devoted to helping agriculture, then we would have a really thriving agricultural <Col N="84" /> industry.  It is to the credit of the farmers that they have been able to build up their industry without protection.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed that I did not hear from the Minister more details of the various goods which it is proposed to protect and the duties to be imposed.  In the Schedule the first provision is an amendment of the duty on razor blades.  I would like to be told the quantities of blades that are being produced here and how the prices of razor blades manufactured in the country compare with the prices of those imported.  In the same way I am concerned with the imposition of a duty on venetian blinds.  So far as I know, we have had here for many years a thriving blind factory.  They were able to carry on for a very long time without protection.  I should like to know what quantities of blinds are produced now and what, in fact, will be the result to the industry of the imposition of these duties.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this Bill should not be let through as a matter of course. It must not be taken for granted that everybody must say: &ldquo;This is a Bill to give the right to the Minister to impose duties and protection.  Therefore, it must be allowed through because, otherwise, it will upset all our economy.&rdquo;  We will not be upsetting our economy by criticising a measure of this kind.  It is our duty to criticise it.  I have criticised it in a reasonable way and in a way that will suggest to people concerned that it is time they took stock of things and went out of their way to see that one of the results of the impositions of a tariff would not be an immediate increase in price.</P>
    <P>A Senator has told us that we have a small population, a small number of consumers and that, therefore, we must increase prices.  Why not develop the export trade?  If people are to run their business satisfactorily they ought to be able to develop not only an internal trade but an external trade.  Numbers of industries in this country have done that.  I cannot accept that we must have an increase in price because we cannot develop an export market.  There should be an <Col N="85" /> export market available for most Irish industries.</P>
    <P>As far as the Minister has power to do so, he should see to it that the quality of the articles produced in this country which are afforded protection would reach a proper standard.  I do not suggest that a very high standard does not exist in most of the protected industries.  We can be quite pleased that articles of a proper standard are being produced in most of our industries. Where the standard is not sufficiently high to satisfy the purchasing public the Minister should take steps to improve the standard.</P>
    <P>We should be very concerned here about a Bill of this kind because, in the main, a Bill of this kind means increased prices to the consumer.  We should demonstrate that we do not allow a Bill of this kind to pass without its being made clear that those to whom privileges are given have particular obligations to fulfil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The ground has been so widely covered that it would be no harm to fill up any gaps that remain to be dealt with.  A matter that needs to be referred to is that there are more people concerned with the benefits of protection than the industrialist.  In connection with a Bill of this kind everybody seems to think that the main beneficiary of protection is the industrialist, the owner, the management, and so on.  Although we are all against unreasonable profits being taken by the owners of industries in Ireland, it is also important that there should not be unreasonable wages demanded by the workers because the main object of our whole protection programme is to develop employment. We all agree that our policy has been very successful in providing a very large measure of employment.  This Bill raises further barriers against the competition with home factories, thereby making the jobs of our workers so much more secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that we are in a very difficult situation at present in business. Business is definitely not good in either manufacture or distribution.  Prior to the last Budget, the Congress of Irish Unions came together with the <Col N="86" /> Federated Union of Employers to examine the whole economic situation. All concerned realised that we were facing a very difficult time and that it was very important in the circumstances that the main object should be to preserve employment rather than to increase anybody's standard of living. The main objective was to hold our employment as high as possible and to see that nothing was done in the way of wage demands that would interfere with that object.</P>
    <P>As a result of those discussions it was agreed that a 12/6 ceiling&mdash;a formula as it was called&mdash;would be the highest increase that workers should reasonably expect to be paid to meet the new cost-of-living figures, having regard to the general situation.  That figure was to be a maximum figure and was to be given only in cases where industries were prosperous and had not been affected by the general slump.</P>
    <P>Now what do we find?  Most of those industries were protected.  We find that in protected industries a lot of settlements were made within that 12/6 formula but everybody went for the maximum and for the most part, indeed, got the maximum.  But, there are workers in certain cases at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>As profits have been mentioned as being one of the things that must be considered when protection is given to an industry, I submit that there must also be considered the standard of wages claimed by the workers because that relates to the cost of the goods ultimately.  In fact, wages are the biggest factor in the price of goods.  Therefore I submit that it is relevant.  I do not intend to pursue it except to say that I fully agree that the owners of protected industries should not look for any unreasonable profits but I also submit the corollary, that no unreasonable <Col N="87" /> demands should be made by workers behind these tariff walls.</P>
      <P>I am not making this case as an employer.  The case I am making on this particular question of wages is one on which I have the co-operation and acquiescence of the Congress of Irish Unions sitting in council with the employers of Ireland.  Therefore, anybody looking for more than 12/6 increase in wages in these particular circumstances and behind these particular tariff walls is doing something which is against the national economy.</P>
      <P>There is one other point that I should like to make.  Senator Douglas suggested that if we are going to have protected industries, we must sacrifice variety.  We all realise that but one of the factors that will have to be taken into consideration by the Department of Industry and Commerce when issuing licences to import goods is variety.  Variety is not only the spice of life; it is the spice of trade.  It is short-sighted to imagine that merely by stopping goods coming in you will get an equal number of sales in the home market for home producers.  I have already spoken on this matter but it bears repetition.  Anybody in the distributive trades knows that if we cannot have variety of, say, materials to sell in the shops, sales drop alarmingly.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely necessary to maintain variety.  Therefore, I suggest that, when giving licences to distributors, emphasis should be placed on the fact that the licences are given subject to a large variety of designs in the articles being imported.  A variety of designs should be brought in under licence and emphasis should be put on variety and not on quantity.  Enough material should be imported to give a wide variety on a rather small yardage which will not interfere with the sale of the Irish product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much, as I do not consider myself as competent to speak on this as other members here.  One thing that emerges from this discussion and also from the discussion in the other House is that the protectionist policy of this Government and of the Government that preceded <Col N="88" /> it has been accepted as the best policy for the country.  There may be a few dissentient voices, those of people who express concern that they are not given enough information as to the employment possibility and so on that the manufacture of the articles concerned would entail.  It would be unwise if the businesses of various industrialists were to be made the subject of discussion here in detail.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Senator O'Reilly was correct when he said that imposition of a duty here is synonymous with an increase in the price of the article involved.  I do not think that is correct.  There is one aspect of the position that should not be lost sight of, that if we do not give sufficient protection here to the industries that have been started, it would pay industrialists outside the country to put goods on the market here at a greatly reduced price, a price below the economic price for them, even for the time being, so as to capture the market; and, having captured the market and having squeezed the native industry, they could then after a period raise the price of the article concerned.  That is an aspect of the case that should not be missed.  When I hear people now and again questioning the quality of the goods produced here, I say to myself that sometimes that question arises out of prejudice.  Everyone knows that when it was decided to start an industrial policy in this country, a mountain of prejudice had to be overcome.  There were people then, and I am afraid there still are people, who, if they were presented with two articles of exactly the same kind and of the same quality, one manufactured abroad and the other at home, out of that very prejudice that I have referred to would accept the article that came from outside.  It is strange that we seldom hear people questioning the quality of the imported article.  We hear people say that if we afford protection to these industries we must make sure that the quality of the articles produced here is of the very best.  There is no question raised at all about the quality of the goods that are imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one Order in which I have <Col N="89" /> a special interest, No. 9, which concerns the manufacture of dolls and the component parts of dolls in the Gaeltacht.  This is an industry that was set up under the auspices of Gaeltacht Services, Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta. From what I can gather, this industry is making good progress.  I have been informed that the articles produced in these factories in the Gaeltacht, dolls and toys, are second to none and that they can hold their own with any imported articles of the same kind.  I would like to inquire of the Parliamentary Secretary or of the Minister whether there is not a possibility of the expansion of that industry.  It appears to be an industry that is particularly suited to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, there are two factories, one in Spiddal, County Galway, and the other in Crolly, County Donegal.  I would like to know to what extent those Gaeltacht factories supply our national requirements in these articles and, if they fall short of supplying the home market, whether there is a possibility of having similar factories established in other parts of the Gaeltacht.  Of course, protection is required for them and will be required. I submit that in the case of industries started in the Gaeltacht a case can be made for a high measure of protection, much greater than would be, perhaps, justifiable for a similar industry started in the Galltacht or non-native-speaking districts.  Also in the course of time it may be possible to produce sufficient of these articles for export.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into those particular points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can all rest satisfied that neither the Government nor the Parliamentary Secretary is asking for this Bill without feeling the necessity for it.  Yet I cannot, with Senator Burke, congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for having brought in this Bill.  I rather feel more like sympathising with the consumer who has to face the necessity of paying higher prices for certain necessaries that are affected as a result of the imposition <Col N="90" /> of the extra duties which this Bill asks for.</P>
      <P>We all know that employers and employees are very well organised.  Employers can, and I believe do, satisfy the Government as to the necessity for any extra protection they need for the industries that they control.  The employees are also well able, because of their organisation, to look after their own interests in the matter of repayment for work done.  The consumer, however, is not so well organised and a feeling in many quarters is that he is getting a tight squeeze between the employers and the employees.  It is only on such occasions as this and in such places that something can be said in the interests of the consumer.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the majority of industrialists in this country are actuated by very honest motives and the best motives in looking for the protection that in many cases they are entitled to get.  It has been alleged, however, that there is a small section of industrialists who are taking advantage of the desire on the part of different Governments to increase employment by encouraging the development of industries in the country and that these people are putting on the market protected articles&mdash;and very heavily protected&mdash;that certainly are not value for the money charged for them.</P>
      <P>I have heard people say from time to time that it would pay them to pay twice the price for the imported article rather than buy something similar of home production.  I would not like that to be so, nor that there was any truth in such statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My mind can go back to a time when we had not a native Government in this country and when we had very few industries.  I recollect at that time the interest that was manifested in many areas in purchasing only Irish manufacture and refusing any substitute. I knew youngsters who when brought into shops by their parents to be provided with confirmation outfits refusing to take the clothes purchased by their parents until they were assured they were of Irish manufacture. They were very hard to please <Col N="91" /> in that matter.  That interest to-day when we have so many industries, is sadly lacking, or there must be some reason for it.</P>
    <P>No one can deny that every Government we have had since the advent of the State has been very considerate and benevolent in the matter of protection for young industries.  With Senator O'Reilly I am in thorough agreement that the time has come when most of these industries should be able to stand on their feet and compete with any foreign production.  I sincerely hope that if that time is not with us now it will not be long until it is.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that certain employers and industrialists have used their employees from time to time to force the hand of the Government in the matter of securing extra protective duties.  I would not like to think that any Government would submit to that form of intimidation.  I believe that this Bill is necessary, but I hope that the time is not far distant when there will be no need to provide such protective remedies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senators for the wide range they embraced in the course of this debate.  Possibly I should have spoken at more length when opening the debate but I felt that since most of these tariffs had already been in operation for several months perhaps Senators, as well as I, realised the full import of them and that it would not be necessary for me to go into more detail than I did.  I also realised that the Seanad has a lot of business to do.</P>
      <P>I do not want to detain the House unduly.  Nevertheless, questions have been asked by several Senators which I think it is my duty to answer in so far as I can.  First of all, there was the broad question in relation to protection which was raised by different Senators on both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is well established here that if we are to advance industrially as a nation, protection is necessary. We realise that our agricultural arm is not strong enough to bear up the whole nation and to maintain as many people <Col N="92" /> in gainful employment in the country as we would hope to see.  Consequently we must try to develop our industrial arm to cater for the balance who are unable to find work on the farm or in the different professions.</P>
    <P>We are a young nation in the industrial field.  For that reason alone protection, or a certain amount of it, is necessary.  If we look around the world we will see that even in the case of many of those nations that have what is known in trade and industry as an historical start it will be found that protection is in operation in respect of many of their industries.  I think that to revert to a policy here of free trade would be suicidal as far as our industry is concerned.  I do not think anybody seriously suggested that.  In many respects the policy of protection has been forced upon us by the differentials on the cost of our raw materials on which some of our industries are based.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to the cost of steel and iron imports from Great Britain.  I think I can refer to them with more detail in dealing with the remarks of some Senators.  Senator Johnston said that the Order imposing a duty on wheelbarrows and trucks, etc., may have the effect of reducing the use of these articles on the farm. The fact is that the raw materials, the iron or steel, that go to make up this particular article, have to be imported from England and in England they maintain the differential in price to the detriment, naturally, of our people.</P>
    <P>For the iron that is sold to the British manufacturer at £40 per ton we pay £65 per ton and in the case of other material of a different texture sold in England at £45 we pay in Ireland £85. Therefore, it is obvious that manufacturers of iron wheelbarrows and trucks in this country could not possibly expect to compete with the imported article.  For that reason it was found desirable to impose that duty.  The fact is that the over-all value of the market in this country is only £30,000 a year in any case.</P>
    <P>I do not think there would be any justification for putting the people engaged in the manufacture of these articles out of employment for the sake <Col N="93" /> of accepting the imported article at the much lower price that the English would hope to put it on the market. The fact is that our prices, even with the big differential in the cost of the article, would reduce competition.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well for me to refer to some of the points raised by individual Senators.  Senator O'Donnell referred to the possibility of giving more assistance to secondary industries in the way of granting licences and I think that that Senator, and every Senator, knows that in cases where secondary industries give a reasonable amount of employment and where it is found impossible to get the basic material used in these industries in Ireland, every consideration is given, and has been given, by the Department of Industry and Commerce to all reasonable applications for the import of goods necessary to maintain that employment.  But he will agree with me that secondary industries in which a very limited amount of operation in the manufacture of any article is carried out, are not good for the economy of any country, and by resisting these applications we can encourage our own manufacturers to make the basic material so that secondary industries can get supplies from home resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston suggested that this was an example of piecemeal legislation, but Senator Douglas, who showed better appreciation of the problem than he did, must have had some practical experience of the negotiations that preceded the making of many of these Orders in this year and in previous years.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Douglas that it is difficult to devise a more realistic method of dealing with imports which tend to depress employment and output in our country.  These situations have to be dealt with quickly, or as quickly as circumstances allow, when they arrive.  It would be impossible to draft piecemeal legislation that would deal once and for all with situations.  Therefore, it is only through the operation of this legislation, forming as it does, Orders made from time to time in relation to particular circumstances, that these situations can be dealt with.  I do not <Col N="94" /> agree with Senator Douglas when he suggests that it takes six to nine months for any particular case to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I understood that the Bill had to be introduced within six to nine months when such an Order was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The Senator is quite right and I am sorry if I misunderstood him.  It is better if we do not have too many of these Bills in a particular year and it is only reasonable that the Bill must be and should be introduced at a time when the effect of the Order can be appreciated and before any maladministration, which the operation of the Order might disclose. In the meantime, if there is any malpractice it will be examined in the Department by the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention at this stage that the imposition of duties does not automatically mean an increase in price to any degree.  Senator Johnston suggested that I was using the Waterford glass as a means of sugar-coating certain increases in tax which this Bill would effect.  I did not bring in Waterford glass in order that Senators might look through it benevolently at these impositions of duties, but the fact is that in almost every one of these cases there has been no increase in price as a result of the imposition of the duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator O'Reilly and some of the other Senators who made that case were speaking I looked casually through the brief supplied which is flagged with the different articles mentioned in the Orders.  I find in the case of statues there has been no increase and in the case of cotton wool it is being sold by the manufacturers 2½d. cheaper since the Order was imposed, and cellulose cotton wool is about 4d. a pound cheaper than the imported article.  The company manufacturing this commodity notified the Department that they hoped to reduce it further by 2d. or 3d.  In the case of dolls there has been no change in price but there has been a slight increase in the selling price of gums.  As regards <Col N="95" /> leather, four firms indicated that there is no change in price since the Order was made, and the same applies to glue and razor blades.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly asked me about the quantity of razor blades that are manufactured here and the amount at which they are sold.  In the last 12 months our manufacturers made 105,178 gross, representing £56,148, and the total home market was estimated at about 200,000 gross per annum.  It will be realised, therefore, that there was a big gap which, with protection, can be made up by our own manufacturers. With regard to price, I am happy to tell Senators that our own manufacturers can sell razor blades from as low as 1d. per blade, which is a good indication that the imposition of tariff or duty was not synonymous with or tantamount to an increase in price.</P>
    <P>I might take an outstanding example in the matter of Venetian blinds, to which Senator O'Reilly referred, and I could do no better than to read from the brief supplied to me. Under Venetian blinds and the heading of price it is disclosed that the manufacturers have made no change in the price of blinds since the duty was imposed.  The Irish price is 5/9 per square foot and imported 7/- per square foot, and manufacturers intend to produce a new and superior type of blind at the old price which will sell at £5 3s. 6d. for six feet by three as compared with £6 1s. 2d. for a somewhat similar but inferior type of blind. That is an outstanding case where an Order has been made.  I hope I have established fairly clearly that the mere getting of protection under one of these Orders is not tantamount to an increase in price.  The cases I have quoted prove the contrary, if anything.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane asked about the manufacture of dolls in the Gaeltacht areas and I am glad to support him in the claim he made that the quality and standard of manufacture of these dolls is as high as we can see in any imported dolls.  This Order, however, relates to doll parts and not to complete dolls.  I understand that the import of complete dolls is small and that the market from one year to <Col N="96" /> another is difficult to gauge, but it is satisfactory to know that the manufacture of dolls in the Gaeltacht areas is increasing somewhat and still more satisfactory to note that the dolls are finding a good market in dollar countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the fact that Orders were in existence in respect of goods which we had ceased to manufacture in this country.  Senator Douglas rather disbelieved that statement, but perhaps there are some cases Deputy Burke is aware of.  I think he ought to give details of these cases to the Minister so that they can be looked into.  He referred also to the special type of hacksaw blades which we found it difficult to do without in certain industries and which we were not making here.  I think there would be a case there for a special licence, if the facts of the situation merited it, and the Senator, in this matter, too, ought to make the facts known to the Department.</P>
    <P>We ought to remember, in this review of certain duties imposed, that the policy of protection has been adopted by every Government and is being carefully administered having regard to the amount of employment which the policy can provide in the country and, at the same time, bearing in mind the interests of the consuming public.  I do not think it is fair to level criticism at manufacturers that their profits have been unduly high.  Senator Summerfield referred to the report of some of the E.C.A. missions, in which it was observed that the profits of Irish manufacturers, far from being high, were, in their opinion, on the low side. I have no particular knowledge of that myself, but I remember reading that observation in one of the E.C.A. reports.</P>
    <P>I think we can safely assume that Irish industry is progressing well, that gaps in our supply in relation to demand are being filled by enterprising Irish industrialists and being filled by the production of a quality of goods which is comparable with the best we can import and, as I think I have demonstrated, in many cases at least, at comparable prices, and in other cases at lower prices.  In those cases <Col N="97" /> in which they are higher, they are not so much higher as to warrant the abandonment of the protection policy. Personally&mdash;I have expressed this view elsewhere&mdash;if I were called upon to choose between two articles, one, an Irish article and the other, an imported article, I would not mind&mdash;possibly because I can afford it&mdash;the little extra for the Irish article of similar quality. The same applies, I think, to people who find it difficult to make ends meet in their weekly budgets, but, generally speaking, the policy of protection as applied by the Department has the full support of the entire country or of as substantial a part of the country as justifies the policy.  There is still lingering not only amongst the general public but amongst some of our shop assistants the unfortunate idea that the imported article is better than the Irish article.</P>
    <P>I think that, by now, we should have dispelled any ideas of that type which some of our people have, but by our industrialists co-operating with their employers and the trade unions, they will eventually impress on the consumer that their article is as good as the imported article and that the price they charge is in most cases as low as and, in some cases, lower than, that of the imported article.  Whether the Seanad will find it necessary to consider whether they should table amendments is a matter for the Seanad, but, as Senator Douglas has pointed out, the Bill must be passed within a certain time and I should be glad to get the Bill this evening, if I may.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to check this runaway chase, but the safety of life at sea is involved and perhaps I should be justified in asking a question.  This section will cover drill for the saving of life, and at present on the Irish cross-Channel steamers, so far as I can find out, such drill is almost never held.  I should like to urge the Parliamentary Secretary, in administering this section, to see that, perhaps once a week, such drill is held on these steamers.</P>
      <P>There are quite a number of passengers who cross quite frequently and they will get practice in this drill, and it would be a very great help to the ships' officers if there were a number of regular passengers so instructed.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary that he should do everything possible to see that cross-Channel steamers have this drill at least once a week in such circumstances as would cause the least disturbance to the passengers.</P>

      <P>There is provision in the Bill for the control of foreign registered ships while they are in our ports.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Stanford, there is also provision for the carrying out of certain drills which I think is recommended as weekly in the case of passenger ships and monthly in the case of cargo ships.  This is an enabling Bill and the Minister will have power to make rules and prescribe certain regulations under it.  I can assure the Senator that in so far as it can be achieved, these cross-Channel steamers will be required to have that drill <Col N="99" /> carried out at least once a week in accordance with the recommendations of the convention.</P>

      <P>In this section I think some provision should be made to guarantee compensation to ships which go to the aid of other ships.  It will make it rather tempting for captains to turn a blind eye to the telescope in doubtful cases if they know they will lose valuable shipping time and may be involved in considerable loss by going to the help of ships.  If, on the other hand, they are assured of adequate compensation, there will be no risk of that happening.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary might consider some clause offering compensation for the loss which is likely to be incurred in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If such provision were put into the Bill it might lead to an uneasiness with ships going on bogus calls and claiming compensation.  I think general agreements amongst shipping companies and owners which provide facilities in regard to compensation in such cases are adequate and I am advised that no case has been made for the payment of this compensation under the 1948 Convention which forms the basis for this legislation.  The Senator will see that at the end of Section 36.  In Section 2, which also deals with distress, provision is made for compensation by way of salvage, which has been the normal method.</P>

      <P>On Second Reading, Senator Stanford raised the matter of pollution of waters, and the Minister asked me to refer to it in particular before leaving the House.</P>
      <P>The indiscriminate discharge of oil into territorial waters is prohibited by the Oil In Navigable Waters Act, 1926. Between the months of May and August of this year complaints had, in fact, been received from the Irish Tourist Board and certain local bodies that the east, south and south-west coasts were being polluted by deposits of oily substances.  In the absence of evidence that these oily substances came from our own shores it was impossible to employ the Oil In Navigable Waters Act, 1926, to deal with them.  The attention of ship-owners, masters and other shipping interests was, however, drawn by an official notice to the necessity for strict compliance with the provisions of the Act, and they were urged to ensure that oil or oil sludge should not be discharged within 50 miles off the Irish coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem, however, I believe, is not peculiar to this country.  It has been under consideration by many countries over a number of years, and <Col N="101" /> in recent years the problem has become more acute, due, it is thought, to a combination of factors&mdash;the large increase in oil-burning ships, break-up of tankers sunk during the war, the large-scale importation of crude oil to the newly established British and continental refineries and the practice that they have of dumping at sea deposits of sludge which accumulate in the tanks of oil-tankers.</P>
    <P>The question is at present under consideration by the Economic and Social Council of U.N.O.  We are not members of U.N.O., but the British Minister of Transport, in pursuance of a recommendation there, has set up a committee of experts to consider what practical measures can be taken to prevent pollution of the waters around the coast of Britain.</P>
    <P>In reply to an inquiry from the British authorities, it was indicated that if it would be of assistance to their inquiries, samples of deposits could be obtained from the affected areas on the Irish coast and sent to them.  The British, I have been informed, have now indicated that they will be glad to be furnished with samples collected along the Irish coast and arrangements are being made to send these samples accordingly.</P>

As it is generally understood that those who are under seven have a better chance of being absorbed into the family than those over seven, that <Col N="102" /> there are so many under seven who have no chance at all of being adopted, I think it would not be advisable to accept it.  I have gone fully into the whole thing and that is the opinion I have come to.  Otherwise I would have had an amendment down by this time. I can assure the Senator that I have looked into the matter and am perfectly satisfied that in the circumstances it is best to leave the Bill as it stands and to have only children under seven years of age.

      <Col N="103" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to prolong for a further year the existing Rent Restrictions Acts, which otherwise would expire at the end of this month.  This is done by Section 1 of the Bill.  There is, I think, general agreement that these Acts cannot be allowed to lapse in present circumstances because undoubtedly hardships on a wide scale would be caused if rent control were abruptly removed.  In fact, as I indicated in the other House, I believe that rent control will be necessary for some years to come.</P>
      <P>As Senators are no doubt aware, the report presented to me by the Rents and Leaseholds Commission on the subject of rent control is at present being examined.  The report deals comprehensively with all aspects of the rent control problem and makes a large number of recommendations.  It would not be possible to give these recommendations the careful consideration they deserve, and to draft amending legislation and pass it into law, before the existing Acts expire on the 31st instant.  I hope, however, that I shall be in a position during the coming year to introduce whatever legislation may prove necessary.  I have not yet received the report from the printers but when received it will be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas and placed on sale.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill is consequential on Section 1.  It provides that landlords who incur expenditure on exceptional repairs may, during the period for which control is being continued, avail themselves of the existing provisions enabling them to increase controlled rents by a graduated percentage of the excess of their expenditure over two-thirds of the existing basic rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully, I have decided that I should not oppose this Bill.  In coming to that decision I have been influenced by the fact that the <Col N="104" /> Minister has indicated that the report of the commission which was set up over two years ago will be circulated very shortly and that he will, without delay&mdash;he has not pinned himself to any time&mdash;introduce amending legislation or perhaps completely new legislation following on the Government's consideration of that report.  For these reasons I will not oppose this Bill.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has made the point that the reason for the Bill is mainly the fact that the present Act expires on the 31st of this month and, if it were not for this continuance Bill, great hardship would be caused.  By that he means, I think, that great hardship would be caused to tenants.  There is no word at all about the difficulties of the unfortunate landlords whose property is let in many cases at entirely uneconomic rents.  There has been a great deal of hardship caused to landlords as a result of the passing of the Rent Restrictions Acts from 1914 up to last year.  Undoubtedly there was grave necessity for legislation of this kind to protect tenants from rapacious landlords.  Were it not for this legislation, undoubtedly the lot of the tenant would be very different; but I assure you that because of the statute law as it stands to-day the lot of the tenant is a very happy one and the lot of the landlord in many cases is a very sad one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, the landlords of this country are landlords of one, two or three houses, the rare exception being the landlord who owns very many houses.  The landlords of one, two or three houses, in the main, exist, or endeavour to-day to exist, out of the rents of those houses. Pre-1939, perhaps, they had a reasonable income from those rents, but to-day, because of the fall in the value of money, because of the increase in rates and because of the excessively high cost of repairs and their inability to recover a proportion of that cost, the income is very seriously depleted. By allowing this Bill to be passed, we may be seeing that no hardship is caused to tenants, but I am afraid that, for another 12 months at least, we will be allowing hardship to be caused to landlords.  Therefore, I would say to the Minister that this <Col N="105" /> time next year I would expect him to be able to do a little for landlords who find themselves in a difficult position because of the statute law in regard to landlord and tenant relationships to-day, because of the fall in the value of money and because of the increase in rates.  Many of them are in a bad way.</P>
    <P>Because of this legislation, they do not get anything like a corresponding increase in rents to make up for the increase in the various outlays they have.  Undoubtedly, this statute is necessary, as otherwise things would be very difficult for the tenant. Certainly, from 1918 on, steps had to be taken to see that the lot of the tenant was not made a misery and this restrictive legislation had to be passed; but to-day the tenant is considerably better off, generally speaking, than his landlord, who, because of this law, is in a most unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I will expect that, when again introducing a Bill of this kind, either to seek renewal because he is not ready to deal with the report, or because he is ready to bring in new legislation following on the report, the Minister will consider not merely the tenant but also the landlord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, that will be done.  There was not a long debate in the other House on this whole matter. The reason we think we will take a whole year is that, owing to the printers' strike, the report has not been printed or circulated.  I got it on 24th June.  It was sent to the printers about the beginning of August and we did not get it back until the middle of October.  Senators will agree that everyone affected by a report of that kind, both property owners and tenants, should have an opportunity to study what is in it and let the Government know their reactions.  Consequently, it will be some time before we can take an official decision on what the new Bill is to be like.  I expect that certainly by this time 12 months the Bill will be in the House, whether it is through this House or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> The next session of the Dáil, from March onwards, is generally taken up with financial business&mdash;even last year we did not finish that business at the end of July&mdash;so there is no prospect of having a new Bill of this kind considered in the other House until the beginning of the autumn session.  I fully expect, however, that by this time next year, if the Bill is not completely out of the Seanad it will at least be here.  I hope there will be no necessity to have this Bill renewed as it stands, without considering all interests. Naturally the interests of all concerned will be considered.  If the Government has not shown that in the new Bill, we have people in the Dáil and Seanad who will be interested in all aspects of the problem and they can put down amendments and state their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that the law relating to income-tax is in urgent need of revision and requests the Government to appoint a commission of inquiry on the subject at an early date.</P>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks by assuring the Minister that this is an entirely non-political motion.  I would move this motion whatever Party was in office and whoever was Minister for Finance.  It is not meant in any way to be critical of the present administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> The second point I want to make is that all I am asking for is an inquiry. All I feel bound to do is to make a <i>prima facie</i> case for an inquiry on the grounds of the injustice to large sections of the population of the present income-tax system.  I am not bound to advocate any particular policy of reform.  I am not bound to answer questions that would be proper before the inquiry if the inquiry was instituted.  All I intend to do is to indicate the presence of a problem and the need for its investigation.</P>
    <P>The justification for this motion, apart from what I might suggest is its inherent propriety, is twofold.  In the first place, the income-tax in this country was imposed 99 years ago.  I hope that next year the Department of Finance will duly celebrate the centenary of this joyful event.  In the course of 100 years no inquiry of any kind has been held in Ireland into the income-tax code although more than one inquiry has been held in England, its country of origin.</P>
    <P>The second justification is the existence of a large volume of dissatisfaction with the present income-tax system.  Since this matter was first mentioned in the Seanad in the course of other debates, I have received communications from many organisations and many individuals urging me to press this inquiry forward.  If I wanted any justification I have, perhaps, sufficient in a recent resolution of the Convocation of the National University advocating that the university representatives should do something to attempt to reform the income-tax system.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly well aware that the income-tax code cannot be treated in isolation.  It cannot possibly be separated from surtax and is difficult to separate from death duty; it is also closely related, especially in rural areas, to local rates on land.  I am aware that any comprehensive inquiry into the income-tax code would necessarily overflow into other parts of the fiscal sphere, and that it would be impossible to make recommendations for drastically altering the code without altering other taxes as well. Having said that and having shown that I realise the inter-relation of the <Col N="109" /> different parts of the tax system, I suggest that for the purposes of this motion it is possible to deal with income-tax alone in the narrowest definition of the term.</P>
    <P>Income-tax was imposed for the first time in this country in 1853.  It was imposed in Great Britain in 1799 as part of the taxation to finance the French War, and continued until 1816. Although the Act of Union was passed in the meanwhile, there was no attempt to extend it to Ireland.  In 1842 income-tax was reimposed by Sir Robert Peel as part of his policy of free trade, of reducing import duties and substituting revenue from them by direct taxation.</P>
    <P>Ireland was again excluded from income-tax in 1842.  One reason was the absence of the machinery of collection. A more fundamental and relevant reason was based on grounds of justice.  Ireland as the agricultural portion of the United Kingdom stood to lose rather than to gain from the free trade policy designed to advance the cause of England during the industrial revolution, and to reduce the cost of food in the interests of low wages and industrial costs.  Both from the point of view of the administrative difficulties and of abstract justice, Ireland was excluded from income-tax reimposed in 1842.</P>
    <P>Income-tax was brought a stage forward by Gladstone in the 1853 Budget. Gladstone made it perfectly clear that he regarded income-tax as a temporary expedient.  In 1853 he imposed the tax for a further term of seven years with a gradual decline in rates, hoping in 1860 the Government would be in a position to dispense with the tax.  As in many other cases, the course of events upset these expectations and only two of the seven years had passed when the Crimean War doubled the rate of tax.  In 1860, the final year of Gladstone's seven years, the tax was fixed at 10d. in the £, and there was no mention of repeal.  Since then the tax has been renewed annually.</P>
    <P>From our point of view the 1853 Budget was peculiarly significant because in that Budget income-tax was first imposed in Ireland.  The reason <Col N="110" /> was that large sums advanced for relief of distress after the Famine had become irrecoverable, owing to the impoverished condition of the country. Income-tax was imposed with the object of recouping the Exchequer for part of the loans and grants to Ireland which had become irrecoverable. Gladstone stated that the tax was calculated to produce £460,000 for seven years.</P>
    <P>It was regarded clearly as a temporary tax, as an emergency measure to recoup the Exchequer for certain advances which it could not recover in any other way.  The Financial Relations Commission in 1896 referred adversely to this development and commented on the impropriety of imposing what became a permanent tax for a purely temporary necessity.  These observations of the Financial Relations Commission became of increasing importance with the passage of time, because from the turn of the century the rate of income-tax rose to quite unprecedented and unforeseen heights.</P>
    <P>In 1884 the tax was 2d. in the £.  In 1902 Mr. Winston Churchill declared that an income-tax of 1/3 in the £ was the extreme limit of practicable taxation, while in 1906 Mr. Asquith, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that income-tax at a uniform rate of more than 1/- in the £ was impossible to justify in times of peace.  Year by year the tax has been renewed and the rate increased.</P>
    <P>The present income-tax code is a patchwork of a large number of Statutes gradually added to, but the underlying structure of the income-tax code has passed through a series of great revolutions in the world with its main structure quite unaltered to meet the changing conditions of the time. Since income-tax, more or less in its present form, with the present schedules, was imposed in England over 150 years ago the world has witnessed the industrial revolution, a transport revolution, the growth of joint-stock enterprise, the nationalisation of many spheres of production, the growth of the welfare State, several wars including two great world wars, changes in the theory and practice of taxation, national borrowing and <Col N="111" /> national debt.  In Ireland we have gone through successive phases of political status: the Union, Dominion status and a Republic.</P>
    <P>Throughout these changes in the world and in Ireland, the income-tax code, although it has been amended in certain particulars and the rate raised from time to time, has remained practically the same code as that introduced shortly before the end of the eighteenth century to finance the French wars.  Even if the income-tax is not in need of amendment, it certainly is in need of codification.  In the interests of clarity and the administration of the tax, the time has come to clear up some of the outstanding questions, to frame something in the nature of a consolidating Statute and bring together into some sort of order this immense mass of legislation and judicial decisions which concern both the collectors and the payers at the present time.</P>
    <P>I shall have occasion to refer to the five schedules under which income-tax is assessed.  These schedules emerged from the mind of the Legislature in their present form in 1803, and have never been altered since.  Income-tax has been extended or copied in the meantime in the United States of America and in most of the British dominions, but in none of these countries has the system of the five schedules been adopted.  It has been inquired into, and is being inquired into in Great Britain, but, in Ireland, these five schedules have taken on something almost of the nature of sacred writings which cannot even be discussed, much less altered.  Therefore, I suggest that, even if there is no need to amend the income-tax, at least there is some need for a commission to consolidate and to bring the legislation up to date.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past year, this question has been debated in the Seanad on more than one occasion. A year ago, on the Supplies and Services Bill, some references were made to the necessity of additional taxation and to the good effect of certain types of income-tax on stimulating saving and reducing consumption. <Col N="112" /> The second occasion on which it was referred to was the debate on the agricultural grant in March of this year.  I do not wish to reopen the difficult problems touched on in that debate, beyond saying that I suggested that there should be some relation between the amount of direct taxation levied on the land by means of income-tax and the amount levied by means of local rates.</P>
    <P>The next occasion on which the matter was discussed was the Social Welfare Bill later in the spring, when it was pointed out that the salaried classes, to a large extent, had made provision for their own social services and that therefore the addition of the contribution they would have to make for a State scheme would really amount to an increase in income-tax.  Finally, the matter was discussed in the debate on the Finance Bill in the early summer.  On that occasion, the matter to which I mainly referred was the standard rate of tax which was raised in the Budget and the effect of the rise in the standard rate on saving and investment.  I did not refer to the distribution of the burden of the tax, beyond saying that, if the distribution of the tax was fairer, the standard rate could be lower.  That is a point to which I will return.  The converse of that point is that if there are any inequities in the distribution of the tax, every increase in the rate of tax magnifies these injustices.</P>
    <P>The concessions which were made to some of the lower group incomes in the Budget were in the direction of a fairer distribution of the burden of the tax, but I think it is only fair to say that these concessions were mainly made to compensate the lower income groups for the reduction in food subsidies and therefore did not meet the case I am trying to make this evening.  The concessions reduced the yield of the tax and tended to concentrate it on the higher incomes.  From the point of view we were considering here in the Finance Bill debate, the adverse incentive effect of the tax on saving and investment, that shift towards the higher incomes did, in my opinion, harm rather than good.  On this occasion I am not dealing with the standard <Col N="113" /> rate, with the gross burden of the tax or with the effects of the tax on saving or investment or other incentives.  I am dealing in this motion with the fact that the distribution of the income-tax at any standard rate produces injustices as between different sections of the population and that it is productive of political discontent, rising in some cases to acute indignation.</P>
    <P>The first outstanding fact to anybody who examines the income-tax in this country is the small number of people who contribute to it.  The Minister for Finance on the 30th January of the present year was asked in the Dáil &mdash;I quote from the Dáil Debates of that day, column 30&mdash;the number of persons who paid income-tax for each of the years, 1948-49, 1949-50 and 1950-51 and the answer he gave was that, in 1948-49, the estimate was 148,000; in 1949-50, 167,000; and in 1950-51, 181,000.  That is to say, roughly one person in 17 of the whole population paid income-tax in 1950-51.  I do not think it is an unfair thing to say that it is a matter of common knowledge that more than one-seventeenth of the population have incomes of more than £140 a year.  If that is the case, the income-tax does appear to be collected from a smaller number of people than the number from whom it would be collected if it were strictly and successfully assessed.</P>
    <P>In other words, a tax which, on the face of it, is impartial between all sections of the population, is in fact unjust to some and benefits some sections at the expense of others. There is a quite irrational and unjustifiable difference between the sections who pay tax and the sections who do not.  It is exactly the same as if the tobacco duty were levied at a different rate on people with dark hair and people with fair hair.  A tobacco duty of that kind would offend one's sense of justice, but nevertheless the difference between the people who are included in the income-tax assessment categories and the others is quite as unrelated to their capacity to pay as the colour of the hair of the indirect taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The complaint is made by the <Col N="114" /> salaried classes in this country, the people whose case I am mainly trying to place before the Minister, that there are certain types of income-tax payers who can evade part of the tax they should pay.  There are certain sections of the population whose income arises in such a way that it cannot be seen by the income-tax inspectors.  It is also suggested that there are other sections who pay every penny they owe, who do nothing illegal and who evade nothing, but who, owing to the fact that the basis of the assessment applicable to their occupation is peculiarly favourable, get off with a rather light payment.  If you like, we can put it this way: there are two types of evasion&mdash;there is the illegal evasion of people who succeed in making false returns, and the legal evasion of people who do nothing illegal, who, quite rightly and properly, benefit by the peculiarly favourable and&mdash;perhaps I might anticipate by saying&mdash;obsolete method of assessment.</P>
    <P>As against that, there are other people who pay every penny they owe. Their incomes are known to the taxation authorities, they have no escape, no method of getting out of the net. If you have a population classified in that way it is perfectly clear that the third class of people have to pay a higher rate than if these legal and illegal evasions were brought to an end.  The late Minister for Finance, Mr. McGilligan, in the Dáil on 10th July of the present year, at column 755, said that if everybody who should pay income-tax paid income-tax the standard rate could be reduced by 1/- or 1/6 in the £.</P>
    <P>That is, roughly, the question which I wish to bring to your attention; that there is a class of the population who, by the nature of their income, find income-tax pressing very harshly on them.  This matter has been put very well in an address by Mr. M.P. Linehan at a meeting of the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations held in March, 1950, and from which I wish to give a few quotations.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been repeatedly pleaded,&rdquo; said Mr. Linehan,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" />&ldquo;that income-tax is the fairest of all forms of taxation in that it seeks to approximate the burden of taxation to the ability of the individual taxpayer to bear that burden.  In theory, this may be so; in practice, it is the direct opposite, for a big proportion of the taxation thus raised is borne by persons whose incomes bear no relation to the tax imposed when compared with persons in other income groups. How is it, you may ask, that a system of taxation, founded on such sound principles, should be so harsh and so unjust in its effects?  The answer is simple.  To implement the system the revenue authorities must be in a position to know the annual income of the taxpayer.  Alone among taxpayers the wages of the employees and the salary of the salaried workers are readily available. The employer makes his return to the revenue.  The statutory allowances are deducted and the tax due estimated.  No such easy system operates in the case of tax payable under the other schedules. Before an industrial concern can be taxed, the accounts have to be audited.  There are innumerable loopholes through which much of the income can escape the taxing master.  There are queries and counter-queries.  The case of the agriculturist presents even greater difficulties, because there is no standard system of cost accounting for farming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not wish for a moment even to suggest any reflection on the administration of the income-tax code by the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not think, however, that it is unfair to state that I have been told that they appear clearly to centre their attention on people already in the net rather than to getting more people into the net; that it is their practice to squeeze the last drop of blood out of people already in their grasp rather than to go looking for new victims who might be difficult to get into the net. The recent increase in the promptitude and efficiency in collecting Schedule E is admirable from the <Col N="116" /> public point of view; but the efficiency of the Revenue Commissioners in this respect increases anguish of their victims.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I have been told, and if my information is not correct I hope it will be corrected, is that the section of the population who can make false returns, who can evade in one way or another their responsibilities, are never brought to criminal prosecution.  I have been informed that the practice in England is that, if a taxpayer is found to be doing something positively fraudulent with the intention of deceiving, in such cases the commissioners will not be content merely to recover the sum due, but will make the person concerned subject to criminal prosecution.  I have been told that in this country no income-tax offender is ever prosecuted but is merely asked to pay up his arrears. That strikes me as being in direct contrast with the activities of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to smuggling and other offences of that kind, where, if a person breaks the customs and excise laws, not only is he prosecuted but he is heavily fined and punished. If my information is correct it is possible to evade the income-tax laws with no penalty beyond paying up the arrears of tax.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the one class of people who are not able to practise any of these deceits are the salaried workers.  Their income is known to the Revenue Commissioners and they have no escape.  There has been a great volume of opinion in recent years in this and other countries that the increased taxation of the professional workers, the white collar workers, the administrative professional classes, has very adverse social and political repercussions.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from some observations by Mr. John Beavan, London Editor of the Manchester Guardian on the position at the present time.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In all the countries I have visited since the war&mdash;and they include the United States&mdash;I have found one section of the middle class having a lean time; I mean the salaried or intellectual middle class, <Col N="117" /> and particularly those members of it employed in the public service.  The middle class has always been regarded as an extremely valuable class, especially so in Britain where its members have been dedicated to their work, scrupulous in their conduct and ready to devote their private leisure to the public good. Upon them has largely depended the cultural life of the country and the running of humanitarian organisations. They have provided, too, most of the hard thinking and skilled advocacy that were needed to plan and attain social advance. They have been the great basis of constitutional democracy.  It would, perhaps, be wrong to say that through its vicissitudes of recent years this class has lost its moral earnestness, but its moral earnestness has been weakened.  It must be a serious loss to the community if this sense of public service were to go.  But when private problems press so hard upon individuals it is difficult for them to be concerned about other people's hardships. To-day the middle class is the class squeezed hardest by the inflation. Below them the wage workers have their trade unions, and since inflation is usually accompanied by full employment, they are in a strong position to protect their members. By the side of the intellectual middle class there are the tradesmen whose profits rise with inflation; and above them are the <i>entrepreneurs</i>, for whom an inflation period is a chance to make a fortune.</P>
    <P>The salaried middle class is not aggressive by temperament&mdash;though it may eventually be driven into aggression&mdash;and its staff organisations are not real trade unions ready to enforce their arguments by striking if all else fails.  Usually middle class salaries are not increased until all hope is abandoned by their employers of a recession in prices. Salaries, then, are well behind the cost of living when it is increasing. Before the war, however, when goods were cheap the salaried middle classes had a very good time indeed: and as unemployment was prevalent <Col N="118" /> and profits were harder to earn, they were envied by all other classes except the well-to-do for their security and well-being.</P>
    <P>Now, the salaried middle classes look back upon those days before the war as a golden age which may never be repeated in their lifetime.  Even their security to-day seems to have no value, since everybody has been pretty secure&mdash;up to now.</P>
    <P>In Britain&mdash;and in some other countries too&mdash;the salaried middle classes have not only failed to keep their earnings in line with the cost of living but also have been tightly squeezed by taxation.  There is no way of shielding them against the heavy taxes which, during a period of war or reconstruction or rearmament, must be levied upon the upper ranks of the workers and upon middle incomes as well as upon the wealthy.  But as the incomes of these latter groups were increasing all the time, the burden was easier to bear. The salaried middle class and some of the lowest-paid workers are the only people in Britain who have a lower standard of living than they had before the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the Seanad by giving further similar quotations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already quoted from the memorandum to the same effect of the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations. I do not think it is necessary to repeat it.  It is already on the records of the House.  I quoted it last spring.</P>
      <P>As I said in the beginning, I do not propose to advocate positive concrete reforms.  I do propose, however, to indicate certain definite grievances which are experienced by the people who are assessed under Schedule E&mdash; the salaried workers.  I intend to touch only on these points very quickly without giving any figures which would overload what I have to say.</P>
      <P>The first point is one on which I think there is very general agreement, that is, that the personal allowances have not been sufficiently varied with the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> As I said already, the concessions made in this year's Budget were definitely related to the reduction in the food subsidies.  They were simply meant to ensure that certain sections of the population would not suffer a reduction in their standard of living by reason of the reduction in the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that the personal allowances should vary with the cost-of-living index number.  The whole point of the personal allowances is to give to every person in the population a certain minimum income on which he can live at a subsistence level.  Whatever the arguments may be for varying higher incomes and wage incomes with the cost of living, it seems to me that the argument for varying that particular allowance with the cost of living is very strong indeed.  If the cost of living rises, the minimum allowance should obviously be raised with it.  If the original allowance was correct, then the original allowance, after a rise in the cost of living, will become too low, and the whole basis of the personal allowance will have disappeared.</P>
    <P>I would like to make another point: that if this principle is admitted, that the allowances should vary with the cost of living, the cost of living should be calculated, not on a working-class index number but on a middle-class index number.  In the <i>Economist</i> of the 29th March, 1952, there are calculations showing the effect of the changes in the cost of living on the middle-class in Great Britain.  I do not know whether similar figures are available in this country but I have no doubt that they could be prepared. The English figures quite clearly indicate that the cost of living has risen more for the middle income groups than for the working-class.  The middle income groups are the people whom I am discussing, people assessed under Schedule E.  If their personal allowances are to be made to vary in some way with the cost of living, it should be a cost of living measured by the appropriate cost-of-living index number, that is to say, one based on the <Col N="120" /> consumption of middle-class households.</P>
    <P>There is another proposal which greatly affects professional people and university graduates.  This proposal was put forward by the Editor of the <i>Economist</i> before the Royal Commission on Taxation at present sitting in England.  It is that the personal allowances, instead of being at a fixed rate, should be a proportion of income up to a certain point.  The particular benefit that would be derived by that change would be that professional people would be enabled to educate their children at good schools.  The principal thing that a child allowance is wanted for is education, and people who wish to be able to send their children to expensive schools, to get a good start in life, should get some further concession than people who are content with a more modest type of education.  That proposal would be of great assistance to certain types of professional people who find the present child allowance insufficient to give their children the type of education they wish.</P>
    <P>Another proposal which seems to me to have a great deal in its favour is that some allowance might be made to taxpayers for necessary expenditure on medical and surgical attendance during the year.  After all, a businessman is given some concession in relation to wear and tear, keeping his premises and capital in order.  The only capital that the ordinary professional worker has is his own body, and if his body goes through a period when it is very expensive to keep in good order it seems only fair that he should be allowed the same remissions as the other types of taxpayer are allowed.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote on that subject a passage from what I think can be described as a remarkable lecture by Professor de Juvenel, called the Ethics of Redistribution.  He refers to this question that people who expend money on keeping their capital intact get income-tax remissions whereas people who spend money on keeping their own body intact do not.  The reason I quote it is because of this rather striking phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is quite incomprehensible that <Col N="121" /> a breeder of dogs for the race track should be allowed his cost of depreciation, etc., while the father of the family is not.  It looks as if lawmakers sympathise more with the purpose of the former, that is, to sell dogs for the track, than the purpose of the latter, which gives men to society, incidentally for soldiering and for taxpaying.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to wander from the main line of my argument but I think this is relevant&mdash;that if allowances of this kind were made, if the Schedule E taxpayers got some allowance for medical and surgical attendance for themselves and their families, the case for a free national health service for that section of the population would be a good deal weaker than it is at present.  I suggest, as a small contribution to the great debate on the public health services in Ireland at the present time, that the need for free health services for certain sections of the population above the working class might be considerably reduced if this principle was admitted into the income-tax code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have a suggestion on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A suggestion? The suggestion is that, as in the United States of America, where it is already in existence, taxpayers should be allowed to deduct from their income money spent on necessary medical attendance for themselves and their families during the year as part of the wear and tear incurred in earning their living.  Roughly, that is the suggestion.  I could give Senator Hawkins further reading references on the subject if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another suggestion of the same kind is that the present life insurance allowances should be increased.  The present life insurance allowances are calculated in such a manner as not to benefit middle-aged people, many of whom are not in a position to effect a substantial insurance on their lives until they are middle-aged.  There is no more difficult problem at the present time amongst professional people than providing for their old age.  Owing to the high cost of living and high direct <Col N="122" /> taxation it is almost impossible for a man to accumulate a sufficient capital sum to-day to yield a decent income in his old age and, therefore, the former method of providing for one's old age has largely become a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>A great many people at the present time are showing a preference for pensionable employment, which is bad for the professions.  It is well known amongst university appointments bureaux, for example, that any job that carries a pension is eagerly accepted because of the security it gives for a whole lifetime.  To drive more and more of the professional classes into safe pensionable jobs is robbing the community of a certain amount of risk-taking and enterprise which used to be a healthy feature of professional life.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into details but I suggest that the basis of the life insurance allowance should be related in some way, not as it is at present, to the taxable income and to the amount insured but to the pension which it might be possible to provide combined with an endowment policy.  There should be an effort to encourage thrift through life insurance to a point that would give the non-pensionable or professional worker the same security for his old age that pensionable workers now enjoy.</P>
    <P>Another point that has been suggested to me is that, with the growth of the City of Dublin, with the great increase in the distance between a man's home and his work, travelling expenses have now become in the case of many workers a serious burden.  If people cannot obtain accommodation near where they are employed they have to spend a considerable sum every year on bus fares getting to and fro.  It does not seem unreasonable that that should be deducted as a working expense&mdash;whereas it is not allowed at the present time.  It has also been suggested that, in the case of owner-occupiers of houses in the cities, the repairs allowance might be restored.  Many people have acquired houses by instalment purchase at great hardship and now find themselves with no income-tax allowance for keeping those houses in repair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> Another point which affects a smaller section of the community but at the same time is of public importance is the need to revise the starting level of surtax.  When surtax began in England in 1909 it started at £2,000 a year.  In this country it was lowered to £1,500 where it still remains.  With the changes that have taken place in the value of money in recent years, £1,500 a year is not the income that it was and it seems only fair to those sections of the population on whose saving we depend for voluntary thrift that their incomes should not be unduly taxed away.</P>
    <P>Another point&mdash;and I think it is a fair one&mdash;is that the earned income allowances should be extended to surtax, at least up to a certain point. Many professional people are now earning large incomes as a result of hard work.  It seems unfair that they should pay surtax at the same rate as people who enjoy incomes derived from property and investments.</P>
    <P>All these suggestions would help the Schedule E taxpayer but none of them would help him as much as the tightening up of the collection under the other schedules.  That tightening up under the other schedules, as I have said already, would probably succeed in reducing the standard rate payable by all.</P>
    <P>There is a very curious difference in the law in relation to allowable expenses between Schedule D and Schedule E.  Under D people trading for profit are able to obtain a reduction in their assessment for monies spent &ldquo;solely and exclusively for the purposes of the trade, profession or vocation.&rdquo;  That clause has been very liberally interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners and still more liberally interpreted by the courts, with the result that it has become almost a joke in Dublin that meals in expensive restaurants, large cars and other types of what I would call display expenditure, are all &ldquo;on the firm.&rdquo;  Whether that is exaggerated or not I do not know, but the impression has certainly got abroad that business people are able to get income-tax allowances for <Col N="124" /> a great deal of luxury spending from which they derive a considerable personal enjoyment.</P>
    <P>Turn then to Schedule E, the salaried workers' allowances, where the phraseology is quite different and much tighter.  The phraseology there covers money expended &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of the office.&rdquo;  That is much tighter.  If a professor in a university brings a professor from another country to lecture here and spends money in entertaining him, he will receive no allowance of income-tax, because it will be said that the visit of that professor was not necessary in the performance of the home professor's duties.  On the other hand, if a business firm brings over other business people to see their premises, they can be entertained lavishly and luxuriously and the firm will get a large allowance in income-tax in respect of that expenditure&mdash; because of the difference in wording of the two schedules.  That undoubtedly is the cause of a feeling of grievance. Salaried workers believe that businessmen get away with a certain amount which they themselves cannot get away with.</P>
    <P>The salaried workers also believe that a number of weekly wage-earners escape from the income-tax net.  They believe that there is a good deal of evasion by means of changing employment. I suggest that the time has come in this country when &ldquo;Pay As You Earn&rdquo; should be seriously reconsidered. The advantages of &ldquo;Pay As You Earn&rdquo; are that from the psychological point of view the worker does not miss what he never gets, he is not asked at intervals to pay to the tax collector large lump sums of cash. His tax is related to his current income and if he dies his widow or his executors have no arrears to pay. From the point of view of the employer, although it does involve a certain amount of administrative difficulty, it is simpler and easier to deduct a small sum each week than to do what he is frequently asked to do now, to deduct quite large sums for arrears at the end of a year or two.</P>
    <P>The rates of taxation and working-class <Col N="125" /> incomes have both risen so much that the sums payable now by skilled workers in Dublin are sometimes quite considerable.  The Irish worker has not yet acquired the habit of making provision of paying these large sums of cash at irregular intervals.  The result is that their employers are faced from time to time with inflicting on them what appears to be extreme hardship.  The arrears have accumulated and the employers are then asked to collect these large arrears which means that the employees get very small wages for several weeks.</P>
    <P>I know that there are administrative difficulties.  I know that the volume of working-class incomes in this country may not be sufficiently great to justify the elaborate machinery which seems to work successfully in Great Britain.  That brings me to this point, which, I think, is central in the whole of my argument.  If, owing to changes that have taken place in society, the existing income-tax has become unworkable and administratively impossible, if the machinery for its effective collection has become so expensive as to be prohibitive, then it seems to me that a case for the revision of the whole code has become necessary.  The result of not collecting from certain classes of the population is that other classes pay more than their share.  From the point of view of social justice, no one can justify the imposition of an excessive burden on any class of the population merely on the ground of administrative difficulty or expense.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to avoid any reference to Schedule B for the simple reason that I am attempting to put forward the grievances of certain classes of people of whom I have special knowledge.  The seconder of the motion has a special knowledge of the issues involved in Schedule D with which he proposes to deal.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that farmers are doing nothing that they are not entitled to do by availing themselves of the basis of assessment laid down in the Income-tax Acts.  I think that, if there was any other basis of assessment, <Col N="126" /> the great majority of farmers in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would be exempt from tax.  The case made by some of the farmers' representatives that the income-tax code in relation to agriculture, should not be altered because of the poverty of the great majority of the farmers is really a case which does not seem to me to be a very strong one.  Any section of the population that has not got an assessable income is perfectly safe in the presence of the Revenue Commissioners. If any large section of the population can show that, on the average, their incomes are below the minimum assessable income, then they have nothing to fear from any revision of the law, however drastic.</P>
      <P>I do not think I am being unfair in stating that there are some recipients of agricultural incomes who derive a benefit from the present basis of assessment.  The basis of the assessment is, as everybody knows, the Griffith Valuation which is now practically 100 years old.  As I said in the beginning, almost everything in the world has changed in the last 150 years.</P>

      <P>I think the majority of farmers would possibly not have to pay, however the law was revised.  I think that possibly a small number of farmers would pay more than they are paying.  I can see that a case could be made in respect of those farmers.  A perfectly legitimate or at least an arguable case that could be made, even if farmers did make large profits, they should get some differential basis of assessment owing to the importance of their industry from the national point of view.</P>
      <P>You cannot pick up a newspaper now, you cannot listen to a debate and you cannot walk down the street without hearing people talking about the necessity for increasing agricultural production. I am perfectly prepared to accede that fiscal incentives may be necessary to increase agricultural production from the point of view of building up additional exports.  These are the sort of matters that could be inquired into by the commission I want to have appointed but they are not the sort of matters that I propose to introduce into this debate.</P>
      <P>I do, however, suggest that if a case for exemption on the ground of producing exports and earning outside currencies can be made by agriculture it can be made by every other export industry in the country as well.  If there is a valid case for the farmers, then it is an equally valid case for the hotel proprietors and everybody who caters directly or indirectly for the tourist industry.  But whatever case there may be for exempting the farmers on the ground of their poverty, on the ground that they have not got taxable income, or on the ground that they are performing a nationally useful service, I suggest that there is no valid ground for continuing to favour them because of antiquated schedules, obsolete valuations or administrative difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told that the main objection to the revision of the Schedule B assessment is the administrative difficulty involved in assessing farmers by any other method.  I am quite prepared to admit that those difficulties exist but what I said in relation to &ldquo;Pay As You Earn&rdquo; is <Col N="128" /> equally relevant here.  If the income-tax code has reached a point where it cannot be successfully administered in modern times, then the case for its revision seems to be conclusively proved.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is, perhaps, to anticipate something which may be said by the Minister.  It has been said by him in another place.  It has been said that an inquiry of this kind can await the report of the British Royal Commission on Taxation. There are, I think, two answers to that point of view.  The first is that the report of the Royal Commission on Taxation will not appear for a very long time.  Anybody who wishes to trace the course of events of that commission has only to look at the columns of <i>The Accountant</i> where they will see that it will be many years before that commission reports.</P>
    <P>The second answer to that point of view is very much stronger.  The whole basis of my argument and the whole point of what I am trying to say is that English and Irish conditions are different.  Up to 1853 no English statesmen ever considered applying income-tax to Ireland.  It was first applied as a temporary post-famine measure by Gladstone who intended to bring it to an end in seven years.  That extension was condemned by the Financial Relations Commission in 1896.  Since then conditions in the two countries have diverged more and more.  They have become separate political entities and the whole course of their development has developed on separate lines.  Yet in the last 30 years, in spite of all the novel programmes adopted in this country&mdash;tariff protection, development of our natural resources, electricity development and all sorts of other experiments of that kind, the income-tax code, and the income-tax code alone, has been accepted as something immutable, unquestionable and incapable of serious revision.  I suggest that the time has come to repair that defect.  I hope that I have not wearied the Seanad; I equally hope I made what I set out to make, a <i>prima facie</i> case for an inquiry into this very serious and topical question.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Brien is a difficult person to follow, because he always makes such an interesting case and is so lucid that one feels that, in following him, one is bound to be uninteresting and something of an anti-climax.  I do not share his fear of being political, as I do not think we are ever going to have income-tax of any kind which is not political, but I presume what he really means is that he did not want to be partisan. At the same time, it would be almost impossible to be partisan in discussing the income-tax code because there is so little difference between the main parties and, so far as this particular motion is concerned, the proposal has been made to successive Governments, but the results have been the same, well, as far as I know, the same, whatever may have happened behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that, in 1945, we unanimously passed the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Minister for Finance be requested to take steps for the revision of income-tax law and practice, with a view to general simplification and the removal of inequities in the application of that law and practice, and, in particular, the amendment of such statutory provisions or rules relating to income-tax or corporation profits tax as may restrict industrial and other development calculated to provide increased employment after the war.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most speakers then urged the appointment of a commission and the then Minister for Finance, who is now President, made a very sympathetic reply and, while he made no promises, he expressed the definite view that some day there would have to be a revision of income-tax law.  The suggestion was again raised in this House when the Minister was present in July, 1951.  He was perhaps a little less sympathetic, but he did state that a good deal could be said for the plea for an inquiry into the general incidence of the income-tax, and, as you have already been reminded by Senator O'Brien, the Minister thought that it would be advantageous to <Col N="130" /> await the result of the Royal Commission on Taxation which is taking place in England.  The Minister then said: &ldquo;I know, of course, that people will say: &lsquo;Why should we wait on Great Britain?&rsquo; but the reason is that there is no use in duplicating the expense and in involving, in particular, our taxpayers in expenditure which can be avoided if we only have the patience to wait until the inquiry now on foot has been concluded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to joint issue with the Minister.  I have no doubt that because we are working an income-tax code more or less based on the 1918 Act that there will be points dealt with by the Royal Commission on Taxation which will be of interest to us but I would point out to the Minister that any report it will make will be based on evidence obtained from persons of experience in Britain and any proposals will be based on British evidence.  The difficulties and problems which have arisen here could not come before that commission.  I do not want to develop this at length but even if I could agree with the Minister that if we had patience we should wait until that commission reports I would suggest to him or any other Government that we are not going to solve this problem by any report from any other country than our own.  Even if it were the best report in the world it would not be acceptable and, in fact, I would go further and say that any Government which attempted to make any amendments to any income-tax code based on a British report would find unreasonable hostility, if only for that reason.</P>
    <P>It always seems strange to me, and I have raised this over a half-dozen times in the House, why no serious attempt has been made during the past 30 years to prepare an Irish income-tax code.  For those of us who can remember the many statements before the Treaty as to the unsuitability of British taxation here, it is strange that no Government has ever even attempted to make any substantial change in the 1918 Act, which is still our principal Act.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons may be that any Government in power is naturally <Col N="131" /> afraid of how it is going to raise its taxation.  I imagine that if I were Minister for Finance, strong though I felt the need for a full inquiry, I would be tempted to leave it to the next Minister to do, because there is not the slightest doubt there would be a period of one or two years' difficulties in assessing taxes following a substantial change.  I am convinced that it will never be possible for any Minister or any Party, in the annual Budget, to make any comprehensive revision in the income-tax code.  I would, therefore, strongly support Senator O'Brien in his demand that there should be a commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why neither the present Minister nor his predecessor could see that all classes are dissatisfied and that the time has come when, in the interests of good Government. there should be a comprehensive inquiry.  I never will be Minister for Finance and I should hate to be but I cannot help feeling that if I were, I should be glad to put off some of the problems for a couple of years.  For that reason alone, I would have expected that some Minister for Finance would realise that, sooner or later, there would have to be an inquiry and that it might as well be now.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear&mdash;I do not wish anything I will say to be misinterpreted&mdash;that nothing I say as to the dissatisfaction that exists&mdash;I think Senator O'Brien would agree with me &mdash;represents in any way any extensive feeling of dissatisfaction against the administration of the income-tax.  So far as I am concerned, I know enough about income-tax law to know how little I know about it and how complicated it is, but a great many people, relatives and others, have come to me for assistance.  I have sent them to their inspectors, and in my experience&mdash;if there were any exceptions, they were very rare&mdash;they found in the office of the inspector a full readiness to give them every possible assistance.  I think it is important that, in any criticism of the code generally, it should be realised that we are not making any <Col N="132" /> attack at all on the administration, the standard of which I believe to be extremely high.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we have in Ireland the personnel from which a good commission of a representative character could be chosen.  We have experienced accountants and businessmen; we have agriculturists who would be quite competent to serve on a commission of the kind proposed; and we have trade union officials who are men of education and fully competent to serve on it.  They would be important because they know how the shoe pinches in certain directions.  I am convinced that the commission must have its civil service experts, but, for the purposes of the inquiry I have in mind, they should not be in the majority.  No doubt, whatever Government ultimately came to consider the report of such a commission would be guided very largely by the experts as to what it would and would not accept.</P>
    <P>I also want to make it very clear that the standard rate of tax or the total amount of money to be raised by income-tax should not form any part of the inquiry I have in mind.  The assumption would be that at the time of the inquiry a similar amount of money had to be raised and it would not be for the commission to discuss the standard rate.  The whole object of the inquiry would be to try to see to it that the tax, as applied, would be as equitable as practicable, that it would be as little injurious to trade, business or the public as possible and cause a minimum amount of hardship.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien gave the figures with regard to the direct payment of income-tax and I think he said it was one in 17.  I think that that might be to some extent misleading, because a very considerable portion of income-tax is collected from traders and manufacturers and it is collected from them on assessable profits.  Except in so far as these profits are paid out of the business, the tax is a charge on the expenses of the busness and is therefore, definitely a part of the cost of production or distribution.  Last year or the year before, many of our leading companies gave certain detailed figures showing the proportion of tax in each <Col N="133" /> £'s worth of goods produced and sold. That year, when the tax was 6/6 in the £, taking a number of these together, I made an estimate that every purchaser of a 5/- article paid approximately 3d. in income-tax.  If he buys an imported article, he does not pay the same proportion of Irish income-tax&mdash;he probably pays British or Japanese income-tax or some other form of tax.  The fact remains, however, that practically every purchase made by anyone includes a proportion of income-tax.  If the goods are made here and distributed here, the proportion is higher than if they are only distributed here.</P>
    <P>One of the things which it would be very proper for a commission, if appointed, to consider&mdash;certainly its terms of reference should be wide enough to include it&mdash;is the effect of income-tax and corporation profits tax on consumer goods and price levels. When I spoke before on this subject, I caused a certain amount of amusement by suggesting that it would be possible to simplify the income-tax.  I think the then Minister quoted some Chancellor of the Exchequer on the other side to the effect that it could not be simplified, but I am still innocent enough to believe that it could be done.  The simplification I really had in mind was not so much simplification of the code as a simplification to make it easier for the individual taxpayer to ascertain his actual liability at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Every one knows the misery caused by spending or incurring liabilities in excess of income and I am perfectly certain that this does happen where perfectly honest young people discover that their liability, which is based on the previous year, is considerably higher than they expected.  The fact is that I could not say to employees&mdash;I speak as an employer&mdash;&ldquo;You should have known; you were careless.&rdquo;  I should like to emphasise that it is extremely important, if you are to have prompt payment, with the minimum of hardship, that the taxpayer, particularly those in the lower and medium income class, should have a proper and easy method of ascertaining at an early period the amount of his tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> For a very considerable period, our income-tax has been calculated on the previous year.  Most of that time has been an inflationary period, or a considerable part of it has been an inflationary period.  Over the past ten years or so, the individual taxpayer, paying on the previous year, has really gained in most cases, but this year it has changed.  There has been an acute trade depression and in many cases incomes are less.  There have been periods of part-time employment and sometimes periods of unemployment. To my own knowledge, quite a number of individuals are finding it extremely difficult to pay and this is partly due to the fact that they are paying on what was a good year, a year in which they had a higher income.  I know that if they are totally unemployed, there could be an adjustment, but the majority are still employed, but with considerably lower incomes.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if there were a commission&mdash;I am not certain whether I would advocate a change&mdash;there should be an examination of whether or not the system of tax being payable on the income of the previous year is the best system.  It must be remembered particularly that the rate of tax on the individual's income is not fixed until after the end of the financial year.  Even with the best will in the world unless he had the secrets of the Minister for Finance a person would not know whether his income-tax was going to be 10/- next year as against 7/6 for the previous year.  That, in itself, is one reason why I think the whole position should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred to &ldquo;Pay As You Earn.&rdquo;  As an employer I do not know that I am particularly favourable to it.  If, however, &ldquo;Pay As You Earn&rdquo; is impracticable I think there should be devised some system by which an employee with the knowledge of the Inspector of Taxes could come to an agreement with his employer to have his income-tax deducted by arrangement over 12 months.  I do not think that there would be much objection to some such scheme.  It may mean of course that the authorities might have some difficulty in collection if a man left employment in the middle of <Col N="135" /> a year with the balance of the income-tax due if a similar arrangement was not made with his next employer.  I believe quite a number of employers are prepared to make an arrangement of that kind which would be better than the present position in which some employers have to deduct money from the salaries of their workers on the direction of the authorities.  One firm told me that it had five sheets of employees from whom moneys had to be deducted.</P>
    <P>I do think that the arrangement I have suggested would be much better than having deductions made from employees' wages for income-tax arrears.  I do not think that in a year like the present the income-tax authorities should be any more harsh in extracting payments than an ordinary businessman would be in similar circumstances.  There is a fairly recognised code with which, in business, one can deal with a man who finds he is unable to pay promptly because of some changed circumstances. The businessman generally would not approve of going to an employer in such circumstances.  There are certain types who might do this but that practice is looked on with disfavour by business interests generally.</P>
    <P>In cases where there are arrears and an amount has been paid off it has been deducted from the second half-yearly payment and not from the first. The result is that a demand goes into the employers and it would appear as though the person concerned was over six months in arrears.  That, I think, should not be the case and any payment made should be credited against the oldest tax due.  By crediting it to the second period it makes it appear that the employee is long in arrears and by making it appear that he is very much in arrears you run the risk of damaging that man in regard to his employer.  I think it is a bad practice that we have to collect income-tax through the employer except by a mutual arrangement.  I think that whole matter deserves careful consideration and is one that could very well be examined by a commission.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien dealt with the case <Col N="136" /> of income-tax allowances so I need not refer to them in detail.  Some of those I have in mind were insurance premiums, superannuation payments, medical expenses and other necessary expenses for which allowances should be made.  I do not think I should allow Senator O'Brien's references to allowances to pass without stressing why it is essential that there should be a full inquiry into the whole question of allowances.  He spoke for a certain section or type of taxpayer but they are not the only class with real grievances.  I can speak on behalf of manufacturers and traders and I could show you that the manner in which the tax is applied in their case is not always equitable.</P>
    <P>We had better disillusion ourselves entirely from the common and I think erroneous belief that the case for inquiry depends mainly on evasion and the failure of the Revenue Commissioners to collect taxes or on the belief that some people succeed in evading it.  I think if there is to be an inquiry the whole problem should be examined and examined in public.</P>
    <P>I think that the question of travelling to and from work is a matter that requires consideration.  In these days many people have no choice as to where they will live in relation to their work and travelling to their work is a necessary expenditure out of earnings which should be deductable.  I think the earned income-tax allowance is also a matter that should be examined.  I have mentioned this before so I will not go into it again except to say that in the lower-income groups I am not convinced that the difference between earned and unearned income justifies the 25 per cent. but that is something which should be examined by a commission and not be debated politically.</P>
    <P>The question of surtax is another matter which requires consideration and I do not think it would be practicable to examine income-tax without at the same time examining surtax because the two are closely related.  I think a case could be made for raising the level of surtax because £1,500 to-day is worth about £700 pre-war, which no one would have then considered a level above which people should be <Col N="137" /> liable to surtax.  I think there should be some provision by which surtax, in cases of widely fluctuating incomes should be capable of adjustment over five years. There are certain professional men working on a small normal income but who in one year might have a particularly big job on hands which would bring them within the surtax limits and that might not occur again for another four or five years.  That is not fair taxation.  There should be some method of adjustment so that the tax could be equitably applied over four or five years or whatever the period may be.  Some persons can so manage their affairs that they can spread income over a period while a professional man may find that a large proportion of his income comes in one year.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien has referred to-day and in previous speeches to the whole question of how far income-tax discourages savings and investment.  I do not propose to deal with that other than to say that it would probably come within the scope of the commission but in the main it is a matter which would have to be one of Government policy from year to year rather than a matter for examination by a commission.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien suggested that I should deal mainly with the questions that would arise in connection with manufacturing and trading profits. On more than one occasion I have made fairly carefully prepared speeches on that subject in this House and I do not propose to go into the same details as before.  But, lest it be thought that there is not just as strong a case and just as strong a desire for a commission of inquiry on the part of the traders and manufacturers whom Senator O'Brien thinks are favoured, I think I ought briefly to refer to several of the points which I think need inquiry.  The fact that I mention any matter now does not mean that I am fully convinced that I have a solution.  It means that I believe it is something that requires careful examination.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred to the possible effect on export prices.  As I <Col N="138" /> said before, I do not think you can possibly have a full examination into the income-tax code without very careful examination as to how far it affects actual prices of goods produced here, whether for export or for home consumption.  I have heard no speech that has convinced me that a matter that is rather a hobby of mine should not be examined.  I have a very strong conviction that there should be a distinction between income-tax and profits tax.  It seems to me that income-tax should be a tax on income &mdash;personal income or the income of individuals; it should be paid by businesses to the extent that they pay out income to individuals, whether by way of dividends or salaries to staffs, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Apart from tax on profits which are paid out it would be very much better if you had a profits tax which could be considered on its own merits when the taxation for the year came under consideration quite apart and distinct from income-tax, as the two problems are by no means the same.  I do not know that it would be particularly popular with businessmen but I would like to see a careful examination as to whether it would not be possible to graduate profits tax somewhat in the way in which income-tax and surtax combined are graduated whereby the tax would be higher if the rate of profit, in relation to turnover, was high.  That would encourage a low rate of profit and definitely encourage large production.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that, but very difficult to work out.  It would be very well worth an inquiry, because, if that could be done&mdash;it could only be done if the profits tax were distinct from income-tax&mdash;we could abolish a very considerable amount of the price and profits control which operates in a rather unsatisfactory way.  That is perhaps a dream.  I do not think it is impossible.</P>
    <P>Whether that be practicable or not, the commission should certainly carefully consider how far it would be possible or wise to treat profits ploughed back into a business as of a different character from distributed profits and to base the taxation on <Col N="139" /> them differently.  Profits distributed, as distinct from profits utilised for the development of a business, seem to me, from the point of view of the State, totally different things.  It is true that the profits paid out may, perhaps, be wisely put into further development, but how is the State to know?  It may also be blown on entertainment.  But profits retained and used for the development of the business, which can be seen by the inspector in the accounts, are adding to the potential taxation, and, therefore, are something which it should be the clear and definite policy of the State to encourage.</P>
    <P>If you ask the average businessman just casually as to what most of all requires examination in the income-tax code, he will probably say wear and tear allowance on plant and machinery. I am not going to develop that in detail.  It seems to me that it is not so much that wear and tear allowances need to be amended as that it is necessary to reconsider the basis as to what is profit and what should be assessable profit.  In the present income-tax code everyone knows that the profits on which taxes are assessed are very different from profits such as any competent accountant would pass for the purpose of showing to the shareholders or the public.  An effort should be made to get these two together.  That might mean a higher rate of tax on profits but, as far as I am concerned, speaking as a businessman of some experience, I would rather pay a higher rate on my actual profits than a lower rate on profits plus what I had not made at all.  It is not easy to say what are the profits of a company but I am pretty certain that the present code could be improved.  As a general rule, however, it may be said that the real profit in any year is the balance of income over expenditure after provision has been made for annual depreciation and for the amortisation of all moneys spent on assets which will be used up in the making of profits.</P>
    <P>We have had a period of industrial development.  Parties argue with each other as to which of them can claim the greatest credit for it but I seriously suggest to this House and to <Col N="140" /> both Parties that we have been overtaxing that industrial development because of the method of taxation and that, perhaps, in some case of bad management but, in the main as a result of taxation, too much of its capital assets are being used up.  I believe that any proper national industrial development should provide out of its profits the replacement of all its wasting assets so that the next generation should have a thriving, healthy, sound, modernised industry.</P>
    <P>I challenge anyone who will carefully examine the matter to deny that with our present taxation as it is operated it will be impossible for Irish industry, taking it as a whole, to do what is demanded of it, that is, to reduce costs, increase output and attain to the greatest efficiency.  To do that it must have the resources to instal the latest in plant and machinery and to be up to date.  It cannot do this on the present allowances.</P>
    <P>The commission of course would hear expert evidence from accountants and others, who would examine whether my experience is the same as that of others.  They would be able to look into the whole matter and it could be carefully examined.  I maintain that there is just as strong a case for a commission of inquiry on that as there is on Schedule E.  I agree with what Senator O'Brien has said and I fully accept his case, except for some minor details.  I think his case is extremely strong, but I do not think it is any stronger than the one I am making.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of allowances for wear and tear and obsolescence of machinery, any experience I have had is that the inspectors are prepared to do the best they can within the rules which they are operating and there is no question of unwillingness to realise the position and apply the regulations in the fairest way possible; but the fact remains that obsolescence and wear and tear allowance are based on the original cost.  Machinery which before the war cost £100 will probably cost £300 or £400 now and unless you can find some method of dealing with that you are bound to have dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> At the present time, for every reserve for depreciation of plant over and above the wear and tear allowance, which is based on cost, the State takes 9/- in the £ from every company which is subject to Corporation Profits Tax.  That means that in order to provide £1 for improvements you have to provide 29/- out of profits.  In Great Britain and Northern Ireland an attempt was made to meet this difficulty by what was called an initial allowance on new purchases of plant to replace old.  I think that has been abolished.  Possibly it was too expensive. I do not follow closely the position in the United Kingdom but several firms have told me they have benefited very considerably by it.  It would not necessarily be suitable here, in any case.</P>
    <P>There is, I believe, another matter which should be examined, that is, some provision for dealing with the cost of new buildings.  I think that over 50 years 2 per cent. is allowed in England, but I am not quite certain of that figure.  It is only the principle I am dealing with.  What I suggest is that it is in the national interest to encourage the erection of new buildings where required, in preference to repairs.  If the cost of repairs are allowed, as they are allowed, for business and industrial premises it is a temptation to see if you can do repairs to make an existing building last another few years.  Money is spent on repairs which in many cases would have been sufficient for rebuilding. With a better arrangement some of our towns might have been partially rebuilt.  I am not quite sure of the position in Great Britain, but I think 2 per cent. is allowed on industrial buildings and I think that the recent committee recommended that that 2 per cent. should be extended to most business buildings.  There again I am not sure of the exact position, but this is certainly a matter which requires consideration and examination here.</P>
    <P>I have probably spoken long enough, but there are one or two small points which I would just like to mention and I will not attempt to argue them.  I do not think there should be any restriction of the period during which <Col N="142" /> business losses could be carried forward. I think that should be looked into.  The losses incurred in the last year of business should be set off against profits for the previous year. That would be a big help in the case of business that have a loss.  I am only mentioning these points, though they are of importance.  Another small point, but an important one, is that the cost of an income-tax appeal, especially if a firm wins it, should be allowed as an expense.  Another point which has come to my notice on more than one occasion is the question of legal costs on a lease, where there is a lease of business premises.  If the premises are leased for, say, 25 years, I think the legal costs should be allowable over the 25 years, because that is a business expense over the period.</P>
    <P>I have spoken too long and it is too late now to deal with Schedule A tax and the whole question of revaluations. Possibly someone else will deal with that.  Any commission of inquiry into income-tax would get a very considerable amount of evidence on which they would be able to reconsider the whole position of the Schedule A tax.</P>
    <P>When this motion was put down a good many months ago and I sat down to prepare some notes for a speech, I received a document, I think it was in connection with anti-partition, in which there was a most interesting report about the Attorney-General in the Six Counties, which provided surprising support for the point of view of some of us.  Mr. Warnock was reported as saying that the British system of taxation was altogether unsuited to the Six Counties and was resulting in the over-taxation of the people in that area.  It may be thought that Mr. Warnock had been reading Arthur Griffith&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that he was more likely to be expressing the feelings of his own supporters. No enthusiastic supporter of partition like Mr. Warnock could possibly object to paying the British rate of tax. <Col N="143" /> Therefore it seems to me that it was the British system of taxation as applied to Northern Ireland to which he objected.  I am not going to make any point about this except to say that it set me wondering if it would be possible to have a joint commission. In the dissatisfaction over the operation of income-tax I have a sort of feeling that we might have a united Ireland.</P>

      <P>At this late hour I do not intend to speak at any great length.  I rise to support the motion and I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it.  I wish to compliment Senator George O'Brien on the masterly way in which he spoke to the motion.  It was indeed a pleasure to hear him speak on a subject which he has studied so exhaustively.  It is hard to find any new argument which would add emphasis to the need for an inquiry.</P>
      <P>When Senator Douglas also put his name to this motion it was obvious that he would deal with those matters which he and I have in common, matters under Schedule D.  I will content myself with emphasising what he urged in connection with undivided business profits.  I think the Minister knows the part that undivided profits are playing in small businesses in keeping those businesses alive.  I know, of my own knowledge, of businesses where profits have been left in the business by the owner and these have been heavily taxed by the State. The business has then fallen on evil times and the net result has been that in advancing years the owner has found himself without a business.  He could have taken out the profits when they were made and exhausted them but he left them in for development and they were taxed, and the evil result of that has been to leave him high and dry.  I would stress that as one of the many things which could be debated at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have promised not to go into this question at length.  I will content myself with saying, as Senator Douglas has said, that businessmen, manufacturers and industrialists join in <Col N="144" /> welcoming this call for an inquiry just as enthusiastically as Senator George O'Brien and the white collar salaried classes to which he refers.  In conclusion, I hope the Minister will agree that this is something that is divorced from party politics in every sense and I hope that he will find it possible to accept the motion and implement it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Senator O'Brien on the very able case he has made for an inquiry relating to the revision of the law in connection with income-tax.  I would like to support the case he has made with reservations.  I was particularly struck by a lot of the defects which both he and his seconder brought to light.  I really think they made a very good case for an allowance in the case of sickness.  We all understand that sickness in a family reduces the income very much while the illness continues. If possible, I think an allowance should be made for travelling and such expenses.</P>
      <P>There was also a very good case made for a reduction in the taxation on profits which go into a business.  It would be a very good thing for the State if it were possible to refrain from taxing profits which were ploughed back into a business.  In agriculture people live from hand to mouth and for many years there were no profits, with the result that our agriculture and economy were reduced. There is a very strong case from the national point of view to refrain from taxing profits ploughed back into industrial production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien raised the question of the extension of income-tax to farmers.  He pointed out that the objection to this might be the fact that agriculture is of supreme importance to the country.  That is true.  To-day, above any other time, when agricultural production is absolutely necessary, is not the time for imposing any additional burdens upon the agricultural population.  It may not be realised but the real trouble with agriculture for the last 100 years was that the land was absolutely devoid of capital.  The urban people did not <Col N="145" /> seem to realise that agriculture production could not go on without any capital any more than a bed of seeds could be made to grow unless it was watered.  That condition of affairs has existed almost up to the present day. Even to-day the farmer's position is not at all what some people think it is.</P>
    <P>A few days ago the Minister for Agriculture announced an increased price for wheat.  This will result in a good deal of taxation on the consumer. There will be demands from other branches of agriculture, but all those are necessary.  Additional taxation will be imposed on the consumer in order to maintain, not alone to speak of increasing agricultural production.</P>
    <P>There is one branch of agricultural production which is very prosperous. I refer to cattle, the prices for which have gone up within the last 12 months. But that is only a temporary phase. Cattle prices were low up to a few years ago and the moment this temporary scarcity is over prices will go back and it would not be wise to interfere with the prosperity of the cattle trade at the present.  Dairy farmers and tillage are in anything but a prosperous condition.  They require additional help from the State and it would be unwise to impose any fresh burdens on the agricultural community as you would have reactions by way of decreased production.</P>
    <P>Another point is that rates are increasing year by year.  So far as one can see they are bound to continue to increase.  The burden of these rates is very heavy, especially on large lands where the valuation is high.  Some of these valuations were imposed as long ago as 100 years.  The valuation is too high on some land that has deteriorated in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that there is a graver issue involved than that of the revision of the income-tax code.  I refer to the general burden of taxation. If it were possible to reduce the burden of taxation by agreement it would be very beneficial.  This burden of taxation has been growing year after year. It is not a question of this Government or any Government, since every Government will henceforth come into <Col N="146" /> office at a time when taxation is increasing and inflation is prevalent.</P>

I hope that his appeal for an inquiry into the income-tax code and the tax system generally will be effective and that a commission will be set up.</P>
      <P>It ought to be abundantly clear to everybody that what is wrong with this country is that the tax imposed on both industry and agriculture is far too heavy.  Recently many of us have read reports that have been published by the E.C.A. which have stressed the fact that the tax on industry in this country is amongst the highest in the world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that the law relating to <Col N="147" /> income-tax is in urgent need of revision and requests the Government to appoint a commission of inquiry on the subject at an early date.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the reasons why I am asking that the commission should be appointed.  However, I will desist now that I have made my point.  I would like to point out that if the continuance of that method of collection was intensified many industries that are making immediate payments to meet claims properly sustainable against their workers will find themselves in bad odour with their bank managers before Christmas is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress the amazing popular chorus of disapproval of what is happening. I do not say it is an injustice but it is unwise, I will admit.  Might I say that one of the things which the commission should do is to bring about <Col N="148" /> some change in the income-tax forms so that the ordinary man may be able to interpret them?  It is known generally that the average man finds it nearly impossible to understand the forms sent out by the Revenue Commissioners. I do know that it is asking for the moon to request a simplified form so that everybody can understand it, but at least the form making a claim on an individual for return should be simplified much more than at present.  As regards my own form, I had to send it to my auditor to be satisfied that my replies to questions on it were correct.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that so long as we have a country which is costing one-third of our total producible wealth to run we must have some form of taxation. It seems we are starting at the wrong end of the stick and, instead of inquiring into income-tax, we should inquire into the whole of our country's economy and find out what justification there is for running a country which is producing, between agriculture and industry, £340,000,000 at a cost of £110,000,000.  We might in that connection consult some of the bigger businessmen who can run their businesses on a smaller percentage than that.</P>
    <P>So long as we are running the country in a wild fashion, we shall have to have taxation and no matter what Party is in power taxation will be necessary.  I agree with Senator O'Brien that we took over a system of taxation and of income-tax in this country which was entirely unsuitable and we did not set out with imagination and fresh thought to see how we could adapt to our economy a system of taxation much more suitable instead of one inherited from an industrial régime.  We shall have the people with business technique on the commission and a psychiatrist as well, because only a psychiatrist can explain to me why we have this system of taxation.</P>
    <P>This system of P.A.Y.E. might be investigated.  I know from my own experience that there is more discontent amongst the workers of this city who have been suddenly called upon to pay their taxes than I have ever <Col N="149" /> known before.  Some of them said to me that if they had been told what time they owed income-tax it would have been paid.  I know of a man with several children who will not get a penny piece of payment until next January.  P.A.Y.E. would obviate any misinterpretation and income-tax harshness.</P>
    <P>There is general appreciation of the fact that some people and classes are not paying their proper proportion of taxes.  I do not know why that should be allowed to continue and I am not going to argue for any particular class. The economists who are much more able to do so than I am have argued and said that if taxation were paid on the basis of all who should pay contributing, then the tax would not be higher than 3/- in the £.  If that is the position I suggest we should examine the whole matter and see that in the cause of social justice, such as Senator O'Brien argued for, people who are overtaxed should be relieved of some of their taxation by people undertaxed or not taxed at all.  I do not think that the Minister, with his sense of social justice, would object to any investigation on that line.</P>
    <P>The proportion of taxation which has been taken out of industrial profits is, to say the least, having an extraordinary effect on our whole economic structure, and it seems to me a form of cock-eyed economy where we have the Ministers and the Government straining these industrialists to work hard and build up a new industrial arm and no sooner is that industry set upon its feet than it has to give a blood transfusion to keep the whole country going.  In other words, it is being seriously overtaxed, as Senator Douglas says.  I think that these people who make wild statements about the extraordinary profits made by manufacturers and industrialists ought to examine their returns to find out what they are actually making; they would discover that many of the industrialists who started from patriotic motives are now in the doldrums trying to survive and paying taxation at the same time.  The Minister is fully aware of the statements <Col N="150" /> made by chairmen of public liability companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems to me, then, that all one can do is pray for the dead and leave it at that, because if I am not to be allowed to talk about the things I am aware of, I will not be able to carry on with my arguments. Speakers before me referred to the allowance for depreciation and wear and tear of machinery and I hope that I will be allowed to reinforce their statements in that regard, that it is having a most deleterious effect on industrial progress.  It has been argued for many years that there should be a greater allowance for buildings and we have argued until we are sick about the necessity for a greater wear and tear allowance in respect of machinery. We have pointed out that, in other countries, and particularly in America, there is a quick write-off and, in my opinion, and it is the opinion of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, no great industrial progress will be made or any export market developed, if we do not face up to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot continue to produce goods on old machines without fresh capital, but hoping that, in time, when we get an obsolescence allowance in respect of the old machines, we will be able to replace them at a higher price. Only yesterday I saw a company report in the papers which stressed that fact, that wear and tear and depreciation are matters of paramount importance to the industry of the country and I hope that portion of the examination by this commission will be devoted to that aspect.  I am quite certain that <Col N="151" /> this Government, like its predecessor and all previous Governments, are vitally interested in the development of an export trade.  I know that the Minister, as Minister for Finance, trying to balance his Budget, is anxious that our imports should, so far as possible, be balanced by exports, but I assure him that I cannot understand the Oliver Puff attitude of preserving a type of income taxation which, on one hand, deprives the industrialists of the opportunity of producing goods efficiently and competitively and of finding an export market and, on the other hand, charges them to the limit in income-tax for doing so.</P>
    <P>This is a many-sided question and there are a good deal of arguments to be put forward one way and the other, as to whether the present system of collection of income-tax is the right system or not, but it is quite obvious that the time has arrived when it is necessary to inquire into it.  Senator O'Brien has stressed that, in this changing world, the one thing that has remained static is our income-tax code, and it is an extraordinary commentary upon this new Ireland of ours that the one thing we possibly disliked most in the days of our rebellious youth is the thing that has remained longest with us.  I am quite sure that the present Minister, in his rebellious days, or his associates or any of our Governments, never wished that we should preserve a form of taxation which was an anachronism.  It is rather strange that we should do so and in that connection I again stress the necessity for a commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I should like that commission to face its task with an open mind and with a completely non-Party attitude, and, so far as I am concerned, I want to reiterate what Senator O'Brien said. I am not speaking from any Party point of view.  I give credit to the Minister and his associates for being just as much interested in national progress as I am.  For many years, I thought they were wrong in clinging to a fiscal system of which this income-tax code is part.  I still think that. The one mistake we made was that not alone did we import and absorb <Col N="152" /> a wrong fiscal system but we took this tail-end of income-tax, too.  I still remain of that opinion and so long as we have that system, with this part of it which affects our whole economy, there is a necessity for this commission. I hope the suggestion will be taken in the spirit in which it is offered, a spirit of regard for good national considerations. An excellent plea was made for it by Senator O'Brien and I hope it will be accepted in the spirit in which he offered it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was very ably proposed by Senator O'Brien and I should like to congratulate him up to a point.  Up to that point, I should be very strongly in favour of the arguments he advanced.  He wants to inquire into the law relating to income-tax, which, he says, is in urgent need of revision.  I suppose that everybody paying income-tax is convinced that it is in very urgent need of revision. The learned Senator said he spoke for his constituents, but I do not think he spoke for all his constituents, because I have the feeling that quite a number of his constituents came from the rural districts and were quite enthusiastic supporters of his.  I know quite a number of them, but I do not think they would be just as enthusiastic in support of all the case he has made here. From the history we have been given of the law relating to income-tax, that law is very old.  It is an import and it is unfair in the times in which we live. So the argument has been advanced by Senator O'Brien.  It might not be a bad thing to have this inquiry, but it might happen, at the end of the inquiry that Senator O'Brien would not be any better pleased with the results than he is to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about one aspect of the argument he made when he indicated that he thought some members of the farming community were not making their just contribution under the existing income-tax law.  He did, it is true, say that any effort made to spread the net wider would still permit the great bulk of the farming community to escape, that there was, in fact, only a limited number of farmers who would come within the scope of any new laws drafted.  If these are the only people whom he <Col N="153" /> wants to catch in his net, is it worth while trying to spread the net at all? He might go fishing and bring home no fish.  I do not know that the section of the class for whom he speaks would be very much better off in the end.</P>
    <P>He indicated a view which he thought might be advanced in defence of the farmer, namely, that he was engaged in an occupation very vital to the country, especially in regard to our balance of payments&mdash;the amount of the productivity of the land which goes abroad to pay for exports.  He went on to say that there were other producers in the country and they, too, might make a similar claim and he asked where would that get us.  If such a commission as suggested were being set up, I should like to see the terms of reference and I think I should like to see stated in those terms of reference the importance of each class in the community to the community as a whole.  That would be a very vital consideration in any terms of reference and I think the farmers would occupy a very high position.  I think the exemptions which that class could rightly claim for the welfare and benefit of all the community would be so high that the burdens the other would have to carry would, in the end, not be any lighter.  I suggest that, if we are to have an equitable tax code, it should be related to the importance of each section to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>What would the country do without agriculture?  Where would our industries, our professional men, and our white collar workers be if agriculture was not bringing the benefits which it is bringing to the nation as a whole? The suggestion that there are some farmers not paying their fair share of income-tax is one that cannot be allowed to pass.  I agree with Senator O'Dwyer who has stated that there are some farmers paying heavily.  I think even Senator O'Brien will concede that there are some farmers paying a great deal of income-tax.  They had the right to say whether they would pay on their profits or their valuation, and I would remind Senator O'Brien that when they are paying on their valuation the farmers are, in fact, paying twice, for, in addition to their income-tax, <Col N="154" /> they have to pay rates to the local authority on that valuation.  A farmer with a valuation of £100 or £200 is to-day paying at the rate of 27/- or 30/- in the £ as compared with 2d. or 3d. in the £ many years ago.</P>
    <P>The Griffith valuation has been referred to during the course of the debate, and nobody knows better than Senator O'Brien who has made a valuable contribution to the economic side of Irish history, that land was valued at £2 an acre and on that £2 an acre the farmers who paid 1/- in the £ at that time are to-day paying 27/- and 30/- in the £.</P>
    <P>That is the picture as I see it.  These are the sections of the community who, Senator O'Brien thinks, are not making a fair contribution to taxation to-day.</P>
    <P>I will make this concession to Senator O'Brien, that he made an able case, giving us a clear indication of what the motion could do for a particular type of worker in a narrow way.  That is what his case was so far as I could picture it.  He was very concerned about one section of the community who can escape income-tax, and he was inclined to the view that sections of the agricultural community were escaping and obviously he is attracted to this point of view because he has adverted to it before in this House, though this time he was a little milder in his approach to it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien will, I think, be answered by the Minister for Finance on the issue which he has raised.  I think it ought to be within the competence of the Oireachtas to examine the income-tax law as it is.  I am certain that there are evasions and that some people are paying more than they are able to pay in a particular year.  I do not think that any of us thinks that the income-tax law as it relates to ourselves is equitable.  At the same time, I think that it is important for Senator O'Brien to realise that, as far as that section of the farming community is concerned, they are bearing their fair share of taxation.  One of the greatest handicaps of the agricultural industry is the lack of capital, and if they were making the high profits <Col N="155" /> which are suggested it was a wonder that there was not some evidence of their ploughing those profits back into their farms.  I think that if we want to do the best possible service to the nation we would not try to get the farmer to pay more money to the Minister for Finance from whom he would not get it back, but to plough it back into the land.  In that way it would show results and the nation would be richer by increased production and increased exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of Senator Baxter and the discussions generally are a most healthy symptom in the Seanad, because they indicate that we are beginning to divide on a vocational basis.  Usually we have been divided on a Party basis, and I have always deplored that.  For that reason, and that reason only, I say that Senator Baxter's speech is encouraging, but it was an exaggeration of Senator O'Brien's reference to the farmers.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien's speech was balanced and, in the course of a balanced survey, he referred to the farming community.  But to imply that that speech was mainly destructive criticism of the farmers is simply absurd.  The object of the motion is to have a general survey of the field and the whole purport of Senator O'Brien's speech was that in any general survey of the field&mdash;and Senator O'Brien will be the first to act honourably on the results of that survey&mdash;the whole problem should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that we have to face three different kinds of injustice in the present code.  There is the injustice that some people are not paying income-tax who should be paying it; there is the injustice of the various forms of taxation as it bears on the various types of payers; and, thirdly, there is the injustice between the various sections of payers.  There are these three classes of injustices and I think we must bear that in mind. There is, for example, the general injustice to payers of income-tax that if the Revenue Commissioners make a mistake and it is not detected within <Col N="156" /> three years, that mistake is irrecoverable, whereas if the payer makes a mistake the Revenue Commissioners can correct it at any time.  On the other hand, if we, the payers, make a mistake and it is detected at any time later we must pay up.  If the income-tax collectors were infallible, that would be a just rule, but the fact is they are not.  I know from direct evidence within the last two years that mistakes are quite often made.  In one case the whole of an earned income allowance was omitted, to the extent of £250, in an assessment.  It was detected by the payer and was put right, but if he had not detected that within three years he would have lost the best part of £120.</P>
    <P>In this year the whole remission for life insurance was omitted in an assessment.  A letter was at once sent to the income-tax collectors correcting that point.  No reply has been received within six weeks.</P>
    <P>I want to make something quite clear.  I entirely agree with those who have stated that on the whole the income-tax authorities do their very best to see justice done and to show courtesy to all their clients.  But the fact is they are overworked at the moment.  They are in arrears in many cases and some of them are making mistakes.  When there is this injustice that if those mistakes are not rectified within three years we must suffer for it, such injustice should be put right.</P>
    <P>There is a second point, a more specific point in connection with Schedule D.  It involves a general principle of taxation on notional incomes.  It has been pleaded in many quarters that taxation should simply be of actual incomes.  In some cases it happens like this: if the notional income is less than the actual income then the taxpayer has to make up the difference; if, on the other hand, the notional income is more than the actual income then the taxpayer has no redress.  He has to pay on the higher figure in both cases.  That is an injustice.</P>
    <P>There are other special points&mdash;the dependants' allowance of £50, for example.  How can that be considered <Col N="157" /> sufficient in the present state of affairs? A friend of mine has to support two elderly female relatives.  He gets the princely remission of £100 a year for supporting them.  It is quite grotesque.</P>
    <P>There is the general point that Senator O'Brien emphasised, that is, the differences between Schedule D and Schedule E assessment.  Why should Schedule D and Schedule E have the difference that those who pay under Schedule E must necessarily incur their expenses&mdash;why should that word &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; be added&mdash;when those who pay under Schedule D simply have to incur them wholly or exclusively?</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate that by relating an experience I had travelling in a train from Cardiff to Swansea last year.  I happened to be an extern examiner for the University of Wales and had my modest expenses for that.  Opposite to me in the dining-car was a commercial traveller.  He began with sherry; he went on to a bottle of wine; he ended up with brandy, while I sipped the local variety of water as contentedly as I could.  When I discussed the desirability of being in his situation he said: &ldquo;Oh, it all comes out of the expenses.&rdquo; And eventually it will all come out of the income-tax allowance because he is on Schedule D and I am on Schedule E.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senator Hayes will develop that in argument later on.  Some businessmen friends of mine send me very pleasant Christmas cards and I welcome them but they get them out of their income-tax allowance, I understand, because they are Schedule D.  I, being Schedule E, may not send Christmas cards out of my income-tax allowance. It is a simple illustration which drives home the injustice of the code.  That is the kind of injustice that exists between Schedule D and Schedule E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to something and to be more serious in its treatment, although the other matter is equally serious in its effects, surely the present taxation of husband and wife is wrong.  I could quote the Constitution on this but I <Col N="158" /> will spare you.  The fact is this: At the moment a brother and sister, both earning an income and living together, can, I understand, get considerably greater relief than a husband and wife. If I am wrong on that, please correct me.  So I am informed.  If that is so, it is against several clauses in the Constitution which insist that the wife's duty is to work in the home and to keep the home together.  But if the husband who is bearing the financial burden of this gets no consideration for the very great deal of work that the wife is doing in the home, is that justice under the Constitution?  I think not.  In the case of husband and wife, they should at least be given twice the single personal allowance, just as brother and sister both working would get twice the single personal allowance.</P>
    <P>I see that the officials present are looking at me askance at that point and I am open to correction, but I do argue that the wife is working just as hard in the home as that sister in the office, and the income-tax code should take account of that.  The wife gets no earned income allowance just because her husband has produced all the income.</P>
    <P>These are general points.  I shall omit one or two others I would have liked to mention.  We need a commission on income-tax.  There is no doubt about it.  I hope the Minister will concede that.  But, it will take a good deal of time, as the Royal Commission in England is bound to take a good deal of time.  Meanwhile what can be done?  I do suggest that the Minister for Finance and the officials of his Department, in preparing for the next Budget should keep in mind what has been said in this debate and be merciful on Schedule D.</P>

      <P>I wonder if every Senator is supposed to demand this commission and if every Senator is supposed to know what alterations are required in the income-tax code? Judging by the debate so far everybody seems to want an inquiry into the iniquitous income-tax code.  Every speaker wanted certain alleviation for one section and possibly extra contributions from other sections.  A former <Col N="159" /> Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, the late Mr. Hugo Flinn, once wanted abolition of income-tax. In this debate, nobody has suggested the abolition of income-tax.  It would be a great idea, if we could get on without it.</P>

      <P>He would have to be original.  I thought I was being original in the suggestion.  Actually I do not suggest it because we as a people must pay our way and the Government acting for the people must pay its way and must get the money to pay its way.  Unless there is some alternative method of getting the money to carry out the duties of the State, income-tax must remain. Another point that occurs to me in connection with an alteration in the income-tax code or the possible abolition of it is the unemployment that would be created.</P>

      <P>We are not on the abolition of income-tax.  The subject matter of the debate is a revision of the present income-tax code.</P>

      <P>Abolition would be a very drastic revision.  I am one of those salaried officials who have no means of escape from income-tax.  We naturally assume that other people have some means of escape.  The debate has been an education to me, to find that other Senators speak of other groups who allege they have no means of escape either and who demand redress.  The businessmen, for whom Senator Douglas has spoken, demand an inquiry also with, of course, the idea of redress to suit themselves. Senator O'Brien also touched on other vocations towards the end of his speech and I am not going over the points which he put so magnificently, all very relevant and showing how hard it is on the salaried official or white-collar worker to make ends meet when this income-tax code lies so heavily on him.  He mentioned the display expenditure in industry and I was wondering when Senator Stanford was speaking <Col N="160" /> if the Christmas cards he spoke of were included as display expenditure for businessmen and in that way they got the cost of their Christmas cards allowed in the income-tax claim.</P>
      <P>The third section of the community Senator O'Brien mentioned is the agricultural community and I must say he referred very softly to them to-night. I agree with Senator Baxter that he was not so soft on previous occasions. I do not know how many farmers pay income-tax, but they must be very few. However, until every farmer has the same display expenditure as the businessman he should not be asked to pay income-tax.  I want to see all industry prospering, but there is a form of thought to-day that if a farmer has a motor-car he is opulent, yet no little business will be a business at all unless the owner has a big car to display that he is doing well.  Possibly that is display advertising.  Until the farmer is able to take a fortnight's holidays or most of a month&mdash;as I am able to do, though I have to take something in coming here to the Seanad&mdash; he should not be asked to pay income-tax. When he is able to pay £4 a week in agricultural wages and put by £5 a week for every son and daughter working on his land and still have a surplus afterwards, let him pay income-tax, but not till then.</P>
      <P>Even when prices are good&mdash;and they are better to-day than in years gone by&mdash;he has a long way to go before his standard of living and his general status in the community are such that he can be designated as liable for income-tax.  At present he cannot allocate for each child the same amount as he has to pay the agricultural labourer that he employs, he has to get that labour from his family free gratis and for nothing and hopes for the best in the future, to be able to educate them.  When he is in a secure position, with a standard of living comparable to that of the salaried earners like ourselves living in the city, he may be charged income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We who are salaried officials hope that when we reach old age we will get a pension.  We have that security. Until the farmer is in a position to <Col N="161" /> hand over his house to his son and has sufficient money to build a dower house or cottage on the land for himself in his old age, there should be no question of asking him to pay income-tax. When that day comes it will be an admirable one for agriculture.  Then we will not have those late marriages, the younger people will be able to go to work, with the older ones in a comfortable position enjoying what might be compared to superannuation in the salaried classes.  That I would say is the day when the farmer may be asked to pay income-tax to supplement the revenue of the country.</P>
    <P>I started by saying the salaried official is in a difficult position, with no means of escape.  I am passing over the arguments made by Senator O'Brien as to whether industry does <Col N="162" /> or does not escape the rigours of the income-tax code.  Even though I feel we are in a difficult position for income-tax ourselves, I deprecate the idea that the farmer has reached the stage where there should be a general demand from any part of the population that he should pay income-tax while his present burdens lie heavily on him.  I hope the day will come when the farmer will be able to do it.</P>
