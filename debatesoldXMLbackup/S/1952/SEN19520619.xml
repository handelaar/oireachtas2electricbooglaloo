    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When the House rose last night I was about to deal with what I described as the disedifying section of this Bill dealing with the removal of the dance tax.  The Minister for Finance, who was present at the time, immediately interjected a remark with regard to the removal of the Supplementary Budget taxes on beer and tobacco by the inter-Party Government in 1948.  That defence for the action of the Fianna Fáil Government in inserting Section 14 into this Bill was also made by the Minister for Finance and some of his colleagues in the Dáil.  I want to say quite clearly that there is no parallel whatever as between the two cases.</P>
      <P>So far as the taxes on drink, imposed in the Supplementary Budget, were concerned, there was a pledge given publicly by members of the Fine Gael Party, by members of Senator Hartnett's former Party, by members of the Labour Party and others, that if the Fianna Fáil Government who had been responsible for these taxes were defeated in the general election, these taxes would be removed.  That was a pledge publicly given and honoured within two or three weeks of the formation of the inter-Party Government. It is a question which the people were asked to decide at the General Election of 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were no backstairs bargains entered into such as have taken place in relation to the removal of the dance tax in this year's Budget.  There is no <Col N="1534" /> parallel whatever as between the two cases.  In one case the electors had an opportunity of giving their decision. The Government which was then formed were given the opportunity to fulfil the pledges which they had given. Those pledges were fully and speedily honoured by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to the dance tax?  What is the position in relation to Section 14 of this Bill? I do not believe I could describe it any better than has been done by an Independent Deputy in the Dáil elected for the same constituency as the Minister for Finance, an ex-Minister of the previous Government now supporting the Fianna Fáil Government.  At column 201 of the Dáil Debates of 23rd April he had this to say in relation to the dance tax:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the removal of the dance tax was extremely foolish.  I simply cannot understand it.  I think it is a very foolish thing to have done. Politically also I think it is a very foolish thing to have done.  I think the Minister will come to feel that it is a very foolish thing.  I do not see how it can be justified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those were the views of an Independent Deputy, representing the same constituency as the Minister for Finance, in relation to this particular section in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>What had the Minister to say with regard to its removal in the Budget statement?  At that time no one knew, so far as the Minister was aware, of the bargain which had been entered into.  In his Budget statement, as reported in column 1147 of the Dáil Debates of the 2nd April the Minister tried to put this case across:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am proposing a concession as regards entertainments duty.  Dancing has been the victim of varying fortune in this regard.  The duty on entertainments was first imposed in 1916 but payments for the right to take part in dances did not come within its scope until 1932.  In 1946 the tax, as applied to these payments, was abolished but was restored by my predecessor in 1949. <Col N="1535" /> Dancing is the only amusement which is discriminated against by levying a tax on active participants as distinct from spectators.  I have never been quite convinced that the discrimination was justified by any social purpose and I propose to abolish it altogether as from the 1st August next.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the justification given by the Minister in Dáil Eireann when making his Budget statement.</P>
    <P>Later on, that was amplified somewhat by the Taoiseach who, on 23rd April, as reported in columns 228-9 of the Dáil Debates, made out the case that the dance tax was costly and difficult to collect and that it was not worth while collecting £140,000 a year. The case made by the Minister for Finance and by his Leader was, No. 1, that the tax was not justified because it was only the participants in the entertainments that were being taxed and, No. 2, that it was a difficult tax to collect.  Neither of these reasons is the true reason why the tax was remitted and I propose to place on the records of this House the reasons why the Government decided to remit the tax on dances.  I want to quote a letter, dated the 15th May, 1951, written by a lady called Kathleen Morris, secretary of the Irish Ballroom Proprietors' Association, to the members of that association.  This letter has been already placed on the records of the Dáil and I think it right that it should also go on the records of this House, because it is a complete exposition of the manner in which this tax came to be removed.  This lady writes to the members of the association on the 15th May, 1951, when the last general election was in progress:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>At a special meeting of the executive of the association held on 8th inst. it was decided to communicate with the Fianna Fáil Party, they being the Party responsible for the abolition of dance tax in 1946 and having since vigorously opposed the reimposition of same by the Coalition Government, requesting them to inform the association of their intentions <Col N="1536" /> regarding the abolition of tax, should they be returned to power.</P>
    <P>I am to inform all members of the association that I have received what the executive consider to be a favourable reply from Mr. Lemass on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, a copy of which you will find enclosed.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of this reply from Mr. Lemass, a further executive meeting was held to-day, the 15th inst., when the meeting confirmed their pledge of support to Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then with a touch of dry humour this lady starts the next paragraph of the letter as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be appreciated that the association is entirely non-political and that having failed utterly to impress the previous Government or Minister for Finance, though it pointed out the hardships caused to ballroom business, to clubs hiring the ballrooms, musicians, staffs, etc., the association has now no alternative but to support the Party who has indicated that they are prepared to repeal this tax as soon as it is practicable.</P>
    <P>The association has decided that the support to Fianna Fáil should take the form of substantial financial help and also that all members, both city and country, should lend a hand in every possible direction to secure the return to power of the one Party who has given the association an indication that they as a Party are opposed to this undesirable entertainment tax on dances.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that, in order to have the desired effect, our financial aid must of necessity be generous.  I may mention that one leading commercial ballroom in Dublin has headed the list of subscribers to this fund with the generous sum of £250 and other members of the executive have also indicated their willingness to subscribe very generously.</P>
    <P>Whilst the association does not specify any particular amount to be subscribed they request you in your own interests to give as much as <Col N="1537" /> possible.  I shall deem it a great favour if you will reply promptly as time is getting short before the general election, and if we are able to help it must be done immediately. Thanking you in anticipation,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Kathleen Morris,</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Secretary).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the letter sent by the secretary of this association to the members. That was the letter which was designed to gather in funds for the Fianna Fáil Party in the general election.  That was the letter which was withheld from the public until it was quoted in Dáil Eireann.  Yet we have the Minister for Finance and his leader, the Taoiseach, standing up brazenly in the Dáil in an effort to persuade the members of that House that this tax was being abolished because it was in some way unfair or in some way difficult to collect.</P>
    <P>What was the true position?  A bargain was struck, the money was paid and the tax was removed.  These three short sentences sum up this whole disreputable business, and because that tax was removed, in some way the money which Fianna Fáil have handed back to the members of the Irish Ballroom Proprietors' Association has to be found elsewhere in this Finance Bill.  Even though, having regard to the total amount of taxation imposed by this Bill the amount may not be very great, £140,000 would build a considerable number of houses in any town or village in this country, and £140,000 would do something to assist old age pensioners and I.R.A. pensioners throughout the country, but the Minister prefers that that money should go back to the dance-hall proprietors in order to conclude the bargain which was struck in May of 1951.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister at least admit to the people that that letter gives the true explanation of the extraordinary action of the Government in abolishing this tax.  At a time when the Government is trying to persuade the people that every brass farthing that can be squeezed out of the people is essential for the administration of the country, <Col N="1538" /> at a time when food subsidies are being abolished, when beer, tobacco and petrol are going up in price and when every housewife will have to pay more at the end of the week for her bread and her butter, her tea and her sugar, the Fianna Fáil Government think nothing of giving back £140,000 to the dance-hall proprietors to honour the bargain they struck.  At least it can be said of them that when they are bought they stay bought.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I wish to deal with is the reference made by, I think, Senator Kissane to Marshall Aid.  The Minister for Finance and other Ministers&mdash;notably the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;have been endeavouring to convince the people that there was something wrong in accepting Marshall Aid, that that was something Fianna Fáil would not have done had they been in office in the years 1948-51, and that it was bad management and bad government to have accepted Marshall Aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely summarising the general attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not pretend to be quoting the Minister.  Had I known that we would be honoured with his presence to-day, I am sure I could have found something in my clippings to enable me to quote him.  I do not want to be taken as pretending to quote the Minister because I am not doing that.  I think I have summarised fairly the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to Marshall Aid or, at any rate, their propaganda in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts in relation to Marshall Aid?  Is it not true that the first steps to obtain this aid were taken by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947 and the originating document which led ultimately to the granting and acceptance of Marshall Aid was signed by the present Taoiseach, who was also Taoiseach in 1947?  Is it not true that the present Taoiseach, during the election campaign of 1948, referred to Marshall Aid as an act of unprecedented <Col N="1539" /> generosity?  Is it not true that every member of the Fianna Fáil Party supported the acceptance of Marshall Aid in the Dáil?  Certainly none of them opposed it.  It was opposed by only one Deputy, an Independent Deputy now associated with the Government.  He is not the gentleman to whom I have already referred. He is the gentleman who, for his pains in opposing the acceptance of Marshall Aid, was, no doubt with the acquiescence of Senator Hartnett, expelled from the Party with which he and Senator Hartnett were at the time associated.  He is the gentleman who was described in such terms by the present Minister for Finance that I would not now like to blacken his character by repeating the expressions used.  First of all, I do not believe they were true.  But that is what he got for his pains in opposing the acceptance of Marshall Aid.</P>
    <P>Has that gentleman now persuaded the Fianna Fáil Government that he was right and they were wrong?  Has he persuaded Senator Hartnett that Senator Hartnett was wrong?  What is the explanation for this change of attitude on the part of the Government? Why do they now try to discredit their predecessors for having accepted Marshall Aid, which was arranged by and originated with the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947?  If there was something wrong in accepting and in spending Marshall Aid, why is it that when the inter-Party Government left something in the region of £25,000,000 worth of American dollars the Fianna Fáil Government, instead of returning that money to the United States stating that they did not want the money and never wanted it, proceeded to spend that money here? Indeed, the Fianna Fáil Government spent twice as much Marshall Aid in six months or 12 months as the inter-Party Government spent in three and a half years.</P>
    <P>Will the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or the Minister for Finance, or some Minister, give us an explanation as to why this change of attitude has come about?  Is it that he Independent Deputy to whom I <Col N="1540" /> have referred has managed to persuade the entire Cabinet that he was right, or is it merely that they are afraid to offend him?</P>
    <P>The general financial position has already been referred to at some length and I do not propose to deal with it any further.  I think the Budget impositions will bear very heavily on every section of the community but they will bear most heavily on those sections that can least afford to shoulder them. I appeal to the Government and to the Minister to call a halt to the policy adumbrated in this Finance Bill and in the Budget statement until the people have had an opportunity of deciding on the issue at a general election.  If, as the Minister has endeavoured to persuade the people, there is a very grave issue to be solved, and if, as the Taoiseach has endeavoured to persuade the people, the very independence of the country is at stake by the acceptance or non-acceptance of Government policy by the people, why have they not got the courage to go to the people, submit their policy to them and let them decide whether or not they want that policy implemented?</P>
    <P>The Government should stay its hand until the people have had an opportunity of deciding on the issue.  Within the next few weeks the people of three constituencies will have an opportunity of giving their decision in relation to this particular matter.  If the decision given by those three constituencies is such as to indicate that the people do not want the present Government and its policy, and if there is any honesty, decency or democracy within the ranks of the Government, then the Dáil will have to be dissolved and there will have to be a general election.  Why not wait until after that general election?  Why complicate matters now and make it more difficult for the next Government to get things back again on an even keel?  I hope the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will do his utmost to persuade the Government that it would be reasonable now to submit its proposals to the people and to await their decision before attempting to implement this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has not put this Bill before the Irish people with any great pleasure. The Party to which he belongs sought the decision of the Irish people last year and, as a result of that decision, the Taoiseach is now charged with the responsibility of governing the country. The Government made certain promises during the election campaign and the Government must now fulfil those promises.  The Government has introduced this bill of £100,000,000 odd, which has been so widely denounced up and down the country, in the Dáil and now here.  If the last speaker and the previous Government had remained in power that Government would be doing the same things and that speaker would be defending the Party to which he belongs.</P>
      <P>It is time that some honesty crept into the public life of this country. Yesterday evening we heard Senator O'Higgins denouncing a Minister of State who, he said, was at the beck and call of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain.  He said that he went to him and discussed the proposal that the food subsidies should be removed. I am not accepting that that is true.  No matter what Government may be in power the Irish people should not be told by a member of this or the other House that a Minister of State went to England or elsewhere and made a bargain with a foreign Minister to the detriment of his own country.  That, in effect, is what this House was told yesterday evening.  I am not accepting that such a statement should be made no matter what Government is in power, this Government, the previous Government or any other Government.  The time has come for that type of propaganda to cease once and for all.  We have a fairly mature national and local Government and I do not believe that the Irish people will swallow that propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has been associated with the Government in putting this Bill to the country.  It is his business to see that the revenue is collected to maintain the State services. There are things in this Budget which were not put there with any pleasure. <Col N="1542" /> If the facts which are so objectionable to so many people were faced and if the previous Government had discharged their responsibilities instead of borrowing, the bill we have to meet would not be so big.  The bill to meet principal and interest of the dead weight debt of this country over 26 years between 1922 and 1948 was £4,000,000 and between 1948 and 1952 it was something like £10,000,000, so an enormous amount of money must have been borrowed during the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>If the previous Government had not borrowed that money they would have had to find it elsewhere, through taxation, I take it, and they would have had to get it in the way the present Minister is getting it, by increasing the duty on cigarettes, beer, whiskey and so on.  Because they borrowed the money they did not have to increase those duties.  If they had remained in power, however, they would have had to do the same as he has done.  Consequently, I cannot accept the denunciations of this Budget in this and in the other House during the last couple of months.  It is not a very likeable Budget but it is better to be honest. If we have commitments they must be met.  If a Government is elected to carry out a certain programme, then their job is to do so and to tell the people what the bill will be.  The people have been told in no uncertain manner by the Minister for Finance what that bill is.  It is his duty to see that the money is collected and properly spent and at the end of 12 months he will come to us again to tell us how he has spent the money and we will be in a position to criticise him or otherwise.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal from Senator O'Higgins about the tax on dancing.  I am not a dancer myself but I think it is better to face facts. The tax applied in towns with a population of 500 or over.  In County Meath there are five such towns, Navan, Trim, Kells, Oldcastle and Athboy. Suppose that a tax inspector went to a dance in Oldcastle to inspect the tickets, he might have to travel 50 miles, his expenses would be 50/- and that might be more than the State <Col N="1543" /> would collect in tax.  He might go to Trim or Athboy the following week and the cost of a car for the excise officer would be more than the State would get out of it.  There are other villages in the county and why should they go tax free?  I do not see why certain sections of the community should pay a tax on dancing while other sections do not.  I am sure that the Department of Finance knows, as everyone knows, that practically everyone who ran dances went out of their way to evade the tax.  They looked upon it as objectionable.  If they paid the full amount they found that they just could make no profit.</P>
    <P>It was well known in the Department of Finance and all over the country that something would have to be done about it, that the law must either be enforced properly or cancelled. Irrespective of what previous Senators have said, I think that the Minister has done the right and proper thing in doing away with the dance tax.  I think that the propaganda against it was unjust, insincere and dishonest.  No matter what the propaganda at present may be, no matter what Deputies or Senators may say, the people of the country will say that the Minister for Finance has done the right thing in repealing the tax imposed a few years ago.</P>
    <P>There are several other things in this Budget which have not been denounced and which I am sure are quite acceptable to the Irish people.  The Social Welfare Bill which has gone through the Dáil and Seanad and has become law will cost a lot of money.  Old age pensioners and other people will benefit, but if people are to benefit someone has to pay.  I believe that the Minister has put an honest Budget before the people.  Senator O'Higgins may say that he should have sought a mandate from the people of the country but the people may give him such an answer in the next few days.  It is not with any pleasure, I am sure, that the Minister and the House ask the Irish people to meet this bill, but if a Party makes promises to the people and is elected, I believe that it is its duty <Col N="1544" /> as a Government to fulfil those promises.  The Minister has put the Bill to the Irish people and I am prepared to support it and to recommend the Budget to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that the longer I remain in this House the more confused I become.  I cannot understand at all how a House composed as this House is on a vocational basis can have so completely misled itself in its beliefs, and the blacks and whites I see constantly before me confuse my mind tremendously and make it very hard to think clearly on a matter of such fundamental importance as this Finance Bill.  I am sorry the Minister is not here himself because after listening to his speech and to the arguments of his protagonists I thought of suggesting to him that he should have sub-titled this Bill after the title of the well-known novel, &ldquo;All This and Heaven Too&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that, sitting back and trying to be impartial, looking with an unprejudiced mind at all the arguments pro and con, I get the impression that there is an element of what I might describe as three-card trickery about the whole thing.  I do not say that in any offensive way.  You have this amazing contrast of increases in taxation and, on the other hand, allowances giving it back.  It is, as it were, that sometimes the Minister shows the queen and you make a mad bid for it, only to find that the other card turns up.  That is the element which seems to be the whole motif of the Bill and of the method of taxation.  I think it is one to be deplored.  It is a sort of deception which is employed on the people on the lines of: &ldquo;We know we are doing wrong.  We are charging you more than you probably like to be charged but we are giving some of it back to you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, it is the familiar trick of the accomplice coming along and after three efforts turning up the queen and getting paid once in a dozen times.  I do not say that that is any more true of this Minister's method of finance than it is of his predecessor's, but I think it is an objectionable method <Col N="1545" /> of presenting a Budget to the people &mdash;this method of manipulation, of being harsh on the one hand and giving sweets to the child on the other.  It is a sort of deception and it is not fair that a Bill of this nature should be presented in that fashion.</P>
    <P>This Bill is really an account of our housekeeping, and whether one is justified in saying that the house is costing too much or too little is entirely a matter of opinion.  I have not been influenced at all by the speeches for or against the Bill so far.  I am influenced only by the fact that the total value of industrial and agricultural production in the last year for which I can find the figures in the Statistical Abstract, 1950, were: agricultural production, £133,000,000, and industrial production, £211,000,000, making a gross figure of £344,000,000 of total national production.  I relate this to the cost of central services alone this year, £94,000,000, and as an ordinary businessman I feel that the relative cost of running the central services in a nation of our capacity is far too high. It is 25 per cent. of our total producible capacity and I do not know-the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may be able to enlighten me because he is more in touch with the later figures than I am&mdash;whether there is any other country on a comparable basis of production paying as high a price for running its house.</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking in general terms about this Bill being justifiable or not.  One would need to go through every Department, and to go through it with a fine comb, to see if the country is getting value for money from them all.  There is a general feeling abroad that, with the exception of the higher strata of the Civil Service, we are not getting the value from the others, the junior members, for whatever wages they earn from the State. I am not now attacking the Civil Service because the Civil Service is a body which is not able to answer back, here or elsewhere, but there is a feeling that there are too many teas at 11 o'clock and too much time used in taking them. I often wonder, without any disparagement of the Civil Service, <Col N="1546" /> whether there is a sufficient check kept on the civil servant as such during working hours.</P>
    <P>This Bill of £94,000,000, however, applies to much more than the Civil Service.  I should find it very difficult to go through item after item and say that it should be increased or reduced, but there are two items which I see have been reduced and the reductions are, I think, symptomatic of the type of mind which has produced this Finance Bill.  I think it deplorable, because the two Votes which have been reduced and which to my mind should be increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understood these were portions of the taxes and that I could discuss them.  If I get a bill from my shopkeeper and if I am allowed to discuss only the general amount, without discussing what he charges me for tea and sugar, there is very little use in discussing it.  I understand, however, that I can discuss these matters later on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins referred to the dance tax and I refer to it now, not so much because of its removal or continuance, but because of the peculiar mentality symptomised by its complete removal.  There are people in this country who say we are not working hard enough, that we are not producing enough, that we will have to strive harder and do more, and, on the other hand, we have people saying: &ldquo;People have been paying £140,000 in taxation on dancing and enjoying themselves and we will make them enjoy themselves more by removing this tax.&rdquo;  It is, as it were, a sort of Morris dance! <Col N="1547" /> I cannot understand the mentality behind that action.  Was there any reason, apart from the mere matter of cost of collection, for its removal?</P>
    <P>I am not accepting all that Senator O'Higgins attributes to the Minister as being correct.  That is a good political case but I am not interested in politics <i>per se.</i>  I am interested rather in the motive and the mind behind these things&mdash;the type of mind which says that the country is spending too much, eating too much and not producing enough and which then helps people to entertain themselves. I should be the last to remove their pleasure from them, but it is a queer mentality which gives rise to these contradistinctions.  I cannot understand why that tax was removed. This sum of £140,000, as Senator O'Higgins pointed out&mdash;and it cannot be rebutted&mdash;would build a lot of houses for the people.  If it were a type of tax which was impossible to collect or which was not a paying tax, I could understand it, but I should like some explanation of its removal.</P>
    <P>This again is symptomatic of the desire&mdash;I am not speaking particularly of the present Government but of all our Governments&mdash;to finance unproductiveness. The great proportion of the money being voted under this Bill &mdash;and I say it with all due respect to the people who will get it from various sources&mdash;is being voted for unproductive purposes.  The two sections which I was about to quote might have been slightly productive but the greater proportion is for unproductive purposes. How long this country can keep on paying out almost one quarter of its total productivity for a method of living which in the main is unproductive in itself is something which I would not like to forecast.</P>
    <P>We simply cannot go on in this country at our present rate of living or rather at our present cost of living, if I can put it that way.  The whole tendency is to divert money from sources where it would be more profitably employed to sources where it would be employed by the State.  This taxation will ultimately come from the people who are producing things.  The <Col N="1548" /> greater proportion will come from the people who are the producers and will be spent by the people who are producing nothing.  I am not saying that the recipients are not working conscientiously but there is an extraordinary anomaly here that we have the City of Dublin growing at an alarming rate and we have a hinterland growing into a wilderness as fast as can be. It does not matter what Government is in control of this country, so long as we continue that sort of financial policy we are not going to go ahead.  We simply cannot go on with this gorgon's head, eating its body.  It is mainly unproductive.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what side of the House you sit on.  You are elected on a vocational basis and you must view the problem impartially.  Whether it is the present Government or past Governments who must accept the blame, we must face up to the responsibility of saying that our housekeeping is too dear if that is the fact.</P>
    <P>We have here at the present moment, unfortunately, between 50,000 and 60,000 people unemployed.  I know a great many of these people are situated in areas where there is unemployment at certain periods of the year.  I have been trying to find out whether there has been any canalising of that unemployment. I understand the procedure at present is that the unemployed man goes to the labour exchange and signs up.  After that, the only thing that is done is that when there is a vacancy notified to the exchange, the exchange advises the inquirer that so-and-so is unemployed.  There does not seem to be any analysing of what these people can do, whether their occupation is carpentry, bootmaking or anything else.  There does not seem to be any contact between the employer and those unemployed men.  In a country which has a population of 2,750,000 people the figure of 60,000 unemployed is appallingly high.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking politically&mdash;as a Party man.  I am speaking as an ordinary member of the Irish public, and I think this figure is far too high and that some effort must be made whereby we can reconstruct our whole method <Col N="1549" /> of financing production in this country, thereby removing this unemployment as far as possible.  There will always be unemployables to some extent.  We know that.  However, surely out of 50,000 or 60,000 unemployed there must be many of them who could be employed if steps were taken to see that unemployment was created for them.  The <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash; miracle of miracles&mdash;has published a radical article from which I wish to quote.  The date is the 18th June, 1952. It bears to some extent upon this matter of unemployment in this country.  They are talking about gold and they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Gold, as King Midas discovered to his cost, is not synonymous with wealth.  For purposes of trade we pretend that it is; but if all the gold that is now lying in vaults were released into the market&mdash;places of the world its value would fall away catastrophically.  Too high a price can be paid for this determination to keep the golden calf as an object of superstitious revels.  For example, it has been necessary, in the interests of the sterling area's gold reserves, to put up the bank rate, and interest rates in general.  One of this country's urgent needs is that more money should be made available for capital expenditure.  For this purpose a low bank rate and low interest on loans by the banks are desirable.  In order to protect gold, in fact, we may be sacrificing the chance of an increase in productivity which, at some later date, might render us sufficiently wealthy for gold to start flowing in freely from less happily situated countries anxious to buy our surplus products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They go on to add:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are we not paying too much attention to gold, and not enough to the sources of real wealth?  It should not be long before the nations realise that gold has had its day, and that some new economic deity, less hungry for human sacrifice should take its place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a most extraordinary leading article but it just shows that those <Col N="1550" /> who were deemed the crackpots have got a most peculiar following or are developing a most peculiar following. What this article means, in effect, is what I said in another way.  We must alter our whole method of finance in this country to such an extent that these 50,000 or 60,000 people are not left unemployed just to satisfy some method which is already outmoded. If we do not do it, as sure as night follows day, this ideology called Communism which we hear so much about will at some time come.  We hear a lot of talk around us about the danger of Communism but I see very little positive effort being made to put a new ideology in its place or towards operating successfully some other ideology.  Instead, we sit back and talk about the dangers of Communism as if the world had stood still 20 years ago and we make political Party capital as fast as can be while the world is falling around our feet.</P>
    <P>I believe that the total effect of this Finance Bill will be to add to the general depression already existing. There is no use in the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs saying, as he will say and as the Minister for Finance will say, that this is not peculiar to us, it is world wide.  That is not a sufficient reply.  This country has not got any counterpart anywhere else.  These comparisons with England are all wrong because there you have a strong industrial arm and a very weak agricultural arm, whereas here you have a strong agricultural arm and a relatively weak or not so strong, at any rate, industrial arm.  You have real wealth in this country.  If the old measures or tokens of real wealth were again used and a brick wall built around the country you would have all the necessities of life.  You would probably have to do without tea and petrol but you could live, clothe and shelter yourself.  In terms of real wealth, this is a wealthy country and with due deference to Professor George O'Brien, who said France was a wealthier country than this, this country was described by leading economists in other countries as probably the second wealthiest country in the world in terms of real wealth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> At the present moment we have in this country a depression that has been created and I use the word &ldquo;created&rdquo; purposely.  We have no inflation.  We have people who still require the goods we can produce; yet we have a continuous scream from all types of industry in this country of falling trade and a growing depression.  I am not going to suggest that this was caused by the fact that Fianna Fáil was returned to power some months ago but I do say, and I have said it before in this House, that the speeches made by the Minister for Finance and the present Tánaiste at a very early stage after their return to power had a very detrimental effect upon trade in general and inflicted a blow upon it from which it has not yet recovered.  I think also that the report of the Central Bank, and the White Paper issued in connection with it, did not do very much to clear away the clouds.  Certainly the present banking policy, under which you have the bank manager on your doorstep or ringing you on the telephone every night, is not going to contribute towards lifting the general depression.  I think until something is done to make people feel that the clouds are not altogether devoid of a silver lining we shall have no improvement in the situation.  It is about time that the Government should endeavour to clear away as quickly as possible the depression which seems to have settled on the country.  They can only do that by effectively controlling financial policy.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about the disequilibrium in the balance of payments. As long as I have been reading economics, I have never known of any country that has been successful in constantly maintaining a favourable balance of payments.  I wonder if the Minister could tell me even at the present moment, because some new arrangements may have been made with the United Nations, what countries enjoy a favourable balance of payments.  Probably the only creditor nation in the world at present is America.</P>

      <P>It would be extremely interesting if the Minister could tell the House what countries enjoy a favourable balance of payments. So far as I am aware this country never enjoyed a favourable balance of payments since the State was established except for a short period during the war.  I do not think there is anything morally or financially wrong in having an unfavourable balance of payments.  After all, money will not buy anything anywhere except goods and services.  We are continually arguing in this House in favour of the development of our export trade, and the greater the deficit in the balance of payments the more certain it is that we shall have to build up an export trade to correct that deficit.  I know it is a rather facetious argument, if you like, but the trade of the world is not going to come to a standstill to-morrow simply because the balance of payments of certain countries is unsatisfactory. This is a question it seems to me that is amplified beyond all meaning, and the seriousness of it can be entirely overrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that, so far as consumer goods are concerned, there is going to be a big fall in imports.  I would say that up to the last six months industrial firms were importing goods which they had bought at the request of the previous Government on a stockpiling plan.  There were many types of goods ordered which had not been even produced when stockpiling commenced, and the result was that large quantities of these goods did not come in until about six months ago. The position is now different.  You now have the extraordinary position that the industrialist who went out and hearkened to the cry that stockpiling was necessary when the Korean situation developed now finds that he has large stocks on hands and that the bank manager with whom he formerly <Col N="1553" /> played golf on Sundays will not even speak to him on the telephone.  He is faced with the position that he cannot find a market for his goods.  That situation simply cannot continue.</P>
    <P>I think that the balance of payments position will rectify itself very shortly to a great extent by reason of the fact that imports, particularly of textile goods, during the coming year will not be at all comparable in quantity to the amount imported last year.  Consequently, when we do secure an improvement in the balance of payments position, I hope that some members of this House will not argue that it has been brought about because the present Government has been returned to power.  It has been brought about simply and solely because stockpiling has ceased.  I want to take the wind out of their sails in anticipation of their using that argument.</P>
    <P>I do not want to argue for or against subsidies.  Like other things in life the question has two facets.  I would say that in certain circumstances subsidies are not alone desirable but are absolutely necessary.  It is largely a matter of personal opinion as to when circumstances justify them.  I was rather amused last night when I read my <i>Evening Herald</i> to see that my friend, Senator McMullen, who sits on my right in this House, in his presidential address to the annual conference of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union in Killarney expressed himself as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So essential is it in our opinion, to maintain the rhythm of our economic life, that in a time of stress like the present if a choice were given us&mdash;an invidious one we admit&mdash;of retaining the subsidies on food or delaying the operation of some of the schemes of social reform which are being introduced and which are costing the nation some millions of pounds annually, we should unhesitatingly decide in favour of the retention of the food subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator McMullen is now absent.  I am sure that it would be an interesting spectacle in this Chamber to find him arguing from the other side of the House in favour of <Col N="1554" /> nation.  In that regard, I agree entirely with the suggestion made by Senator Martin O'Dwyer whose speech, if I may say so, was a model of decency.  I think both he and Senator Douglas on this side of the House suggested that it would be well to set up a commission to examine the whole question of taxation. It should surely not be beyond the capacity or the wisdom of this House to combine with representatives of the other House in a review of our whole method of taxation.  So far as I am aware, the present method of taxation was one which we took over from another State, which, as I have said before, is run on quite different lines from ours.  Whether direct taxation would increase or decrease as a result of such an examination I am not competent to say.  It strikes me as peculiar, however, that a nation, the value of whose total production both industrial and agricultural, amounted in the year 1950 to £344,000,000, requires for central services alone a sum of £94,000,000.  I think Denis Guiney would make a far better job of running the country single-handed than does the Government because I am quite certain that it is not costing him 25 per cent. of his total turnover to run his establishments.</P>
    <P>the retention of subsidies.  I am quoting this statement only for the purpose of showing that people who have been arguing for the retention of subsidies seem to have found allies in unexpected quarters.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that our whole method of taxation calls for </P>
    <P>If such a commission were set up we might with advantage examine the Swiss method.  We might do worse than examine that method both in relation to its form of government and in relation to its administration.  Not so many years ago the present Taoiseach was very interested in the Swiss form of government.  If such a commission is appointed here to examine the incidence of taxation it should also examine the new scheme in Switzerland, a most revolutionary scheme that would shock the tax authorities here, under which the Swiss have decided that every industrialist who employs an extra man will <Col N="1555" /> be allowed an income-tax rebate.  I think I am correctly stating the position. It was reported in the Swiss Bank Corporation Report.  Anyhow that can be verified.  In order to create employment in Switzerland employers were given the incentive of an extra income-tax allowance.  That is not such a foolish idea as it may appear at first sight.  I agree it is absolutely unorthodox.  It has never been done before.  I am quite sure that my colleagues in industry would be prepared to employ all the people they could get if some such an incentive were given here.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea now, though I find myself in the somewhat invidious position of addressing that plea to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with whom I was so closely associated in this matter in the past.  I know that I am speaking to one who has already been converted.  There are, however, others who could give some thought to this matter.  I refer to the depreciation of wear and tear on machinery. This old warhorse has been travelling round the country for many years.  If this, or any other Government, is really serious in its export drive it will have to take some cognisance of the demand made by manufacturers for a more up-to-date approach in their method of computing allowances upon machinery.  There is machinery still in operation here which is completely out of date.  I know that the obvious answer is to get rid of it and an obsolescence allowance will be made. That is a kind of a general evasion of the issue.  It is like the theory that one can sin all one's life and through the medium of a general confession get complete forgiveness at the end of 25 years.  That is not a good or sufficient argument.  The people who deal with this matter should read again the case made again by the manufacturers for these increased allowances.  If we are to hold our own in the modern world with an up-to-date industrial arm the Government will have to help us in every way.</P>
    <P>Politically, we have never been able to make ourselves felt.  We feel that if we had the voting strength that <Col N="1556" /> other sections have the position would have been altered long ago.  Depreciation on wear and tear is a vital matter in our country's industrial progress but so far it has never been regarded with favour by any Government.  We ask for this allowance as a matter of right. Americans write down a machine in four years.  It takes an Irish manufacturer 20 years to write down the same machine.  The allowance asked for would not cost the country a whole lot.  I doubt very much if it would cost more than the dance tax which has been remitted.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tax on tobacco I want to make a special appeal on behalf of snuff takers.  There was a time in the Georgian period, I think, when snuff-taking was the prerogative of the wealthier sections of the community. To-day it is indulged in only by the poorer sections and the increased tobacco tax is imposing a serious hardship on these people.  I know many of these old age pensioners in charitable institutions are suffering untold hardship as a result of the tobacco tax.  I do not believe the Government intended to inflict that hardship and it should not be beyond the competence of the Government to give some concession to these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas pointed out yesterday that out of each £'s worth of goods produced by him the proportion taken in taxation is much greater to-day than it was heretofore.  I do not know whether an analysis has been made of the position but if such an analysis is made it will be found that industrial producers are paying far more than what might be regarded as their equitable contribution.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that this Bill might carry the sub-title &ldquo;All This and Heaven Too&rdquo;.  Looking at the matter dispassionately I know that the country's finances have to be found somewhere by somebody at some time. It seems to me that a bill for Central Services of £94,000,000 out of a total of £344,000,000 is altogether too high and the sooner the country is handed over to a group of businessmen and political Parties disbanded the sooner <Col N="1557" /> will we find a solution for our difficulties coupled, probably, with a readier acceptance of the trials and tribulations prophesied for us in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I come to deal with the Finance Bill generally, I would like to say a few words on some of the matters raised by Senator O'Higgins.  The first relates to the dance tax.  Having listened to a number of speeches yesterday I had hoped that this tax, which was discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> in the Dáil, might be spared us here, but of course Senator O'Higgins brought forth the old warhorse and, he having done so, it might be as well to say a few words on it.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins devoted himself to pointing an analogy between the Fianna Fáil remission of the dance tax and the Coalition's remission of the taxes on beer and tobacco.  Of course, there is one obvious difference between them, which is that the dance tax was one which made no practical difference to the nation's finances, since it was a very small sum of money, whereas the other taxes made a serious difference. His suggestion that whereas the Coalition Parties had made their point of view on those taxes perfectly clear during the debate on the Supplementary Budget of 1947, Fianna Fáil had concealed their views about the dance tax, is not true.  The dance tax was removed by Deputy Aiken, then Minister for Finance, in 1946, and its removal was accepted and supported by all other Parties in Dáil Eireann.  The reasons given at that time were that it was a tax difficult and expensive to collect, that it led to wholesale evasion and trickery on the part of those responsible for running dances and, further, that it hit very heavily charitable and religious organisations throughout the country which find in dances almost their only means of raising money.  For these reasons Deputy Aiken removed the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years later, in 1949, Deputy McGilligan, the Coalition Minister for Finance, put back the tax.  During the debate on that Finance Bill, the points I have mentioned were put very strongly by members of the Fianna <Col N="1558" /> Fáil Party.  They very strongly opposed the reimposition of the tax. In fact, there was no doubt whatever about the views of Fianna Fáil.  They were made public and pressed at length.  If Senator O'Higgins considered the tax on its merits he would be prepared to concede that it is a bad tax and one which should be removed.  The only occasion for accusations such as Senator O'Higgins made against Fianna Fáil would be if that Party had altered their policy as part of a bargain with any private association.  Fianna Fáil made no bargain with anybody and they did not alter their policy.  In remitting this tax Fianna Fáil have done only what they did in 1946 and have carried out the policy which they enunciated in public on numerous occasions for years past.</P>
    <P>The other question which I would like to mention briefly, and which Senator O'Higgins raised, is Marshall Aid. Senator O'Higgins said that the main tenor of Fianna Fáil speeches regarding Marshall Aid was that the Coalition Government should not have accepted it.  Having put that argument as applying to the Fianna Fáil side of the question, he proceeded to demolish it by saying that the preliminary steps were taken by Fianna Fáil before they went out of office.  Of course, nobody in Fianna Fáil said anything of the kind.  What we maintained all along was not that the Coalition should not have accepted Marshall Aid, but that they misused the dollars they received; $146,000,000 were, in fact, received from the American Government by the Coalition during their period of office and were spent not on capital goods, not on building up the country, not on building houses or the like, but on the import of non-essentials and largely on the import of articles which we could have produced in this country.  Of that enormous sum of $146,000,000 the total amount spent on capital goods was only $6,250,000. That is the accusation and complaint we make.</P>
    <P>One satisfactory feature of the debate so far on the Finance Bill has been that we have not heard from anyone the ludicrous accusation, made <Col N="1559" /><i>ad nauseam</i> for weeks on end in the other House, that the Minister for Finance is budgeting for a surplus of £10,000,000.  We have been spared that argument in this House; we are, therefore, spared the task of answering it and we can approach this Budget in a very simple way.  It will be agreed by everyone that a Budget must be balanced.  It will be agreed that if you are going to spend a certain amount of money in any one year you must raise sufficient taxes to pay for it; I take it that there is no one in this House who will disagree with that.  Therefore, in this year as in any other year the problem facing the Minister for Finance is that if there is a gap&mdash;as there is in this year of £15,000,000&mdash;you can only fill it by reducing expenditure or by raising revenue; in other words, by increasing taxation.  It is entirely useless, a waste of time, for the Opposition to criticise this Budget unless they are prepared to do it on that basis, unless they are prepared to suggest in what way the Minister could have reduced expenditure or in what other way he could have raised taxes.  Unless the Opposition are prepared to devote their minds to that problem, they might as well stay out of the matter completely.</P>
    <P>In considering what item of expenditure could be reduced this year, the question of subsidies inevitably arises. It seems clear that in a year where the difference between estimated expenditure and estimated revenue was £15,000,000 subsidies in fact would have to be cut.  Subsidies were originally started by Fianna Fáil during the war years, in abnormal years, when prices were rising very rapidly and it was most undesirable that there should be a vicious spiral of wages chasing prices at a time when very few goods were available.  Surely, nobody on the Opposition benches any more than on this side can conceive subsidies as an item of expenditure which should be permanent.  It is quite clear that they could not be permanent, as permanent subsidies would mean permanent rationing and a permanent bureaucracy at the centre to arrange to take some £15,000,000 every year out of the people's pockets with a further set of <Col N="1560" /> officials to give it back in the form of subsidies.</P>
    <P>The whole machinery of rationing would have to be permanent with all the difficulties caused to shopkeepers and all the difficulties caused to families who would eat more than the rations they were allowed and would find difficulties in getting extra supplies. There was the wastage caused by the fact that cheap flour and bread could be fed to animals because they were the cheapest feeding stuffs available. You had all these difficulties and it was inevitable that some day this problem would have to be dealt with and the subsidies removed.  Nobody knows that better than the members of the Fine Gael Party and the Opposition generally in this House.</P>
    <P>When subsidies were first introduced in 1941 on a small scale, they were opposed by the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, and later on, when, in the Supplementary Budget of 1947, the system of subsidies was greatly extended, it was also opposed not alone in Dáil Eireann and in this House but right through the country, by the same people who now weep crocodile tears over the reduction of subsidies this year.  Senator O'Higgins, when discussing the question of subsidies, said that during the whole period of his time as a Fine Gael member of Dáil Eireann, as a member of the Fine Gael Party and Central Executive, he never heard a single word from anyone about it being Fine Gael policy that subsidies should be reduced.  I am not in a position to say anything about that, but I take it he was at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis in 1950 and listened to the president of the Party, General Mulcahy, speaking on that occasion. On 16th February, 1950, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, General Mulcahy, in dealing with this question of subsidies, spoke as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A good deal of the money is being given out to those who could well afford to do without.  There must definitely be a reduction in the burden of subsidies on our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we must agree with that argument and we must agree with Deputy Mulcahy that, in the year when there was an enormous gap to be filled in <Col N="1561" /> the Budget, it was essential that some item of expenditure should be pruned, and that in pruning expenditure, something should be taken off the subsidies. The Minister has, of course, replaced the subsidies to some extent by benefits in the form of increased children's allowances, increased old age pensions and increased unemployment assistance, so that those who are least able to bear the burden will, either in whole or in part, be compensated for the removal of the subsidies.  Further, in regard to those sections of the population who pay income-tax, the great majority of income-tax payers will be compensated, and in most cases more than compensated, for the removal of subsidies.</P>
    <P>Even with the saving brought about by the cutting down of the amount spent on subsidies, there was still a sum of £11,000,000 to be raised in taxation, and the Opposition, instead of going around the country talking about the poor man's pint, about the price of the packet of cigarettes, about the price of petrol and the other taxes which are being raised, would be much better employed in coming here and suggesting what other taxes should have been raised instead of the ones the Minister proposes to raise.  The position&mdash;it should be clear to anyone&mdash;is that the great bulk of taxation in this country will always have to be in the form of indirect taxes.  There are very few rich people in Ireland.  In the year 1944, as shown in the national income report issued in recent years, of the non-agricultural population, the percentage with incomes over £750 per year was only 2½.  That has presumably risen by a certain amount since, but it is quite obvious that a great majority of the people have relatively small incomes and if one is going to raise taxation, it must, in general, be in the form of indirect taxation, that is, taxation on such things as beer and tobacco.</P>
    <P>Are the Opposition to bend their minds at all to the question of suggesting an alternative?  I do not think they are.  I think this Budget has shown quite clearly, not alone from the speeches in Dáil Eireann but in this House and by members of the Opposition throughout the country, that their <Col N="1562" /> interest in this Budget is to use it as a stick to beat the Government with; that they are not prepared to spend any time or any effort on taking a constructive line about it or suggesting any alternative.  I believe that the people, in the opportunity they will shortly get, will also accept the view that this is a good Budget&mdash;a good Budget because it faces up to the problem which Mr. McGilligan was not prepared to face up to: that if you have expenditure you must have taxation, and if you are going to spend a certain number of millions in the year you must raise that sum of money.  This Budget accepts that and it has done so in a manner which will place as small a burden as possible on the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, made a statement which has aroused a good deal of feeling, it would appear, on the other side.  He pointed out that well over half the total amount of taxation raised in this Budget should have been raised last year, but was not raised by his predecessor.  There were statements made by Senator Hayes and others that the Minister should not have said that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>He attacked the Minister most severely for making the statement and we were left under the impression that it was a thing which was not done &mdash;to point out that over half the total sum raised in the Budget was due to Deputy McGilligan and the fact that he did not raise this sum in his election Budget of May, 1951.  How can one consider this Budget without adverting to that point?  The Opposition are apparently to be permitted to go up and down the country attacking the Government right, left and centre for the enormous amount of taxation, as they put it, which they are raising, and when the Minister points out that if Deputy McGilligan had done his duty last year, less than half the total sum would have to be raised this year, he is attacked for doing so.  The Opposition, it would appear, want to have it both ways.  The Minister has <Col N="1563" /> approached this task of balancing two years' Budgets in one with courage and imagination, and I am convinced that the people are prepared to accept such burdens as are laid upon them in this Budget in order to avoid the disaster which comes to any country which allows itself to engage in a series of unbalanced Budgets.  This is a good Budget, a fair Budget and a Budget which I believe the people will accept.</P>

      <P>There is no conflict in the opinions in this House that this bill is a very severe one.  Various reasons are given as to why the country has to face it, but the people giving these reasons do not seem to be agreed as to what those reasons are.  We are told by one section that our independence is at stake because of the manner in which the inter-Party Government administered American assistance or Marshall Aid.  The Taoiseach himself says that our independence is at stake, but he does not specify the quarter from which that independence is threatened.  In so far as the administration of Marshall Aid by the inter-Party Government being responsible for this measure is concerned, I think Senator Hayes very effectively disposed of that argument when he pointed out that the negotiations which led to Marshall Aid were, in the first instance, participated in by the present Taoiseach and Tánaiste, both of whom were enthusiastic about the assistance given by America not alone to this country but to other countries as well.  The Taoiseach, if I think aright, went to the trouble of going out to the scene of the conference and expressing the hope that the progress made as a result of that conference would be continued in the future.  No sane person in this country believes that our status is threatened by America, a country that has always been on the best of terms with us and from which we got help and encouragement in every trouble and in every emergency that the country was ever in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people, however, who attribute the reason for this Budget to the visit paid by the Finance Minister to his opposite number in <Col N="1564" /> England before he introduced his Budget into the Dáil.  Those of us who may have read the write-up that our Minister got in the <i>Sunday Press</i> the Sunday before he travelled over to England will recollect that it was pointed out that this conference was a very serious matter, that our standard of living was at stake as well as the size of our pay packet.  We were also informed that while our Minister would give a very patient hearing to Mr. Butler, whose country was up against it, he would undoubtedly inform him that the interests of Ireland came first.  We were also told in that particular article about the arguments that the Minister was prepared to put forward and the top rate cards he was prepared to play to safeguard those interests.</P>
    <P>He did not tell us when he came back as to how he played those cards or whether he played them at all.  The country had to depend for information as to what transpired on a statement made by the English Chancellor of the Exchequer when, in paying a compliment and speaking in eloquent terms of the loyalty of the various countries of the British Commonwealth of Nations because of the manner in which they rallied to the mother country in her trouble, he also stated that he had received a letter from the Irish Minister for Finance to the effect that his Government appreciated the difficulties they were in and were prepared to take steps to resolve them.</P>
    <P>I say that many people in the country attributed the severity of this Budget to those steps.  It is a British-made Budget and if people next month have to pay almost double prices for important and necessary articles of food it is because of that Budget. People who depend on bread, butter, tea and sugar as the principal articles of food&mdash;and they are the majority of the people in this country&mdash;will be paying next month almost twice the price for some of those articles.  They feel that there was no need for the Budget that made that necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to refer to a matter very ably treated yesterday by Senator Professor O'Brien about the <Col N="1565" /> repatriation of our external assets, but I will say this.  I am perfectly aware of the fact that if it were possible to fund the various sums of money that were transmitted to County Mayo during the years of the war by emigrants from that particular county who had to go to England to work, that money so invested could be effectively used to finance schemes of capital development in their own county.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the dance tax.  In this connection my mind goes back to the time when that tax was remitted before and I can assure the Minister that the patrons did not get the benefit of the remission.  Those who promoted the dances continued to collect the full figure of admission.</P>
    <P>Personally, I regard this Bill as a very severe one.  It is regarded as severe by the vast majority of the people.  I have yet to find outside this House anyone who tried to defend it. I believe it was designed for the very specific purpose of collecting a surplus that would be used at some opportune time perhaps in the manner in which the remission of the dance tax was used.  People see through these things at the present time.  It is not so easy as it used to be to pull the wool over their eyes.  I am satisfied that if they get an opportunity they will have no hesitation in informing the Government in their own way what they think of the matter.</P>

      <P>I spent yesterday listening to a very interesting debate on matters arising out of this Finance Bill and making notes of the various points that were made by the different speakers.  That started in my mind several trains of thought and I would like, in the space of not too many minutes, to give the House the benefit of some of those trains of thought and pieces of information that I happen to be possessed of.  We all realise that the Minister is faced with the necessity of balancing a gap of some £15,000,000 which he feels ought to be met from current receipts on revenue account.  I hope we are all agreed that current expenditure should be met out of current revenue and that <Col N="1566" /> taxation must be adequate for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The only alternatives are, of course, either to reduce expenditure or to increase taxation and to some extent the Minister has done or is doing a bit of both.  There has been a lot of talk about subsidies.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on going as far as he is going in removing subsidies, while, at the same time, expressing the regret that he did not go the whole hog and remove subsidies entirely.</P>
      <P>If I remember rightly the Minister for Industry and Commerce said some time ago that the total cost of the subsidies was a matter of some £15,000,000, and if he had removed those subsidies completely and compensated the worst-off victims of that policy to the extent of some £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 he would have gone nearly the whole way towards bridging the gulf between revenue and expenditure and would only have to find a matter of some £4,000,000 out of taxation.  What he does propose in this Budget, in removing subsidies, is to effect a gross saving on account of subsidies of £6.7 million, which is compensated for by an additional expenditure on old age pensioners and others to the extent of some £2,000,000, if I am right in that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the net saving on reducing the subsidies is only a matter of just under £4,000,000.  It really is a very tiny proportion of the total subsidies that is being removed. The bulk of the subsidies will, in fact, still remain.  The removal of even a small portion of the subsidies is about one of the most unpopular things a Government could do, and if in the forthcoming by-elections they lose one, two or three seats, it is quite likely that the partial removal of the subsidies will be one of the principal causes.  There is an old proverb that a Government or anyone else might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.  I am sorry that in this case the Government did not elect to be hung electorally, if it must be hung, for the whole sheep instead of one tiny lamb.</P>

      <P>Leaving the subsidies on bread and flour.  I am still right in saying that a substantial proportion of the subsidies still remains.  I am sorry you did not abolish the whole lot.  Those who denounce the reduction of the subsidies represent what is being done as an increase in the cost of living.  So it is, in one sense, but obviously if the Government had retained the subsidies untouched, they would have had to find at least £4,000,000 more taxation than they are now proposing to find. So, if the cost of living would have remained lower by reason of the retention of the subsidies, the cost of living would have been affected in the opposite direction by the necessity to pay £4,000,000 additional taxation.  In fact, these subsidies are a kind of inverted indirect taxation.  The subsidies work in an artificial way and make food, for example, artificially cheap. Apart from the ordinary objects of indirect taxation, I want to see things bought and sold for a price that represents their real economic cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we must all have been interested and impressed by Senator Professor O'Brien's lengthy and learned disquisition about the whole economy of this matter and we must all appreciate his, on the whole, non-partisan approach to the problems under consideration.  I should like to emulate that approach, in so far as the approach was non-partisan and somewhat academic.  It does not follow, of course, that we necessarily agree in every matter he raised in the discussion. He began by saying that there is no immediate danger of depression, world or otherwise.  That is a matter of opinion and people who are concerned with the textile industry, not <Col N="1568" /> only in this country but in every country in the world, are very much concerned with the fact that there is a serious depression in the textile industry.</P>
    <P>When we realise the fact that $60,000,000,000 are being spent on rearmament in the huge economy of the U.S.A., we might ask ourselves what will happen if in the near future, that vast pouring out of dollars should suddenly be reduced, what will happen to the gap in demand represented by an expenditure on goods and services of the money now being distributed to the people making munitions of war.  If, for any reason&mdash;an outbreak of peace for example&mdash;industry in the U.S.A. were suddenly deprived of the demand represented by anything like $60,000,000,000 of purchasing power, there might be a terrific depression, in comparison to which the depression of 1929 was only a flea bite.  I am not sure whether the danger of such a depression is not one of the real dangers threatening the world, second only in importance to the other danger of a third world war.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Brien and Senator Douglas that the Budget, the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill are now the principal weapons in the hands of the Government for framing its economic policy, the principal means by which they can influence, guide and control the direction of the national economy.  In framing their Budget, they have to take into account not only the technical necessity of securing finances to meet their commitments of various kinds, but also what effect their taxation and expenditure policy will have on the general health, tendencies and development of the national economy.</P>
    <P>If there is a general criticism I would level against this Budget, it is that its preoccupation is too much with reduced consumption and expenditure and not enough with the desirability of expanding production of every kind, especially of the kind most appropriate to our economic circumstances.  There is much wisdom in the remark that the burden of any national Budget is lightened in proportion as the national income increases. There is a lot of room for a <Col N="1569" /> further increase in our real national income, if we could only get down to increasing it in the right way and in the right direction.  Senator O'Brien said quite a lot about the desirability of expanding production based on investment and based on saving especially in agriculture.  Senator Baxter said that the State should see that more capital is invested in Irish land.  I shall come to that in more detail presently.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask who owns the land of Ireland and whose job is it to invest money in Irish land?  Is it the duty of the owners or the duty of the State?  We believe in private property and private enterprise.  Private property and private profit are the mainsprings of our national economy.  In an economy based on private property it is surely the duty primarily of the owners of that property to invest their own or borrowed money in the property they hold.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the land of Ireland was owned by a few thousand landlords and most of the farmers were property-less tenants.  Nevertheless, they were the only people who invested any real effort and any real capital in developing the land they did not own. The time came when people rightly said that by reason of the fact that they were the only people really investing capital in the land they had acquired a moral title to ownership of the land.  Let the farmers beware lest if they encourage too much State investment of State money in the land of Ireland, they thereby give the State a moral title to the ownership of Irish land.  I think that is a point of view that ought to be emphasised because it appears to be one which has not occurred to ordinary people who talk about the desirability of investing capital in Irish land.</P>
    <P>There is a good example of the kind of thing that happens when there is large-scale State investment in agriculture, where the land is privately owned.  In England, as Senator Baxter pointed out, there was considerable investment of public capital directly or indirectly in the development of agricultural production.  It took the form <Col N="1570" /> perhaps of artificially high prices rather than of direct investment of capital but there was too direct investment of State-provided capital.  The result is that the volume of British agricultural production has been raised by as much as 50 per cent. as compared with pre-war.  In order to bring about that very desirable result the money incomes of farmers in the United Kingdom have been multiplied by five.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable to bring about an increase in agricultural production but that method is not financially possible for this community, and I doubt whether it is even financially desirable for the British community to pay such an enormous financial price in order to bring about such a comparatively meagre result.  Who gets the benefit? The net result from the financial point of view of the British experiment has been that owners of land in England, including the farmers&mdash;tenant-farmers most of them&mdash;have been presented with a vast unearned increment of financial gain which they can cash in on at any time they choose to give up their farms at the expense of the general community and the general taxpayer.</P>
    <P>That is a form of dual ownership on the basis of &ldquo;heads I win, tails you lose&rdquo;, from the point of view of the State, and I think there should be some more appropriate and rational method of bringing about and encouraging agricultural production here, because we cannot afford the particular kind of financial extravagance which has produced that particular result in England.  Admittedly, we must increase agricultural production. Let us examine the factors upon which an increase in agricultural production depends.</P>
    <P>People talk about fertilisers, about capital, and so on, quite vaguely. Getting down to hard facts, the first thing on which an increase in agricultural production depends is an increase in the number of cows in the country. If I may be permitted to repeat the ancient rhyme: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  Cows are, of course, the basis of the dairying industry.  They <Col N="1571" /> are also the foundation of the dry-stock industry, which happens to be one of our principal economic resources. Fat cattle were being sold 20 years ago at £8 and £9 apiece.  I remember selling them for that myself and being glad to get rid of a few animals at that price.  But that was a disaster for the cattle trade and for the national economy.  To-day fat cattle are being sold for £60, £70 and £80 apiece and, in my view, that is equally a disaster&mdash;perhaps a greater disaster&mdash;for the national economy, because it threatens the very foundation of the possibility of an increase in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The price of beef cattle is now so high that farmers generally are turning into beef animals that they should be putting to the bull and turning into cows.  The number of cows in the country is decreasing.  The number of in-calf heifers was less in 1951 by 34,000 than it was in 1950.  It is probably less still this year.  In the long run the cattle population depends on new heifers being turned into cows from year to year in order to increase and replace existing stocks.</P>
    <P>One of the first consequences of lower prices for beef would be that farmers would no longer be tempted to turn good heifers into beef and would turn them into cows instead. That would be the beginning of a possibility of an increase in agricultural production so far as two-thirds of our agriculture is concerned.  Another factor upon which an increase in agricultural production depends is cheaper feed for poultry and pigs.  For nearly 100 years the basic economy of small and medium-sized agriculture here has been Indian meal.  We almost developed the habit of regarding Indian meal as a kind of corner stone of national small-scale agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>The year 1949 was a turning point in that respect.  Before September, 1949, Indian meal was selling at round about 25/- per cwt.  In September, 1949, devaluation came and in the course of the next year or two the price of Indian meal, as a result of devaluation making the dollar so dear, went up and up until it is now selling at nearly 40/- per cwt.  At that price it just is not <Col N="1572" /> possible to produce pigs or poultry profitably.  Between 1948 and 1950 there was a very desirable revival of pig and poultry production for which the inter-Party Government took credit.  That Government was entitled to a good deal of credit in relation to their policy in that particular respect, but it was based on cheap Indian meal and when that situation suddenly changed after 1950, there was a diminution in the number of poultry and a diminution in the number of pigs and an end of a desirable trend towards increased agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Do not blame the farmers for that retrogression.  They are not such fools as to be prepared to commit financial suicide in order to produce pigs, poultry and eggs for the rest of us to consume.  They cannot do that unless feed bears a correct price relation to the price they can get for their produce.</P>
    <P>A point made by Senator Professor O'Brien in relation to savings starts a train of thought in my mind.  Mere monetary saving by Irish farmers will not increase agricultural production one iota.  One of the curses of the country, and of the Irish farming tradition, is the tendency to save money and keep it saved in the form of untouched bank balances that are handed down from one generation to another or used to provide daughters with a dowry on marriage.  If saving money alone would stimulate agricultural production, this country should be one of the most productive agricultural countries in the world.  As we know quite well, it is not.  On the other hand, without despairing of the future of the capitalist economy, as Senator Professor O'Brien at times seems to do, I would say there are certain modifications of that economy, both in respect of consumer organisation and production organisation, which make it possible to bring about the creative saving of money&mdash;money which is not only saved but is directed almost automatically into useful channels of investment.  As everyone who has studied the matter is aware, the consumers' co-operative movement in Britain is, among other things, an instrument of automatic saving.  The <Col N="1573" /> consumer's dividend is one of the things to which the woman of the house looks forward as a desirable source of income from time to time.</P>
    <P>However, we have not quite the same development of consumers' co-operation in Ireland.  We have a considerable development of producers' co-operation, especially in the important creamery industry of which there are at least 300 examples in the country. Many years ago, when I used to look into the finances of these creameries, the principal characteristic of them was that one or two public-spirited farmers gave a guarantee to the bank, and the credit of the creamery was financed, almost entirely, by the money loaned by the bank on the guarantee of these public-spirited members.  More recently, when I looked into their figures, I found that there has been a considerable growth in the amount of capital that they own of their own, earned from their own activities, and that the extent to which they depend on external finance has been greatly diminished.  In other words, the organisation of agricultural processing has automatically brought about a substantial and desirable growth of savings productively employed in connection with the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that, if we could intensify this co-operative organisation and the whole agricultural business on the lines recommended by General Costello, for example, and by Captain Richards Orpen, and bring about the application of the co-operative method to the details of agricultural production on a parochial basis as well as to the various aspects of agricultural processing on a wider basis, you would automatically create economic conditions in which savings would take place and would be readily applied in the various ways in which savings ought to be applied&mdash;to the use of capital in production.</P>
    <P>The Government is not entirely to blame if it has been unable to bring about a substantial increase in agricultural production.  There are causes inhibiting any increase in agricultural production which are outside our control. For example, the disastrous change in the price of Indian meal <Col N="1574" /> that took place after devaluation in 1949.  But I think the Government could have done more, and could have done it in connection with this Finance Bill, to alter the situation in a sense that would have promoted the kind of agricultural production that we think is possible and desirable.</P>
    <P>I said before that the present fantastically high prices for cattle, especially beef cattle, is perhaps a major economic disaster for the country.  I have been criticised for saying that.  I say it again and will try to explain why it is a serious economic disaster.  It certainly cannot, for at least three years, bring about any increase in the total available number of beef cattle. In the meanwhile, it is making what looks like easy money a too attractive and profitable proposition for farmers of all sizes, whereas they ought to know by this time that only farmers with, at least, 50 or 100 acres can hope to make a living by specialising in producing beef cattle.  If a farmer is making too much easy money by selling beef cattle at the present fantastic prices, he is tempted not to devote quite so much energy to other and lesser ancillary activities, such as the production of poultry and pigs which are also very important from the point of view of the national economy.</P>
    <P>The present enormous price of cattle is a major factor in the high cost of living in the towns.  That is a problem which the Government is constantly faced with and has not been able to do very much about.  If the Government had put a tax of £5 or even £10 a head on every animal exported on the hoof, it would have encouraged the development of the very desirable dead meat trade that is now taking place, and, at the same time, reduced the price to the native consumer of all the cattle wanted for the home market by something like £10 a head.  That would have been a substantial contribution to a reduction in the cost of living.  There are probably at least 600,000 cattle still going out on the hoof every year, and that, multiplied by £10, is a matter of £6,000,000, which would be a quite nice little contribution for the Minister towards balancing the Budget while at the same time reducing the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> There is another possible way in which such an acquisition of money from an export tax might have been used with indirect effects in lowering the cost of living, and direct effects towards encouraging increased production in other sectors of the agricultural economy which are now languishing, I mean the small and medium sized farms, the sectors which must specialise in poultry and pig production. I suggested elsewhere that money raised by such an export tax could, to some extent at least, have been used to subsidise the price of home-grown feeding barley to be made available for the feeding of pigs and poultry, not necessarily on the farm of the person growing it&mdash;in fact quite otherwise&mdash;but in the country generally.</P>
    <P>Ymer barley has all, or nearly all, the qualities of Indian meal and grows very readily on fertile land, giving a yield of two tons to the acre and commanding a price, in a free market recently, of something like £30 a ton.  With a subsidy of £5 or £10 a ton, Ymer barley could be sold to farmers specialising in pig and poultry production at a price something like £20 a ton, which would be very attractive indeed, bearing in mind the present prices of finished pigs and of eggs.  If that suitable price relation between feed, egg and pig prices were restored in this way, there would immediately be a forward movement in the whole process of pig and poultry production in the country, which is the principal side of our agricultural activity which is now languishing.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether members of the House ever see the statistics of Northern Ireland agricultural production. Do people generally realise that there are as many hens in Northern Ireland as there are in this part of Ireland? Do people realise that by efficintly organising the production and marketing of pigs during the 1930's, the pig population of Northern Ireland was increased from about 200,000 to about 600,000 or 700,000?  Of course, it diminished during the war, but, again, I think it is on the upgrade.  If that is possible in that part of Ireland, <Col N="1576" /> surely it is possible here to create economic conditions in which the farmers, through their own initiative and for their own interest, will develop pig and poultry production and emulate, or even excel, the achievements of their Northern countrymen.</P>
    <P>Another worry of the Minister's, financially, is the chronic deficit in the cost of running the Córas Iompair Eireann concern.  I think that he has to find a matter of £2,500,000 in the current year for that purpose.  Anyone reading a recent publication of Córas Iompair Eireann must have realised that the principal cause of the losses of Córas Iompair Eireann is that most businesses and firms prefer to have their own industrial motor transport and, having acquired it, use it to go all over the country and use the railway system as little as possible and only when it suits them to do so.  That is partly the result of their natural desire to be independent of possible strikes and so on, but it is also the result of the exceedingly stupid taxation system which the Government imposed in relation to motor lorry owners, who pay the same tax on their lorries whether they use them only to go to the nearest railway station or to drive to Malin Head and back every day.</P>
    <P>By a simple change in the principle of motor taxation you could make it worth the while of lorry owners to use them only for short distant traffic and, therefore, to use them in co-operation with the railway system, while only those who paid the higher tax would use their lorries to career all over the country, to the discomfort and inconvenience of ordinary motorists.  There should be a lower tax for the owners of motor lorries and vans who elected to confine themselves to a limited radius from their own centre of business, while anybody going beyond that would pay the full tax.  If there was a possibility of saving tax by reducing the distance travelled many lorry owners would find it a good idea to confine themselves to a distance of 20 or 30 miles from their own abode and to do their long-distance business by the public transport system.  That would bring back much-needed trade to Córas Iompair Eireann and go a <Col N="1577" /> long way to wipe out the £2,500,000 deficit.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Senator Baxter's remarks about the credit policy imposed by the Central Bank on the banking system and its effect in restricting agricultural production.  As a matter of fact, whether the Central Bank is to blame or not it is a fact that there are in this country bank managers who are singularly stupid and who know less than nothing about the realities and possibilities of agricultural production and the proper use of credit in connection therewith. I once came across a bank manager who, in dealing with a farmer who had two or three cows, one of which was very much better than the others, advised him to sell his best cow in order to pay a small debt he had in the bank.  Only a lunatic or a bank manager of that type would invite a farmer to sell his best cow.  I happen to know that there are farmers with grass growing up all over the place and who are inadequately stocked with reference to the amount of grass they have.  If they go to the bank, the bank says: &ldquo;No, you must reduce your overdraft. We will not lend you another penny towards stocking your land.&rdquo; That amounts to a decision on the part of the bank to allow the grass to go to waste.  If that is happening in one instance it probably happens in dozens of instances, and it is quite time that somebody who knew something about agriculture persuaded the banking system to behave more sensibly in cases like that.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the butter market is being freed both from control and from subsidy, and I hope that, in a free market, butter will command a price which will encourage an expansion in the production both of creamery and farmer's butter.  There are, however, special problems which will arise when the marketing of butter is once more taken over by the creameries themselves or by some organisation which the creameries may elect to build up. If it is the case that certain creameries, foreseeing that, if they threw all their butter on the market in the near future, it might glut the market and lower the prices disastrously, went to <Col N="1578" /> the local bank and said: &ldquo;We want to borrow with a view to the cold storing of this butter and its orderly marketing during the whole season&rdquo;, and the bank, when approached, replied: &ldquo;No, we will not finance any such proceeding on your part&rdquo;, then that bank knows less than nothing about the principles of banking, its social duties or the obligations of the country to provide for the marketing of butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we could very well have from this course a serious crisis in the butter market with a disastrous lowering of prices leading to under-production, and a disastrous scarcity in six months or a year, then it is important that this difficult period in the private sale of butter should be carefully looked into, and that the banks should play their necessary part in easing the transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Higgins that our problems are not the same as Britain's, and yet perhaps there is a fundamental similarity between the case of Britain and our case, because the fact is that neither the Minister for Finance nor Mr. Butler is a free agent.  They are both in the grip of the inexorable world system, and they both have to do the best they can to try to adjust themselves to a difficult situation which is really beyond their control.  The fact of the matter is that there are now two economic leviathans dominating the world.  If we lived in Finland or Sweden we would be dominated by the great economic leviathan which is centred in the Kremlin, but actually we belong to the sphere of influence of the other economic leviathan, and whether we like it or not we are dominated by the policies which emanate from the capital of the western leviathan in Washington, and not merely by the policies, but even by the absent-minded actions of the 150,000,000 people who live in that vast and terribly important economy of the U.S.A.  One example I have already given is that the devaluation of 1949 was in fact an American policy imposed on a very reluctant Britain, and <Col N="1579" /> accepted by many of Britain's associates.  But the original idea was American, and because America said &ldquo;You must devaluate&rdquo;, they did devaluate, and we and other people were the victims of the consequences.</P>
    <P>It is not only the policies; it is the mere actions of these 150,000,000, even their inactions, that can have the most terrific economic effects on the rest of us.</P>
    <P>After June, 1950, the American Government and people went on a buying spree which sent world prices rocketing. Incidentally, it greatly increased the demand for sterling area raw materials.  Producers of tin and rubber in Malaya and of wool in Australia had a very good time; the dollar pool of the sterling area filled up and everything looked to be for the best in the best of all sterling worlds.  It looked as if Britain was permanently out of the red and into an era of complete solvency.</P>
    <P>What happened?  Again an unpredictable economic event happened over there.  After Easter, 1951, the Americans indulged in a saving spree.  They unexpectedly elected to save $6,000,000,000 or $8,000,000,000 more than usual in a quarter of that year.  I forget the exact figures. If you want them, you can get them in the Economic Surveys of Europe regularly published by U.N.O. They went on a saving spree and, therefore, their purchases of sterling area raw materials diminished considerably and a new sterling area crisis developed which is the one that is worrying Mr. Butler and our own Minister now, imposing all this stringency and the reduction of imports, and so on, on Britain and on us.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we are so dominated by the enormous relative size and importance of the American economy that it is almost no exaggeration to say, metaphorically, that every time an American sneezes it has the effect of a thunderbolt over here.  In a way, it is almost amusing, if it was not so tragic and so dangerous, to observe the seesaw behaviour of the dollar pool and the sterling area, in every case the seesaw movement starting by <Col N="1580" /> some shrugging of American economic shoulders or change in American behaviour which nobody could foresee. But, behind it all, there is a much more ominous feature of the long-term sterling situation and that is the increasing trade of Japan and Western Germany, which is increasing at the expense of British trade in critical areas of the world market.  We must not forget that Japan and Western Germany are now the whiteheaded boys of American diplomacy.  Britain comes a long way behind them in her relative importance in world politics.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring before you some of the facts about the recent expansion of Western Germany's trade and its indirect effects on the solvency of the sterling area which is directly a concern of ours.  On page 73 of the Economic Survey of Europe for 1951, you will find the following facts set out: The volume of British exports to Western Europe was, in 1951, 1 per cent. less than in 1950.  The volume of Western Germany's exports to other countries in Western Europe was 90 per cent. more in 1950 than in 1949 and 41 per cent. more in 1951 than in 1950.  Is it strange that Britain is now losing gold to E.P.U. as well as to everybody else?  More important is the index of the increasing volume of Western Germany's exports to overseas countries, including, in fact, countries beyond the Iron Curtain in Europe.</P>
    <P>Here are the facts: In 1950, the volume of British exports to these destinations was 8 per cent. more than in 1949 and, in 1951, 8 per cent. more than in 1950.  In 1950 Western Germany's exports volume increased by 202 per cent. over 1949 and, in 1951, by 105 per cent. over 1950.  Perhaps the real Achilles heel of the whole sterling area system is in the threatened growth of Japanese trade in the Far East.</P>
    <P>If you look at page 100 of the Economic Survey of Europe for 1951, you will find the following significant facts: Before the war, Japan's principal export trade was with China, but since the war and since the present unpleasant situation in the Far East developed, Japan is forbidden to trade with China to any serious extent by her new overlord.  Here are the facts <Col N="1581" /> in terms of statistics: Pre-war, 44 per cent. of Japanese exports were absorbed by China and Korea.  In the first half of 1951, only 14 per cent. of her exports were absorbed there.  Pre-war, Japanese exports to south-east Asia&mdash;that means to India, Indonesia, and so on&mdash;were 17 per cent. of her total.  In 1951, they were 35 per cent. of her total.</P>
    <P>In other words, Japanese trade is rapidly expanding, driving British trade out of the markets of southeastern Asia and, in that way, removing what you might call the lynchpin of the whole sterling area system.</P>
    <P>If the present world situation continues, I can see a very real possibility of the whole sterling area system becoming permanently bankrupt, or permanently solvent only as a pensioner of the American dollar system.  But, do not blame our Government for that situation, and do not blame our Government, or any of our Governments, for the unpleasant things that we have to do to try to adjust ourselves to that situation.  We may as well realise that we live in a mad world but, for God's sake, let us keep sane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to take part in this debate except to express my appreciation of the lectures that we have had from the various speakers on the other side of the House.  While I have accused the Fine Gael Party of incompetence and various other things, they seem to have started a reading class at Fine Gael headquarters.  We have had a couple of speakers, and I must say they are excellent readers, and anyone who could not follow their speeches would be the kind of person who would not want to learn.</P>
      <P>Yesterday morning when I took up the paper I saw a picture of people who were thrown out of a Catalina plane which was alleged to have been attacked by the Russians.  I was forcibly reminded of that picture when I saw Senator Baxter floundering around in the rather disturbed sea of international finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated here before that I am no authority on high finance, and I make no bones about it.  If I did know enough about high finance to make a <Col N="1582" /> speech on it.  I hope I would know enough to know that there were no people here who would understand me with, possibly, two or three exceptions, and they know so much that they know enough to know that it would not be worth while listening to me.</P>
    <P>If anybody were to take Senator Baxter seriously in his speech they would not be able to sleep for nights. He starts off with a great flourish of trumpets and describes the Budget as an instrument of destruction.  He does not understand why on earth the Minister should inflict such a Budget on the people.  My answer to that is that Senator Baxter must not have been reading the papers for the last three weeks or a month, nearly two months for that matter, or, if he has been reading the papers, he must have been reading the wrong papers.  I understand that there is a rule in the Fine Gael Party and a regulation whereby their followers are advised to read only certain papers.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for people saying at this stage that they cannot understand why the Minister introduced such a Budget.  We have regulations of that kind in the countries behind the Iron Curtain and they were in existence in countries which were behind the Nazi curtain some time ago, but surely we here have reached a stage at which people ought to be allowed to read whatever they ought to read in order to learn the facts.  I would recommend to the Fine Gael people and other followers of the Coalition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Which Coalition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that, even from now until this day week, they should read the <i>Irish Press.</i>  If we could get any guarantee that they would do that, even for that short period, I have no doubt whatever about the result.  I believe the people would not be left in ignorance as apparently Senator Baxter is, wondering why the Minister inflicted this terrible Budget on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to accuse the Minister of being influenced by the Central Bank Report.  It is not necessary to go into that.  It has been dealt with and dealt with adequately already.  If there is <Col N="1583" /> anything wrong with the directors of the Central Bank, it is not the Fianna Fáil Government who are responsible for it.  The majority of the directors were appointed by the other Parties who were in power, and, if they were not appointed by them while in power, they were still in office when the Coalition was in power, and if there was anything wrong with them, they should have removed them.  If they did not do so while in office, they should for ever hold their peace.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter is also a little worried whether the Minister will take his share of the blame.  The Minister's record in the public life of this country over a very long period is fairly well known, and if we had about one battalion of men like the Minister, I have no hesitation in saying that we could take on some of the Great Powers that are making a lot of noise at present.  There was never a period in the history of this country since the Minister came of age when he was not prepared to take his share of the blame or the trouble as it was going.  At every stage of the battle he was in the front line trenches, and I believe he has done a job over the past two months, despite the criticism, the sneers and the attacks of the Opposition, that very few other men would be capable of handling.</P>

      <P>In connection with the extraordinary statements we heard from Senator Baxter about the type of Minister for Agriculture we should have, he said it was necessary for us to have a forceful Minister for Agriculture, a man who knew the problems of agriculture, a man who understood the business of farming, so on, so forth and et cetera, until I was quite convinced that he was talking about the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>

When a Senator starts to blow <Col N="1585" /> trumpets for the ex-Minister, I might perhaps ask him if he would mind telling us what was the cause of the trouble between the Coalition Government at the time and Dr. Miller of the E.C.A.?  I suggest that that trouble was largely caused by this alleged wonderful Minister for Agriculture, Deputy James Dillon, when he destroyed the lime scheme which was left on his desk by the previous Minister.  I suggest that almost irreparable damage was done to this country by the friction caused, and, I should say, caused deliberately by the ex-Minister cutting out the scheme recommended by Dr. Miller himself, sponsored by the E.C.A. and accepted by the previous Government.</P>

      <P>If Senator Baxter can prove that, I promise to resign from the Fianna Fáil Party this evening. Apparently, Senator Baxter is now keeping his eye on the rôle of Minister for Finance.  Perhaps he might make a better Minister for Finance than the former Minister we had, because he has the reputation of being a man who would not spend too much money or would not spend it too freely.  He would not be so bad at all.  I hope he will live a long time, but I am afraid he will not live long enough to get into that kind of job.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister for Finance accused of practically everything within the last month or two months and even before that.  I was amused, however, to hear Senator O'Brien, who made a very detailed and instructive speech from certain points of view, accuse the Minister of window-dressing so far as the Budget was concerned. If you accuse a person of window-dressing, you must accuse him of presenting something which will be attractive to people; in other words, you must accuse the Minister of producing something which is really very attractive and which would induce a lot of people to say that the Minister was a great fellow.  There is something in that, but you would not expect a statement of that kind from the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the days and weeks pass by, the people who, a couple of weeks ago, thought this Budget was, in fact, something near what it was described by Senator Baxter, an instrument of destruction, having faced facts, having heard speeches on the Budget by the Minister and other speakers, have come to the conclusion that this Budget is one of the greatest things ever produced in this country, that, if the previous Minister for Finance and the previous Government had been in <Col N="1589" /> power for a couple of more years, it would take even a greater man than the present Minister and a greater Government than the present Government to rescue this country from the state in which it would be.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that Senator Baxter has a bee in his bonnet when he sets out to criticise the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  He pointed out, as an argument or as an attack on the Agricultural Credit Corporation, that during a certain number of years many thousands of pounds were lent to industry by the Industrial Credit Company as against a very small amount lent to farmers by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Whatever else we have not in common, Senator Baxter and myself have this much in common.  We were both on the Board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and we were both removed from that position.  But the Agricultural Credit Corporation still goes on doing a good service for the agricultural community and a good day's work for the farmers and for every Government of this country, no matter what Government are there.</P>
    <P>It is a great thing to have a grievance and to criticise people who are not here to defend themselves.  But I have no hesitation in saying, and I am talking from experience, that the Agricultural Credit Corporation have done their job.  They have given out loans in keeping with the policy of the Government in power at the time. These loans have been responsible for good work being done in this country. They have made loans which people might say were bad loans.  I have always believed that it is impossible to say when a loan to a farmer is a bad loan, and loans which might be regarded as bad a couple of years ago have long since been repaid.  It comes very bad from a man who was trusted sufficiently by any Government to be put on the Agricultural Credit Corporation to criticise the corporation years afterwards for the work they did instead of taking off his hat to them and saying: &ldquo;I did not think you could get along without me, but you got along just as well or a little better since I left.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As I was saying before the adjournment, the friction caused by the action of the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, with the Americans&mdash;if I might refer to them generally as such&mdash;has done damage to this country which it will take a long time to repair. It will take a lot of diplomacy and a lot of hard work on the part of the present Minister for External Affairs to bring about a situation such as that which existed when the Fianna Fáil Government left office in 1948.  As I said before, the Minister for Agriculture was ably assisted by the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy McBride.  Between them, they made a nice job of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was cross-examined by some of the Senators on the other side of the House before the adjournment as to the number of times Dr. Miller spoke on the question of agricultural development in this country.  During the adjournment I had time to look up the matter.  I find that on five different occasions he went on record, and on each one of the five occasions he very definitely criticised the Coalition Government for their lack of interest in agricultural development in this country, for their lack of attention to various schemes which, if they had been put into operation, would have increased the agricultural production of this country during their term of office. Notwithstanding that fact, Senator Baxter complimented the present Minister for Finance on his conversion to the policy of agricultural development. In actual fact, there was no need for conversion as far as the Minister is <Col N="1591" /> concerned.  For something approaching a quarter of a century, the Minister has preached a policy of agricultural development&mdash;a policy which was put into operation when Fianna Fáil came into power originally as a Government.</P>
    <P>To listen to Senator Baxter, one would imagine that when the change-about came in 1948, when Fianna Fáil were put out of office by what I call a trick, this country was a wilderness. The fact of the matter is that, under Fianna Fáil administration, the record of the rate of agricultural development in this country has not been surpassed by any other country in the same length of time.  We found when Fianna Fáil assumed office in 1932, that this country had 21,000 acres of wheat&mdash;I am giving round figures.  In 1945 that figure increased to 380,000 acres.  Those figures knock on the head any suggestion that, during that period, agricultural development did not take place. I assert that the agricultural position in those years improved beyond all recognition. I think I am right in saying that if we go back not alone ten years or 20 years but even 1,000 years, we will find that the people who were regarded as the wise men of this world over that period always measured the success, development and the strength of any particular country in proportion to the number of tons, cwt. or acres of wheat which that country was able to produce.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Fianna Fáil policy at that time it was possible to produce that amount of wheat and then at a period when manures were practically impossible to get; but because of the way in which that policy was supported by the farmers of this country and because of the leadership given to the farming population and despite strenuous efforts made by the late Minister for Agriculture and some of his supporters at that time, this country was saved from war.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter seems to be surprised that any move was made in connection with the ground lime scheme before the Fianna Fáil Government went out of power.  During the tea interval I looked that up and I find that when the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Smith, was previously <Col N="1592" /> Minister for Agriculture he had not alone prepared that scheme and made all the preparations to put such a scheme into operation but he had actually ordered the machinery for the ground lime scheme which we are now told was developed by the great Deputy James Dillon, ex-Minister for Agriculture under the Coalition Government.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say any more about that.  As I say, Dr. Miller spoke five times and on each of the five occasions he went on record as being critical of the efforts made by the Coalition Government to develop agriculture in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas said that the difference between the present Government and their predecessors was one of financial outlook.  There is a great deal of truth in that.  Whenever I am caught out for some kind of logical reason for various things, I inevitably fall back on what I learned as a child away down the country in the national school, at the crossroads, or perhaps in the blacksmith's forge.  Most of the Senators here are nearly as old, and a few are a good deal older, than I am, and I am sure they heard the expression &ldquo;money speaks&rdquo; and believe it.  I am sure they will also believe when they are reminded of that, that no money talks quite so consistently and no money talks quite so long as the money you owe to the bank or to the various business concerns in the country.  If you owe money here, there and everywhere, you are more or less afraid or ashamed to go into the town. That is the difference between the two outlooks on finance.</P>
    <P>One Party facing the people of this country, the Fianna Fáil Party, believe that money talks and they believe that you should not put yourself in the position of being awake nights thinking of how on earth you are going to get the next £ to keep the country running. The other Party, the Coalition Party, sponsored by Senator Douglas, one of its most recent adherents&mdash;he was placed third on the list anyhow&mdash; believed that the proper policy to follow, if we are to judge from their actions, was to borrow money indiscriminately, everywhere you could, <Col N="1593" /> and spend it indiscriminately.  As I say, they spent it like drunken sailors.</P>
    <P>It is a desperate state of affairs to say we had in this country a man in the position of Minister for Agriculture who brags, even now after he has been found out, that the busiest afternoon he had during his term of office was to find how he would get rid of £5,000,000 in five hours, £1,000,000 an hour.  It is scarcely necessary for me to point out that any Minister for Agriculture could discover very easily how he could spend £1,000,000 usefully on one branch of agriculture and £1,000,000 usefully on another branch of agriculture, and so on, until he had the £5,000,000 spent. A sensible or a sane Minister for Agriculture would not be going around bragging that he was going to spend £5,000,000 in five hours.  He would get down to business and find out how he was going to spend £1,000,000.  If the ex-Minister for Agriculture had any common sense he would have spent £1,000,000 on the dairying industry in this country which he did not do.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that Fianna Fáil had to be converted to the development of agriculture in this country. Were it not for the fact that Fianna Fáil came to the rescue of the dairying industry here in the past I know where the dairying industry would be to-day. When the Coalition Government came into power, milk, as far as I can remember, was at 1/2 a gallon.  Deputy Dillon's contribution as Minister for Agriculture was to reduce its price to 1/- a gallon and, typical of the political following of the Coalition, you had a couple of crawling creameries in the country prepared to accept his policy and actually for a couple of days reduced the price of milk to 1/- a gallon.  Fianna Fáil when they went to the country before they were returned to power promised that in so far as they could do so they would preserve the dairying industry.  As a result of that promise which they carried out, as they carried out every other promise they undertook, milk to-day is 1/4 a gallon with a prospect of going higher. When I say the prospect of going higher I have in mind the fact that a commission has been set up to go into the costings, and if it is found that on <Col N="1594" /> these costings the cost of production is greater than it had been heretofore, I believe that a further increase will be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of raising the taxes, a suggestion has been made that a tax should be put on the export of cattle.  That suggestion was made, I believe, by Senator Johnston, and I am entirely in agreement with it.  I believe that cattle being exported from this country would stand at least some tax, and that a certain amount of money could be collected in that way.</P>
      <P>On the question of finance, the Government were faced with a situation where they had to provide money for social services and for the various other amenities which were demanded by the people generally and which were not opposed very seriously in the Dáil.  Money had to be found, and the Minister for Finance had to take his courage in his hands and find it in the manner that would cause the least suffering to the poorer sections of the community.  As I said already, I believe that some of the money could be found by putting a small export tax on cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of the much talked of development in the agricultural products of this country. In my opinion, our dead meat industry is one of the most important developments with regard to agriculture. Senator O'Brien and Senator O'Callaghan referred to this development. I am open to correction, but I think they both suggested, at any rate, that the major portion of the credit for the fostering of this industry should go to the officials of the Department of Agriculture.  Far be it from me to take any credit from the officials of that Department.  In my opinion, they are at least as good, if not better than, the officers of any Department of Agriculture in any country in the world.  It is because of their efforts, because of their grit and because of their intelligence that to-day Irish chilled <Col N="1595" /> beef, Irish canned meat and Irish meat products generally stand higher than the meat products of any other country in the world.  That may be taken as a rather wild statement.  However, I am talking of something about which I have knowledge.  I believe that, at the present time, we have greater freedom from meat diseases than any other country in Europe.  The U.S.A., which may be taken as being rather particular about its imports, is prepared to take Irish beef, while it is not prepared to take beef from very many of the other European countries.  That situation, it appears to me, has resulted from the very careful attention given to this matter by the officials of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I feel it would be most unfair to pass from a discussion on the meat industry without paying tribute to the men who may be regarded as the pioneers of that industry in this country.  While I am always rather slow to mention names in a debate on any subject, I feel it is only right that I should name men like Jim Landy of Waterford&mdash;a man who travelled the greater part of the world, who learned the meat business in many countries, and who came back to give his services to his own country in what might be regarded as the evening of his life.  I would also like to mention the Crowleys of Roscrea&mdash;the men who started the Roscrea factory, who have put it on the map, and who have carried on a thriving industry there, and who will, I hope, do so for a long time to come.  I am not forgetting the directors of the Castlebar meat factory.</P>

      <P>I am coming to Limerick.  You must think I am a bigger fool than I appear to be.  The Mattersons and O'Mearas developed the meat industry in Limerick.  The Dennys developed it in Waterford, and we have Clonmel foods, which is on the borders of Waterford, and which gets a good proportion of its labour and of its cattle from County Waterford. To my mind, they are the pioneers of the meat industry in this <Col N="1596" /> country.  I have probably forgotten to mention a few, such as the McCarrens of Cavan.  I have not really forgotten others, but I have merely overlooked mentioning them.  When all these people went into the industry, they got very little encouragement.  As time went on, they got a little more encouragement and now, under the friendly wing of Fianna Fáil, they have developed out of all recognition. They are on their feet, and I hope they will stay on them for many years to come.</P>
      <P>I feel also that we should mention people on the other side who commenced taking our products.</P>

He is the man who was responsible for sending the first consignment of chilled beef from this country to Sweden.  He is still in the trade and is doing a very good job.</P>
      <P>I was waiting for Senator Baxter to return before I mentioned ground limestone. In my opinion, the application of ground limestone to our soil would do a great deal of good.  Let me repeat again that the lime scheme was wrecked by Deputy James Dillon.  When he got a letter of protest from Dr. Miller denouncing him for his attitude, he wrote across that letter, and this is on record&mdash;&ldquo;That is mad.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>While dealing with that industry, it might be well to mention the question of mechanised transport for farms.  Senator O'Callaghan made reference to the position as far as <Col N="1597" /> petrol is concerned.  I am quite sure that the Minister will take serious notice of what he said in connection with the provision of more petrol pumps in the country so that the farmers can get supplies of petrol and oil for their tractors.  While that is very desirable, at the same time, we should not pass from a discussion on this matter without considering what our position would be if a world war developed.  I feel sure that the present Minister would do as much, in such a situation, as any other Minister. However, I believe that if we had another world war our position would be even more acute than it was during the last war, and that even the present Minister for Finance would not be able to provide petrol for our tractors. Because of that, I believe, and I repeat what I have often said before, that it is an insane policy for us to allow our horses to be exported and to import tractors to take their place.  I feel that we should maintain the nucleus of a horse transport here which would be ready to take over in the event of another world war.  Even without that development, I fail to see why we should not use horse transport, particularly in certain Departments of State. I make the Minister a present of the information, and it is reliable information, that, on short haulage, horses could be used more economically than mechanised transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several outfits in this State are using horse transport to-day.  They keep audited accounts and these audited accounts show that, so far as short haulage with numerous stops is concerned, the transport of various materials by horses is more economical than by motor transport.  The Minister for Finance, so far as the expenditure of the various Departments is concerned is, I take it, largely the boss. If that is so.  I would ask him to examine the situation and find out in what Department horses are being used&mdash;the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Agriculture and various other Departments. I think if he will go into the matter carefully he will find that there is a suggestion at the present time that some of these Departments should <Col N="1598" /> discard horses and take on motor transport.  I would ask the Minister to go carefully into the situation before such a development is allowed to take place.  If he asks for figures from the various transport companies in this city, he will find that any Department that uses mechanised transport will pay more for doing the same job than they would pay with horse transport.</P>

If money has to be found to supply petrol for transport, it means that that money cannot be devoted to other purposes which in the opinion of a lot of people may be more desirable.  One item to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention is the question of the cavalry escort.

      <P>All right; we shall come to it later.  Senator O'Higgins I <Col N="1599" /> am glad to see is back.  He accuses the Minister for Finance of various crimes, knowing of course that his statements were completely without foundation.  He says that the Minister was ordered over to London.  If he knew the Minister as well as many more of us know him, he would know that if the Minister were ordered over to London, his natural reaction would be to back around in the other direction. If the Minister goes over to London to do a job in his capacity as Minister for Finance, he is accused of going over to London under orders, or accused of slavishly following the advice of the British Minister for Finance, the Bank of England or somebody else.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House much longer but I should like to say that Senator O'Higgins is a little bit young.  When he has had a little bit more experience, he will know that it comes very badly from one of the O'Higginses to accuse anybody of slavishly following the advice or the orders of the British.  In this debate, I have noticed&mdash;and I am very sorry that it is so&mdash;that we did not discuss the economic war or the civil war.  Perhaps it is a relief to find that some of those people are at long last getting ashamed of their past.  I should like to remind them that the people who slavishly followed the British orders were the people who advanced on the Four Courts with borrowed British guns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to weary the House by going into the realms of high finance which have been discussed in this House and in the other House for many weeks past. I should like to look at this Budget, on which this Bill hinges, as the ordinary man in the street or the ordinary person in rural Ireland would look at it.  I should like to look at it in the same light as the average person will look at it when he finds that, after the 5th July next, he will be called upon to pay an extra price for foodstuffs as a result of the removal of subsidies on a number of essential commodities.  We know that any Government must impose a certain amount of taxation on its people in order to <Col N="1600" /> finance different Government schemes, to pay for social services and to run different Departments of State.  Taxation must be levied in some form or another in order that the country can get along, but we must remember that a time comes when, if proper precaution is not observed, it is doubtful if the country can bear any more taxation and any Minister for Finance will find himself in a difficulty in deciding on what commodity he can lay his finger to bring in more revenue to the State.  That is the difficulty that faces every Minister for Finance, not alone in this country but in every country all over the world.  In searching for things to tax, they find that everything taxable has been taxed heretofore to the utmost limit.  They have, therefore, to find some new means by which to raise money to supply the needs of the State.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance here has been faced with the same problem, but I think the Minister should have a little more consideration for the people before proceeding to levy taxation on foodstuffs which is exactly what the removal of the subsidies on essential commodities means.  I do not know what prompted the Minister for Finance, who was so ready with his promises not so long ago that the cost of living would be reduced, to come along in such a short time and say to every man, woman and child, to the rich as well as to the poor: &ldquo;The bread you are going to eat will cost you more; the butter, the tea and the sugar you are going to consume will cost you more.&rdquo;  There might be some slight excuse for taxing semi-luxuries, as was done in 1947, in order to provide money for essential services, but to tax foodstuffs, the life-blood of the people, is something that is unpardonable.  We are told that the Minister was a courageous man in setting out to do that.  Personally, I think he is a very courageous man to make such demands on the Irish people in the conditions in which they are living at the moment, when we are told that our only chance of survival is to try to increase production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation is generally imposed, as Senator O'Brien pointed out yesterday, <Col N="1601" /> in an effort to set aside a surplus to increase production.  Again, that may be an excuse for over-taxation, but where, in the extra taxation that is being imposed at the present time, is there any money being put aside to help to increase production either in the industrial field or in the field of agriculture?  How will the production we expect to increase benefit by the increased taxation which is being imposed? In what manner will the increased taxation benefit production so that something may be set aside to help to bring back the money which is being taken from the people in increased taxes?</P>
    <P>Despite the genuine, honest efforts over a number of years to develop the industrial arm of this country, we are still a long way behind.  Perhaps we have gone as far as we can to try to get the very utmost out of industrial production.  We have made advances. Our period of advancement is reasonably short when you compare it with other countries with 100 or 200 years of industrial life behind them.  Maybe at the present time we could not have done anything more or, perhaps, we could if we had set our minds to it.</P>
    <P>The one type of production we can and should increase at the present time is our agricultural production.  This is an agricultural country.  The main volume of our income comes from our exports of agriculture produce.  Have we developed or are we setting out to develop our agriculture so that it will help to bring in money, through exports, to add to the Exchequer and help our finances?</P>
    <P>There was a time, not so very long ago, when agriculture in any country in the world was not a great industry. Perhaps, that was due to the upheaval over the past 12 or 15 years.  International committees, which have been formed all over the world, have pointed out that the world will be in a serious position with regard to food supplies. It is our business to do as much as we can to help in that regard.  To do that we must devote more time to and help out better our agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Agricultural production which brings such money to the State got a severe <Col N="1602" /> wallop in this Budget.  If we are to increase our agricultural production, we must improve methods to get more out of the land.  We must collect that extra harvest, as it were, and make sure that none of it is lost.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke mentioned mechanisation on the land.  We must realise that we are a long way behind any other country in the world with regard to the mechanisation of our agriculture. When we set out to increase agricultural production, we must get away from the old-time slavery and drudgery that existed up to very recently&mdash; the back-breaking and back-bending methods by which our fathers and forefathers collected the wealth from the land.  The Minister knows and everybody knows that the young people of to-day, including the young farmers, will not work and toil in this manner. They must take advantage of modern methods of mechanisation and they must get those modern methods of mechanisation to help them along so that they can add their weight to the effort that is being made to increase the value of our exports.  Right into the heart of their great effort comes the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke may talk about the value of horses.  In a sense, I agree with him.  I worked horses myself, not for as long, perhaps, as Senator Quirke but just as hard in my own way. As a farmer I think the day of the horse on even the smallest farm is passing away.  Mechanisation on farms means less drudgery and toil for the person who has to stay at home trying to eke out an existence from the land. As machines are practically all run by oil of one type or another, I think it is most unfair of the Minister for Finance, at this stage, to put an extra tax of 4d. per gallon on the petrol that is supplied for agricultural tractors.</P>
    <P>I know that will definitely put a very severe burden on many farmers who have substituted machinery for their horses.  They have substituted machinery for the heavy horses for heavy work and heavy haulage on the farms. They have substituted machinery for the light horses which were used for light transport to creameries and for <Col N="1603" /> bringing milk supplies to towns and doing all the different jobs that a light type horse would have to do.  All these have been substituted by tractors.  Now the farmer finds that it will cost him an extra 4d. per gallon for petrol to operate the tractor.  I can assure the Minister that this will constitute a very big problem so far as the farmers are concerned.</P>
    <P>These are the same farmers who are being asked to produce more.  The country needs more food for itself and for export, for export in order to earn currency, both hard and soft&mdash;dollars from the United States and soft currency from the soft currency countries.  We were told to produce more agricultural goods, and men set out to equip themselves to produce more in order to benefit not only themselves but also the State.  In the midst of their great effort they are burdened with extra taxation on their petrol, the very life-line of their existence in their everyday life.</P>
    <P>I agree to a certain point with Senator Quirke in regard to what Dr. A.C. Miller said on one or two occasions.  As far as I remember&mdash;and I read the cutting from a newspaper&mdash; he said that this country was very foolish to import any coarse grain for animal feeding stuffs when it could well afford to produce the grain itself.  I agreed with Dr. A.C. Miller at the time he said that, and had he said it to-day I would have agreed.</P>
    <P>I will say that the response to the effort that is being made at the present day to increase agricultural production is not anything like what it should be. Any Senator who knows farms must realise that the acreage of beet has fallen considerably this year.  There is no denying that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The acreage of beet contracted for has increased, but the all over acreage of beet is considerably less than it was this time last year.  I do not blame the Government.  No Government can go out, take the farmers by the throat, and compel them to do certain work.  I do not want to hear any braggadocio in relation to the advance that has been made in agricultural production.  We know that the acreage under beet has fallen. We had to import sugar in past years, and we were loudly criticised for doing that.  I am not criticising the present Minister's agricultural effort any more than I would criticise the effort of his predecessor.  Prices are good, but production has not increased.</P>

      <P>The Senator may have had a campaign of his own.  So far as the Tuam beet factory is concerned, beet growing ceased after the strike there some years ago.  If anyone cares to look at the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> he will see that the number of cattle one year old and under is considerably less than it was this time last year. That goes to show that the all-out effort for agricultural production is not progressing any further than or as far as it had progressed under the Minister's predecessor.</P>
      <P>Senator Quirke has assured us that the plans and everything else were ready to start the ground limestone scheme in operation when Deputy Dillon became Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1605" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Ask another parliamentary question.  That is the best way to get information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use of having plans unless they are put into operation?  I have been a member of the Mayo Agricultural Committee for many years.  We had the old lime subsidy scheme for burnt lime.  We never heard a word about ground limestone until the scheme was initiated by the inter-Party Government.  At first farmers were very slow in taking advantage of the scheme until they were assured that ground limestone had a more permanent effect on the land than burnt lime.  Plans are of very little use unless they are implemented. We had an Arterial Drainage Act passed in 1945.  There were plans and so forth in connection with that, but no money was made available to put those plans into operation until two or three years ago.  It is on results we judge.</P>
      <P>I know that anything that may be said at this stage will make no difference so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned.  The Government is determined that this taxation must be imposed.  The Government is determined that subsidies must go.  We must eat in order to live.  The Minister, in his wisdom or in his folly, has decided it is necessary to impose this burden of taxation in order to balance his Budget.  I think his Budget will prove an unwise one so far as he and his Party are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal was made to the Minister in the Dáil to give some rebate to farmers in relation to the tax on petrol.  The Minister said, in reply, that, to his own knowledge, such a rebate would be unfair because he had information that the scheme was being abused.  I agree it is possible to abuse the scheme if a farmer can get an unlimited quantity of petrol for his tractor.  The temptation is there to use some of that petrol in his private car if he wants to.  Would it not be possible to evolve a scheme under which a limited number of gallons would be made available to each tractor owner for use in his tractor? A rebate of 4d. per gallon could then <Col N="1606" /> be worked out satisfactorily because it would be impossible to abuse the scheme with only a limited amount of petrol at the farmer's disposal.  I would not even ask the Minister to make that rebate applicable to all petrol used in tractors.  If the Minister is sincere in his desire for an all-out drive in agricultural production he would, by means of that little concession, give an added incentive to agricultural producers.</P>
    <P>I want to protest seriously against the suggestion of taxing cattle for export.  I agree farmers have got increased prices for their live stock but prices can fall very quickly.  How often in the past has the farmer had to bear the brunt of an agricultural depression? The small farmers in my constituency never reap the benefits of these high prices because they are compelled to get rid of their stock at a time of the year when the market is glutted.  If a tax of £5 or £6 per head was imposed on live stock exported the small farmer would be the first to feel the effect of that because it would be passed on to him immediately in the same way as increased shipping and rail charges are passed on at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to see every beast in the country exported as tinned or frozen meat.  That was the policy of the late Arthur Griffith.  It was held that the export of cattle on the hoof was unfavourable to a balanced economy.  No great effort was made to establish factories or find markets for chilled meat until three or four years ago.  A certain amount of credit must go in that respect to the different firms engaged in this trade.  They took a chance in establishing factories for the export of chilled meat and tinned meat.  Markets have been found for that commodity all over the world and to-day the industry is thriving.  But despite all those things, I want to go on record as saying that, as far as I am concerned, representing as I do a constituency of small farmers, I am totally opposed to the very idea, or even the mention of putting any tax whatever on the cattle which are exported from this country on the hoof at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> The efforts of the farmers are at all times for the good of the country, of the small farmers as well as the big farmers.  They are producing something which is earning money for this country, whether it be hard currency or soft currency.  They are quite prepared to do that, and while they are doing it, and have got one discouragement in their mechanisation, I do not want to see them getting any other discouragement in the way of a tax on their live stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, at the conclusion of Senator O'Higgins's speech, I put to him what I thought was a very direct question.  I asked him whether he would state were it a fact that the Fine Gael Party had, during the Coalition régime, opposed the retention of the food subsidies?  The Senator waxed eloquent and waxed indignant. He put his hand on his heart and he told us of the executive bodies to which he had belonged; he told us of his membership of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party at that time, and he proclaimed to high heaven that there was no truth whatever in the implication which was contained in my question. He went further in that he implied&mdash;in that he stated, he did not merely imply it&mdash;that I was basing that implied remark that they did so oppose food subsidies on a personal conversation, and that I was retailing Cabinet secrets which had been transmitted to me by somebody else.  Certainly, the implication in that charge was perfectly clear.  Senator Yeats, who was sitting beside me, interjected, and asked Senator O'Higgins whether he had attended the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis in 1950.  Senator O'Higgins said: &ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;  I think the House has already heard the quotation from the speech made by the titular leader of the Fine Gael Party at the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis held on the 16th February, 1950:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A good deal of the money is being given out to those who could well afford to do without it.  There must definitely be a reduction in the burden of subsidies on our people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad last night beheld or saw <Col N="1608" /> an exhibition of what I can only describe as hypocrisy on the part of Senator O'Higgins.  He must have been at that Ard-Fheis, and out of courtesy if for no other reason, he must have listened to what was being said by the titular leader of his Party. He now, because he has taken the subsidies to his bosom, tries to pin on me the charge that I was retailing Cabinet secrets which had been transmitted to me improperly by a member of the Cabinet.  I can only characterise that, in view of the quotation which I have given, as a very contemptible charge indeed, particularly as it was public property among all Parties then constituting the Coalition, that Fine Gael were so opposed to these subsidies.  Of course, it was equally known among all Parties then constituting the Coalition that Fine Gael would surrender on any point whatever in order to retain office.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry that Senator O'Higgins is not in the House while I am making these remarks.  I do not want to be tedious on the matter or deal with it at any length.  I am informed that, in the course of his remarks to-day, the same Senator also took the opportunity of making what I can again characterise as a cowardly attack on a member of the Dáil, Deputy Cowan, who, of course, is not in this House to defend himself.  I would, Sir, through you remind the Senator that one who is so hypersensitive as he is about criticism, should not act in that particular way. Only a few short weeks ago, we had Senator O'Higgins sending Deputy Sweetman into Dáil Eireann with a letter to the Dáil and to the Ceann Comhairle, protesting against the fact that his name had been mentioned improperly by a Deputy of that House, and complaining that this was grossly unfair and improper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Merely for record purposes, I want to make it clear that I did not complain about anything being unfair.  I merely recorded the fact that the allegation was completely untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator could have done that by means of a letter to the newspapers, but he chose to <Col N="1609" /> select Deputy Sweetman as his galloper to go into Dáil Éireann and read out his epistle to the Dáil.  One who is so thin-skinned and sensitive as he is should not attack a Deputy who is not in this House and who has not an opportunity of defending himself. I think it is, perhaps, well for Senator O'Higgins that Deputy Cowan is not in this House or Senator O'Higgins might have rued the day that he launched the attack on him that he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a further point of order.  I think I am entitled to ask Senator Hartnett to quote me if he says that I attacked any Deputy in the House.  I did not attack any Deputy in the House.  I merely refrained from quoting the opinion which the Minister for Finance had expressed of that particular Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>This, in my respectful submission to the Chair, is the kind of contemptible quibble which brings parliamentary institutions into disrepute. Now, if I may turn my attention to more serious topics, I think the Minister must feel that the manner in which the Finance Bill has been discussed in the Seanad has, on the whole, been in pleasant contrast to the manner in which it was discussed in the Dáil, with very few exceptions.  I would like, particularly, to express the gratitude, certainly of myself, to Senator Professor George O'Brien for his interesting and very lucid speech on a very intricate subject.  This Bill and, of course, the Vote on Account, constitute a field day for the professional economists, Senator O'Brien and also Senator Johnston, who gave us a very interesting speech indeed.  I think that the ordinary Senator comes in here and does listen for what the professional economists have to say, even though their conclusions may not be accepted by him.  He does or must or should listen with interest, so that at least he may be able to tease out or untangle his own thinking on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather a pity, I think, that the main speech made immediately after the Minister's speech was not by Senator O'Brien rather than by Senator Professor Hayes.  I think that it is rather a pity, rather discouraging, for <Col N="1610" /> the younger members of the House to find a politician so seasoned as Senator Hayes indulging in the kind of tub-thumping to which the Senator treated the House.  All during the debate in the Dáil there was what I might describe as the battle of the quotations&mdash; what A said in 1932 and B said in 1933. The younger legislators and, I think, the electorate are rather tired of this kind of reminiscing.  I trust I am not out of order in suggesting that a committee room should be set aside in Leinster House for persons who want to indulge in that kind of discussion of &ldquo;old unhappy far-off things and battles long ago,&rdquo; a committee room to which they could repair and in which they could exchange their pleasant and unpleasant reminiscences.</P>
    <P>However, Senator Hayes is a very astute politician in my view.  I think that is why his speech was as irrelevant as it proved to be.  Senator Hayes, being an astute politician, would, I think, be wise to ring down the curtain on the past, on the past particularly of his own Party.  Much has been forgiven to them; much is being forgiven to them.  It is only on the most rare occasion that they are to-day reminded of their stand in the defence of the Oath of Allegiance and of all the slavish clauses in the Constitution imposed by the British Government on this country.  That is why I think it is so unfair of Senator O'Higgins to stand up and make the charge against an Irish Minister belonging to any Party in the Oireachtas that he was &ldquo;summoned to London&rdquo;.  That is a phrase which stirs a chord of memory. That is a phrase which brings us back many years.  In fact, it brings us back to 30 years ago this month.  Other people &ldquo;were summoned to London&rdquo;. We are still suffering the ill effects.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand this curious anglophobia that has broken out in the Fine Gael ranks.  I am completely at a loss to understand it.  Is it because they suddenly found themselves in the middle of a transformation scene when they were so ignorant and there was an announcement all unbeknownst to them that the External Relations Act was going to be repealed?  Was it then that they suddenly developed this curious brand of chauvinism, this <Col N="1611" /> chauvinistic patriotism which they display in this House?  Everyone else is suspect; everyone else would sell out to the British except the men who trooped into the Lobby in this House, some of them, to preserve the Oath of Allegiance to a British King so that civil war conditions might continue in the country.  I know who are being patient with them; I know who are being tolerant, and I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I will say, in conclusion, that there should be a Standing Order forbidding the reading of quotations from any speech made more than five years ago. Conditions in 1932, 1933 or 1944 are not necessarily the conditions which exist to-day, and very often these quotations are, in my submission, deliberately made for the purpose of misleading the public, deceiving the public, for the sordid aim of vote catching.</P>
    <P>I, as an ordinary layman, came into the House with a reasonably open mind regarding the provisions of the Finance Bill.  I had read in the newspapers and in the Official Debates of Dáil Eireann that the Budget had been described as a fraud, a dishonest Budget, and that the Minister had budgeted for a sum which he did not require.  Of course I applied my mind to that in this way: if the Minister had given 101 reliefs in this Budget then there might be grounds for suspicion about his good faith, whether right or wrong. You could have said that he had given these concessions in order to curry favour with the electorate but Senators know that there was nothing of the kind in the Budget which was introduced. It was described, I understand, as being dishonest because it was alleged that the sum budgeted for was not a real sum, that the Minister was over-estimating.  I think that was hinted at by Senator Hayes.  I understood that from his speech but if I am wrong of course I will accept his correction.  I would expect from a man of Senator Hayes's standing and experience that in making any charge of that kind he would make some effort to substantiate it, that he would say with regard to Estimate A, B, C or D that in each, all or any of these Estimates <Col N="1612" /> the Minister had looked for more money than was required.  He has not said that.  The two real experts in this House, Senators O'Brien and Johnston, have not said that.  Senator Johnston not merely did not say it but he said that it should be accepted by every reasonable person that the sum budgeted for was the sum required, and Senator Johnston cannot be accused of speaking out of any Party bias or any Party animus.  He is an expert and Senator O'Brien is an expert.  Both are men of integrity. Both are men highly distinguished in their subject and from them there comes no suggestion that there was any over-estimation in the Budget. That being so I think it requires very great temerity on the part of lay backbenchers of Fine Gael to stand up and allege that there was without telling us precisely where the over-estimation occurs.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we had Senator Douglas standing up in this House and saying that in his view the Budget was a disaster and would prove a disaster. Again, if that statement is made by a 19 or 20-year-old politician speaking outside a church gate on a Sunday morning, one takes it with a grain of salt.  One accords to the young speaker the licence which is the proper concomitant of enthusiasm.  But, when it is made by a sage and experienced politician like Senator Douglas, one reasonably expects him to go further; one expects him to say (a) whether the Minister did have to close the gap which he said he had to close; (b) whether the Minister adopted the right methods in closing that gap; (c) if the Minister did not adopt the right methods to close that gap, what were the methods which the Minister should have chosen.  Is that too much to ask from a senior politician who has been in this House and its predecessor since the foundation of the Seanad?  No suggestion at all of that kind came from any of these people.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes did cover up by talking about backbone and about slogans, by making assaults upon the Minister and assaults upon all the persons and institutions whom the Senator does not happen to like.  That is a poor substitute <Col N="1613" /> for argument coming from a university professor.  I would expect that university professors would set a better example to the members of this House and to the country than the example which has been set here by Senator Hayes.</P>
    <P>I did not hear everything that was said by Senator Baxter.  I think&mdash;I will not be rude, particularly as he is not present in the House&mdash;but, again, I could not gather from what I did hear of Senator Baxter's speech that he made any suggestion to substantiate the charges which are being made against the integrity of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not pinning myself to the fact that the Government took the right way out.  If we face this clearly, if we are to preserve democratic institutions in this country at all, we must not start campaigns alleging that the Minister for Finance, various Ministers for Finance, have over-estimated.  As I see, if the Minister were to take a chance of that kind, it would come out, if I may use a vulgar phrase, in the washing, next March.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor O'Brien said that we were in a dangerous situation financially and economically.  He said that there was very little we could do about it, that we were to a large extent trapped by world conditions.  Before I go on, I would like to refer in particular to some of the points made by Senator Professor O'Brien.  As I have already stated, in my view, he made a most lucid and most interesting, instructive and informative speech.  I do think, of course, that he perhaps is not adapting himself to the transitional circumstances of present-day economic life.  The Senator said, among other things, that investment had to come from our savings.  That, of course, is unquestionably true.  Even to my lay mind it seems to be clearly evident.  He discussed the present-day attitude to savings.  He told us that there were so many less people nowadays who had a large surplus over their expenditure which could be devoted to investment. In that connection, he suggested to the Minister that the Minister was unwise in increasing the income-tax.  As far as I could gather from Senator Professor <Col N="1614" /> O'Brien's statement, he was in favour of the abolition of direct taxation altogether, perhaps of income-tax, or the substantial reduction of income-tax.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to consider it in this particular way: There is no possibility now, thank God, of turning back the hands of the clock and having 15, 20, 30 or 40 people with vast incomes mainly derived from land, as they were in the old days from the ownership of land and from the exploitation of the workers on the land.  There is now no possibility of reverting to the days when we had this small section of people with vast sums of money to invest in industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor O'Brien suggested that the increase in the income-tax would reduce whatever possibility there was of the rich or, as he put it, the not so poor, devoting whatever they could spare from their expenditure to investment.  Surely, that is ignoring, again in my respectful submission to the Senator, the very important factor of public spending.  If you had 200, 300 or 400 people with money to spare to invest in industry, is there any guarantee that they would invest their money in the industries which would contribute most to the common good?</P>
    <P>First and foremost, is there any guarantee that they would invest their money in any reproductive manner?  It is possible that they might invest their money as Senator O'Donnell wanted to invest his the other night when he told the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he wanted a casino established in this country so that the people who had money to spend could go down to the roulette tables and back the black and if they did not like the black, they could back the red.  They could do that.  They could spend their money on continental travel.  They could spend their money on over-indulgence in alcohol.  I do not think I need specify all the ways in which persons of that kind might spend their money unless they were public-spirited, and it does not always happen that persons who have surplus income in that way are public-spirited. I think perhaps the general experience might be the very contrary.  But, even if they were to invest their money, what guarantee is there that they <Col N="1615" /> would invest it in those industries which contribute most to the common good?  Would they have invested their money in the electricity supply undertaking? Would they have invested their money in Bórd na Móna?  I do not think so.  They would, of course, in the ordinary way, have looked for those industries which would yield to them personally the greatest return.  I am not criticising that, but I do say that it should be a principle of national economy that the common need is of far more importance than private greed, and that, whether we like it or not, we have arrived at the position where the State, if the national economy is to continue at all, not only in this but in most other countries, must cream off surplus income and itself invest it in industries which contribute most to the common good.  I must be careful in making these remarks lest they be taken up and distorted and used as an allocution to youthful audiences on inappropriate occasions, but nevertheless, I think they should be made.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which Senator O'Brien touched on and on which I find myself in agreement with him, although at the end I was not quite sure whether he was merely stating it as a fact, or advocating it to the Minister as a device he should adopt, that is, the preservation so far as possible of the value of savings.  I would make this suggestion to the Minister.  It is extremely difficult to induce people to save in present-day circumstances. People who saved money in 1939, people who at great sacrifice to themselves saved £1,000 now find that, through no fault of theirs, through no fault of their country's Government, that £1,000 is in value, in purchasing power, less than £500.  That must naturally breed a spirit of eat, drink and be merry, for to-morrow the £ may be worth twopence.  That is the psychological climate in which the Minister or any Minister for Finance has to-day to look to the people to save.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien told us all about the new French loan.  I had read about it but I did not know it was quite so advantageous to the borrower as the <Col N="1616" /> Senator informed us it was.  I do not think the Minister could, with the resources of our country, go quite that distance, but he might consider devising the scheme in relation to the small savings of the people, the savings of the little man, the little man who is not interested in the stock exchange and who has no understanding of the manipulations of the stock exchange operators, the little man who puts his money, perhaps, into the Post Office Savings Bank, or into Savings Certificates up to the amount allowed by the Minister.  He does not do that for the purpose of getting a return on his money.  I do not think he is interested to any extent in the interest his money earns.  He is providing not so much an investment as a cushion, something which will enable him in later life to enjoy some more comfort and some of the little urbanities of life.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the devising of a scheme for relating savings up to, say, £1,000, £2,000 or whatever figure he may decide on in consultation with his officials, to the cost of living, so that the real value of that saving, up to a limited amount, may be preserved.  If that were done, the Government, which would have the use of the money, would not have to give any interest on it.  I think that would be dispensed with and that, in itself, would be a considerable saving. This theory has been adumbrated by the ex-Taoiseach in Cork without acknowledgment of an article which appeared in, I think, <i>The Economist.</i> I have also read it set out in some detail in the excellent book of Mr. Aneurin Bevan, <i>In Place of Fear.</i>  It is commonly reported that Mr. Bevan gets his economic views from the distinguished economist, Mr. G.D.H. Cole.  It is a very curious thing that the analysis of society, of the existing financial structure of society, given to us last evening by Senator O'Brien, was to me almost identical with that given by Aneurin Bevan and, accordingly, by Mr. G.D.H. Cole.  They differ only in the solutions they would apply.  I do not know which is right&mdash; the nostalgia of Senator O'Brien for the era which seems to be closing, or the faith and courage of Mr. Bevan, <Col N="1617" /> who looks to a more equal world, where every man's child, regardless of social position, will have equal opportunity of developing the talents which God gave him.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien said so many interesting things about savings that I am sure many Senators would like to pursue some or all of them, but it would take too much time.  Again, what I have said with regard to the psychological climate for savings to-day applies equally to life insurance.  Despite the company reports and returns which I read in the newspapers, there is, I think, a developing tendency to feel: &ldquo;You pay your premium at such a rate, and, when the policy matures, the money will be worth less than half and perhaps a quarter, or even less, of what you paid in.&rdquo;  That is going to develop, and I do not think it is beyond the ingenuiy of the Minister and his officials to devise some such scheme in that regard.  Apply it not merely to small savings but to the benefits under the social security scheme; apply it to pensions, old age pensions, pensions under the social scheme, and to all the pensions of persons who have been in State employment, for a start.  That would be a noble and Christian act.</P>
    <P>Even if it were to cost more money, the Minister could come into the House and say: &ldquo;I had to put even 3d. more on the pint; I have had to put 6d on the glass of whiskey; I have even had to put 3d more on the packet of cigarettes&rdquo;&mdash;and there is not one of you would have the courage to stand up and say he was not justified in doing it.  You might say that it was not really required, that at least the money was not needed, but you would not have the courage to say that the sacrifice was not worth the boon which the Minister would be conferring.</P>
    <P>Talking about whiskey, in case I should go off the subject, I think it is time the licensed trade in this country had it made clear to them that they do not occupy a privileged position in this State.</P>
    <P>I have no grievance against the licensed trade, good, bad or indifferent. I am not a teetotaller.  I have very great respect for teetotallers, but I <Col N="1618" /> think you will all agree that for many years past the licensed trade has exercised in the politics of this country a completely disproportionate influence and that it is time that was ended.  The days of pressure-group government in this country must finally cease, whether the pressure comes from the licensed trade or the Irish Medical Association or anybody else whatsoever.  In recent years we have had an outstanding example of pressure-group government and it must result finally in a deterioration into Tammany Hall government if it is allowed to develop and continue.</P>
    <P>There have been Ministers who have done the courageous thing in taxing whiskey as the Minister has done.  The late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins did it and earned a great deal of unpopularity with the licensed trade because of the fact that he resisted either their blandishments or their threats.  I was interested to see a deputation coming into Leinster House from the licensed trade on the night on which the final Budget resolution was being voted on and I was pleased to note that at least four of the people constituting that deputation were wearing Pioneer badges.  I was at a loss to understand whether they were coming to thank the Minister for his services to temperance or to blame him for having, as they believed, reduced their over-all earnings.  I do not think they were interested in the consumer; they were interested in their own profits.  I am not blaming them for that.  That is perfectly legitimate.  That is true of all trades and all so-called professions.  I do not know the difference between a trade or a profession; somebody will tell me some day.  But it is true of every person who works for his living.</P>
    <P>I heard again plaintive wails. We had in the newspaper reports plaintive wails from the members of the licensed trade about the way in which their business has been detrimentally affected by the Minister's taxes on alcohol.  The public houses round Dublin are crowded every night, but of course with good neighbours coming in to sympathise with the publican for the bad loss he has suffered as a result of the Budget.</P>
    <P>I have spoken for a long time and I have not touched on a quarter of the <Col N="1619" /> points I wanted to raise.  I should like to follow, indeed I would like to cross-examine Senator O'Brien on his remarks on direct as against indirect taxation.  The whole theory of that is that the really just and equitable tax is the direct tax.  I would not go quite that distance.  I would submit to Senator O'Brien that it would be inequitable if a man earning, say, £3,000 a year should pay the same tax or less tax than the man earning £500 or less, which would result if you did not have a system of graded income-tax. The fact that a man earning £3 15s. 0d. or up to £500 a year has to pay an extra halfpenny for his box of matches will hurt him more than it will the £10,000 a year executive.  Accordingly, the only reasonable and equitable way of redistributing income is the income-tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, made an extremely good point in his opening speech when he said that concessions when once granted in the income-tax code are never withdrawn, but that the standard rate of income-tax itself varies up and down in accordance with financial circumstances.  This year very considerable concessions have been given in direct taxation and that is a useful thing.  I would say to the Minister, however, that, far from taking Senator O'Brien's view, he should increase the surtax.  I think that so far as he can without doing an injustice, without acting contrary to the moral law, he should do away, if the public weal demands it, with the inheritance of wealth.  That is why, contrary to the proposition put forward by Senator O'Brien, I am a strong believer and a strong supporter of the death duties, as I feel sure the Minister is.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dwyer made a remark with which I must seriously quarrel. He advised the Minister to be careful lest we take too many within the pool, meaning the pool of the social services. I do not think we can err by over-charity. Even if you were to err on the other side, that you give to somebody who does not require it, it is better than depriving somebody who does require it of the sustenance which <Col N="1620" /> he needs.  I do not find that proposition in any textbooks on economics.  It can be found in the Sermon on the Mount, and the Sermon on the Mount has not yet, openly, at any rate, become a controversial document as between different political Parties in this country.  If this Minister or any Minister for Finance goes to the people of this country and asks them to make sacrifices, asks them to pay more for luxury goods in order to help the aged, to help the sick, to help the poor, the Minister will meet with an immediate response from the majority of the people.  The argument should be put forward, in my view, without any economic trimmings whatever.  It should be put forward as a dictum based on elementary Christian doctrine. If the inexorable economic laws, of which Senator O'Brien talked, conflict with Christian doctrine, then they must go by the wayside, and Christian charity must prevail.</P>
    <P>I must ask the Senators opposite whether, in fact, they are genuinely in favour of social security.  As I said during the debate on the Vote on Account, I stood on a platform with Senator O'Higgins, from which he stated clearly that he was an opponent of the welfare State and of anything approximating to the welfare State. If you feel like that, come out and say so.  Then let the issue be knit fairly and squarely&mdash;those who are on the right, those who are on the left; those who stand for reducing the social services or consolidating them at their present level, or those who want to extend them still further until anxiety and insecurity are removed from the mind of every person in this country. If we give them that issue, clearly stated, if the Fine Gael Party would be true to itself and stop flirting with labour and selling its own philosophy in order to capture the support of some people in Dáil Eireann or of some sections of the electorate, it would be a very good thing because we could then have a genuine examination of the social structure of this country.  When listening to the professional economists &mdash;Senator O'Brien and Senator Johnston&mdash;I expected that they would express an opinion on this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> We are now told that it is possible to abolish all the extra taxation which the Minister has imposed in this Budget, and that, at the same time, the food subsidies can be restored in addition to the concessions which the Minister has given in his Budget to the old age pensioners&mdash;and which, I trust, he will see his way to increase&mdash; and to the recipients of children's allowances.  I should have liked the professional economists to tell us ordinary laymen in this deliberative Assembly whether that can possibly be done, and, if it can be done, how it is going to be financed?  Where is the money going to come from?  I do not think one should play blind man's buff in this particular way with financial policy.  I think it is reckless and irresponsible&mdash;irresponsible to the point of lunacy.  It may meet with the kind of Nemesis which overtook Mr. Winston Churchill when he sent out Lord Woolton and his other lieutenants to promise that all controls would be removed, and that everything in the garden would be smiling in an England from which the blight of socialism would be removed.  Look at him now &mdash;praying that something will happen to take him out of the mess, hoping that something will come out of the bag that will rescue him, even if it be only a war.  I suggest to the gentlemen opposite that when they put forward theories and when they make pledges they should be quite sure that they will be in a position to fulfil them.</P>
    <P>The dance tax has been mentioned in this House.  I agree with what was said by a writer in the <i>Leader</i> of this week that it is unwise for leaders of a political Party to give a pledge before an election which involves a charge on the Budget.  I, myself, once acted as director of elections, and I may say that it is done by leaders of every political Party.  I do not suggest, and I think it is improper to suggest, that the Minister acted in any way dishonestly. I think it was unquestionably his view that dancing should not be taxed.  As it has resulted, however, in the context of the present Budget, the removal of that tax has exposed the Minister to misrepresentation.  It is nonsense to say that the concession was given before the election for the <Col N="1622" /> purpose of getting election funds. Everybody knows that the dance-hall proprietors could not subscribe a tithe of what could be subscribed by the publicans of Dublin alone, whom the Senators opposite have so solidly behind them.  Accordingly, if the Minister were looking for election funds, he could have distributed favours among people who could have given a considerably higher return&mdash;&ldquo;a better consideration&rdquo;, as the lawyers put it&mdash;than the dance-hall proprietors.  However, the experience will be an example to leaders of all political Parties.  Even if it be your policy, better not say anything beforehand, because there will be misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>We have all been guilty of misrepresentation in our time.  There is no doubt about that.  I am sure it will lay balm to the soul of Senator Seán O'Donovan to hear me admitting that I have been as guilty as anybody else of misrepresentation.</P>

      <P>I am glad to note that the Senator is at least vocal.  If misrepresentation is to be made in this particular way, it will mean that, not merely will we be destroying our political opponents, but we will be destroying political democracy in this country.  We must understand that we will be shaking the faith of the younger generation in the political institutions as we understand them and value them and, in their place, there can be substituted only some form of callous dictatorship which, once having got, we can only remove by force.  I think that, particularly in this House, it is a pity that the arguments of the marketplace, the arguments one hears at the side of the road, are so often used.  If this House is to discharge its true function, it should examine questions impartially and coldly, excluding, so far as is possible, the personal factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not being done with regard to this Budget.  That is not being done generally throughout the country with regard to this Budget.  The Minister may have been wrong ultimately in removing the subsidies all at the one time, but it should not be said that in <Col N="1623" /> doing an unpopular thing, a grossly unpopular thing, he was acting dishonestly. How anybody can suggest that and regard himself as being a reasonable person I just do not understand.  I must apologise to the House for having delayed them so long.</P>

      <P>We had <i>Hamlet</i> in Elsinore and we had Senator Hartnett in the Seanad this week.  We had the actors in the two places; perhaps in only one case have we had the play-actor.  We have listened, if I may say so, to utter nonsense from Senator Hartnett.  He said practically nothing about the Budget.  He abused everybody whom he could think of abusing. He abused the professions and the business people and strangely enough. and fortunately for themselves, he omitted to deliver any attack on the dance-hall proprietors.  How they escaped is a mystery to me.  It certainly is strange.  They are very lucky.  I cannot explain how they escaped.  Why he should go out of his way to attack the parties he has attacked I cannot say.  He attacked the licensed traders and other bodies apparently either because a number of traders wear Pioneer badges or because some of them do not support his Party.  We have heard nothing but nonsense from the Senator.  He made no real effort to deal with the Budget.  There was no end to the praise which he gave the Minister, and so I should say Senator Quirke must look to himself.  He has outquirked Quirke.  Senator Quirke does very well but could not do half as well as Senator Hartnett has done.</P>

      <P>I had not the remotest notion of wasting any time on the dance-hall tax but as the Senator seems to be anxious to hear a little more, perhaps I shall oblige.  There can be no justification whatever for the removal of the entertainment tax.  It was stated that the Minister's Party <Col N="1624" /> gave an undertaking to remove the entertainment duty but let me make this clear.  The Minister's Party gave an unequivocal undertaking that they would not interefere with the food subsidies.  They are keeping their promise in regard to the dance-hall tax but they are breaking it flagrantly in regard to the promise as to food subsidies.  Point 15 of the 17-point manifesto for which I am sure the Government collectively accept responsibility was &ldquo;to maintain subsidies, to control the price of essential foodstuffs and the operation of an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities&rdquo;.  That is what I have to say in regard to the removal of entertainments duty.  We have heard sufficient about that and I do not propose to deal with the matter any further.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned in regard to the food subsidies what the definite promise and undertaking of the Government was and what they have done in this Bill.  How they can explain their attitude now and what they promised is difficult to understand. General Mulcahy was quoted as having said on the 16th February, 1950, that he would abolish subsidies.  Of course that was entirely wrong.  General Mulcahy on that occasion referred to subsidies but he discussed his attitude in regard to subsidies on the basis that taxation would be reduced not on the understanding that taxation would be increased.  Let us hear no more about that quotation.  Let us deal with things as they are to-day and not as they were two or three years ago.  Whatever was said or was alleged to have been said by General Mulcahy on that occasion, the fact is that he did not in any way interfere with or remove food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Marshall Aid, again we have had nothing but a great deal of misrepresentation as to the Coalition Government's dealing with the Marshall Aid funds.  The Taoiseach himself stated that every penny left in the American Loan Counterpart Fund in June, 1951, was spent upon capital projects approved of by the previous Government and incorporated in Mr. <Col N="1625" /> McGilligan's Budget statement of 1951. Yet Senator Yeats stated here that only £6,250,000 of the loan was spent on capital projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about dollars.  There are no dollars in the Counterpart Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be noted that in June, 1951, there were £24,000,000 in the American Loan Counterpart Fund out of a total of £40,000,000.  As I am on the question of dollars, might I suggest this to the Minister, that efforts should be made by him to see that dollar purchases are cut down severely?  We have heard recently of cases where, so far as I could understand, dollars were expended in purchasing goods that could be purchased elsewhere.  Be that as it may, there are purchases being made for dollars which should not be made at all to-day.  What about the import of motor car parts for motor cars to be assembled here?  Why should these parts be allowed to be imported here? Why should we spend dollars on these? Why not get the parties interested in assembling those cars to assemble cars the component parts for which may be purchased in the sterling area?  There is no difficulty in changing over.  I would stress that as a matter of very great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal recently about our contemplated transatlantic air service.  For goodness' sake, let us do away with the idea immediately. How can we hope to achieve anything except, perhaps, prestige?  What slightest hope can we have of maintaining the prestige that we may raise in a day, once, having established the transatlantic air service, we lose the service again in a month?  Our service would be bound to be crushed to pieces by American-operated services and, perhaps, by services not altogether operated from America.  Bearing in mind the fact that the Minister states that he is seeking and must obtain millions of money, I feel it is altogether wrong for him to suggest, or to allow any other Department to suggest, that we should engage in the setting up of a transatlantic air service.  The very idea is ridiculous, and I fail to <Col N="1626" /> see what would be gained from it.  I feel the Minister will have very, very great difficulty in convincing the public of this country that such services should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, there is one matter in which I find myself in agreement, to some extent, with Senator Hartnett.  In my view, very little is done by our Government to deal with the matter of savings in this country and to encourage savings, particularly small savings, by our people.  Recently the Minister told us that he was concerned somewhat with that and that he proposed a new issue of Savings Certificates. After that announcement, I wrote to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs making a suggestion to him, perhaps not a very important suggestion, as to how the idea of savings might be propagated throughout the country.  Of course, I received an acknowledgment of my letter and attached to it was a nicely printed list setting out the terms of the issue.  No effort whatever was made to reply to the suggestion I had made that a certain body might be approached with a view to getting them interested in encouraging the savings idea.</P>
    <P>Clause 17 of the Bill facilitates dealing with deposit receipts and money in joint deposit with banks.  I suggest to the Minister that he might allow the £500 to be increased to £2,000.  That will greatly convenience people in certain matters dealing with deaths.  I do not think there is any fear that revenue will be lost should he increase the amount from £500 to £2,000.</P>
    <P>Clause 21 of the Bill provides for the lodgment of certain deeds in a branch of the Revenue Commissioners' Department, known as the adjudication branch.  I suggest that it is unnecessary to have these documents so stamped.  In certain cases, the Revenue Commissioners require documents to be lodged marked &ldquo;adjudged duly stamped&rdquo;.  Certain delay arises in the adjudication of the documents.  The adjudication office is an exceptionally busy and important office.  If I may say so, it does its business very well. Arising out of the need of having to lodge certain documents, though they might be few in number, there will be <Col N="1627" /> further waste of time and delay.  I feel that the authorities might be satisfied if, instead of having documents of this kind lodged for adjudication, the documents contained a certificate setting out certain facts.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell referred to one other small point which I also have in mind.  I feel it is a matter to which the Minister should give special attention. I have heard complaints, and I am sure many other people have heard complaints, about the lack of a proper allowance for wear and tear.  I cannot pass judgment on the complaints which I frequently hear with regard to this matter, but I believe that the people who lodge the complaints have some sense of grievance which I consider to be well founded.  I would ask the Minister to give his attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for having taken up so much time.  I cannot say, as Senator Hartnett has suggested, that the people will be satisfied with this Budget.  I believe that the people are entirely dissatisfied with it and that that dissatisfaction will be very shortly given expression to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no great ambition to speak on this Bill to-night. However, I conceive it to be my duty to say certain things on which I am qualified to speak; I can see these matters from an angle which is denied other people.  This Budget is definitely a deflationary Budget.  I gather that that is its purpose.  I feel it is true to say that the idea of Irish freedom was, first of all, of course, to satisfy our national aspirations, and, secondly, to procure financial and economic freedom, so that we would not be tied together as people are in a three-legged race, having to do everything our masters do on the other side.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;master&rdquo; in any wrong sense here to-night; it has been rather hurtfully used, perhaps.  The present situation in England calls for deflationary measures.  That nation is building up a war potential and, at the same time, trying to achieve an export market to pay debts resulting from two wars. <Col N="1628" /> However, we are in a totally different situation here, just as was the case with us during the last war.  We were neutral then, and we took a line of our own, irrespective of what England said, did and tried to force us to do. Our national policy was a neutral one.</P>
      <P>I feel that something has happened in our present situation which approximates to what happened during the war in the drapery trade with regard to rationing.  We are trying to keep our industries going and to keep people employed.  However, in England, the Government are trying to take people out of employment in ordinary industries and to put them into war production.  Here we want to keep our industries going.  We blindly followed England when we took over their clothes rationing system during the war.  That caused a furore in the trade and, after a while, it had to be scrapped.</P>
      <P>A rationing system which was more suited to us was introduced, and it worked so well that it was retained to the end of the war period.  Now, we are again following Britain's lead in the mistaken belief that we need deflation when, in fact, everybody knows that we have more goods in this country than we can sell.  Instead of siphoning purchasing power and drying it up, we should try to maintain and, if possible, increase purchasing power, I mean purchasing power on the part of the public.  It is necessary to retain as much money as possible in circulation so as to develop and expand business, so as to create employment and to keep our economy strong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always taken the line that I have not been afraid to say here that the right thing should be done economically. I have always spoken thus whether or not it was the policy of the Party to which I belonged.  I have said some things from time to time at the risk of being out of step with my Party.  I have no hesitation in saying that if I felt this Budget showed the right way to live within our resources, I would feel bound to support it but I do not believe that it does so.  An ordinary business, when faced with financial difficulties, proceeds to solve its financial problems by cutting down on expenses and expenditure generally, <Col N="1629" /> but here we have a case where there has been no sign on the part of the Government of cutting down expenditure or of economising upon schemes generally.  Expenses and outgoings are just as big as ever they were which leads me to believe that the Government are just not serious in their protestations.  We are imposing these hardships on the people but the Government continues to spend as gaily as ever before.</P>
    <P>On the question of food subsidies, the food subsidies have been removed and there has been a lot of talk to the effect that Fine Gael were against the food subsidies.  I say we are all against food subsidies.  Nobody wants subsidies. I go further and say that industrial labour people are against food subsidies.  They do not desire them. Subsidies are a most undesirable form of prop in our economy but the point is that they should be abolished only if and when it is possible to do so with the least possible upset to our social and economic life.  That is just the whole point.  I was talking to some trade unionists a few weeks ago and every one of the trade union leaders said that they did not like food subsidies but that this was not the time to remove them, that it should be done at a time when trade was good, and gradually.  The object of the removal of food subsidies is to remove a weight from the Exchequer and from the State, but that should be done in such a way that the weight is passed on to the consumer at a time when the consumers are getting more wages or are getting direct reliefs from the Exchequer approximating to what they have lost by the removal of the subsidies.</P>
    <P>You may have read a statement on this question by Senator McMullen in Cork.  Senator McMullen is known to be very friendly to the present Government. One of the difficulties in this whole question of criticising the Budget is that all the criticism comes from one side.  Everybody on the Government side is bound to praise the Budget.  At least very few men on the Government side will stand up and offer any form of criticism of the existing régime.  That is the practice, <Col N="1630" /> not only in the case of this Government but in the case of every other Government.  Here is a man, however, who is forced to speak as he does because he is the official president of a trade union.  What does he say?  May I say, in passing, that I agree with him?  Speaking in Cork yesterday, as reported in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i>, he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From international problems had come the burdens created for them by the recent Budget proposals.  Most people had been prepared for increased taxation, but not for the drastic character of those enumerated to take effect from July.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say in regard to the decision about food subsidies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This decision came as a stunning blow to the trade unions....  It was felt that the Budget proposals should be used as an instrument for influencing or correcting the economic trends which have shown recent signs of running into a period of depression in trade and industry and a deepening of unemployment throughout the State, rather than accentuating those problems and making it more difficult for employment to be maintained at a high level and for the people to purchase the basic necessities of life for the maintenance of their families.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He further says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With a rising cost of living, however, there could not have been a more unfortunate moment for the removal of these subsidies, as a burden will be placed on the household budgets which can only mean the deprivation of essential foodstuffs to the families of the lower income groups through such commodities becoming excessive in price. Although subsidies had their shortcomings&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>a statement with which we agree,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;no better method had been devised by which the poorer sections of the community could be cushioned off against the full impact of abnormally high prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is just our line on this.  We do not like food subsidies but we think <Col N="1631" /> they should not be removed at this time.  I should like to say that a Budget solely concerned with financial considerations, as this one is, may solve our financial problems as posed on paper, but it ignores the effect which such Budget is likely to have as the housekeeping plan of the nation. We should take into consideration, in the light of other factors, the effect, economic and social, that this Budget will have on the people.  It may be financially desirable to do certain things, but it may be socially undesirable to do them.  That is what I feel about this Budget.</P>
    <P>A Budget should be so designed as to keep things running smoothly and harmoniously.  A burden should not be imposed on the people which is likely to upset the whole industrial life of the country and to cause shock. Even at the best of times, it would be inadvisable to do that, but it is doubly so at a time of depression and difficulty. If things have gone wrong and need adjustment, it is inadvisable, even in the case of a household or a business, to attempt to settle everything at one bang.  What anyone of common sense does in such circumstances is to sit down quietly and try to adjust matters without causing undue shock, over as long a period as possible.  There is no use in trying to settle everything at one bang.  It would be very desirable if that could be done, but it is not possible in ordinary economic life.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is no evidence of a consistent Government policy, in spite of the claim that the Government's whole policy is one of prudence, economy and care in expenditure.  I myself have been scoffed at in certain papers when I counselled economy and care in expenditure and said that certain proposals for expenditure were brought before this House because the present Government were trying to outdo Mr. Norton.  It is very unpopular where lavish expenditure is proposed to talk about living within our means, but the all-important thing is that we must live within our means. We have a policy put before us one day of retrenchment, and on another day we are presented with measures which <Col N="1632" /> involve considerable expenditure.  I must submit that we do not seem to have any consistency in Government policy.  If there was a definite policy that we should all retrench and tighten our belts I think the people would accept it if it were honestly put before them, but that is the fault with all this talk about tightening our belts.  There is no evidence of anybody tightening their belts except the ordinary citizens.</P>
    <P>This Budget is either of two things. It is either a genuine attempt to establish our finances on a strong basis in the belief that we are spending too much and generally living beyond our means, or else it is designed to discredit the previous Government.  That is the only alternative you have in approaching this Budget.  The proof of the genuineness in the first case would be the severe Budget which we have had, plus a determined effort at retrenchment of expenditure of all kinds.  This latter requirement does not seem to have been carried out.  We are not only spending as much as was spent by the inter-Party Government but we will be spending more on a few bigger and better schemes which are in the offing.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about disagreement amongst the inter-Party Government. The Inter-Party Government consisted of people from different Parties and with different views.  It made no bones about that.  I was a member of the inter-Party Government and had people with me who were completely on the Left.  By getting together, we arrived at a good policy which produced good results.  It was claimed that there was dissension in the inter-Party Government, but I suggest that in the present Government, which is a one-Party Government, there has been dissension.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs early last year saying one set of things. The phrase they used was that there was &ldquo;a terrific crisis&rdquo; in the country. That phrase was used over and over again.  On the other hand we had the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, saying there was only &ldquo;a situation.&rdquo;  The fact is that there is only a situation to be dealt with.  Life <Col N="1633" /> is just one long succession of dealing with situations but life is not one long crisis.  There were definite dissension and differences of opinion in the Fianna Fáil Party itself on this whole question.</P>
    <P>I suggest that our task is to try to expand our economy.  Even if it is not possible to expand it for special and temporary reasons, at least nothing should be done to retard and upset what exists.  Recently, the Taoiseach called this Budget &ldquo;a pay-your-way Budget&rdquo;, but you can only pay your way out of a prosperous industrial and agricultural economy. Nobody can say that trade is prosperous to-day.  It is quite evident that that position is caused and aggravated by the policy of the Government and the speeches made both before the Budget and on the Budget itself.</P>
    <P>I must excuse myself for racing through my speech.  The hour is late and there were some things I wanted to say, but the late hour curtails my remarks.  The Bill that is produced by the Minister says, in brief, that the best way to pay a bill like this is to stint yourself to such a degree that you cannot do your work, and that the country cannot freely carry on its business.  A wise Budget should preserve the economy and stimulate business.  The whole effect of the Budget has been to put down trade. In some cases it has brought factories to a standstill.  You have restricted credit by the banks.  Not only is there restricted credit by the bankers, but there is also restricted credit between traders themselves.  People are not giving the same credit to one another as they did a year ago.  Bank rates have increased, wages have increased, taxes have increased, and the cost of almost everything has increased.  The one place where we have no increase is in trade, which is down&mdash;at least in the textile industry, both in manufacturing and distribution, there is anything from a 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. decrease.  That is not a fanciful figure.  I can guarantee it.</P>
    <P>Charges have been made that Deputy McGilligan could not, in fact, have balanced his Budget.  That was sought to be proved by reference to the existing situation of our finances <Col N="1634" /> to-day.  I submit that Deputy McGilligan was relying upon an expanding economy which was fostered and encouraged by the inter-Party policy.  This was not only a policy but a fact.  There was increasing production. There were increasing trade and industry.  There was increasing employment, and even increasing population. The only thing that decreased during those three years was emigration, and that for the first time for a great many years.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see the Minister can take it.  I was saying that, under the inter-Party Government, Deputy McGilligan's plan was to finance the present situation out of an expanding economy.  That was not only a policy, but was something that could be proved by facts and figures. In the report of the debate in the Dáil, Volume 131, No. 14, Deputy McGilligan said, at column 2100:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We had gone on a policy of trying to develop the productivity of this country to get an outcropping particularly on the export side.  In 1947 exports and re-exports from this country had not touched the £40,000,000 mark.  In 1951, they were at £81,000,000.  In the first three months of 1951 they were £16,000,000, being one-fifth of the total for the year.  In the first three months of this year they were £22,500,000.  If that proportion of one-fifth is maintained during the year, it seems that exports will be at the total of £112,500,000 this year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> At column 2101 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition, we hope to achieve, in the investment of moneys at home, such an increase in the national income and the wealth of the country that taxes in a certain level would yield more revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same column he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The general tax revenue in 1948-49 was £62,000,000 odd.  In 1951-52 it was £73,000,000.  I am leaving out the non-tax revenue.  Tax revenue was up £11,000,000 in four years.  It is undeniable that, during that period, the inter-Party Government was occupied in reducing the rates of tax.  Yet we were getting that increased revenue.  Let me take a more significant thing.  I gave many alleviations to income-tax payers and reduced the tax by 6d.  Income-tax yielded £14,664,000 in 1948-49.  Last year it yielded £18,750,000.  The income-tax yield was up by £3,000,000.  The estimate given was that 6d. off would result in a loss of £1,000,000.  But, instead of losing, the yield went up from £14,500,000 to £18,750,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 2102 he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I suggest that we achieved success in the two aims we had. Imports and exports rose.  We have stabilised revenue at a high point because there is so much wealth and so much productivity in the country. That, in four years, was no mean achievement.  It is something we will have to bring home to the people and put it in opposition to this picture of misery, unemployment and slump.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am trying to show that Deputy McGilligan had reason for basing his calculations on an expanding economy. It would seem, from the Minister's Budget speech, that he believed and acted upon the assumption that earnings had outstripped the cost of living. It was, therefore, assumed that there should be no demand for wage increases as a result of the removal of the food subsidies.  If that was his assumption &mdash;in other words, that there would not <Col N="1636" /> be demands for wage increases because already earnings had outstripped the cost of living&mdash;the alternative was that the Minister deliberately threw the problem to the employers to handle as best they could.  What has happened is that the whole problem of the Budget has been thrown to the employers and into the arena of industrial relations generally at a time when we are already preoccupied with bad trade, unemployment, rising costs and higher prices.</P>
    <P>The workers claim there has been a 10½ per cent. rise in the cost of living in the past year from 102 to 114 according to the index figure whereas during the inter-Party régime from 1948 to 1951 the cost of living index figure remained practically static.  During the whole of that time there was a rise of only two or three points.  Furthermore, the trade unions argued in negotiations recently in an attempt to find a wage formula that, with the removal of food subsidies, the total rise as far as they were concerned will be 18 per cent. The Trade Union Congress goes further and includes the rise in the cost of tobacco and other commodities and that organisation works out the increase at 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is the problem that has been thrown to industry.  It represents a very big spanner in the economic and industrial machine at the moment when employers are, as I have already said, preoccupied with keeping the business and trade of the country going.  We can see the result already.  Perhaps I see more clearly than some of the public what is happening.  The result will be disorder and disputes.  We already have disputes and disorder not only between employers and workers but actually between the workers' unions themselves.  There is a veritable scramble at the moment for a rise in wages and for employers to meet some quite considerable demands, and this at a time when, instead of workers and employers wrestling with one another and fighting about wage claims, they should be standing together working out the basis on which we will be able to maintain our trade and production and keep our present employment level instead of <Col N="1637" /> being faced with an extension of unemployment.  These are the major problems with which we are faced, and we find ourselves dealing with the question of wages, which should be the last thing we should be called upon to discuss because there is no reality in discussing increased wages unless there is a prosperous industry to support those wages.</P>
    <P>Finally, I agree with some comments made by Senator Douglas yesterday. I think he was quite right when he said that there should be continuity in the policy of all our Governments. We are a small country and there is really little difference between the policies of our different Governments when all is said and done.  We are, however, creating bigger difficulties than really exist, and for that reason I feel our financial policies should bear a closer relationship with one another because it is only in that way we shall succeed in moving forward on an even keel.</P>
    <P>This idea of completely revolutionising our outlook in our Budget from year to year is a most dangerous one. A given policy should be given a reasonable chance to work.  The policy of Deputy McGilligan had only run for three and a half years.  That was a policy which embodied long-term investment in agriculture and other capital projects, and it is quite fantastic to say after a year or two that the policy did not work.  How could a policy involving the investment of £40,000,000 in agriculture be expected to produce results in two years?  It is childish to suggest that it should.  I would prefer to see the policy of the present Government being given a fair run.  The alternative is to return to the other policy, and that is the reason why it is so very important that we should have a general election in order to clear the decks for action, and let us know quite definitely what will be the Government of the future.  Are we to have a Fianna Fáil policy such as that embodied in the present Budget, or are we to have an inter-Party policy?  It is very important that business people should know what the future is likely to hold, so that there may be some semblance of <Col N="1638" /> stability.  It is also very important for the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I ought to begin on a matter of more interest to me personally than it may be to the Seanad generally, and refer to a statement made by Senator O'Higgins. Senator O'Higgins made the point that when I was speaking in Rathmines in May, 1951, I dealt with rumours which were being sedulously circulated by his friends, to the effect that if Fianna Fáil were returned the first thing a Fianna Fáil Government would do would be to reimpose the taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco, which had figured in the Supplementary Budget of autumn 1947.</P>
      <P>I said, of course, that it was not our intention to reimpose these duties and, quite naturally, as rational men we could not have that intention until we saw what the problem was.  Because I happened to say that in May, 1951, it does not follow that, in different circumstances, and if the national interest requires that I depart from it, I shall be bound by that promise in perpetuity. However, it is only a pettifogging issue, raised to make the sort of point which one would expect from Senator O'Higgins or anyone of his name.</P>
      <P>In any event, what does anything I said in 1951 matter in relation to the problems which now confront the State, the Government and the people?  We have three problems of very great magnitude&mdash;the balance of payments, the deficit on the current Budget and the difficulty in maintaining capital investment at the level which public opinion seems to demand.  These are serious problems which, if not grappled with and solved, will inevitably entail widespread unemployment, want, hardship and suffering.  Why should I or any public man refuse to face up to and take the steps necessary to deal with these three major problems merely in order to ensure that some person like Senator O'Higgins will not come along later to twist, to twist, to turn and misrepresent the statements that were made in quite different circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For what purpose did I ask the electorate to return myself and my colleagues in 1951?  I have here my election <Col N="1639" /> address.  I commend it to some of the Senators who have been talking here to-night, particularly to the Senator who spoke last.  Everybody can see it. It was signed by me and by my colleague and fellow-candidate, Senator Yeats.  It was sent to every elector in my constituency.  It went into every house in my constituency and it was received in every household before the day of the actual poll.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We, in Fianna Fáil, stand firmly on the principle that Deputies are bound by every consideration of honour and obligation to keep faith with the electorate.  It is on that basis that we offer ourselves to you in this election.  In doing so, however, we wish to make it clear that Fianna Fáil makes no rash promises. We do not know the extent to which the credit and solvency of the State has been undermined by the Coalition. We suspect, however, that bad though the position in this regard appears to be, the worst has been concealed.  Therefore, if Fianna Fáil should receive a mandate to form a Government its first task must be to reorganise the public finances and to set them in order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then went on to say what we should do when that had been accomplished:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When this has been accomplished, Fianna Fáil pledges itself to pursue a progressive social and economic policy, always, however, with due regard to the resources of the State and the individual rights of its citizens.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the pledge which I gave to the electors.  That is the pledge, set out in black and white, given, as I have said, by my colleague, Senator Yeats, and by myself, and it is on that I stand. That is the justification for the fact that, as I said, we have had to do unpopular things, but we have to do them in order to set the public finances in order and to save the people of this country from disaster.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to use these words, &ldquo;from disaster&rdquo;, disaster if the recent trend had been permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is worth <Col N="1640" /> dealing with Senator Hayes.  I think that Senator Hartnett sufficiently answered him, but it was quite clear that Senator Hayes was at a loss as to how he was going to deal with the case which I had made for the Budget.  He had expected quite a different type of speech and had come in prepared to comment upon quite a different type of speech.  Accordingly, the Senator found himself in this debate with the seat shot from under him, and, somewhat at variance with his usual form, the Senator was abusive.  I was supposed to have a dirty tongue merely because I said that I did not underrate Deputy McGilligan's intelligence, but that I had not just so much regard for his backbone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What created the difficulties for the Senator were the figures which I put before the House. When I opened this debate, I pointed out that the total expenditure, on the basis of current services, would come to £108,000,000.  I said that we had to provide, in addition, for the cost of social welfare and other possible expenditure to the amount of £3,000,000.  That made the total expenditure to be covered by this year's Budget £111,000,000.  I then proceeded to tell the House that we were deducting from that figure the sum of £9,277,000 in respect of voted capital services which left us with a net figure to be dealt with, either out of revenue or by the method which appeared to appeal to Senator McGuire of reducing expenditure.  Deducting the revenue which would accrue to the Exchequer on the basis of the existing taxes and which would amount to £86,581,000, we were left with a net figure of £15,142,000.  We propose to dispose of that figure in this way, by savings, amounting to £3,918,000, leaving us with a balance of £11,124,000 to be found out of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire said that if a business man found himself in difficulty the first thing he would do would be to try and reduce expenditure, and, having laid that down as a guiding principle in business, and, I assume <Col N="1641" /> also, in the business of public affairs, Senator McGuire proceeded to tell us that, among those expenditures which he considered to be most undesirable, were the expenditures on food subsidies. Having indicated, first of all, that he would approach this problem by reducing expenditure and then, by putting his finger on the form of expenditure which he considered to be most undesirable&mdash;having screwed his courage up to that point&mdash;the Senator immediately fled, because he thought perhaps that some colleagues on his left wing had their eye on him.  He decided that he was not going to reduce the subsidies: he was not going to reduce expenditure, and he was going, therefore, to leave us with a sum of £15,000,000 to be found by taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, pump fresh purchasing power into the whole system, inflate prices higher and higher.  That, I gather, is the Senator's specific for our existing situation.  Everybody has told us that there is an inflationary trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>That only happens in an inflationary, not in a deflationary, situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Senator was here listening to Senator Professor O'Brien and Senator Professor Johnston.  Senator O'Brien was certainly convinced that there was an inflationary situation existing in this country, and Senator <Col N="1642" /> Johnston, I take it, thought that there was an inflationary situation existing but that he was much more apprehensive of a coming depression than Senator Professor O'Brien was.  But, in any event, there was general agreement that there does exist in this country a situation which cannot be dealt with, and which can only be further aggravated by pumping fresh money into circulation in order to achieve what Senator McGuire describes as expanding your economy.</P>
      <P>The only way in which a business man can meet commitments which he is not prepared to reduce&mdash;and Senator McGuire indicated at long last that he was not prepared to do that in regard to the State's expenditure&mdash;the only way, I say, in which a business man can meet such commitments and in which the State can meet such commitments is by doing what this Finance Bill proposes, take more purchasing power&mdash;not print more money&mdash;from the public and use it in order to maintain the public services.  It may be a good thing or it may be a bad thing to continue to try to maintain the public services at their existing level.  If you decide that you are going to have social welfare schemes and social security schemes, that you are going to enhance the old age and blind pensions&mdash;as, mind you, Senator McGuire's Party did prior to the election of 1951&mdash;then you have to decide, if you are going to have any kind of soundness in your economy at all, to divert purchasing power which the people would use in other ways which seemed the best to themselves, to the coffers of the State and use it in the way in which the Government, and the general public in so far as the Government represents them think it ought to be used.  There is no escape from that dilemma, at least no permanent escape from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House at any great length, but two very interesting speeches were delivered in the course of the debate, the speeches of Senator Professor O'Brien and Senator Professor Johnston.  These speeches might make a Minister for Finance regret that the Budget debate is not opened <Col N="1643" /> in the less polemic and more objective atmosphere of this Chamber.  If it were, the public would be more appreciative of the problems which confront us and what we have to do to solve them.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to traverse the ground&mdash;I do not think I should be capable of traversing the whole of the ground&mdash;covered by Senator O'Brien.  It was a speech to which, on an economic plane, very few people could take any exception.  All the right things were said, and even the wrong things were given their due meed of appreciation, but Senator O'Brien, I think, when speaking about income-tax, concentrated upon much too narrow a front.  His remarks seemed to me to be addressed entirely to the fact that we are proposing in the Finance Bill to increase the standard rate of income-tax, but he did not give any consideration&mdash;at least what I would regard as being full due consideration&mdash;to the very significant change which we are making in the incidence of that tax.</P>
    <P>He attacked the income-tax proposal because of its adverse effect on saving, its narrowing of the differential which induced a capital inflow into this country from other countries and because it was an inflationary factor adding fuel to the fire.  In doing that, he considered, I think, the effect of our income-tax proposals wholly out of the context of the Budget as a whole.  He did not recognise, for instance, as I have already pointed out in dealing with some remarks of Senator McGuire's, that, at the end of the financial year, 1951-52, we were facing a deficit on current expenditure of the order of over £15,000,000, and that we have met that deficit by introducing certain desirable reductions in the food subsidies, and that we have, in the interests of an equitable distribution of the inevitable cost of meeting the remainder of the deficit, increased the taxation of higher incomes and company profits.  He overlooked the fact, having regard to the total amount to be found, that we had to close a gap of £15,000,000, that a net <Col N="1644" /> sum of only £910,000 would accrue to the Exchequer as a result of that particular tax change.  He overlooked, I think, the fact that, as I have already indicated, we had to try to close that gap if we were to avoid the greater danger that would flow from money inflation.  In dealing with the effect of the increased standard rate upon savings, he overlooked the fact, I think, that it is only after current expenses have been met that any legitimate saving for capital purposes emerges.  He blames us, too, because we are not giving any inducement to people to save.  There is one new tax-free outlet, however, for personal savings which he overlooked.  I announced it in the Budget speech, a new issue of Savings Certificates which yield £3 8s. 9d., free of tax, to mature with an overriding limit that no person may buy more than 1,000 of these. These were matters which the Senator overlooked regarding the income-tax proposals and what I have said as to their net effect.</P>
    <P>I have conceded&mdash;already I have said it elsewhere&mdash;that no tax is in itself good.  Every tax is naturally undesirable, every tax, I think, even a tax imposed for a social purpose is productive of certain consequences which in themselves are bad, but in any event since we must try to find over £11,250,000 out of taxation it is inevitable that we should try to do so in the way which would do the least possible social harm.  The changes which we have brought about in the income-tax code by the increase in the earned income relief, the very significant changes which we have introduced in reduced rate reliefs and the increase also which we are giving in the rate of age relief will all allow many people at least a greater margin for savings, will allow it to the small people, the people who have become the main source from which risk capital and investment capital is secured.</P>
    <P>If the standard rate of tax had been increased by 1/- and the rigours of the increase had not been abated in any way that 1/- would bring in under present circumstances £2,800,000, but because of the adjustments we have <Col N="1645" /> made the position is this: about 6,000 companies are paying £900,000 extra tax; 7,000 surtax payers will pay £650,000 extra tax; 11,000 individuals whose incomes are below the surtax level will pay about £100,000; these total payments will come to about £1,650,000.  As against that, over 170,000 individuals will get a net relief of £867,000, leaving to be retained in the Exchequer in a full year, not this year&mdash;I am talking about a full year&mdash; about £783,000.  That will be the net gain which the Exchequer will ultimately get from this increase in the standard rate of 1/-, modified, again I want to emphasise, by the change in the allowances.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  It means this: Take the range of incomes where saving is desirable.  Take an unmarried person with an earned income, the young man who has an income of £450 and who may be thinking of getting married.  Last year he would have paid £55 5s.  This year he will pay £44 5s. There is a net saving to him of £11.  It is not very much as prices go nowadays, but at any rate it does more than fully compensate him for, say, the reduction in the food subsidies.  When we come to some of the persons who are married, we find that a married couple with three children with an earned income ranging from £850 to £950 will save over £15.  There will be a net gain to them of over £15 or, in the £1,000 range, there will be a net gain of £13 18s.  In time, as I hope, we shall be able, when we get out of this wood, to reduce the standard rate of tax, the benefit of these increased allowances will be much more significant. We have had a very stiff problem to face.  We have at least mitigated any hardship which this Budget would impose by reason of the alteration in the food subsidies by the change in the incidence of the tax and by the increases which we are giving, in particular, in children's allowances.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the attitude of those who have criticised us for removing the food subsidies, particularly those who regard themselves as businessmen and realists.  Food subsidies might have been all right as a temporary measure.  We were responsible <Col N="1646" /> for introducing them first.  We had intended that they would be paid for in certain ways.  I think it was a grave mistake that we introduced them at all. They have had many social consequences which I think have been very undesirable.  First of all, they have distorted the general pattern of family expenditure.  They have put the emphasis of individual and family spending in the wrong place.  It used to be that the first charge upon a man's earnings was what was required to provide food for himself and his family. The food subsidies have concealed that obligation from the individual citizens of the State who are made to feel that they are getting cheap food when in fact they were paying for it indirectly through taxation.  Even though the appearance is that the consumer is getting the food cheaper than he would if it were not for the subsidies, the fact of the matter is that, as I think it was Senator Michael Hayes pointed out, we are collecting the taxes to pay the subsidies on the food with one hand and distributing the proceeds through all the ramifications of trade, through wholesalers, retail grocers and everyone else, to those from whom the taxes were collected.  At this stage of the performance we engage in what might be described as a vicious circle of non-productive expenditures.</P>
    <P>We have a non-productive expenditure of time and labour collecting, first of all, the taxation and then we have the futile and wasteful procedures that have been pursued in order to ensure that these moneys ultimately go back, because that is what they do, to the people from whom they were taken first.  It is a vicious circle which, as I have said, disguises and conceals from the consumer the fact that, despite the figures on his grocer's bill, he is in truth paying the full economic cost of his foodstuffs plus what it cost to collect the taxes, and then give them back to him in the way which I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because you do not collect the tax and then give back the allowances.  You deduct the <Col N="1647" /> allowances and collect the net tax afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not concealing that.  Somebody has to pay. I suppose to a certain extent a surtax payer may not be able to pass his tax on.  In the controlled economy in which we have been existing since 1939, where we have had price regulation and controls of one sort and another and competition has been restricted, probably many companies will pass on and do pass on their burden of corporation profits tax and income-tax to the consumers but, as competition becomes freer and there is less price fixing, that position will tend to rectify itself, and companies will have to carry a proportion&mdash;you can never compel them to do any more than carry a proportion&mdash;of their corporation profits tax and their income-tax. The amount, of course, which they will have to carry will depend on their competitive ability.  To the extent to which they are able to produce more cheaply than their competitors and to the extent to which their competitors, by reason of their inability to produce and market their goods on favourable terms, help to keep the general price level up, the more efficient companies will probably be able to pass on to their customers a larger proportion of the taxes on their profits.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into this sort of rather discursive argument about what happens to taxation, as I should quite probably say some things that would not appeal to the specialists among us and they might feel themselves compelled to refute some of the statements I might make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend even to try to deal at any length with what Senator Professor Johnston said but there is one thing which he did say with which I find myself in very close agreement.  He queried, I think, Senator Professor O'Brien's rather optimistic contention that there was no danger of a depression. Senator Professor O'Brien was not very emphatic about that, but he did say that the general opinion seemed to be that things would go on very much <Col N="1648" /> as they were, and, though there had been a pocket of unemployment here and there, they were isolated pockets, and the onset of a general depression did not seem to be manifesting itself. Senator Johnston took the contrary view.  He was not quite so confident that this general picture of Senator O'Brien's was an accurate or sound one.  He instanced the general depression in the textile trade, which is world wide.  This depression is not isolated and there is no question of there being just isolated pockets here and there. It is in America; it has been even in Japan; it has been in India, Belgium, France and Italy, and, of course, very markedly in Great Britain.  Even last week, the chairman of Courtauld's, who was able to show that they had had a very good year last year, warned his shareholders that possibly as a result of the trends which had manifested themselves in the current year, they might even lose their dividends, and, in these circumstances, I think we would be very foolish to rule out the possibility of a very severe slump setting in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has set in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility exists not only in relation to textiles, for many other industries are feeling the pinch, too, such as industries manufacturing luxury goods like wireless and so on.  There has been a very marked slump there.  I do not want to go over the whole range because everybody knows of these things.  Commenting on what Senator O'Brien said, Senator Johnston recalled the 1930 depression and how it had originated in minor recessions followed by less marked partial recoveries in America. Now it seems to me that, looking at the general world picture, the early pattern of the 1929 and 1930 depression is tending to repeat itself.</P>
      <P>I should like, if I had time, to consider the suggestion the Senator made that we might put a tax of £5 or £10 per head of cattle exported on the hoof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

      <P>Somebody has ascribed to me a courage which I do <Col N="1649" /> not always feel, but it would not be courage&mdash;it would be fool-hardiness&mdash; for any person to bring in a proposal of that sort.  I am not certain, either, that it would be a very effective one. It might.  If there were a growing world shortage of beef and if we had a freer market, we might be able to compel our principal customers to pay this £5 or £10.  Probably that is not what the Senator had in mind, but I think he did suggest that we should use the proceeds in order to subsidise another form of agriculture and therefore it would not matter very much, provided we got the cash, whether some people in this country paid it or our customers paid it.  In any event, I think it is scarcely a practicable policy.</P>
      <P>The Senator&mdash;and, I think, Senator O'Dwyer&mdash;referred to the problems which might have to be faced when butter rationing came to an end.  The Government is alive to the dangers there and the Butter Marketing Committee will continue to exist, at any rate for a period of three or four months, and may possibly continue to exist for a more indefinite period, but in any event there will be an organisation which will, we hope, be able to steer the industry through the early stages of the de-rationing period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a lot of other interesting things I could have said, particularly in relation to the suggestion as to our being responsible for Marshall Aid.  I should have liked to point out that there was a very significant difference between what we did in November 1947 and what our successors did in October 1948.  In September 1947 we got our <Col N="1650" /> dollars from the sterling pool as of right.  We did not borrow.  There is a very significant difference between that and the consequences which flowed from that and borrowing these dollars and spending them in the way they have been spent.</P>
    <P>It is now 10.25 p.m. and I have imposed on myself the self-denying ordinance of trying to finish as close as possible to 10.30 p.m.  There is one suggestion, however, I want to refer to before I finish.  Senator Hartnett spoke about the difficulty of inducing savings and attracting the savings of the little man.  He referred to a scheme which received some publicity in <i>The Economist</i> some weeks ago for relating savings to the cost of living.  That would be all right so long as the cost of living was tending to go up.  The psychological effect of your £10 becoming £11 if the cost of living went up 10 points, would be all right, but what is going to happen if, as might conceivably occur, the cost of living began to fall and your £10 in nominal value were reduced to £9?  The Government would speedily be accused of chiselling the investments of the small man.  One might criticise that proposal on a great many other grounds, but I do not think I have time to do so to-night.  I am now going to realise my ambition to finish before half-past ten.</P>
