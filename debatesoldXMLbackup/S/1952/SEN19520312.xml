      <P>Is dona liom go bhfuil sé de dhualgas orm a chur in iúl don Seanad go bhfuil an Seanadóir Bean Uí Choincheanainn básaithe.  Is ar éigin is gá dom a rá chomh mór agus is cailliúint ar an Seanad agus ar an tír í. Aireoidh lucht an Tí seo uathú go mór í.</P>
      <P>Bhronn Dia a lán talana ar an Seanadóir Coincheanainn; ba scoláire agus scríbhneoir den chéad scoth í. Rinne sí mórchuid taighde agus mórchuid oibre ar stair na tíre seo agus ar stair an chreidimh go háirithe.  Mura mbeadh ach an tseirbhís sin ann, tá Éire fágtha go mór faoi chomaoin aicí.</P>
      <P>Ba dhea-shampla í i gcónaí i saol poiblí na tíre.  Bhí sí ina Teachta Dála thar ceann Ollscoil na hÉireann ó 1933 go dtí 1937, an tráth ar cuireadh deireadh leis an Dáil-Teachtaíocht Ollscoile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Toghadh mar Sheanadóir í ag an <Col N="774" /> gcéad toghchán a bhí ann, an bhliain dar gcionn, i gcóir an tSeanaid nua agus do hatoghadh í ag gach toghchán eile ina dhiaidh sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhór í a spéis in obair an Oireachtais agus go mór mhór in obair an tSeanaid.  Ba duine í Bean Uí Choincheanainn nach ndearna faillí in aon ní dar bhain lena cuid dualgaisí.  Ba mhór a spéis ins gach iarratas dar cuireadh ós a comhair.</P>
    <P>Bhí mórchuid eolais aici ar shaol an ghnáth-dhuine agus is beag duine a thuig saol na tuaithe níos fearr ná í. D'oibrigh sí go tréan agus de shíor ar mhaithe leis na mná.  Rinne sí a dícheall le córas feiliúnach oideachais a chur ar fáil dóibh le go múinfí iad ar na bealaigh b'inmholta lena ndualgaisí a chomhlíonadh go cóir iomlán agus le go mbeidís ina ndea-mháithreacha.  Ba gheal léi gach dá ndearnadh agus gach a déanfaí le obair na mban, sa teach agus taobh amuigh de, d'fheabhsú agus d'éadtromú.  Solas na bhFlathas go raibh aici.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated the Seanad, and indeed the whole country, is the poorer for the death of Senator Mrs. Concannon.</P>
    <P>I know that all Senators deeply regret the passing of this distinguished lady, and wish that I should convey their sympathy to her husband and other relatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should apologise for my lack of knowledge of the procedure of the House on the last occasion. There was no excuse for me, but I suppose that many a Senator with longer experience of the House than I might easily have fallen into the same mistake.  This Bill proposes only one change, but, I suggest, a very fundamental change, in the charter of the hospital.  It seeks to remove from the charter the words &ldquo;without fee or reward&rdquo;.  This House is entitled to some clarification of the position and some explanation of what that means. The position at present is that there is a board of governors who elect periodically people to the hospital. Some of these people remain for a very long period.  They are suffering from incurable diseases and some remain there for years.</P>
      <P>What I am afraid of is that if this clause is removed it will possibly mean that people who cannot afford to pay will not be so readily elected into the hospital as people who can afford to pay.  I know that the hospital is for poor people, but there are degrees of poverty, and people may be poor who could afford to pay something, but there are others who are so poor that they could not afford to pay anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the Dublin Corporation and we subscribe to this hospital.  We have increased our contributions over the years and the present contribution is in the neighbourhood of £5,000 per annum.  What I am anxious to know is whether <Col N="776" /> removal of this clause means that in future no one can be admitted, unless he or she is willing to pay, and, if he or she is willing to pay, what will the payments amount to.  Will they be chosen on the basis of their ability to pay?  Suppose there are two patients, one of whom can pay more than the other.  Will the one who can afford to pay more be admitted to the hospital rather than the other?</P>
    <P>That is the only point I am interested in and I have no other motive in opposing the Bill.  I am anxious to protect people, many of whom I know, who are not in a position to pay anything at all.  I want to ensure that these people will have the same right of admittance to the hospital as they have now, prior to the suggested abolition of these words.  I quite appreciate&mdash;I should be ungenerous if I did not say it&mdash;the splendid work this hospital is doing and has been doing over the years for the poor of the country.  That should be said.  I can appreciate also how difficult it is, not alone for this hospital but for all hospitals, to keep things going at present, but my anxiety is to ensure that the removal of these words will not be a hindrance to the poorest of the poor getting into the hospital, as they have been getting in heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>As members of the House are probably aware, this is a private Bill and will have to go, if it passes this stage here, to a Joint Committee of both Houses, where it will have to be very carefully examined.  Only if it passes that Committee can it come back to us for further consideration.  When I heard that there might be a debate on this stage, I thought it would be no harm to make some inquiries.  I did not speak to Senator Colgan, but I heard indirectly some of the points he has made, which seem to me to be very proper and natural points to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, although I am not a member of the committee of the hospital and, therefore, cannot in any sense speak officially on its behalf, I did make inquiries, and as a result of information given to me I prepared a brief statement.  I submitted it to the solicitors for the hospital and asked <Col N="777" /> them to let me know if there was anything that was not strictly accurate in it.  They sent it back with one or two minor amendments and I propose to make that statement now, because it will clarify the position.  There might be a danger that some members of the public might be unduly alarmed by a discussion here and possibly some of the patients might be afraid of their own position, and whereas I quite approve of the statement being made I feel that it should be at least partially answered, although until the Bill is fully examined it is not possible to answer all the points.</P>
    <P>According to the information given to me the position is as follows: The hospital has been carried on under a charter granted in the year 1800 and a supplemental charter dated 1886, both of which provide that the patients shall be tended &ldquo;without fee or reward.&rdquo; It is not necessary for me to refer to the value of the work of the hospital for poor persons afflicted with illnesses declared by the qualified medical authority to be incurable.  This is fully recognised by everybody.  There are, I am informed, 236 patients at present in the hospital&mdash;100 male and 136 female&mdash;all suffering from incurable diseases and all being cared for without fee or reward.</P>
    <P>Up to the outbreak of the second world war in the year 1939 the hospital continued to be carried on with efficiency upon the income then available, but as a consequence of the war, while voluntary subscriptions tended to fall, the expenses in all directions increased consistently, as the following figures will show: Provisions in 1938-39 cost £5,205 and, in 1950-51, £9,991; fuel, electric light, etc., cost £2,340 in 1938-39 and now cost £6,360; salaries and wages, which were £4,465 in 1938-39, are now £8,156; and the average cost of maintaining a bed, which was £64 in 1938-39, is now £121.</P>
    <P>To meet the large increase in yearly expenses the managing committee was obliged to sell £44,766 of capital. Realising that this drain upon capital could not be allowed to continue if the hospital was not to be forced to close its doors, the managing committee decided to approach the Minister for <Col N="778" /> Health and ask for assistance.  A special committee was appointed to wait on the Minister and explain to him the serious financial position in which the hospital was placed.  This meeting was held at the Minister's office upon the 21st March, 1951.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, on the Minister's recommendation, the hospital received from the Hospital Trust a grant of £20,000, which almost discharged the overdraft due to the hospital's bankers at 31st March, 1951.  It was explained to the special committee that in all probability no further grant would be made, and that the managing committee should take immediate steps to place the hospital on a sound financial basis.  One of the suggestions subsequently put forward for doing this was that the managing committee should take steps to amend the hospital's charter so that it could admit into the hospital for treatment a number of public assistance patients under the provisions of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, and accept payment for their maintenance and treatment at £4 4s. Od. per week for each patient, which might be defrayed by the public assistance authorities.</P>
    <P>The managing committee therefore consulted their solicitors, who advised that in order to carry out the Minister's suggestion it would be necessary to promote a Private Bill in the Oireachtas with the object of amending the charter.  The Bill is a simple one and designed only to amend the provisions of the charter so as to make it possible for the hospital in future to take some patients for whom fees will be paid.</P>
    <P>I have been assured that it is very far from the intention of the managing committee to discontinue taking non-paying patients.  It will, I understand, continue to take as many non-paying patients as the financial position will permit, and it is expected that these will be the vast majority of the inmates. It is obvious, however, that if satisfactory steps are not taken to place the finances of the hospital on a sound basis, it will not be possible for it to continue to function.</P>
    <P>It therefore appears to me that the Bill should be regarded as a first and necessary step towards improving the <Col N="779" /> financial position so that the hospital may continue its good work.  It is, I think, important to note that, if passed, this Bill will not of itself enable the hospital to take paying patients.  Before this can be done, the by-laws of the hospital will have to be amended or replaced by new by-laws. I am informed that before these by-laws can come into force they must have the approval and consent of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the senior judge of the Supreme Court, or at least one of them.  We can, I am sure, be confident that none of these eminent judges will approve any new by-laws without full and careful consideration.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Bill should contain detailed provisions which would restrict the ways in which these by-laws should be amended in relation to the conditions under which paying patients should be received. This is, of course, a very proper suggestion and may be a matter for consideration in Committee or when the Bill is reported to the House, but I would point out that there are obvious advantages in leaving it to the hospital to amend its by-laws to meet circumstances as they may arise, subject of course to judicial approval.  No one wishes the funds of the hospital spent on the promotion of a series of Private Bills and this might easily occur if there was no power to alter the by-laws to meet altered circumstances.</P>
    <P>Apart from the possibility of the reception of public assistance patients&mdash; and, of course, it is not certain&mdash;there are other classes of patients which might be admitted without in any way altering the main object of the hospital which is to take patients without fee or reward.  It is not possible to visualise all the possible circumstances, but the following are a few examples of what could conceivably occur in the future:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  A Government Department or other public or local authority might be authorised to pay for the maintenance in the hospital of some particular class of patient.</P>
    <P>(b)  A public or private concern <Col N="780" /> might undertake to pay for the maintenance of some employee or employees. Under present regulations the hospital could not take that patient.</P>
    <P>(c)  A private individual by his will or otherwise might make a donation to the hospital on condition that a particular patient, or a patient from a particular locality, was admitted to the hospital.</P>
    <P>(d)  Social legislation might be introduced providing for the payment of substantial pensions to persons who were inmates in the hospital, and it might be reasonable that a proportion of these pensions might be made available for their maintenance in the hospital.</P>
    <P>That, I understand, could not be done under present conditions.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that this is a matter which should be allowed to go to a committee for full investigation.  I have gone to some trouble to make an investigation, but I am making this case on no responsibility except my own.</P>

    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the continuation of the Rates on Agricultural <Col N="782" /> Land (Relief) Act, 1946, for the year ending 31st March, 1953.  No new principle is involved.  The Bill merely proposes to continue the Agricultural Grant on its present basis for a further year.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, the basis of the grant was established by the Act of 1946, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A primary allowance at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate on land valuations not exceeding £20, and the first £20 of higher valuations.</P>
      <P>(2)  A supplementary allowance at the rate of one-fifth of the general rate on the whole of the land valuation above £20.</P>
      <P>(3)  An employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation above £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance does not exceed £6 10s. in respect of each man at work on the holding.</P>
      <P>In the years 1935-36 to 1945-46 the grant was fixed at the figure of £1,870,000.  Under the present basis of distribution, however, the amount of the grant varies with changes in the local rates.  This has served to shield farmers from the full consequences of the general but unavoidable increases in rates which have taken place in recent years.  In the current financial year the grant is estimated to amount to £4,230,000.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil, I am having the whole matter of this form of rate relief examined to see if the comparatively large subsidy involved might be used to a greater extent to benefit those landowners who are engaged in the forms of agriculture which afford the maximum employment and who, in present conditions, are best serving the needs of the community in regard to agricultural production.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of this examination I would ask the House to agree to the continuance of the agricultural grant in its present form for a further year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his closing remarks, to some extent anticipated what I intended to say when he stated that the basis of the <Col N="783" /> distribution of this grant is going to be revised.  I cannot help feeling, however, that at a time like this when there is so much discussion in regard to the general financial position of the country, the whole basis of the Grants-in-Aid of agricultural rates should be revised and should be examined afresh.</P>
      <P>The present position has been largely the result of a series of compromises which have been drifted into without any very considered long-term policy in mind.  I suggest that, as this Bill is purely a temporary measure, for one year only, before the Minister comes to the House next year, he should be prepared to defend the general principle of the Grants-in-Aid.  Not merely do I suggest that it should be an examination into the distribution of the grants, but into the whole principle of the grants themselves.  It is common knowledge that in the next couple of months this country will encounter a very difficult Budget and that in that Budget the Minister for Finance will be trying to meet greatly increased expenditure.  It is therefore a matter of public interest to everybody in the country that every possible source of wasteful expenditure should be very carefully examined between now and the date of the Budget.  The only possibility we have of avoiding great increases in taxation, which have an extremely adverse affect on many people in the country, is to cut out every single unnecessary piece of Exchequer expenditure.  I suggest that some of the Grants-in-Aid of rates on agricultural land could possibly be reduced or dispensed with without doing any very great harm to any section of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be no harm to recall very briefly the origin of the agricultural grant as far as I know it.  The Local Government Act of 1898 began the agricultural grant in the form in which we know it to-day.  Up to that date the local rates on land were paid, generally speaking, as to one half by the landlord and one half by the tenant.  The Local Government Act of 1898 shifted the whole control and patronage of local government from the landlords to the tenants in the <Col N="784" /> country.  I have always understood that the agricultural grant which was given under that Act was meant to compensate the landlords for the half share of the rates they used to pay, that it was a consideration for the taking away of the power and the patronage they possessed in local government and that the actual amount of the agricultural grant as defined in the Act of 1898 was the amount which had been contributed by the landlords as their half of the local county rates before that date.  In 1925 the agricultural grant was doubled.  The reason for this great increase in agricultural grants is, I think, very interesting in view of the situation to-day and the situation which is coming in the near future in the Budget.</P>
    <P>In 1925 the worst repercussions of the first world war were gradually dying down and it became possible to reduce income-tax, though the younger generation of the present day may find it impossible to believe that.  In 1925 the standard rate of income-tax for this country was reduced to 3/- in the £.  At that time the farmers' representatives in the Dáil very properly complained that the reduction in the rate of income-tax conferred no benefit on farmers for the simple reason that farmers paid, as they pay to-day, a very small portion of the total income-tax of this country.  It was in order to give the farmers some equivalent relief for the reduction in income-tax that the relief from rates on agricultural land was doubled in that year.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is this: if the agricultural grant is raised when the income-tax is lowered then the agricultural grant should be lowered when the income-tax is raised.  When other sections of the population derived benefit from the decrease in the rate of income-tax, we gave farmers an equivalent relief by way of increasing the agricultural grant, and it seems to me to be just and logical that, at a time when other sections of the population are called upon to bear the greatly increased income-tax, the farmers should bear their own part of the fiscal burden by being deprived of part of the agricultural grant which <Col N="785" /> goes towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.  If the reason which was given by the Minister for Finance for increasing the agricultural grant in 1925 is a good one, I find it difficult to see his argument against reducing the agricultural grant if income-tax is again increased.  Remember, that the standard rate of income-tax paid nowadays is more than twice what it was in 1925 and that the agricultural grant, which in 1925 stood, roughly, at £600,000, is now, as the Minister has told us, over £4,000,000, and under the new principle which he outlined to-day is rapidly and automatically increasing with every increase in local expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to stray from the text of the Bill.  I have no intention of doing anything so disorderly.  I do not propose to discuss on this Bill some of the matters I would have discussed on the motion with regard to income-tax, if it were taken.  However, what I am going to say is strictly relevant, and it is this.  At the present time, owing to the nature of the assessment under Schedule B in the income-tax code, the farmers enjoy very preferential treatment.  Without going further into that question, I feel I can say without any fear of contradiction that, owing to a series of historical developments, owing to the fact that the income-tax code has not been brought up-to-date in the light of modern circumstances, owing to the changes in the value of money, to the rise in agricultural prices and to a whole series of circumstances which I hope, at a later date, to discuss in the Seanad, Schedule B does, in fact, favour the farmers more than other sections of the population.  At the present time the only contribution which the farmers make, with the exception, of course, of very large farmers, to the direct taxation in this country is by means of the rates on the land.</P>
    <P>I suggest some revision of the income-tax laws which will bring farmers more in line than they are at present with other sections of the population for income-tax purposes.  Pending that revision, farmers should share in the burden of direct taxation in the <Col N="786" /> only way in which they can share under the existing law, and that is by contributing more to the rates on land. The way that can be done, and this is strictly relevant to this Bill, is by varying the agricultural grant.  This grant is an extremely delicate mechanism for the purpose of varying the amount of direct taxation on farmers.  It was increased in 1925 when it was desirable to reduce direct taxation on farmers. I suggest that, in the present emergency, the increasing of the direct taxation on farmers is unfortunately desirable. The most convenient means of imposing this taxation is by changing, in the opposite direction, the agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>I remember serving on the commission in 1931 which went into the whole question of the derating of Irish agricultural land.  The object in setting up that commission was to see if Irish farmers could not get some relief equivalent to what was being enjoyed by British farmers under the derating of agricultural land in Great Britain.  I need not weary the Seanad with the arguments of that commission.  Suffice it to say that a small majority of the members of the commission were of the opinion that the complete derating of Irish agricultural land was impracticable in the circumstances of the country. Certain recommendations were made for the grading of the agricultural grant in the way in which it is graded at the present time.  Certain of the recommendations of the commission have been carried into effect and were mentioned in the Minister's statement this afternoon.  Two years later, in 1933, the land annuities were halved.</P>
    <P>If reference were made to the Parliamentary Debates of the time I would probably be proved correct, though I am only speaking from memory, when I say that I understood that the halving of the land annuities at that time was meant to give to the farmers what the Derating Commission had found it impossible to give them by way of complete derating.  Whether that was the reason or not, the halving of the annuities in 1933 conferred a very great benefit on the farming community of this country.  It relieved the people who had purchased land up to that <Col N="787" /> date of 50 per cent. of their contractual obligations.  It had precisely the same effect as the halving of a monthly payment on an article bought on the hire-purchase system would have.  I always understood the halving of the annuities was meant as a partial consolation for the great difficulties of the time.  It is no use harking back on these difficulties such as the economic war.  It was not possible to give complete derating to Irish farmers as was given to English farmers but, instead, their annuities were halved.</P>
    <P>The reason I am referring to those rather distant events is that it was in those years that the present system of agricultural derating began to take shape.  Certain benefits were conferred on farmers in those years for certain well-defined reasons.  Like so many other things that happened, those benefits have been almost automatically increased without regard to the background or the circumstances.  I suggest that the time has now come to inquire whether this country can afford this great measure of relief given to one section of the population at the expense of others.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all about it but the agricultural community of this country enjoys a very favourable fiscal position.  Owing to the manner in which income-tax is assessed under Schedule B, farmers enjoy a favourable position.  That is common knowledge. In addition to that, owing to the operation of the agricultural grant, they pay on their agricultural land lower rates than other people pay on their rateable property.  Both in regard to the main national tax and to the main local tax, farmers enjoy a distinctly more favourable position than other members of the community.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and I have no doubt it will be said again, that farmers themselves contribute so largely to some of the other taxes in the country that they do not get any practical benefit from derating at all. In 1931 an effort was made by the Derating Commission, of which the result is printed in the report&mdash;and I wish some similar investigation could be made to-day&mdash;to allocate the <Col N="788" /> revenue and the expenditure of the country as between the farming and the non-farming classes.  The result shown in that investigation was that the farmers were deriving a greater percentage of the national expenditure than they were contributing to the national revenue.  Those figures are 20 years old, and I would like to see some similar inquiry to-day.</P>
    <P>Whatever the result of such an inquiry might be, we find ourselves in this dilemma: If the whole of the amount of the agricultural grant is paid for by the farmers in indirect taxation, then the position is that the farmers are giving with one hand what they receive with the other.  If the case made by the farmers that they pay such heavy indirect taxes can be justified, then the whole thing is farcical. If, on the other hand, they do not pay with one hand what they receive with the other&mdash;and I do not believe that they do&mdash;then the position is that one section of the population is in a position of preference as compared with others.  I am not saying that in any country you should not have preference of that kind.  It is the essence and basis of the so-called welfare State that the less favoured section of the population should derive certain benefits paid for by the more favoured section, and the whole basis of modern redistribution of taxation on social services is explained on that principle.  There are subsidies on food, housing and other services paid for out of taxation.</P>
    <P>Many of these subsidies have an overwhelming justification and others have not.  In the coming Budget, I have no doubt, the Minister for Finance will search for justification for the retention of some of these subsidies and, I hope, for the abandonment of some of the others.  People are waiting with interest to see which of the subsidies will disappear in the Budget, but the point I want to make on this occasion is a point that seems to be overlooked, at least I have not seen any reference to it in public discussion.  That is that the increase of the agricultural grant and the halving of these land annuities appear to be subsidisation of the agricultural population.  Many of the local <Col N="789" /> services which the farmers enjoy are subsidised by the non-farming population and in the halving of the land annuities the farmer's purchase price for the land of which he is rapidly becoming the fee simple owner is being subsidised.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is that, at a time when the financial position is so stringent, when taxation is rising and when everybody is urging that every unnecessary expenditure should be pruned and that every subsidy that has no overwhelming justification should be cut down, this is a type of expenditure which is growing almost continuously from year to year without question. It is almost regarded as unpatriotic to question the agricultural grant and it is argued that this does not fall under the heading of subsidy in the same sense as food, housing and the other subsidies.  I hope when all the other subsidies are being considered between now and the Budget that the agricultural grant will also come in for its due measure of consideration.</P>
    <P>I just want to make one other small point and it is something which the Minister has already referred to.  It is in regard to distribution of the grant.  The present grant is distributed on two differentials.  With one everybody will agree and with the other they will not agree.  The first is an effort made to try and give a greater amount of relief to the small holders. That, I think, is right.  It was recommended by the Derating Commission, who considered it was right that they should give some differential treatment to the small man.  The other system of gradation is on the basis of the amount of employment given.</P>
    <P>I really think that represents a certain fallacy and muddled thinking which is very common in this country, namely, that the amount of employment given is in itself something to be desired for its own sake.  I cannot accept that.  I consider the basis of a good agricultural policy is not the number of hands employed in producing the products of the country but the amount of the products produced in relation to the amount of labour employed.  Therefore, I suggest that <Col N="790" /> in this matter the present system of distribution is unscientific.  If the grant is going to be distributed by any other gradation outside that of the size of the holding, I urge that the volume of produce should be the basis, and not the amount of employment.</P>
    <P>The agricultural grant should not be used as a method of giving relief through employment by the farmers. That is retrograde and out of date in these times.  I am not suggesting what the system of gradation should be because the Minister said it is going to be investigated, but I agree it should be on a rough and ready measure of the area of the land under tillage.  Everybody in the country is agreed that an expansion of tillage is desirable.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a gradation of the agricultural grant in relation to the amount of tillage rather than the number of men employed would be more consistent with general agricultural policy.  In other words, the agricultural grant is a very delicate mechanism for guiding agriculture, as it gives to the Government an extremely mobile and flexible instrument for helping agriculture in various directions.  I suggest that a scientific and rational grading of the grant, not in relation merely to the number of men employed&mdash;because that is simply the old relief work mentality and we are back in the days of the Famine&mdash; but in relation to the amount of produce of the land, would enable this delicate mechanism to be utilised for the general furtherance of the Government's agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for delaying the Seanad so long, but I ask the Minister to give us some assurance before this time next year that the larger items of expenditure of public money will receive some more serious consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of attempting to follow the very interesting examination of this whole problem which the House has heard from Senator O'Brien.  He has raised a number of interesting and fundamental issues which I have no doubt the Minister will deal with&mdash;from the first, income-tax, down to the last&mdash;the idea <Col N="791" /> behind the examination of the present plan of distribution of grants through local authorities.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege of serving on this same Agricultural Commission to which Senator O'Brien refers, in 1931, with him.  It was not at all an invidious position that we representatives of the rural community occupied on that commission.  We were up against people with trained minds, the statisticians like Senator O'Brien and a number of his colleagues.  I think the majority of them were distinguished graduates of the university, and all were very skilled in putting their point of view across.  He refers to the fact that documents were submitted to that commission which purported&mdash;I say purported&mdash;to give a picture of the benefits the agriculturists received in the distribution of State grants, but it was something which no informed representative of the agricultural community would accept.  It was the kind of thing which people looking at Ireland through Dublin eyes would like to present as their view of the situation, but those of us who came from the country did not accept it then and, with greater experience to-day, are not prepared to accept it to-day.</P>
      <P>I am not following the Senator, except to say in regard to the point he makes about the farmer not paying his share of income-tax, that he is paying on his valuation.  There has been an increase in the incidence of income-tax over the years.  I would suggest to Senator O'Brien that it would be a very profitable study for him to examine by how much and by what percentage there has been an increase in contribution made by the farmers and by the ratepayers to the maintenance of local services in the same years.  He will find that the farmer is considerably more out of pocket, by the contribution he has to make to meet the ever-rising demand for the maintenance of local services, than the income-tax payer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suffer from the delusion that Senator O'Brien presents to the House in regard to the benefit of the halving of the annuities to the farmers. <Col N="792" /> My feeling about that then, and my view still is now, that we went through then such a purgatory and paid so much before the land annuities were halved, that it would take a very long time for those wounds to heal up.  At the same time, I recognise that when you have very able minds presenting the sort of picture which Senator O'Brien has given to the House, of the ease with which the farmers are able to carry this very light burden, it demands examination, and it is the responsibility of the Minister to give Senator O'Brien his answer.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true, as I am sure Senator O'Brien realises, that there have been vastly increased demands for the maintenance of county and main roads.  An immense amount of traffic is going over the main arteries of the country, to the maintenance of which our farmers are making a very considerable contribution.  While some of them under £20 valuation are getting certain reliefs, it is important that it should be understood that they must pay full rates on farm buildings, just as the resident pays on a building in an urban district of the city.  There is no relief there.</P>
    <P>The disturbing point about relief in regard to rates is that while the people benefit where the valuation is under £20 and it is then graduated up to a certain point, there is a very considerable area of the land to-day which is not covered.  It is true that that is only in the case of a limited number of people, but the burden which their land is made to bear now with the increasing rates must be a matter of grave concern and it is something which ought to be studied.  The Minister has informed the House that there is an examination of this question going on&mdash;I gather from him&mdash;in his Department.  If the problem is as presented to us by Senator O'Brien, it is obviously not in the Department of Local Government that it should be studied at all.  It has much wider issue than the issues that have been raised and it is much more vital and fundamental, and I think it must be taken out to a wider field for study. I do not quite know how any officials in the Department here could determine as to what would be the equitable <Col N="793" /> distribution of these grants amongst the ratepaying community if they have to analyse what is the most profitable use to which the land can be put from the national point of view and from the point of view of giving employment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps by way of reply to Senator O'Brien I might say that there is no method by which land gives less employment than when it is used for growing corn.  In Carlow, Louth, South Kildare and places like that, where a man goes in with tractors and does the ploughing and sowing of corn drills, and goes in with a combined harvester in the autumn, there is very little employment at all.  Those who know anything about agriculture know that not only in this country but in every country in the world the greatest density of employment is given where you have animal husbandry.  I do not know what the Minister's policy is, but I would like to hear him explain more fully what his views are.  You can have a conflict between Governments on this and it is something on which people should find agreement.  If you have agreement on the basis of relief of the area under wheat, you find it changed overnight with the change of Government and the distribution of grants goes on to a changed policy. That is something which should be examined and determined outside Party considerations, as it is something on which there should be reasonable understanding one way or another.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said by Senator O'Brien and people who are income-tax payers to a greater extent than some others&mdash;for reasons that one might say are obvious and perhaps understandable&mdash;the fact is that agriculturists in every county to-day are considerably perturbed at the rising cost of local administration.  Those of us on either side of the House who have had to sit for hours studying Estimates presented to us by county executive officers are aware of that. There have been demands in some counties for as high as £2 in the £. In my own county the demand was for 31/10, but after hours of consideration we succeeded in reducing it to 27/3. <Col N="794" /> All of us in every county have reached the stage when the burden of local taxation is such on the ratepaying community that unless things are radically altered we will find that we have planned a scheme of expenditure which we will not be able to sustain.  I think you will find a spirit of rebellion developing among the agricultural community. It will not be quelled by the views expressed by Senator O'Brien or anyone elaborating on the position or examining it, however interesting that examination may be.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the rural community feel that the amounts given in grants by way of relief of rates are not sufficient and feel also that they are paying for services which are, in the main, national rather than local services. Far from any reduction in the amount given and due to the local ratepayers by way of relief from the Central Fund being made, their feeling to-day is that the rising demands of local expenditure are such that further relief by way of increased grants to assist local ratepayers is necessary, if local administration is to be reasonably efficient at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator O'Brien was giving expression to his viewpoint in regard to the relief of rates on agricultural land, I could not help thinking that I had heard that viewpoint expressed before.  It occurred to me then that I had read that viewpoint expressed in certain newspapers some time ago.  It struck me that perhaps Senator O'Brien's mind was made up by the expression of that viewpoint in those newspapers, but it then struck me that perhaps he had made up the minds of these newspapers. The latter might be the more correct way of putting it.  Senator O'Brien quoted the Minister as having said that the basis of distribution of the grant was going to be revised.  If I understood the Minister, he said it was going to be examined, which, to me, means something different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien, without giving the premises on which he based his argument, tried to prove that there should be an inverse proportion between income-tax and the agricultural grant, but I fail to see on what basis it can <Col N="795" /> be argued that there should be such a proportion between the two.  He said that when income-tax was reduced was the time when the agricultural grant was increased and hence, since income-tax has increased, the agricultural grant should be reduced.  That is not the premises on which to build the argument that there should be an inverse proportion between income-tax and the agricultural grant.  It is a grand thing to hear Senator O'Brien say that the halving of the land annuities conferred a great benefit on the farming community.  Agreed, it did, and perhaps if his statement had been made at the time that matter was of serious political import it might have had some effect, because quite a lot of people at that time argued that it did not.</P>
    <P>Since I come from a rural area and am a member of the farming community, I feel that there is an onus on me to try to put a viewpoint different from that put by Senator O'Brien.  He suggests that there is not equity in the distribution of the agricultural grant and because of that suggests that there should be a reduction in the grant.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely possible in any human scheme of things to have absolute equity and it may be argued that even in the system of taxation on the basis of poor law valuation there is not equity.  There is, however, this to be said for it, that it is very hard for anybody to devise a better system which will collect the same amount of money and cause less hardship.  It is not a great argument in favour of the system of taxation on poor law valuation.</P>
    <P>In relation to this matter of the agricultural grant, I am not at all prepared to accept that there should be an inverse proportion between the volume of the grant and the scale of income-tax, but I am prepared to argue that that grant is given to the under-privileged people of the country and is intended primarily for people on the lower valuations.  The people who benefit most by this derating grant are the people with poor law valuations under £20 and perhaps in respect of the second and third headings of the distribution of the grant, there <Col N="796" /> might be need for some adjustments, unless there is to be a radical change in the system of distribution.  Senator O'Brien did not suggest any change in the system of distribution, apart from his criticism of it in its present form, and Senator Baxter did not suggest any change either.</P>
    <P>I think we will all agree that the purpose of this grant is to help local authorities to give a standard of service in different counties on the basis of some equality and to have reasonable equity in the taxation of these counties.  I am prepared to say that at present it is scarcely achieving the purpose for which it was intended, and, if there is to be any change in the system of distribution, I am prepared to argue that there should be some scheme of a basic rate, the same rate in all counties in the country, and that the grants should be distributed to the different local authorities having regard to their position with a view to ensuring equality in the standard of their services.</P>
    <P>Anybody will agree that as long as a penny in the £ will give £2,400,000 in Meath and £600,000 in Leitrim it is quite impossible to have an equal standard of roads, hospitals and the other services maintained by local authorities.  Any sensible person will maintain that.  Therefore, if there is to be a change in the distribution of this grant, I argue that there should be a radical change so as to ensure the same rate in Donegal, Leitrim, Kerry and Galway as in Dublin, Kildare, Wexford, Waterford and the richer counties.  The grant should be distributed so as to ensure as good services in these counties of hospitals, roads, sewerage, water, housing and everything else which local authorities provide.  Only then would there be equality in the distribution of the grant.  That, in my opinion, would be a better line upon which to work than that suggested by Senator O'Brien, who held that the grant should be reduced, because the main purpose of the grant is to give the services and to ensure some equality as between the various counties.  I am convinced that unless something like that is done there will not be equality in services between the <Col N="797" /> congested areas and the counties along the eastern seaboard.  The people in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry are entitled to the same standard of services as the people anywhere else, and it is because those standards are not available to them that you have a marked drop in the population of those counties.</P>

      <P>The assurance given by the Minister in his brief statement introducing the Bill that the whole question of rate relief will be examined is a statement I was glad to hear.  The whole question of local administration should be examined. Like my friend Senator Baxter I am a member of a local body.  We spent two long days recently trying to effect a reduction of rate from 42/- to 35/- in the £.</P>
      <P>My experience during those days is that the question of local administration at the present time is one that few local representatives have time to handle.  They are presented with files of correspondence which need time for analysis, and the business of studying a manager's estimate invariably falls to a section of the council.  Their suggestions are invariably approved by a majority of the council when as a result of their investigation their recommendation is made known.</P>
      <P>The whole system of local government has, from the point of view of the ratepayers, gone from bad to worse for years.  I happened to meet a citizen of an urban area very recently who commented on the time when industry in the town in which he lives was in a flourishing condition, when the spending capacity of the people was far better than it is now and when the local urban council spent a considerable time one evening discussing the advisability of accepting a suggestion that the rate should be raised from 5d. to 5½d. in the £; the rate at the present time is 40/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with Senator O'Brien that rate relief for the farming community should be related not so much to the amount of labour employed on the farm but to the amount of production issuing therefrom.  I would like the Minister to try to take into consideration the towns where there is no <Col N="798" /> rate remission and where the excessive demands in the matter of rates are very high.  If these people improve their premises their valuation is increased and their rates go up.  The question of rates at the present time in this country is one of considerable worry to those who must meet demands for rates which, as I have already said, are far in excess of what they used to be when those concerned were in a better position to pay them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Senator O'Brien was very interesting.  He always is.  He said a number of interesting things in his speech to-day, but a number of them were interesting only in theory and were not to a very great extent at all practical.  He referred to the gain which accrued to farmers following the halving, or virtual halving, of their annuities, but that was not a real gain to farmers. The circumstances which made that grant necessary cost them considerably more than they will ever make by this alleged halving of the annuities.  Any farmer, given a choice between the halving of his annuity and the position which obtained before that became necessary, would opt, not to have his annuity halved, but to go back to the pre-economic war position. The halving of the annuity meant to the farmer whose annuity was £5, £2 10s. Od. a year or, with an annuity of £20, a saving of £10, and that, I suggest, was no great gain to any farmer.  I do not agree with Senator O'Brien at all.  I am practically in entire disagreement with what he said except, perhaps, in so far as the Minister might consider the question of production and apply it to some large degree as a test for an abatement. That, I think, is the only part of Senator O'Brien's speech with which I could agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke of the favourable position of farmers with regard to income-tax. Of course, they are in a favourable position.  They may, if they wish, prepare accounts for the farm, but there would not appear to be any liability for a tax on the accounts of a number of farmers in this country.  Because of that position they are not being treated any more favourably than any <Col N="799" /> other citizen.  The £4,000,000 which this grant will require is a very small sum compared with all the other grants which must be met from the national Exchequer.  Grants to aviation amount to over £540,000, and food subsidies cost over £11,682,000.  There are many other grants where farmers do not get full value but where in the main town dwellers get the benefit.</P>
    <P>Grants are also made towards housing, and there, again, I suggest that the urban dweller derives greater benefits from these grants than do the agricultural community.  The Minister has suggested, and Senator O'Brien has agreed, that an examination should be made of the entire system, but that we should let it go out from this House that there should be a substantial reduction in the agricultural grant because more income-tax has to be paid, would be entirely wrong.  There is no reason why, if higher income-tax must be levied on people who have taxable income, this grant or any part of it should be withdrawn from the farmer.  The farmer pays by way of rates a larger amount than the people in the towns and cities, and he must, because of his economic circumstances, get the benefit of this agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, or rather we might be entitled to conclude, that the farmer who gets the main benefit from this agricultural grant is a man who, were it not for the income-tax laws as at present constituted, should be paying income-tax on, perhaps, £1,000 or £500 per annum.  There are very few such farmers living in this country, at least to my knowledge, and I feel that that is the opinion of most of the people here.  The grant which is sought by virtue of this Bill is one which is eminently necessary and essential for a particular economic state.  I suggest that, if the people in the cities and big towns were given the option of going to live on farms and given the advantage of the great boon, as has been suggested, that the agricultural grant confers on farmers, they would decline the offer.  I feel that for the reasons I have mentioned <Col N="800" /> there should be no falling off in the amount of the grant.  Undoubtedly, as the Minister has told us, there would appear to be a case for an examination of the system by which the grant is allocated.</P>
    <P>There is one matter with which I feel the Minister might concern himself in that examination.  I suggest that he should employ some production test with a view to giving to the bigger producers a larger share of the grant. Probably he would be met with administrative difficulties there.  In conclusion, I would like to say that I feel that there is no reason why the amount of this grant should be criticised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested some years ago that it would not be very long until the rates levied on agricultural land would be greater than the rack rent.  I know of a case where the amount of rates paid on land is now approaching something in the neighbourhood of £4 per acre.  If I may be slightly dramatic, I think I am right in saying that landlords have been shot for less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that the farmer does not pay income-tax.  The farmer is liable for most of the Schedule A tax.  If he happens to be a man with a large holding and has no dependents, he is also liable for Schedule B tax on the assumed profit that he derives from the working of that holding.  It has also been mentioned that he is receiving subsidies.  These subsidies are for the purpose of reducing the price of the commodity which the farmer produces and they are meant not to benefit the farmer but the townspeople. If the price that the farmer could charge for his commodities were free, these subsidies would be a definite boon.  However, that is not the case, because his subsidies are used to enable the townsmen to buy at a cheap rate.  I feel it will be time enough to do away with these subsidies when the countryman, be he the farmer or the farm worker, is in receipt of a higher income, or when his average income is higher than that of the town worker.  Let us consider for a moment an ordinary country town.  Let us take one street in such <Col N="801" /> a town.  A tradesman lives there, a shop assistant and many other workers, but between them they would not be paying £100 in rates.  Two or three small farmers would be paying that much.  The farming community contribute more in rates towards the maintainence of hospitals and social services generally than does any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>Being men of substance, most of them, they cannot get any free treatment in the hospitals, but have to pay in full.  It shows a lack of knowledge of the situation to say that the farmer is not paying a vast amount in taxation.  If the farmer were deriving all these economic benefits that we were told about, nobody would be living in the towns, but would be pursuing agricultural vocations.</P>
    <P>Every census shows that a large number of people are leaving the land for the softer way of life of the towns. The tariff walls which are built up are meant to protect the people in the towns, both industrialists and workers, in many cases to the disadvantage of their brothers and sisters on the land.</P>
    <P>One thing which I would like the Minister to do, if he does set up a commission to inquire into the system of rating and local government in general, is to drop the county-at-large charge.  This charge is encouraged under local administration as a sort of log-rolling.  If there is a water scheme introduced into one village in a county, every other small village must have the same sort of water scheme, whether the people want it or not, because there is a grant for it. Some people think that it will be to their advantage and that they will be considered progressive if they can put more on the rates and get more out of the Central Fund when it is going to cost their particular area little or nothing.  If the several charge system were reverted to, at least in part, it would have the effect of stopping a certain type of person competing with other sections of their county in order to get State grants and county-at-large charges, which are for the benefit of their locality.  There is no real benefit in spending money for the sake of spending money.  It is a very short-term benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> If the Minister sets up this commission I think he will have to see how local government, the manager and the council can co-operate to get efficiency. I believe at the moment they are out of step.  The information that local government have in regard to efficiency and in regard to any schemes that are being carried out by our local authority rarely ever comes into the possession of the councillors who have the responsibility of providing money for these schemes, in whole or in part, in their own counties.  I believe that the managerial system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With those few remarks I will conclude and I ask the Minister to bear these things in mind.  I would also ask him to remember one thing particularly, and that is, the farmer is in his own way probably the most heavily taxed person in this community&mdash;if he were not we would all be living on the land.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Brien at the outset expressed the view that the sum of £4,500,000 provided as subsidy to the farmer by way of these agricultural grants was a huge sum and that the time had come when serious consideration should be given to the payment of these and other subsidies.  We all agree that £4,500,000 is rather a large sum of money and I think a discussion on a subject of this kind at this particular time should be very welcome because it brings before this House and before the public much of the moneys that have been provided, of which little or no regard is being held by the people who are in receipt of the various subsidies.  When I say that, I do not refer only to the farming <Col N="803" /> community but also to the consuming public who are benefiting to a great extent from these subsidies.</P>
      <P>When we regard the sum of £4,500,000 as being a large sum we must also have regard to the fact that the relief of a burden of £5,000,000 per annum from the backs of the farmers through the halving of the annuities must have been some consideration. While Senator O'Brien considers £4,500,000 a considerable sum, Senator O'Reilly considers that there was little or no benefit to the farmers by the relief of £5,000,000 in the halving of the annuities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>He could also have stated in regard to the payment of this grant the benefit that may accrue from it to the person who is paying £5 per annum in rates.  I think that, as the Minister has informed us that consideration will be given to the system of distribution of these grants, we should take the matter seriously. Senator O'Brien and other Senators who have spoken have suggested that, rather than pay a part of the grant on the basis of employment, the new system should be on the basis of production. With such a suggestion I do not at all agree.  Each and every one of us knows that there is no farmer in this country who is going to employ persons throughout the whole year at the present rate of agricultural wages and under present conditions for the purpose of availing of the small benefit that may accrue from this Bill.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there is no farmer in this country who is worthy of the name of farmer who will have a person employed unless he is employed on useful production or what leads to production in the long run. I do not think it would be an inducement to the farmers if we were to adopt the suggestions made by Senator O'Brien and others, to revert or change over as an experiment to allocating these grants on a basis of production of a particular crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that would be unjust because you would be benefiting particular farmers who would have the land <Col N="804" /> suitable for the production of that particular crop.  Therefore, no matter how we view the position, we will come to the conclusion that, whatever can be said against, certainly the weight is in favour of the present system.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have spoken of the advantages farmers have in regard to income-tax, but I suggest that the agricultural grant was first introduced as a recognition of the contribution made by the ratepayers in providing social services that were not their function when the system of levying rates was first introduced.  We know that farmers are the largest body of ratepayers and that they are in the greater part providing the social services for our people in the towns and villages throughout the country. It is only just, therefore, that whatever contributions could be made to relieve the burden of the rate being placed upon them should be made, and I would press that the present system be continued.</P>

      <P>I would like to agree with what Senator O'Brien said, that, on the whole, in this debate, we must take the wide view in a matter of this kind and see this relief of rates in the setting of the whole financial system of the country. I especially agree with him in regard to the matter of relating the income-tax with those reliefs in rates, because I do feel, in some respects, farmers are a favoured community, and I think we must be careful not to indulge them too much.  Senator Baxter does not like the sound of that.  We realise that the farmers in this country are our life blood, but sometimes blood can get high pressure as well as low pressure, and there is a danger, if it is over-fed, it may develop a high pressure which would be dangerous to the body politic.  That, I think, seems to be what Senator O'Brien is warning us against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this Bill, and I hope you will allow me, Sir, a little latitude in this matter.  You have allowed latitude with regard to the Budget, income-tax, the managerial system and various other <Col N="805" /> things.  I would say that, in the Seanad, we suffer a little from opportunities of taking the broader view of matters of this kind.  We do not meet very often, and I think you will agree with me, Sir, that an amount of latitude in taking the broader view will be permissible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good advice from an experienced parliamentarian. I suggest, in this matter, taking the wider view, that the farmers are in need more of workers than of financial relief.</P>
      <P>No matter how the farmers are favoured with favourable financial legislation, unless the rural population is maintained and if possible increased, these reliefs will not serve their purpose. I visited West Cork last week and I was disturbed by some of the things I saw and heard there.  I heard of farms that were no longer being worked, even derelict farms.  We have all heard these things but they become more serious when you hear them from the people themselves.  It has been emphasised again and again in this House that there must be an improvement in the social amenities of the countryside&mdash;mere financial relief is not enough.  I am sure the Minister has this very seriously in mind but I would like to draw his attention to one special rumour which I heard in West Cork at the week-end.  I take this opportunity of drawing his attention to it in case he may not have heard it himself. It was mentioned to me by some of the more enterprising citizens there. Apparently, there is some risk that the State intends to rob Peter to pay Paul in the rural areas.  Let me explain what I mean by that.  The farmers say just when this legislation is going through the Oireachtas that valuation officers were going around the country studying the parochial halls, old and new and the suggestion is that they are going to levy rates on these halls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope you will agree with me that this bears directly on the wider problems of the agricultural communities because if social amenities are diminished or taken away you will not keep the workers on the land and you will <Col N="806" /> not keep the young people in the rural areas of the country.  These parochial halls are provided as social centres and if they are taxed new halls will not be built and some of the old ones will be sold.  In that way the social life of the rural areas will suffer.  I know this is not a matter within the jurisdiction of the Minister but he could bear it in mind when taking part in Cabinet discussions and express his view against putting rates on these parochial halls. Some of the enterprising citizens in West Cork have assured me that this is a matter causing grave concern and I hope the Minister, if it is a fact, will do what he can to prevent it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statements which have been made here in regard to the very favourable position in which the farmer is supposed to be, I am rather surprised that there has not been a flight to the land instead of a flight from the land, of which we have heard so much.  At the same time, I think that if some of the people who hold that the farmer is in a favourable position in getting everything change places with him for a while, they will soon be flying from the land again.  It is only fair and right that the present rate of relief should be given to the rural ratepayers; otherwise a very serious situation would arise because with the great increases there have been in everything it would be almost impossible to carry on.  Since pre-1914 rates have gone up ten times.  In one rural district in my own county the rate was 2/2 in the £ in 1914 and it is now 23/3, and that would be a fair average to work on.  You have many social services which have to be taken into consideration and paid for in the national interest and it is only fair that the national resources should be called on to pay a reasonable share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reached a stage when roads, and particularly main roads, have become a serious problem.  The time has come when they must be regarded as national highways.  This problem was discussed by my county council recently and the general feeling was that much of the traffic now using the main roads should be diverted to the railways, which are subsidised by <Col N="807" /> taxation.  Housing is another matter which must go on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be agreed that housing is a national problem and for that reason there is every case for the charges in respect of it.  It is fair and right that a certain amount of relief should be based on the employment given on the farm.  I think it was Senator Baxter who said that if you sowed a crop of wheat, you would not have to give much employment with the present state of modern equipment. The best employment is given in dairy farming and the work is given all the year round.  It would be hard to work out a basis of distribution of the grant on the area tilled.  The amount of employment given seems to be the most reasonable way of deciding on the distribution of the grant.</P>
      <P>People in the towns have a grievance that valuations are being increased because of all the sanitary services which are being provided for them. It is, however, the rural taxpayer who is bearing the bulk of these charges even though he is getting no direct benefit.  Even if there is a small increase in the town valuations, they are getting the services for it.</P>
      <P>The question of the estimate of valuation is another thing which caused a difficulty because it changes from year to year.  The claim of the agricultural community is that they are receiving in the agricultural grant not too much but too little, and if the Minister is making any case with the Minister for Finance it should be one for an increase in the present grants, and his efforts in making that case would be very much appreciated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable attention to the speech made by Senator O'Brien, who, no doubt, was expressing the city mentality.  Later I had the pleasure of listening to his colleague, Senator Stanford, and it occurred to me that when Senator Stanford was visiting West Cork it was a pity he did not <Col N="808" /> take Senator O'Brien with him.  Had Senator O'Brien visited the seaboard counties along the West or South, he would not have made the type of speech we have heard this evening. He is anxious that some of the surplus wealth which has been showered on the farming community should be taken from them, by having the grant in aid of rates reduced considerably, to the benefit of the general taxpayer, the inference being that the farmer is getting too much. It is a pity Senator O'Brien did not develop the argument further and tell us the proportion of income which the said wealthy farmer in the South and West is deriving from his labour, by comparison with those more fortunate people who live in the cities and towns.</P>
      <P>Over 50 per cent. of the population are engaged in agriculture and, as a reward, they get approximately one-third of the total national income. Less than 50 per cent. live in the cities and towns, and they get the remaining two-thirds.  Now Senator O'Brien calmly suggests that those who get only half the reward of the others should have their incomes cut to benefit those who get £2 to their £1.  Is it not an amazing thing for Senator O'Brien to go back to the year 1925, when the relief of rates was introduced, to find that, year by year ever since, and despite changes of Government meanwhile, there has been an exodus from the land and you have the people fleeing from that prosperity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford referred to small farms in West Cork being left derelict and unworked.  That is not confined to West Cork.  There are other areas I know very well, where small holdings have been abandoned and people have locked up their houses because the small income they were deriving from the land would not enable them to live and they have gone elsewhere to seek more remunerative employment. It is time some protest was made, to inform those people in cities and towns of the conditions obtaining amongst the very small-holders in the South and West of Ireland.  I do not propose to detain the House this evening <Col N="809" /> by referring in detail to the Bill before us.  The Minister has already said he does not propose to introduce any changes and, knowing him as I do, as a man of considerable common sense who knows the conditions in rural Ireland, I know that these interests are safe in his hands.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien also referred to the halving of the annuities.  This is the first time I have heard any admission from those who think with him that that has been a benefit to the community.  Undoubtedly it was, but it was a benefit that was very much needed, and I hope it is being appreciated.</P>
    <P>Decreasing the burden&mdash;whether paid in rates or in income-tax&mdash;on the shoulders of those who are in the happy position of having to pay super tax, so as to relieve them from paying super tax, and having that amount collected, either by rates or by income-tax, from the small-holders in the West and South, will not improve conditions. Whether we like it or not, the people of this island depend exclusively for their prosperity directly or indirectly on the produce of the land and any act we may do here or elsewhere that would help to reduce the income they derive from the land will not benefit even the people in the cities and towns. It is a pity that more people in the cities would not act like Senator Stanford and take an occasional run to the South and West to see the conditions there and how the people have to live and work hard&mdash;no eight hour day for them&mdash;to drag out a poor existence. The transferring from the very wealthy of the burdens which they naturally have to bear, not merely in this but in every other community, on to the shoulders of these poor people is an appalling idea.</P>

      <P>I must be grateful to the members who have spoken inasmuch as I cannot complain that they did not open up this field sufficiently wide to permit of my speaking almost as long as I should like and talking about anything and everything under the sun. I am very appreciative of their good intentions, but I do not propose to make use of all the freedom they have presented me with this evening: I do <Col N="810" /> not propose either to deal in any comprehensive way with the speech which seems to have aroused a good deal of interest, because, to tell the truth, I have not had much experience of the members of this House since it was constituted on the occasion of the last election.</P>
      <P>I know very little of my friend, Senator O'Brien, but I know enough to know that these trained economists are magnificent at raising hares, and to know that they raise them in an assembly of this kind for many reasons.  They love to have people run after them and they like to demonstrate their independence of thought. They think that, because&mdash;and we get tired listening to it, because it is so true that it does not need to be repeated as often as it is repeated by public men&mdash;this is an agricultural country, public men dare not say the things to which Senator O'Brien has given expression.  I am quite sure I could think of a whole lot of other reasons why people of the trained type of mind that Senator O'Brien has take the greatest possible pleasure in provoking this sort of shadow-boxing which we have had here for the past hour or so.  I do not take exception to it&mdash;I must say I enjoyed it&mdash;but I am not going to get in any way frothy because of some of the statements he has made with regard to the matter we are discussing and considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a very harmless intention when I mentioned in the Dáil that I was going to consider, in the course of the next 12 months, the distribution of what I described here as a large sum of money.  That was my intention in the other House, and it was my intention in briefly referring to it here also.  I will try to give the Seanad as briefly as I can the thoughts that were running through my mind when I was confronted with the responsibility of introducing this simple measure.  Simple as it was, it was, to me, a measure dealing with a large sum of money, and, without throwing my mind over the wider field which we have been invited to traverse, without thinking of the responsibilities of the Minister for Finance in these times, without thinking <Col N="811" /> of the problems that the Senator set himself of income-tax going down in 1925 being used as an argument in favour of the agricultural grant going up, and then considering whether or not it was a proof that when income-tax went up in the years that followed, the agricultural grant should come down&mdash;without conjuring in my mind all these highly delightful little problems which I will leave to the trained economists&mdash;I was asking myself, when I saw this figure of £4,300,000, if these amounts which were being collected from the taxpayer were being distributed in a manner which would secure for the community the best possible return, and especially were they being distributed so as to secure the best possible return, having regard to the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day and may find ourselves to-morrow.</P>
    <P>I know that it is the duty of a Minister to have regard to the problems of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, at a time like this.  I am afraid that, instead of showing sympathy and understanding for him, many of us are amongst his worst problems, but however that may be, I say that it was not my intention to have regard to the size of the sum and not my intention to have the size of the sum examined in regard to the problems that affect the Minister for Finance and the Government. It was purely and simply an announcement by me to the Dáil and Seanad to make the public aware that, in 12 months' time, there might be introduced a new system of distribution of this sum of money designed to achieve objectives from the farming community which would contribute in the largest possible way to the general interests of the whole community making these sums available out of taxation.</P>
    <P>I knew that the making of this brief reference to my intention would provoke discussion even though I was not proposing to make any change this year.  I admit that if I had had time to have the matter examined thoroughly, the chances are that changes would have been made this year, because, however much we may <Col N="812" /> say here or outside in defence of the agricultural community as against the people of the towns and built-up areas, however strongly we may hold a point of view with regard to the section of the community receiving the best treatment, I know&mdash;I hope I have been properly described&mdash;as a practical countryman that the farmers in these times and for some time past&mdash;and judging by the tendencies we see around us, it would appear that the same will apply in the future&mdash;who are engaged in the production of the commodities so vital to us now are the people who find it hard to get labour.</P>
    <P>They are in competition with a lot of other interests for that labour.  There are other attractions which are serving as inducements to labour to seek employment in other fields, and, when Senator O'Brien talks of the giving of employment on land and the undesirability of regarding employment on land as a sort of relief scheme, I entirely, completely and absolutely disagree with his approach, because I take it that by and large the farmer who gives employment is the farmer who is engaged in the form of production which is most suitable to us now and perhaps at all times.  Senator O'Brien could, of course, with his modern mind and modern notions, say that the modern farmer may, by purchasing machinery such as milking machines, eliminate labour, but I know farmers who have considered these matters, for example, the installation of a milking machine.</P>
    <P>I know farmers who have gone to other farmers with milking machines and said: &ldquo;What do you think of this machine?&rdquo;  The query addressed by the farmer who had them to the farmer who had not always was &ldquo;Can you get men to milk your cows?&rdquo; and, if the other said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; the owner of the machine replied: &ldquo;As long as you can get men to milk by hand never mind milking machines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien entreated me to treat these sums of money on the basis of the employment they give but I absolutely dispute that and refuse to accept that advice, whether it comes from Senator O'Brien or all the economists in the world, because his approach comes from a different experience and from a complete and <Col N="813" /> absolute lack of the knowledge which belongs to the man on the spot, the man who is charged with carrying on the job.  We want the wheat to convert into bread&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course, bow to your ruling, but I am showing, I hope, that the purpose behind these sums of money was a much narrower one than that with which I have been credited by those who have spoken here in the Seanad.  At this time when farmers who are owners of land are claiming freedom to do as they choose, freedom to grow or not to grow, the freedom described in the Dáil and outside it, I have no hesitation in saying that if the taxpayers are asked to provide a sum of £4,300,000 for the relief of the rates of those who own land, the Government responsible for the taxation to make that available and I, as a Minister of that Government, are entitled to ask whether the community will get the services as a result of that provision to which the community is entitled.  It is not, therefore, with the end in view to which Senator O'Brien has given expression, the end of securing some relief from the point of view of the Minister for Finance for the problems which confront him now and in the future, that I have decided to examine the matter over the next 12 months, but rather to ensure that those who work the land for the benefit of the community which is most difficult and trying in these days will, if we can secure it, reap the richest possible harvest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to raise the limit of advances to the Electricity Supply Board.  As the House is aware, the Electricity Supply Board draws from the Exchequer the capital needed for its development and the amount which the Exchequer can advance to the board is limited by legislation.  Under the existing legislation the limit is £36,945,000, and the effect of the section of this Bill is to raise that by £22,000,000 to £58,945,000.  It is estimated that that sum will meet the requirements of the board until 1955. Out of the additional amount to be advanced to the board approximately £12,500,000 will be spent on new generation; £4,000,000 on transmission; £4,000,000 on distribution, and £1,500,000 on general purposes and contingencies.</P>
      <P>In preparing that estimate of the capital needs of the board it was considered that the demand for electricity would double during the course of the next five years.  The House is aware, of course, that it takes generally from four to six years to complete the construction of a new generation station, and as far as the next five-year period is concerned new stations that will come into production are either now under construction or have reached the stage at which construction is about to commence.  I will give the new stations in the order in which they will come into operation.  The first is the extension of the North Wall station. The North Wall station, as the House may be aware, was built upon the boiler houses which were originally constructed for the oil refinery project. When that project lapsed the Electricity Supply Board took over these boiler houses and built a small power house there.  That station is being considerably enlarged and two additional generation sets will be installed, adding 100,000,000 units per year to the board's supply by 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new station is being built at Cork to burn coal or oil, with an estimated <Col N="815" /> capacity of 200,000,000 units per year, which will be in production by 1954. A new station is being built at Ringsend, also to burn coal or oil, with a capacity of 200,000,000 units per year, to be in production by 1955.</P>
    <P>In the following year another generating set will be installed at Ringsend, adding another 100,000,000 units to the capacity of the system, and in that year also the new Ferbane turf-burning station will come into production, with two sets giving 160,000,000 units.  In 1956, the first set in the proposed turf-burning station at Bangor-Erris will be in production, giving 80,000,000 units.  In 1957, the Lee River hydro-electric station, with one set giving 60,000,000 units, and in that year also the second set of the Bangor-Erris station are expected to be in production, adding another 80,000,000 units to the board's production.  That programme of generation up to 1957 will, it is thought, keep the board's generating capacity ahead of demand.</P>
    <P>It will be understood that estimates of that character must necessarily be provisional.  The total capacity of the existing power stations of the board and of these new power stations to be erected may vary with conditions.  The hydro-electric stations are affected by weather conditions and the steam stations by fuel supplies.  The estimated capacity of the stations is based upon average conditions.  The estimated demand for current is, of course, even more provisional, but the rapid growth in the use of electricity during the past few years indicates that demand will continue to increase at the rate I have indicated.</P>
    <P>A further programme for the next following five years has been drawn up but, of course, no part of the capital required to carry it into effect is provided in this Bill.  That programme is being drawn up now because if work is to be completed in accordance with the board's schedule during that period, it is necessary to start planning now.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase by £3,000,000 in advances to the board for the rural electrification scheme. The legislation passed in 1945 fixed a <Col N="816" /> limit of £5,000,000 to the advances that might be made to the board for the purposes of that scheme.  That limit has now been raised to £8,000,000.  The rate of progress on the rural network is accelerating.  The progress made in 1951 was the best to date.  It is hoped that that improvement will be continued, although that hope is subject to certain supply difficulties being overcome and to the successful outcome of the board's efforts to meet shortages of technical staff.</P>
    <P>The finances of the rural electrification scheme have, of course, to be reconsidered.  When that scheme was prepared in 1943 it was based upon the assumption that prices post-war would be pre-war prices plus 75 per cent., and the finances of the scheme rested on that calculation.  It is now obvious that the costs of constructing the network, the cost of the scheme as a whole, will be substantially greater than was assumed in 1943.  The present estimate for the final cost of the scheme is £24,500,000.  On the original calculation one-half of the capital cost of construction was given to the board by way of free grant from the Exchequer. It was recognised then that a capital subsidy of 50 per cent. was provisional in large measure and that if costs worked out different from the assumptions made then a revision of the capital subsidy would be necessary if the board was to avoid losing money on the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is more than obvious now that a 50 per cent. subsidy is inadequate and it may even be that a 100 per cent. subsidy would be necessary to prevent any charges falling upon the board's revenue because of the rural electrification scheme.  The charges now falling upon the board's revenue by reason of the fact that the capital subsidy is still on a 50 per cent. basis are not considerable and it is not a matter of urgency to rectify the present position.  But it is obvious that at some stage the whole matter will have to be reviewed.  I was intending to review it later in the present year.  The additional capital which is being provided for the rural electrification scheme will meet outgoings, it is estimated, for two years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> The rest of the Bill deals with pensions of Electricity Supply Board employees and proposes to make certain changes in the law in that regard.  The first of these changes is to give to pensioners of the board who retired before the relevant dates&mdash;which are September 23rd, 1946, for manual workers and April 1st, 1946, for general workers, who are not covered by the general Act passed in 1950&mdash;increases in their pensions corresponding to those provided in the 1950 Act.  For some reason&mdash;it may have been a drafting error, it may have been a deliberate decision, although it would be hard to understand&mdash;that increase of pension, in so far as it applied to Electricity Supply Board employees, gave the increase only to those employees whose pensions were calculated on a cost-of-living basis. The purpose of this amendment is to give a similar increase to the board's employees whose pensions are on a fixed basis.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the board has different categories of pensioners arising out of the fact that it took over local authority staff at various stages of its development with different pension rights and many of them with no pension rights at all.  Only after the passage of a considerable period of time will all the board's employees have their pension rights based solely upon the board's own schemes.</P>
    <P>Another change being made here is to make the increases in pensions which were authorised by the 1950 Act, as well as increases under this Act, retrospective to 1st April, 1949.  That was done for local authority employees but, for some reason, it was not done for Electricity Supply Board employees. There is one other change in the law relating to the board's pensioners being made in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation regulating the transfer of Local Government employees to the Electricity Supply Board, these employees are entitled to remain indefinitely in the service of the board.  If their services are terminated, they are entitled to appeal to the Minister for Local Government. At the time at which most of them were transferred, there was no legislation fixing age limits for retirement <Col N="818" /> for Local Government employees. Such age limits were fixed by the Local Government Act, 1941.  However, that Act did not apply to these former employees of local authorities who were transferred to the Electricity Supply Board, and the purpose of one of the sections of this Bill is to apply the provision of the 1941 Act to these transferred employees of the board. The retiring ages fixed are the same as those fixed by the 1941 Act for Local Government employees.  When the board's pension schemes were being prepared, it was contemplated that the normal retiring ages would be 65 for men and 60 for women, and these schemes provide that service with the board after these ages will not count for pension purposes.  The actuarial basis of the schemes was calculated upon that assumption.</P>
    <P>It appears, however, that the schemes are in conflict with the legislation in respect of that provision, and one of the sections of this Bill is designed to remedy that defect in the legislation by determining as the normal retiring ages the ages specified in the schemes and to provide also that subsequent service with the board will not count for pension purposes.  That section of the Bill is intended to rectify a defect in the 1942 Act.  In so far as the House may wish to consider these pension provisions, they are more appropriate for discussion on the Committee Stage than on Second Reading.  As, however, a Bill was necessary to effect changes in the law relating to the board's advances to which I have referred, an opportunity was taken to make these changes in respect of the pension provisions also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is of very great importance, perhaps of greater importance than the Minister's speech would indicate.  It was given considerable discussion in the other House. Very large sums of money are involved, sums by way of advances to the Electricity Supply Board, but also, as the Minister has indicated, by way of actual grant for certain purposes.  This Bill, of course, is based on the Electricity Supply Act, to which the Minister and his colleagues were so strongly opposed.  It is worth saying <Col N="819" /> that the scheme based upon the Shannon development, which was in its initial stages very much opposed by all kinds of people for all kinds of motives, some of them extremely bad, has now proved itself to be, and has all the time been, the most sound, the most solvent and the most efficient of all State enterprises.  The Electricity Supply Board has been completely successful. It has not only paid off some of the capital but it has also paid interest at varying rates to the Government for money advanced.  Since that is the case, we should take every step to see that nothing is done now which will in any way endanger either the efficiency or the solvency of that particular board, or of the whole enterprise.</P>
      <P>There are, as the Minister has frequently stated, and he has very strong views on this, sources of power for electricity generation available to us here at home.  I am referring to water and turf.  The other requirements for electricity generation, coal and oil, have to be imported.  It should not be too easily decided that we must not import anything.  There is a considerable volume of opinion, that we should strike a balance between those four sources of power&mdash;water, turf, coal and oil.  During the period of office of the inter-Party Government a considerable number of schemes for electricity generation were approved, two of them using turf.  The turf-burning stations in question were erected at Allenwood and Ferbane.  A water-power station was erected on the River Lee, and the development of the River Erne was continued and is now completed.  As the Minister has told us, a steam station was erected at Ringsend and another steam station at Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from declarations by the Minister that he would entirely reverse the decision to have more coal or oil stations if he had his way.  However, there is a great deal to be said for striking a balance, while at the same time using local resources to the greatest possible degree.  For example, a drought would upset the water supply, and strikes would affect supplies of turf.  It is very difficult to store <Col N="820" /> turf so that every station would have sufficient quantities of reserves.  The whole theory is based upon the opinion, which is justified by our experience, that the consumption of electricity is going to increase greatly.  I feel the Minister might tell us when concluding what the development of electricity is going to cost and what the effect is going to be upon the price of current, because it is true that there will be development.  If the price of current were too high the development might not be by any means such as the board or the Minister indicates.</P>
    <P>I would like now to consider the question of native power.  It is quite true that when all practicable workable water power has been developed the board will still be in the position of not being able to supply the current which it is thought would be demanded at the end of another five years or, indeed, even now.  Therefore we must use something else.  I am entirely in favour of using native resources if these resources can be made to do the work and do the work under proper conditions.  I feel we ought to tackle the whole problem in a realistic way and find out precisely why we are doing certain things.  I am all in favour of native resources.  I was reared up in that particular doctrine. The question arises: Can turf be used so as efficiently to generate electricity? Is it cheap or are we merely using it for the employment of labour? Another argument for employing native resources is that in time of war we would be unable to import either oil or coal.  At any rate we should be able to see where precisely we are going and what precisely our projects are going to cost us.  For example, there is no method by which we can control the price of coal or oil.</P>
    <P>Is there any method of controlling the price of turf or is it the case with it, as with coal and oil, that we do not know the price to which it is going to soar?  Are we able to say that Bord na Móna has been in a position to supply the Electricity Supply Board with all the turf which it requires? There have been very definite statements that Bord na Móna has not been able to supply the amount of turf with <Col N="821" /> the required lack of moisture content which the board requires.</P>
    <P>Questions arise about the turf stations on which the Minister can give information when replying.  They require immense quantities of water and they must be built close to a bog. How long will the bog last?  When it is exhausted what is going to happen to the station?  How does one get the immense quantities of water required for the generation of steam while one is working the bog?  What happens when the bog has been exhausted?  I put it that way so that the Minister might tell us when concluding.</P>
    <P>I read the debates in the Dáil and, like the Minister, I am not a technical person.  I made an endeavour to understand, and I made inquiries as to what milled peat is.  I feel I am right in saying that the briquettes now being made are not the milled peat which it is intended to use in the station at Erris.  The Minister stated that the milled peat can be produced, that furnaces can be adapted for its use and that it can be used for the generation of electricity, but at what price? Would it not be desirable to lay upon the table of the House a White Paper setting out the Electricity Board's opinion, upon which the Minister based his own view, that milled peat could be used for the generation of electricity. It has never been used in these islands or in Europe, except, perhaps, in Russia.</P>
    <P>In his speech in the Dáil the Minister made a passing reference to its use in Russia.  The Minister may be in a different position to most others when he could refer to what was been done in Russia in this respect and to get information of a complete character about what has happened in Russia.  This submission was made that the technicians and the Electricity Supply Board were satisfied with the prospect of milled peat in the generating of electricity.  If that was so, it would be desirable that both Houses should be told by way of a White Paper on what basis that satisfaction has been achieved in regard to the use of milled peat in a station at Bangor Erris.  We are going to pay £2,000,000 for this project, and, that being so, we <Col N="822" /> should have technical evidence of the matters on which the Minister's prophecy is based.  He said, for example, that the best water content for milled peat for the generation of electricity was 55 per cent., but one would imagine that that was high.  If it was found that the milled peat did not work at the Bangor Erris station, then it would become what the Minister and his colleagues once called the Shannon scheme&mdash;a white elephant.  I hope that will not be so, but we should be able to see what the evidence is and be able to state quite clearly that milled peat could be used in that particular way.</P>
    <P>The demand for current has increased considerably in recent years and we use less electricity per head of population here than in other countries.  The nearest country to us in consumption is Italy, and even there they use half as much again per head of the population as we do.  Norway uses 17 times as much.  It is quite clear, therefore, the expectation of the board that consumption will increase is well based.  I would like to ask the Minister if he can say whether the new demand expected for current can be met by electricity generated from turf. In other words, can turf production be stepped up in such a way as to meet the increased demand for electricity? As far as we can get the figures, the average increase in turf production from 1945 to 1950 was 13,300 tons per year.  That would produce 10,000,000 units of electricity.  In the same period the increase in electricity generation was 75,000,000 units.  In other words, seven and a half times as much electricity was used as could have been generated from the extra amount of turf production.  It is expected that by 1955 the amount of extra current used will also have increased to 20,000,000 units.  As we are all anxious for information, perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us what the figures are and what is the information or data on which he is basing his prophecy.</P>
    <P>The question of pensions is one that might be left over for Committee, but I want to make a point that there is a sum of £450 over which no increase <Col N="823" /> might be granted.  That is a figure adopted in this Bill because it was adopted in a Civil Service Pensions Bill in 1950, but we should recognise the fact that the cost of living then was much lower than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to get further information from the Minister. The board has had a very successful career so far, and much as I would like to see the native industries developed from our own resources we should not work on a basis of slogans or principles alone.  It is a matter of technical difficulties and we are entitled to more information than has so far been made available.  In the meantime, I support the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill and the provision of £22,000,000 for the general purposes of electricity and £3,000,000 additional for rural electrification is a clear indication of the Government's policy to continue with the development and to provide the necessary impetus for the development of our national industries. Senator Hayes has at the outset paid a tribute to the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And to the people who at the outset made it possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to those who originated the Shannon scheme.  That is a controversial question which I think would be well left alone just now.  The development of the Shannon scheme did confer benefit on a particular group but at the same time created a national problem which is not going to be very easy to solve and which has inflicted great hardship on a large section of our community. However, this is not the time to discuss that.  The Shannon scheme is there and the hardship will continue to be there until some engineer comes along with some device to overcome this state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes also paid tribute to the work of the Electricity Supply Board, but here again I would like to join issue with the Senator.  It is almost 30 years since this board was established and yet we find that the supply of current falls far short of the <Col N="824" /> demand.  I think it was wise for the Minister to introduce this Bill in the spring or summer rather than in the winter, because in the summer, though they have encouraged the people to instal electrical equipment instead of giving them the necessary current to use it, they will be rationing in every way.</P>
    <P>A board controlling a national concern such as this should be able to produce not only sufficient to meet the demands but to provide a surplus, and their business should be to go and seek the consumers to use that surplus. Senator Hayes has also paid tribute to the fact that the Electricity Supply Board have paid their way.  There is no difficulty in the members of the Electricity Supply Board making their undertaking pay, for they have a monopoly and when they decide to increase charges there is nothing the consumer can do about it.  I would like to ask the Minister to go into the question of charges in the country, and particularly in Galway.  The people feel that because the Electricity Supply Board is a semi-State concern there can be no inquiry into their demands for increased charges, as there would be in the case of a private concern.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business suspended at 6 p.m. and resumed at 7 p.m.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the charge for electricity by the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not wish to delay on that question, but I would like to mention an incident where the charge for power in 1949 in the case of one particular undertaking was £600, and, as a result of the change in charges by the Electricity Supply Board, for the same amount of power that sum was raised in 12 months to about £900.  We all appreciate that the board has the same difficulties in regard to the cost of material and labour as every undertaking.  I raise this question to-night, however, because there is a feeling abroad that as the Electricity Supply Board is a State-sponsored board the same examination of costs is not made as would be made in other cases.  It is very important that an assurance should be given to the people that everything possible will be done in the <Col N="825" /> future to ensure that the supply will be made as cheap as possible, and that all reasonable precautions will be taken to see that any increased demands made by the board on the public are justifiable, and that the public will be satisfied that those demands are justifiable.</P>
      <P>Many of us are disappointed at the slow progress in the supply of electricity throughout the country.  Generally speaking, that disappointment is more pronounced in the case of rural electrification. When we passed the Bill to provide for that, we had hopes that more progress would be made.  I appreciate the difficulties in securing materials and skilled labour for this purpose, but here again I would impress on the Minister the necessity to use his influence as far as possible with the board, to get them to use vision and foresight in the planning of rural electrification schemes.  Each and every Senator and Deputy is aware of complaints from many areas where the scheme is at present being undertaken, on account of part only of a parish or district being provided for. We have had experience in the past of local authorities providing sewerage or water supply schemes for a particular district and making provision only for the immediate demand; and when that particular area was developed the previous schemes had to be scrapped and a new one undertaken at considerable extra expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I see up and down the country, the same thing is happening in regard to rural electrification.  In several cases, because of the anxiety of the residents in one part of an area to get the supply and to comply with the regulations of the Electricity Supply Board, provision is being made to give them a supply.  There may be a little hesitancy amongst the occupants in the other part of the area, or for one reason or another they may not be as anxious to get it, but the time will come when they will be anxious and then the original scheme will be scrapped and new poles and higher-powered cable will be needed to extend the benefits of the scheme to the whole district.  We should do everything we can to ensure that this kind of thing does not happen.  We have <Col N="826" /> seen it occur all round the country month after month in the case of the development of water and other services by local authorities.  A long-term view should be taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the West of Ireland and in what have been termed the undeveloped areas, we have a particular grievance about rural electrification.  In many cases, the demands being made at present by the Electricity Supply Board cannot be complied with in these particular areas.  If there is not a more sympathetic approach by the board to the question of supplying electricity to the Gaeltacht and undeveloped areas, it will be many years before we give those areas the essential services we have provided for other districts.</P>
    <P>In this connection again, there are difficulties with regard to population&mdash; the fact that it might not be economic to extend supplies.  I suggest that the board should encourage the utilisation of available waterways and the setting up of small generating plants in such areas as Connemara, Donegal, Kerry and places where such waterways are available and capable of supplying, if not the whole area, a great part of it. There is no doubt that we have the turf to provide the fuel for the generating stations.  I want to impress on the Minister the importance of urging the board to adopt a more sympathetic attitude towards the supply of electricity to the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes, while welcoming the Bill, expressed grave doubts as to the advisability of spending such considerable sums of money in connection with the utilisation of turf for generating purposes.  If my memory serves me right, when the original rural electrification Bill was introduced, we heard somewhat the same doubts expressed. At that time, these doubts were backed up, it was claimed, to an extent by the engineering staff, or at least by the reluctance of the Electricity Supply Board to look with favour on the development of our native fuel for generating purposes.  However, a change has come about and we have seen the results at Portarlington.  We have seen from statements made in the Dáil that not alone did the station there stand up to the engineers' anticipations but surpassed them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> We have a suggestion now that we should not proceed with development in respect of what is termed milled peat and Senator Hayes questioned the Minister as to whether he had received any definite technical advice on the point or whether milled peat was used in any countries outside Russia. Is it the suggestion that we, having been satisfied to a great extent that it is possible to use this fuel with success, must wait&mdash;we have waited already for over 30 years&mdash;another 30 years until some other country convinces us that it is possible and then proceed to develop it?  The Minister's proposal is very reasonable.  He has indicated to the board that he is prepared to be sympathetic towards a proposal to set up a station to test it out and to see whether it is a success and we know that the board is prepared to proceed with the work.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the Bill&mdash;its provisions seem generous&mdash;there is a question on which we ought to satisfy ourselves.  Are we making sufficient provision now or will we, in 1957, when, as the Minister said, the works now in course of erection will be in production, have provided for the demands and any foreseeable demands that may arise.  It takes a number of years, we know, to plan a generating station, to erect it, and get it into operation.  We recently passed a measure which is being availed of in many parts of the country and which makes provision for sums of money to encourage the establishment of industries.</P>
    <P>We must remember that it does not require a very big industry to consume a considerable amount of electric power in a year, and, if this great industrial revival proceeds as we expect it will, I have grave doubts as to whether the present provision will be sufficient; whether, as a result of that lack of foresight on the part of the Electricity Supply Board to which I have referred, progress will not be retarded; and whether, in 1957, we will not find ourselves compelled to bring into operation all the annoying restrictions in the shape of curtailments of supplies which have been imposed on our people for a number of years past. <Col N="828" /> The greater use there is of electric power by industries, the greater the annoyance and the upheaval when restrictions of any kind have to be imposed.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to be quite satisfied that the provision now being made will be ample, not alone for 1957, but for quite a long period to come. I have grave doubts that that will be so, but I hope that, within the shortest possible space of time, the Electricity Supply Board will find itself in a position to abandon the restrictions imposed from time to time, and particularly during the summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in the happy position with this Bill that, while there may be criticism, there is no opposition to the passing of the measure; he does not always find himself in such a fortunate position.</P>
      <P>The whole problem of the development of sources of power has been something very fascinating in the life of man.  Here we have engaged in the development of our water power resources for a number of years and most recently we have turned to the bogs.  What has been done up to the present is now realised by all to be inadequate for the needs of the country.  This measure, which empowers the Minister to spend a considerable sum in addition to what we have already invested, is another step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approach this measure, I may say, as I approached the original proposal. I was in the other House when Deputy <Col N="830" /> McGilligan introduced the original Bill, and those of us who have watched the development of these resources all along must feel that, however critical we may be of ourselves at times&mdash;and perhaps with a good deal of justification&mdash;we have gone a very great distance along the road since Deputy McGilligan, on the inspiration of Dr. McLaughlin, introduced the first plan to harness the Shannon.  My view is that we have now come to the point when we should be told about the study which has been done of our total power resources.  It may be that this is available; I do not know.  Senator Hayes, in addressing himself to certain aspects of the Bill, said that we could develop power from water, turf, coal and oil; could we not also add from the wind and the waves of the sea? This problem of harnessing all the forces of nature available to us is something urgent.  There is a need to-day for more power than is available in the country.  As Senator Hawkins, who has left already, said, we need more power for industry.  We are quite satisfied that the development of industry in many areas of the country is contingent on power being made available for electricity.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said on perhaps one or two occasions that we are nearing the end of the development of power from water.  I wonder if that is true. It is an aspect of this question which I think requires re-examination and I would like to submit to the House and the Minister my view.</P>
    <P>All over the country we have many mountain streams which individually have not a great capacity for producing power but which, I think, taken collectively could add very considerably to our power resources.  Senator McFadden has referred to conditions in Donegal and I could speak with some knowledge of the west end of my own county where there are mountains which extend for 30 miles into Leitrim until they practically reach the sea.  I know that it can be stated that the development of power from these mountain streams would be possible only at a cost which would really be uneconomic.  That is the answer one will get, but if you require power and <Col N="831" /> can have it only by importing some commodity not available at home, at what point can the production of power from resources of our own be said to be really uneconomic?  These are resources which are still untapped. While I appreciate the view of the engineer, the trained mind who looks for these forces from some large river where the possibilities are very great, it seems to me that we have hundreds, perhaps thousands, of mountain streams which in other parts of the world would be used for the development of power and which you can harness if you will.</P>
    <P>What does it cost?  I know many of these streams.  I have tramped along their banks in my own county and I am satisfied that, while the cost of building dams with available material might be considerable, it would not put any great strain on our resources if it were done by the employment of local labour and local material.  I feel that the possibilities in this direction have not yet been fully exploited at all and, while some may think it wise to build on turf and others may feel that with the use of foreign coal and oil we may develop sufficient powers to meet our needs, I feel that what is available and secure at home should not be left unharnessed.  There is certainly work yet to be done and a study of the possibilities of the country will be rewarding.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes raised questions about the development of power from bogs.  My view on this has I think been previously stated in the House, and the Minister knows quite well what my approach is.  It does not matter from what side of the House the criticism may come regarding the utilisation of peat for the development of power.  One of the big problems which will confront the country in the future for generations to come is to get rid of the peat from the heart of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have said before that, in my judgment, if the great tracts of bog which are in this country were in Italy in the days of Mussolini, if he could have done nothing else with them, he would have employed his millions of people to dig them out so that the vacant <Col N="832" /> spaces could be taken over and turned into arable land or made available for forestry.  That, in my opinion, is the way in which this space ought to be utilised for the future development of the country.</P>
    <P>Another new aspect of turf development was introduced by the Minister's proposal to develop electricity from milled peat.  I have been down to the bogs on two or three occasions, and I have examined this milled peat.  I want the Minister to clarify this position for me.  I am a person who spent much of his youth working on the bogs, but, frankly, I am puzzled to know how one is going to produce milled peat in sufficient quantities, and store it so as to ensure that we are going to have an ample supply available continuously for the production of power by means of the turbines which are going to utilise milled peat.  I am not aware how this is going to be produced, collected, stored and, above all, protected against the weather, so as to ensure that it is going to have a moisture content of no more than 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the first place, if provision is to be made to have ample supplies of milled peat, or if power is to be based on ample supplies being available, I can well imagine stores having to be built which would cover half the area of Dublin.  One realises how turf mould accumulates and develops in bulk in a very short period.  I want some information from the Minister on this point. When one realises the immense quantities of peat compressed, stacked and stored that are necessary to develop power so as to ensure that the stations are kept going, I am at a loss to know how this other plant is going to work. While I have full sympathy with any new method connected with the development of power from our peat resources, I want some enlightenment on this point.  This problem has been discussed in the other House and also the possibility and the wisdom of erecting a power station close to the Arigna mines.  There is a great deal to be said for that idea.</P>
    <P>I understand that the question of surveying our resources in wind power is somehow or other being measured in conjunction with work done somewhere <Col N="833" /> in Great Britain.  I wonder would the Minister be able to enlighten us on that or on the possibility of harnessing power from the sea.  All these matters are, I feel, pertinent to this Bill.  In my view, the major consideration for us is to visualise the necessity, for a variety of reasons, of developing electric power to a greater degree than is anticipated to be necessary at the moment.  Sometimes in the past the Minister found a certain amount of enjoyment in making prophecies about the future.  I know that people can be caught out as a result of making prophecies. Bearing in mind the state of the world to-day, by the end of two years Western Europe and perhaps the whole world will probably have reached a turning point.  Armaments are being produced in such quantities as will ensure that the western world will be certain of having ample sources available to meet whatever may come to pass.</P>
    <P>Already we see not only in our own country but outside it, unemployment at a higher figure than has been the case for a number of years.  If America and Britain and Western Europe decide that they have sufficient guns, that the atomic energy plants are producing enough devilish machines and so on, there has got to be a switch over to a new type of production.  We must face this possibility in two or three years time or even before that, but anyhow in the foreseeable future.  When that time arrives the change over is unquestionably going to come about and be difficult for every highly industrialised country and particularly difficult for Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The change over to consumption goods of one kind or another will mean a very considerable degree of unemployment, and it will mean for us in Ireland that 50,000 or 100,000 of our emigrants will come back to us in the course of a number of months.  So as to meet that situation, we ought to make sure now, as far as we possibly can, that there will be something for these people to do.  Realising the means that are available to us, we should try to develop our own resources so that our returning emigrants can be absorbed into employment and so help towards producing the goods which we <Col N="834" /> need.  I feel that that, in itself, is a reason for urgent action by us and for the adoption of every possible plan so as to meet the dangers and difficulties of the future.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us whether the decision of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to increase bank interest rates will have any influence whatever on the Minister's plans for financing the development of electricity under this new Bill.  Are we going to have to try to do this now with dearer money than we utilised in the past?  If so, what are the effects going to be as regards the cost of electricity?  I remember examining on another occasion here the balance sheet of the Electricity Supply Board, which had come to my hands a few days before a debate in this House.  I was astonished to find the proportion of the total revenue of the Electricity Supply Board which went towards the repayment of principal and interest. Perhaps the Minister would enlighten the House on that matter.  If he did, it would be very interesting for us to know the cost of servicing the debt and the proportion of the total revenue of the board which goes towards such servicing.  If money will be much more expensive than probably at any time in the past, the influence of this dear money on the cost of production and the sale of electricity is going to be a factor of which we ought to take cognisance now.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any study has ever been given to the possibility of decentralisation in regard to the whole production and management of electricity in the country.  It has been said to me on a number of occasions down the country that if, instead of having the one central authority, we had two or three, one for the Erne, one for the Shannon and subsidiaries, and perhaps one for another district in the South, each board operating in conjunction with the others but working on its own with a spirit of enterprise and competition, we would get a better and cheaper service.  I do not know whether that has ever been studied or surveyed, but it would be interesting if the Minister could give us his point of view on it.</P>
    <P>There are certain risks in the building <Col N="835" /> up of huge structures like those of the Electricity Supply Board.  I am not a querulous sort of person and I am not finding fault with the administration. I am looking at it from the point of view of the country as a whole.  Especially at the moment, when the development of power is increasing, it is unsatisfactory that the system should be under one central authority.  I think it would be well worth study whether it is wise policy to have all our eggs in one basket, to have this organisation under one central authority.</P>
    <P>In regard to rural electrification, the Minister indicated that in regard to the financing of this scheme, the whole problem has to be studied again in the light of the increased cost.  I wonder if the Minister would be able to indicate to us what these increased costs are.  We know they have gone up but, as regards the increases which have taken place, how much is due to the production of power and the costs of installation and distribution?  Undoubtedly costs of production have gone up very considerably since the early days and we know that the production of power from peat, rising charges and that kind of thing, must mean an increase in the price of electricity, but I believe it would be important to be able to dissemble the components that give us this picture so that we could see in what way these costs are built up.  It would be interesting to measure the costs of the increase due to the fact that we have gone over to the production of turf, as against coal, or as against water.  In that way we could see what all this means.</P>
    <P>I feel myself that there are a number of things awaiting the further development of electricity in this country.  It is one of the matters that have puzzled me for a long time why we have never yet reached the point of being able to create an industry in the country for the production of nitrogenous manures.  I understand that that hangs very largely on the availability of power from electricity and on the cost.  But when either the present Minister or his colleagues talk about <Col N="836" /> developing the resources of the country, improving the position of the country in regard to exports, balancing our trade, and so on, the capacity to do that hangs to a far greater extent than seems to be realised on the possibility of the farmers of this country having available to them a sufficient quantity of nitrogenous fertilisers which they have not available to them in the country to-day except at a very high price.  Certainly in time of difficulty they are not available to us at all except in so far as Imperial Chemicals or some firm like that is prepared to place a very limited quantity of them at our disposal.  If only for that reason, to give the country more security than we have enjoyed in the past, we ought to do everything we possibly can to speed up the full development of all the resources of power that are available to us.</P>
    <P>I feel with all the other Senators that this Bill is entitled to our support. At the same time, I think we are justified in drawing the attention of the Minister to certain matters and in seeking information on any aspect of the development of those resources and on the purposes for which they are to be utilised, if in obtaining this information, it will help us to have a clearer appreciation of how this power can be used for the benefit of the country as a whole.  I can certainly say that the House is behind the Minister in this, but I think we can help the Minister better if we have a clearer understanding of the position as a result of the kind of queries I have put to the Minister. As far as I am personally concerned that is what I am seeking to give to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Our problem, and I think the problem of Western Europe, in our time is the development of power. When speaking on the Undeveloped Areas Bill I mentioned that I had some doubts in regard to our everlasting supply of turf as a fuel, and I mentioned that when a survey was made in regard to the development of the national paperboard mills in North Tipperary in the year 1948 or 1949, it was found in the town of Templemore that the bogs that would supply these <Col N="837" /> paper mills would be exhausted in about 15 or 20 years.  Another site was then selected in Tipperary and it was found that there was not an adequate water supply available.  It was eventually decided to site that industry in Waterford.  The reason I mention that is that in the development of electric power from peat we may exhaust a great deal of the available supplies of peat during times of peace.  Therefore until we have developed fully our water power resources we should in peacetime purchase all the oil and all the coal from the resources of other nations while they are available and have our bogs ready to be used during any period of emergency when we will not find it possible to procure outside supplies and sources of fuel.</P>
      <P>I also mentioned on that debate that I would like to ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of developing 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 kilowatt power stations on our small rivers and streams, and I was naturally rather pleased to note that in Volume 129, No. 3, of the Dáil Debates, the Minister said that by far the most economical method of producing electric power at present&mdash;and the situation was not likely to change during the years ahead&mdash;was water power. He further mentions, at column 421 of the same volume:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A list of some ten or 12 smaller rivers has been shown to me on which the board think it is possible to establish hydro-power stations of varying capacities.  They explained that their difficulty in proceeding with these stations was the burden upon their own planning staff by reason of the heavy programme I have outlined, and I have suggested to them that they should consider the possibility of entrusting the development of these ten or 12 small rivers to commercial firms.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has taken that view because I think that it is now possible for the Electricity Supply Board to consider all the various schemes that could be undertaken throughout the country.  Would the Minister be able to receive co-operation from commerce, industry and public authority interests in this <Col N="838" /> country which would help him to discover and to provide the finance and energy necessary to develop these smaller river schemes?  I agree with Senator Baxter that they are capable of development and the manner in which that would be done is something on which we would like some more information.  Will these schemes if developed by commercial interests then sell their power to the grid for national distribution?</P>
    <P>In my own area it was suggested that the Suir, the second largest river in the country, could possibly be tapped at Cahir and piped across the bend of the river to a centre at Clonmel, seven miles away.  That could provide a large output of electricity and the reason I instance this case is that it is typical of the type of thing which could be investigated by commercial and other interests all over the country.  Any production of electricity from water is an everlasting source of supply and the only thing we need to import to produce it, is capital goods and small maintenance generating plant required from time to time.</P>
    <P>I would like a reply from the Minister along these lines because I think on a long-term view they are things which the Electricity Supply Board or the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have to go into.  It was no good hoping for an early development of something like atomic energy which has cost the great powers of the world huge sums to develop and which I believe they are not going to divulge to other countries, even if they can produce it economically at an early date.  We will have to rely on water resources and this is something which the various industrial elements can co-operate in developing, particularly in the small rivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce, not only for introducing the Bill, but for his great patience during the debate.  Listening to the speeches of many of the speakers it would seem that they had not taken the trouble to read this Bill.  I was interested in hearing Senator Burke's speech suggesting that the Suir could be tapped and piped to some place and <Col N="839" /> so develop electricity on that river.  I am as interested in the area as the Senator, but as far as the Suir is concerned any developments there will depend on arterial drainage, and unless Senator Burke has a scheme whereby the river could be piped in such a way as to by-pass Clonmel and avoid flooding, there would not seem to be any useful work which could be done at the present time.  It would require cleaning of the river, removal of trees and other matters which are not provided for in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke goes on to say that he has some doubt about the supplies of turf and how long they would last. I am not aware of how many years supply of turf there are in the country, but we know that there are supplies that will last a certain number of years.  The fact is, however, that we have enormous supplies of turf available in the country, and it is up to this or any other Government to avail of that turf supply for the generation of electricity so far as it is possible.</P>
      <P>In connection with Senator Burke's references to Templemore, I am again as much interested in that town as he is, having been associated with it for many years.  We had a supposed miracle there at one time, and another miracle was when the former Minister for Industry and Commerce came down to the town and told the people that they could have an industry which would employ not only the people of Templemore, but people from areas around it.  The Minister had told the people that that industry, requiring large amounts of water, could be started even though there was not sufficient water in the Suir at the time. The present Minister could not do anything about the wild statements made by his predecessor, beyond help to put him out of office, but he would not go down to any town and make such statements until he had fully acquainted himself with the position, and knew that it was practicable to do the things he suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comes very badly from Senator Burke.  If he had said it by way of apology, there might have been some explanation for it, but he suggests that <Col N="840" /> something might be done now, the mess having been made by the last Administration, a mess which anyone should be ashamed to admit having had to do with.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter very seldom says anything definite here, and to-day he said he was doubtful about this reliance on turf.</P>

      <P>He did not meet the same trouble and I hope he never will. The situation here has been handled by the present Minister efficiently under this Bill.  We have a certain acreage of turf which will provide electricity for a considerable number of years, yet we have people criticising the Bill.  They do not oppose the Second Reading, but they find all kinds of fault with the scheme.  It is a good idea here or in the other House to have people criticise Bills, but if they criticise any section or any action proposed to be taken they should suggest an alternative.</P>
      <P>The Minister has got a lecture and I am sure he has sufficient common sense to absorb all the advice he has got as to the scientific lines on which this scheme should be run.  It is a good job he had time to be here to-night to listen to that.  Senator Baxter suggested that it is not a good thing to have all the eggs in one basket.  That is what his pal Mussolini did&mdash;he had all the eggs in one basket&mdash;and while Senator Baxter would not say, any more than he says anything definitely, that he would agree whole hog with Mussolini, he is not satisfied that it is a good idea for all the eggs to be in one basket.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have so much turf in one basket is a very good job for the nation and the fact that we had it in one basket during the last emergency, with the present Minister in the same position, was one of the major factors in saving this country from destruction during the last war.</P>

That kind of talk is the talk of children at school.  Anybody in his sane senses knows that at present an emergency exists, not alone in this country and in the neighbouring island, but in the world, and any country, taking serious note of what is going on in the world to-day, must make provision for the time when a serious emergency exists.  Under this Bill, an attempt is being made to provide electrical power for the country, not alone in an emergency, but in the years ahead when there may be no emergency, and if there never were an emergency, it would still be wise to provide electrical power, as is being provided in this Bill.  I cannot understand why people merely for the sake of talking politics must talk nonsense here for a considerable time.  If the Minister, when he is finished with this Bill and has made the necessary provision for the development of electrical power from turf, water and other sources, could possibly arrange to harness the wind that comes from the Opposition side of this House he would have something to work on for a while.</P>

      <P>I intend to be brief because I can see that the Minister is becoming exhausted.  He has had a few exhausting days already with the Tourist Bill in the Dáil and anybody reading the debates on this Bill in the Dáil must know that every point made on it here has already been made in the other House.  It is rather annoying to hear the leader of the other section of the House telling us how to read a Bill, and, in doing so, he is being rather uncomplimentary to his Minister who gave us a very excellent recital of the reasons for the Bill.  He elaborated on the point and generally we understood what the Bill was about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the Bill.  It <Col N="845" /> embodies a form of national development which we all should welcome and of which we should not be in any way critical.  If there are differences of opinion as to whether one form of fuel is more suitable than another, they are natural differences, but I am personally of opinion that the using up of our peat resources is, taking the long view, not a wise procedure.  I have been making inquiries about the life of bogs and I am assured by competent authorities that the biggest bog in the country has not a longer life than 25 years.  If that is true, if our turf resources can be consumed in 25 years, it is doubtful whether it is good policy to develop our electricity mainly on a bog basis, if I may put it that way.  I am not opposed to it, but I feel that it may have an effect on our subsoils and our whole land development, because the bog transmits through the various subsoils a particular type of nitrogen or fertiliser of some kind which is of benefit to the land.  Whether we should develop our turbary resources to that extent is a matter for speculation, and, unless one is technically equipped, one cannot give a definite decision for or against.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware that scientific research has been going on here into other forms of the creation of power, apart from fuel, water or coal.  I cannot divulge here, because I got the information in confidence, how this development is taking place or what progress it is making, but it is a form of power which is probably the most readily available to us.  Certain scientists have been experimenting on it.  The Russians have been experimenting with regard to it, despite the fact that Senator Baxter doubted the Minister's knowledge of Russia's affairs.</P>

      <P>The scientists do know about Russia, which has been <Col N="846" /> investigating this source of power. That investigation has also been going on here.  It is a source of power which can be developed, and I am told by a scientist who has made a very great study of it that it is feasible, and I hope that, in the very near future, it will become possible.  If the Minister is not aware of it, I shall be glad to give him the information I have on the matter.</P>
      <P>We owe a great debt to the Electricity Supply Board, and I should like to pay them a compliment on their recently published report.  If members of the House had read that report, we would have less talk and would merely accept the Minister's proposition to provide extra capital.  We would accept the members of the board as being people of knowledge who knew their job and who were going ahead with development in the right way.  I deplore that a matter of great national development should be made the subject of any sort of Party controversy in either House.  We should be fully behind the Minister in securing that our resources are developed to the fullest extent.</P>
      <P>There have been suggestions that we have been caustic and critical and that unfair criticism has been made.  I should like that flow of criticism to be dammed, and to let the Minister feel sure that everybody is behind him and the board in this development.  The electricity scheme has changed the whole social and economic life of the country, and we would never have got through the war years were it not for the great services rendered by electricity. We cannot pay sufficient tribute to the members of the board for their great services and to the Minister for the great help he gave. Speaking for industry in some small way, I should like to thank the Minister, and, through him, the Electricity Supply Board, for what they have done for the country and to assure him that, so far as any big electricity development is promoted in any way, I am with him 100 per cent., and so are the majority of the industrialists here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of money paid by the Exchequer to the Electricity Supply <Col N="847" /> Board so far amounts to £22,000,000, and I understand that a sum of £12,000,000 has gone in payment of interest.  Of the capital, only £900,000 has been repaid.  It seems to me that that is a very dear price to pay, and there is something wrong with our financial economy when we are compelled to pay £12,000,000 for £22,000,000 worth of capital development.  I know that the Minister will ask what the alternative is, and that brings us to another school of thought and another method of solving our difficulties.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to request the board to consider the application of a flat power rate all over the country.  We should not have variations as between Limerick, Cork and Dublin in respect of power, and it is rather unfair to industries which are decentralised and which, because they are situated away from the source of power, from Dublin, should have to pay more than the industry in Dublin pays.  The House should, without any criticism whatever, thank the Minister for this form of national development. We have been under-developed in many ways.  The foundation of our development is hydro-electric power, in respect of which the Minister has asked for a further increase.  I say: &ldquo;God bless him for asking and God bless the work,&rdquo; and the House should approve wholeheartedly of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I never dreamed when the debate began that, at this late stage in our national history, we should find Senators on the other side expressing doubts as to the desirability or feasibility of the production of electricity from turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in fact, heard speeches, especially from Senator Hayes and also from Senator Burke, in which such doubts were expressed.  The doubts were largely, I think, about whether it was more expensive to produce electricity from turf and also about the availability of turf.  At any rate, even were it proved that it was more expensive to produce electricity from turf than coal or oil, in my opinion it would still be desirable to do so because the electricity would be produced from a fuel obtainable in the country and it <Col N="848" /> would mean giving money to our own people instead of sending it abroad. In actual fact, however, it has been proved beyond a shadow of doubt that it is very much cheaper to produce electricity from turf than from any other form of fuel except water. Surely it cannot be said that when the cost of turf, say, at Portarlington, is 40/6 per ton&mdash;I understand that that is the most recent figure&mdash;a cheaper fuel would be possible even if you allow for the difference in calorific value between turf and coal or oil. Surely it is not possible to foresee a future where either of these fuels would be cheaper than turf.</P>
    <P>Doubt has been expressed regarding the availability of turf.  I am not competent to give an expert opinion on this but, in common with other Senators, I have been up and down the country and have visited those parts of the country which are covered with bog, and it is very difficult to see how, in the lifetime of any Senator, a time might come when turf would not be available for the production of electricity or for any other purpose.  It may be that individual bogs where power stations have been set up will dry up and that those in charge of the station will have to go ten or 20 miles or further to get the turf.  I cannot say whether that is so, but if it is, it would be a more practical proposition even then than to travel to England, Peru or Persia to get coal or oil.</P>
    <P>There is no need to consider the criticisms made in this debate of the production of electricity from turf were it not for the fact that during the three years of office of the last Government there was a fundamental change &mdash;brought about, no doubt, by arguments similar to those we have heard to-night&mdash;in the whole policy of the Electricity Supply Board regarding the future building of power stations. In 1938 the present Minister for Industry and Commerce directed the Electricity Supply Board that all future steam power stations were to be based on turf, but, in fact, during the three years in which the last Government were in power two very big power stations, one in Ringsend and the other in Cork, were sanctioned to use coal or oil.  Those two power <Col N="849" /> stations together will, when completed, produce 500,000,000 units of electricity per year and as a result of this policy we have the position that in 1957 when, it is hoped, the present programme of the Electricity Supply Board will be finished and the present stations they have on hand completed, almost exactly half of our total annual electricity will still be generated from imported fuel, coal or oil.  It is extraordinary that after the war, during which electricity was very severely rationed because at that time we depended to a considerable extent for electricity on imported fuel, any Government should still have been prepared to sanction very heavy public expenditure on power stations designed to burn imported fuel.  It means that for many years to come we will still be dependent to a very great extent on imported fuel for our electricity.  Apart altogether from the effects this may have should there be another war or a period in which it might be difficult to get imported fuel, it means money going out of the country which could be kept at home.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Senator Hawkins's remarks regarding the necessity of looking again into the economics of rural electrification.  The present system, as I understand it, is that, before taking up new areas, the board make a calculation of the ratio between the cost of bringing electricity to that area and the revenue which can be obtained from it.  That means inevitably a system of priority: the richer areas get the electricity first and the poorer districts, especially in the West, the congested areas, get it last. That will inevitably mean that, at the end of ten or 15 years, when the scheme is coming to a close, the country, as a whole, will be linked with electricity, except the poorer areas.  On the present scheme of charges as laid down by the Electricity Supply Board for rural electrification, it seems probable that, apart from the priority question, there will be people who, due to their lack of money income, will not be able to take electricity.  Already the people in certain areas in the West were offered electricity, but because there were not enough people who <Col N="850" /> could afford the fairly high charges, the Electricity Supply Board went elsewhere. I would ask the Minister to reconsider this whole matter, perhaps on the basis that the undeveloped areas of the West would be dealt with separately with a different system of charging, so that they might have a better chance of getting electricity.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which should perhaps be raised on the Committee Stage but which I would ask the Minister to consider between now and then. I refer to the position of certain employees of the Electricity Supply Board who were formerly in the employment of the Dublin United Tramways Company. These men are at present entitled to a pension under the superannuation scheme of the Electricity Supply Board, but in completing their years of service as things stand their period of service with the Dublin United Tramways Company cannot be counted.  These men would like the board's superannuation scheme to cover that period in order that, on retirement, they would become entitled to a pension computed on their years of service with the board and with the tramways company, subject of course to their making the necessary contribution for those years to the superannuation fund.  In 1949 the Electricity Supply Board were empowered to grant superannuation pensions to the employees of the tramways company, but that will amount only to half of the increased pension to which they would become entitled if the superannuation scheme were extended as I suggest it might be. Only a small number of men is involved but the matter is of great importance to the individuals concerned.  The Electricity Supply Board owe a debt of gratitude to these men because they could have stayed on with the tramway company when their generating station was closing down, but in fact they joined the Electricity Supply Board when the Electricity Supply Board was looking for trained men.  I understand that what they are asking has already been granted to the former employees of the Cork Tramways Company.  I hope that the Minister will be able to deal with the matter.  There may be some difficulties with regard to other <Col N="851" /> classes of workers in the Electricity Supply Board, but the Minister could look into it and see what could be done.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on having brought in this Bill.  It is a matter of very great importance to the country that the various schemes should go on as rapidly as possible, and I am sure that the Minister will keep a guiding eye on the activities of the Electricity Supply Board so that great progress will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a district which in the very early days of the Shannon hydro-electric scheme enjoyed its results, I naturally welcome the Bill that is intended, among other things, to carry its benefits into parts of County Mayo that are not yet provided with the power and light that that scheme makes available.  Notwithstanding the strictures of Senator Quirke on the speakers who have spoken already on this Bill&mdash;and to whom I listened right through this debate&mdash;as one who, I can assure you, has read the Bill.  I was very much interested in the points raised by every person who addressed himself to this measure&mdash;Senator Hayes, Senator Hawkins, Senator Baxter and others. I am certain that the points and suggestions they have made to the Minister and the information they were anxious to obtain from him as to what this Bill purports to do and its possibilities, will be informative to everybody in this House.</P>
      <P>In so far as Erris is concerned, the erection of the power station is certainly a very effective contribution to check the migration and emigration from that area that has obtained for many years.  I do not know anything about how long the supply of turf or peat will last, but I do know that the peat that is in Erris is of the finest quality.  In referring to that I would like also to bring in another part of County Mayo, Achill Island, which has peat second to none and which has practically an inexhaustible supply of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the Undeveloped Areas Bill I commented on the lack of <Col N="852" /> foresight that characterised the removal of the railway line from Westport to Achill and the incentive that railway line would be to private enterprise to avail of the facilities provided in the Undeveloped Areas Bill for the erection of an industry at Achill.  I still deplore the absence of that railway when I realise what an incentive a fuel station might have been for the production of electric power through such fuel and the contribution it would make towards encouraging private enterprise and the initiation of an industry in that particular place where it is very necessary, Every year hundreds of people, boys and girls, migrate to Scotland and to England to give the benefit of their labour to those countries, that we hope as a result of this Bill can be used at home.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats rightly referred to the fact that hydro-electric power is the most economic and I would like to address myself to that question in so far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned with the erection of the station at Erris.  I think that in this matter there should be some collaboration between the Office of Public Works and the Electricity Supply Board as regards the production of electric power from water.  A question which has agitated the minds of many people in Mayo and the remedying of which is very necessary is the drainage of the River Moy.  I understand that at the present time a survey is being made in connection with the projected drainage of the Moy.  In that investigation I believe there should be some collaboration between the Office of Public Works and the Electricity Supply Board so that there would be no overlapping.  I believe that a very effective scheme of drainage could be carried out in that area and at the same time a useful source of hydro-electric power could be produced.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter raised the question of decentralising control, for instance, having a board in charge of the Erne scheme and one in charge of the Shannon scheme.  I would not approve of that.  I am afraid if the administration was decentralised there would be overlapping that would certainly not contribute to its efficiency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> There is one point I would like to address to the Minister and that is the increased cost of current.  The town I belong to, from its size and population, would be one of the best customers of the Electricity Supply Board for the consumption of light and power.  In the early stages, quite a number of people installed cookers for which a separate meter was provided; the power used for the purpose of cooking was registered on a different meter from that used for registering power used for light.  During the war, the difficulty that arose in getting meters for new installations rendered it necessary to have the second meter removed from practically every house.  The result is that power used for light and cooking and other domestic purposes is now registered on the one meter.</P>
    <P>While there is a justification, in my opinion, for an increase in the price of current compared with what it was in the early stages, there is no justification for the extent of that increase. I do not know anything about this particular matter, but people state that they are being charged a flat rate and it is not to their advantage to allow the current used for cooking and heating to be registered on the one meter. If the extra cost is due to the steps that have been taken to extend the benefits of the hydro-electric scheme or turf-produced power to the new areas, some effort should be made to make posterity pay for the benefits they will enjoy as a result of the work being done by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>I believe that the points raised by Senator Hayes and Senator Baxter would make very interesting the issue of a White Paper giving information, according to the opinion of those in a position to judge, as to the length of time the supplies of peat in the different areas would last and also the purposes to which the turf-burning stations would be put if the supply of peat were exhausted.  It would also be very interesting to receive an answer to the questions raised here this evening as to the steps which will be taken to store the peat produced for the purpose of fueling the stations which will be erected as a result of this scheme.</P>

      <P>My remarks will be brief but, in company with other speakers, I want to welcome this Bill. I want to welcome it particularly as marking the final conversion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the present Government with regard to electricity development and the Electricity Supply Board generally. It is a good thing to realise that in the year 1952 we have finally left behind us the days when the Minister and his Party considered the Electricity Supply Board merely as a white elephant.  For that reason, if for no other, I feel that this Bill is welcome&mdash; welcome in the fact that it is introduced by the present Minister even though the ground-work and preparation for it may have been prepared before his accession to office.</P>
      <P>It is welcome, too, because of the recent speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Minister for Finance in relation to expenditure generally on capital development.  One was entitled to have the suspicion or the fear that capital development of a worthwhile type such as is envisaged in this Bill might have been sacrificed because of the speeches which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were making with regard to the financial situation.  I am glad that that is not so in relation to this particular development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats made some worthwhile suggestions which he feels would be more appropriate to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I will look forward with interest to the Committee Stage, and I hope we will have an opportunity by means of amendments put down by Senator Yeats to give these matters further consideration.  I feel they are points which might be considered in more detail.  Might I express the hope, in a personal way, to Senator Yeats, that he will save the Senators on this side of the House the bother of endeavouring to define his amendments on the Committee Stage? With regard to the question of water power as against electricity generated by turf, Senator Yeats seemed to think that there was something outrageous <Col N="855" /> in Senator Baxter's reference to waterpower.  He expressed considerable surprise that at this stage of the debate there should be any doubt as to which was the cheaper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am wrong, I apologise to the Senator.  The impression I got was that he was questioning Senator Baxter's reference to that subject.  I do not think that there is any doubt about the cheaper form of power.  I am merely pointing out that all Senator Baxter did was to quote some remarks made by the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I could not quite follow Senator Quirke's speech or his reference to the question of importing oil.  As I understand the position, though I maybe wrong, there is a number of new power stations to be erected in the course of half a dozen years or so, and I understand that three or four of those power stations will utilise oil as fuel.  I think I am correct in saying that at least two of the proposed stations in Dublin, situated at the North Wall and at Ringsend, will be using either coal or oil as fuel.  I would like the Minister to verify that when replying, and I would like him also to deal with the objection raised by Senator Quirke, if there is any substance in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood the argument made by him to be to the effect that it was nonsensical to think of erecting oil-burning stations&mdash;I think he called them oil-boiler stations&mdash;in this country because of the storage difficulties, and that if such stations were erected they would be worse than useless if an emergency came upon us which would prevent the importation of oil.  That is a serious matter, if it is so.  A considerable amount of money will be expended on these stations.  I may be incorrect but, as I understand the position, at least two or three of the proposed stations will be erected for the purpose of burning oil.  I would like the Minister to <Col N="856" /> deal with that matter when concluding, if only to remove fears expressed by Senator Quirke on the subject.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude, as I commenced, by welcoming the Bill and by expressing the hope that this kind of development will be encouraged by the present Government in the same manner as it was encouraged by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes opened his remarks by referring to the origin of the Electricity Supply Board and to the controversies that raged upon it when the first Act was introduced in 1926 by Mr. McGilligan as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not want to fight these battles over again not because I have any objection to reviving the memory of past dissensions between Senator Hayes and other Senators who now sit very close to him and behind him in this House, or because there is not a great deal which could be said about the origin and the development of the Electricity Supply Board and of the Shannon scheme.  Some day somebody will write a full history of this whole business, but just at present I do not feel like doing it.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I regarded myself as the custodian of the reputation of the Electricity Supply Board and the public evaluation of the Shannon scheme.  I propose, therefore, to say nothing which might be regarded as detrimental to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins spoke about my conversion to the Electricity Supply Board idea.  That conversion took place in 1932.  At that time, the Electricity Supply Board had been in a bit of a mess, financially and otherwise.  I shared the responsibility of making certain changes, both in its methods of operation and in its personnel.  The board, as reconstituted then, has, I feel, worked fairly well since.  I made it quite obvious in the Dáil that I did not regard the board as free from criticism.  In fact, in my view, it has been a handicap of the Electricity Supply Board that it has not been criticised sufficiently.  That was due to the fact that for the 16 years during which <Col N="857" /> I was Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1932 on, I felt bound to defend it as a member of the Government. The main Opposition felt debarred from attacking it because of their association with the Shannon scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>References were made to the present programme of development. Senator Hayes said that the turf-burning power stations at Ferbane and at Allenwood, as well as the water power station on the Lee and the steam stations at Dublin and Cork, were approved by the previous Government. That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Allenwood, Ferbane and Lee stations were in the programme which I outlined as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1946.  The steam stations at Dublin and Cork were not.  I want to be perfectly fair to my predecessor because I know he was personally anxious to support the idea of developing our turf resources for power purposes and he made that quite clear to the Electricity Supply Board.  If he is open to criticism at all it is, perhaps because of his Party association; he was less critical of the case made by the Electricity Supply Board than I was. The record says that for these three years from 1948-51 the only stations that were put into the programme were those at Cork and Dublin to burn coal or oil.  I don't know what Senator <Col N="858" /> O'Higgins's point was about the utilisation of oil in these stations.  They will be designed to burn either coal or oil and if neither coal nor oil is available then they will go out of commission.</P>
    <P>It may be that because of turf production difficulties Ferbane and Allenwood could not have been got into operation earlier.  I am not sure about that.  I am rather surprised at the slow progress of the Lee station.  Even still I think there is reason to query the lack of expedition in getting the construction work started there.  In the programme for the next ten years, &mdash;both the part which represents stations under construction and the part which represents stations approved on which construction work has not yet been started&mdash;there are no further projects for stations to burn coal or oil. There are several water power or turf burning steam stations.  At the end of that period they will be capable of producing enough electricity to supply the anticipated demands of that time. That assumes that the Electricity Supply Board will be able to proceed with the development of ten or 12 small rivers for power to produce an aggregate annual supply of 200,000,000 units.  At that stage we will have utilised our water power to the full and there will be no further progress practicable based on the utilisation of water power.</P>
    <P>It is possible that at that stage some question may arise about the future utilisation of peat but my own feeling is that it is unwise to attempt to plan a programme after 1961.  Technical developments are proceeding every day.</P>
    <P>There may, by then, be a possibility of the economic utilisation of the wind or the sea or perhaps even the possibility of an atomic pile but I can say that we have found it possible to plan ahead for ten years a programme based entirely on native resources. That programme as I have emphasised involves the completion of the development of water power for electricity generating purposes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position in respect of peat resources it is perhaps necessary to remove some misapprehension <Col N="859" /> that appears to exist with regard to the location of stations for the utilisation of peat fuel.  They are located on the bogs that are estimated to have a life of from 20 to 25 years, on an assumed annual output of turf and it is estimated that at that stage&mdash;after 25 years&mdash;each station will also have outlived its useful life.  The station will be amortised on that basis and, in fact, it is likely that the plant will have worn itself out and will require replacement.  By then other stations will be in existence on other bogs.</P>
    <P>It is true that up to the present the board has been concerned with the development of the bogs which were considered to be most suitable for that purpose and it is now proceeding to select bogs for milled turf development which are also the most suitable for it. But one must not assume that the development of turf winning techniques will not proceed.</P>
    <P>The board is now carrying out certain experiments which may or may not open up new methods of utilisation of peat as a fuel for power stations and with the development of new methods then there will be the possibility of bringing into use bogs which have been rejected as unsuitable for the present methods.  One of the big advantages of the development of the milled peat process is that it makes possible the Bangor-Erris station.  The bog was examined with a view to its suitability for sod peat and was rejected because of the characteristics of the bog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, irregularity of the floor, I think.  The milled peat process was regarded as very suitable for that type of bog.  Any other new process that might develop will widen the area of possibility of utilisation.  If one were to estimate the utilisation of turf at the rate of say 2,000,000 tons a year for power purposes then I may say our bogs are still capable of supplying our requirements for well over 100 years. I do not think we need worry about that stage.  Undoubtedly there then will be other sources of power which we cannot at the moment visualise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that water-power utilisation <Col N="860" /> is dependent on weather conditions, in some rivers more than others.  The Liffey is almost immune from variation taking one year with another but the Shannon is very susceptible to weather conditions. Nevertheless, the directors of the board will use water power to the limit.  It is true that water power is the cheapest form of power and particularly so at the present time.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked the relationship between capital charges and other costs in the production of power.  In the case of hydro-electric stations, it is practically all capital cost.  Once the station is built, the principal charge is the remuneration of capital and the operating costs are practically nil. Consequently, it will always be profitable to the Electricity Supply Board to use water-power stations to the limit and only to bring in the steam stations, which involve the cost of fuel, to supplement water power.  At the same time, it is obvious that we must have steam stations, since the output of the hydro stations is variable and we could not rely entirely on them to meet a growing demand.  It is difficult to give a figure of comparable cost of production of current from stations utilising coal or turf, as a great deal depends on the price of coal or turf.</P>
    <P>The increased charge for current sanctioned last year was due entirely to the higher cost of coal.  Other costs had undoubtedly increased also, but the big factor which necessitated an overall increase in the cost of current was the much higher price of coal which prevailed last year as compared with previous years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senator Baxter was accused of making too many prophecies.  I do not want to make any.  Increased supplies of coal from Britain would reduce the average cost of all coal coming in here, but the price of British coal is going up, so what the average cost may be I could not predict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a reduction in the price of coal as purchased by the Electricity Supply Board, can <Col N="861" /> we hope for a reduction in the cost of current?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in such circumstances that could be expected, particularly when these new stations at Dublin and Cork are in commission, since at that stage, as Senator Yeats remarked, practically half the total output will be from coal stations.  When the other turf and water-power stations come into commission, the cost of coal would be less significant in the total charges of the board.</P>
      <P>The economics of turf can be clearly demonstrated, that is, not merely in relation to the actual unit cost of electricity from these stations but in relation to the overall position of the country. Senator Baxter said that Western Europe was going to reach a turning point in two or three years' time.  Again avoiding anything in the nature of prophecy, I think it has reached it now.  All the indications are that every country in Europe, and almost every country in the world, is going to be forced into trade restrictions of one kind or another in the present year in order to avoid serious financial difficulties.  All the news which has appeared in our papers in the last two or three weeks appears to suggest that development in this year.  The possibility that we may run into serious difficulty in financing imports is obvious and it is clearly in our interest, from every point of view, that we should minimise imports to whatever extent is practicable and that we should develop our own resources to replace them as quickly as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to milled peat, I must say I do not know why it got that name. It is peat milled by mechanical methods into a rather fine powder.  The milled peat which it is intended to utilise in the power stations is precisely the same as that produced at Lullymore for the production of briquettes.  There is not, and never was, a doubt about the physical possibility of burning milled peat in a furnace but there was a question as to the availability of boiler equipment suitable for its use. We secured the services of a very well-known, internationally famous, firm of <Col N="862" /> consultants, the Batelle Institute of the United States.</P>
    <P>They sent experts over here, who examined the question and submitted a report.  I was asked in the Dáil to publish that report, but there is some difficulty in doing that, as it refers to some equipment on offer by firms, mentioning firms by name and commenting on the value and suitability of the equipment.  That report indicated that there was available equipment for the utilisation of milled peat in furnaces eminently suitable for the purpose and the manufacturers of which were prepared to guarantee its performance.</P>
    <P>Following the presentation of that report, the Electricity Supply Board prepared a series of supplementary questions, which were submitted to the Batelle Institute, and in reply they submitted a supplementary report.  In the meantime, the Electricity Supply Board had also sent engineers to the Continent to inspect certain types of equipment to which reference was made in the report and to note their performance.</P>
    <P>There is available&mdash;I mention this apropos a remark of Senator Hayes&mdash; a great deal of information as to what has taken place in Russia.  The scientific publications containing that information are available here and, in fact, in relation to turf there is at Bord na Móna's experimental station at Newbridge as valuable a library as exists anywhere in the world.  The Batelle Institute reported that they could not send their people to inspect the equipment in Russia and to see its performance for themselves.  They had to take their information about it from these published reports.  On the basis of all the information gathered by these people about Russian achievements, what they saw in Germany and what they knew themselves had been done in the United States, in the utilisation of sawdust and other low grade fuels for power purposes, they made their recommendation.  Following the receipt of the supplementary report from the Batelle Institute, a conference was held in the Department of Industry and Commerce between those concerned&mdash;the <Col N="863" /> representatives of the Batelle Institute, of Bord na Móna, of the Electricity Supply Board and of the Department&mdash;and it was then agreed that there was no further technical problem to be solved, that it appeared to be all straight sailing, in the utilisation of milled peat.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the Dáil that the Electricity Supply Board had in mind at that stage the erection of a pilot plant at Portarlington, to put in a boiler there to burn milled peat in order to get knowledge of its performance and of the type of equipment that would give the greatest efficiency in its use.  They have since told me they are now satisfied that it will not be necessary to install a pilot plant and they are going ahead straightaway to design a plant for the Bangor-Erris station, which will be the first to commence utilising milled peat.</P>

      <P>Might I ask whether there are stations in Europe outside Russia available for inspection which are using a fuel similar to our milled peat for the generation of electricity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>It would be a matter of some difficulty to publish a paper which would be informative enough to impress, say, an engineer and, at the <Col N="864" /> same time, omit the information upon which the recommendation was based, because the Batelle Institute recommendations and the board's decision were, I think, largely influenced by the fact that certain named firms had designed suitable plant and were prepared to guarantee its performance, when installed.</P>

      <P>That is a six-mark question which I would not like to answer.  Its main advantage from the point of view of electricity production is that it is much cheaper.  It involves a lower utilisation of labour, which was one of the problems anticipated in connection with the development of peat for power purposes.  It is completely mechanised and, therefore, admits of the employment of a higher type of labour, a more highly remunerated type.</P>

      <P>It is true that the demand for current is still low in this country, but we are assuming quite a substantial increase.  It will be no small jump in the consumption of current if we double this year's consumption by 1957.  That is what we are planning for, and then to face another increase of similar dimensions in the following five years.  In case anybody should be misled by some statements made, I should say that in this year the board will have no difficulty at all in meeting all demands for current.  With the coming into operation in this year of the new station at Allenwood and the main station on the Erne, it is certain that the board will be able to meet in full all demands for current in this year and if their construction programme works out as planned, they will always be one step ahead of the increase in demand.</P>

      <P>When I came back to office last June and saw these stations in the programme, that was the first question I had to ask myself: was there any possibility of substituting these stations by others utilising native resources?

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would find it hard to answer that question.  If the new <Col N="866" /> stations that are being planned at Ferbane, Allenwood and Bangor-Erris for the utilisation of turf, the new water power stations like the Lee, the Clady, the Boyne and Avonmore, were coming in two, three or four years earlier than they now appear in the programme, this other development could have been avoided, but what the situation would have been in 1960 then would be another matter upon which I should not like to express an opinion. As I have said, we will by then, on our present programme, have reached the end of the water power and it is not possible now to say what the position regarding turf production will be at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you not limited by turf production in those areas where you are relying on turf as a fuel?  I mention that matter because Senator Yeats was critical of the fact that the Dublin and Cork stations were based on coal and oil supplies.  Surely they were based on them because turf was not available in the places where they were situated, due to lack of manpower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to get a turf-burning steam station into production, work must first start on the development of the bog to supply the turf and that must precede the construction of the station by two or three years.  In that connection, Senator Hayes asked if Bord na Móna was able to meet the requirements of the Electricity Supply Board for turf up to the present, and, in answering that question, it is necessary to state that the difficulty of planning ahead the utilisation of turf for power purposes is the rigidity of the turf production plan, the inability to expand the output of turf rapidly to meet increasing demands from the station.  Naturally, the Electricity Supply Board engineers planning steam stations in the past did not have to have regard to fuel supply problems at all.  They designed the station; they purchased the equipment for the station; and they began to play around to see whether they could not step up the output and get a higher efficiency than the plans originally contemplated. In the case of the Portarlington station, that happened.  The station was <Col N="867" /> designed to realise a certain output of electricity and to consume for that purpose 120,000 tons of turf per year, but, after the station was installed, the engineers began to improve on the station to get it to a higher stage of efficiency and succeeded to the point that, instead of the 120,000 tons per year originally contemplated, the board were demanding 165,000 tons per year.</P>
      <P>They could not get that from Clonsast because that bog was designed to produce 120,000 tons a year and could not be expanded to produce 165,000 tons per year, so the turf had to be brought in from other areas to supplement the output of Clonsast pending the development of other bogs in the locality; but the board did, in fact, get all the turf it required this year although not from the Clonsast bog.  The position this year was complicated somewhat by the fact that there was a strike of Bord na Móna staff about 12 months ago which lowered the output at the beginning of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with the Minister with regard to the utilisation of Irish fuel, but is it not true that production from home fuel never kept pace with the demand for electricity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  We cannot speak from a wide experience.  The first station came into production in 1950 and the second came into production only this year so we cannot go too much upon experience. It will obviously be necessary for the Electricity Supply Board to keep in mind the fact that when planning these stations in relation to the problem of the turf production associated with <Col N="868" /> them they cannot vary their demand for turf from one year to another.  They must take a predetermined quantity of turf except that they may supplement it by turf from private producers or from other Bord na Móna bogs.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rural electrification scheme, I do not think that it is correct to say that the present method of selecting areas for development, works to the detriment of the Gaeltacht or poorer areas of the country. I should make it clear that it is intended that every area in the country will get a supply eventually. A process of selection is undertaken now because the board cannot do all the areas at once.  It gives priority to those areas from which it gets the best financial return and I do not see anything very much wrong with that.  I did query with the board whether the present basis of selection which related the total fixed charge revenue with the cost of construction of the network was preferable to a simple calculation of the percentage of residents in the area who would be prepared to take a supply.  I do not mind which basis is chosen as long as it is rigidly maintained and there is no suggestion of a departure from it in order to favour one area as against another.  The system operates to induce the maximum number of people to take the supply at the time when the network is being constructed in the area.  It is obviously desirable that at the time when the board's staff are constructing the network the maximum number of people will take a supply then.  It may be that some people will not want to take the supply now and will want it in four or five years but they will not get it in four or five years; they will not get it until the scheme has been completed because that would disorganise the board's programme. Some arrangement for competition between areas does mean that there is every inducement to the maximum number of residents to take the supply at the right time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Galway, I think that the area to qualify first was the Spiddal area. When one thinks on the matter, one can see that that was likely to be so. It is an area with a fairly high density <Col N="869" /> of population and there is not a very great distance between the houses. Therefore, the capital cost of construction is comparatively low if a reasonable number of residents take supply and the return will be high.  If one could visualise a ranching area with three houses, it would never qualify, or at least not for a long time, because the capital cost of bringing the network to isolated dwellings is very high. When I suggested to the Electricity Supply Board to turn over from the present basis of calculation to a percentage basis, they convinced me that it would not necessarily operate in favour of the poorer areas as against the wealthier areas.  Nevertheless, I have asked whether it would be possible to combine the two arrangements so as to give a better system or else to have a separate arrangement for the undeveloped areas.</P>

      <P>I personally am not altogether satisfied that the Electricity Supply Board could not speed up rural electrification development.  I am urging them to go ahead as fast as they can and it may be that they can develop their organisation so as to go a bit faster.  I hope that that will prove possible.</P>

    <P>Senator Burke spoke about the development of small rivers.  There are about ten or 12 rivers apart from the main rivers which are being developed <Col N="870" />&mdash;the Lee, the Boyne, the Avonmore in Wicklow and the Clady in Donegal&mdash; which it is intended to develop for power purposes.  I mentioned in the Dáil that the main difficulty in proceeding with them was the bottleneck of the board's own planning staff here in Dublin, and that is why I suggested that this task of planning the most suitable method to develop these small rivers for power purposes should be entrusted to private engineering firms. Senator Burke made the same mistake as certain Deputies.  He thought that the stations on these rivers would be built by private firms and that they would engage as such in the sale of current, selling current to the Electricity Supply Board.  It is intended that once the plans of development are made and the necessary blueprints prepared&mdash;and it is only a matter of placing contracts for the works&mdash;the Electricity Supply Board will take over.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter mentioned the development of nitrogenous fertilisers and the importance of developing adequate power resources for that purpose.  At the present time a firm of international experts is examining the possibilitty of developing the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia utilising the gypsum resources of Monaghan and I am expecting a report in the very near future.  Over and above that we have a peat gasification project.  That is a project for investigating the possibility of gasifying peat on a commercial basis, one of the by-products being sulphate of ammonia.  I am hoping that this investigation will be the beginning of a very large scale and important development here.  If we had dumped the midland bogs into the sea as Senator Baxter at one time had in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal more to be done with them than that. We see in these bogs not merely an important source of national wealth but one that is increasing in importance with time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the pensions matters that were referred to, there was mention made to the fact that there is a ceiling of £450 in the Bill.  That was mentioned in relation to the rise in the cost of living since the 1950 Act was passed.  The increase in pensions applies to those persons who retired during the period when there was a Wages Standstill Order in force or whose pensions were affected in any way by the operation of that Standstill Order.  The purpose of all this legislation is to ensure that <Col N="872" /> people who retired during that period are not perjudiced permanently in the amount of their pensions by the effect of that Order or that persons retiring subsequent to the repeal of the Order but whose pensions related to their average earnings over five years are not adversely affected.  Therefore, that limit was imposed by the 1950 Act. That Act did not apply to civil servants but rather to non-service pensioners whose pensions are regulated by statute, mainly employees of local authorities.  That is the reason why that limit was put in the Act and we are keeping that limit here.  I think it is true to say that it is mainly in relation to people whose remuneration was such that their pensions on retirement would be under £450 per year that any hardship arose.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats referred to the former employees of the Dublin United Tramway Company's power station in Dublin.  I have gone into that carefully, as I did before, when I made provision in legislation to give the board power to give <i>ex-gratia</i> pensions to those people.  I am quite satisfied in my mind that there is no need to do anything more for them.  Those men are entitled now to a pension on retirement of 50 per cent. of their pre-retirement earnings plus a lump sum, and they have, I believe, no greater claim and possibly not as good a claim as many of the employees of local authorities who were transferred to the board without pension rights.</P>
    <P>The employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company had no pension rights when they were transferred to the board.  When the Dublin United Tramways Company, on its own initiative, decided to close down its own station and to buy power from the Electricity Supply Board, they dismissed their employees at the power station.  Some of them went off to other employment but eventually they all came back to the service of the Electricity Supply Board.  It is hard to argue that they have any greater rights than anybody else who came into the service of the Electricity Supply Board, certainly no greater rights than employees who were compulsorily transferred to the Electricity <Col N="873" /> Supply Board from the service of the local authorities.  It would be inequitable to give them better rights in relation to pension than those former local authority employees have.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal under consideration at the moment for the amendment of the pensions scheme which, I understand, has been agreed to by the board and the staff representatives which may operate to give men the right to secure better pensions by adjustment of their contributions at the present time.  The main purpose of the provisions of this Bill in relation to pensions is to correct oversights or to repair what I consider to be defects in the 1950 Bill and to ensure that all the pensioners of the Electricity Supply Board who retired during the currency of the standstill Orders, or whose pensions might be affected by the Order, will be on equal terms.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes might I ask one question? I thought he might refer in his reply to the matter I mentioned with regard <Col N="874" /> to the creation of power from other sources and to the fact that investigation of the creation of power from sources other than those he mentioned in the Bill is being made by Irish scientists at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, in fact, a proposal under the technical assistance projects of E.C.A. for the investigation of power resources here, which.  I think, has fallen through with the death of E.C.A.  But there are quite a number of independent investigations proceeding&mdash;to mention a few, wind, waves and atoms.</P>
