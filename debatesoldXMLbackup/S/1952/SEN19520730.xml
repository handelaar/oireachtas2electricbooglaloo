      <P>Before proceeding with the business as agreed upon, I wish to announce that I have received a communication from the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil that a member of this House, Senator William Quirke, on Thursday last, 24th July, assaulted a member of the Dáil, Deputy James M. Dillon, in the passage to the right of the staircase leading to the Dáil Chamber.</P>
      <P>On receipt of this communication, I felt it my duty to summon Senator Quirke to my office and to ask him if he had committed the assault described in the Ceann Comhairle's communication.  He admitted the assault, expressed his regret to me and indicated his intention to apologise to the House and to ask that an apology from him be communicated to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I find that this assault constituted an action in contempt of Parliament.</P>
      <P>The powers conferred on me by the Standing Orders cover only disorder within the House itself and not disorderly acts committed in the precincts of the House or at a time when the House is not sitting.</P>
      <P>I shall, therefore, ask Senator Quirke to make his apology.  Having heard the Senator, the House itself can decide on any course which it deems appropriate.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my regret for having assaulted Deputy James M. Dillon in the precincts of the Houses of the Oireachtas and apologise to the Seanad for any reflexion on its good name caused by my action.  At the same time, I extend my apologies to the Dáil for my conduct towards a member of that House and I trust that the good relations which have at all times existed between the two Houses will not be in any way impaired in consequence. I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to convey my apologies to the Ceann Comhairle and to the Dáil at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>Having heard the Cathaoirleach's statement and the statement of Senator Quirke, I feel that the situation as between the Dáil and Seanad could be resolved by a motion in these terms.  I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad accepts Senator Quirke's apology, and requests the Cathaoirleach to transmit its terms to the Dáil and to express the regret of the Seanad that the incident has taken place with the hope that the harmonious relations that have existed between the two Houses may not be disturbed in any way.</P>
      <P>For my own part&mdash;I am sure I express the views of everybody in the House&mdash; I regret the occasion which makes this motion necessary.  It is not a personal one.  Difficulties between members of the same House may be&mdash;and, as we have seen, have been&mdash;easily resolved. The present situation, where a member of the Dáil and a member of the Seanad are concerned, is different and more complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1922, the Dáil and Seanad have been meeting in the same building, served to a great extent by the same staff.  Under the Constitution of 1922 and the present Constitution, Ministers, whether members of the Dáil or of the Seanad, have always had the right of audience in both Houses.  Senators enjoy certain privileges in the Dáil Chamber, as do Deputies here.  These arrangements have proved convenient for all concerned&mdash;for the public, for civil servants, for members of the Oireachtas and, of course, above all <Col N="1861" /> for Ministers.  They have also proved economical from the point of view of public finance.  It is of great importance that such a state of affairs should not be disturbed.  This motion is, therefore, directed towards the relations between the two Houses and is not concerned with personalities.</P>
    <P>There is just one other word I would like to say.  It is not a code of law, a set of rules or standing orders, or penalties of any kind, which can make parliamentary government successful and respected.  For the satisfactory working of parliamentary institutions, certain principles must find general acceptance and be put into practice by all members.</P>
    <P>Following the two statements already made, I feel that the motion will meet with unanimous agreement from the Seanad and I commend it to the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is an annual feature and is in the usual standardised form.  It proposes to do three things. First, it authorises the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount&mdash;including certain supplementary amounts granted for the Supplies Services, 1952-53, after deduction of the amount already authorised&mdash; for the Central Fund Bill of this year.  Secondly, it authorises the Minister for Finance to borrow up to the limit of the issue provided for. Thirdly, it appropriates to the several Supplies Services sums granted by the Dáil since the Appropriation Act of 1951.</P>
      <P>As the Bill is in the usual form, I assume the Seanad will not require any detailed explanation of the several sections in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one <Col N="1862" /> of the two opportunities the Seanad gets of discussing the finances of the country.  On this particular occasion, as indeed on other occasions, the Appropriation Bill comes to us very late.  It must be law by to-morrow, and a motion is down in the name of the Leader of the House asking us to say that it is a matter of urgency to have it signed.  Indeed, it is a matter of urgency to have it signed to-morrow. I suggest to the Minister again that it is very difficult and rather unfair for us to be confronted on almost the last day of July with a Bill of this kind, after the Dáil has adjourned for the summer Recess, and when it is very difficult to get up any real enthusiasm for a serious debate.  This year the Budget was earlier than ever before, nearly a month earlier, yet we get the Appropriation Bill later than ever.  I do not know if that could be remedied. There are two things which could be done.  One, which would be a very drastic change, and which would do great good to the business of the other House, would be to change the financial year from April-March, and make it run from January to December like the ordinary year.  The other method, if I may have the temerity to make the suggestion here, is that the Dáil might come to the conclusion that it should discuss the Estimates on some agreed plan which would survive Governments and be a regular institution.  If it did that, we might be able to get this Bill rather earlier, and so give it more valuable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Appropriation Bill itself, even on the reduced value of the £ the amount of money now being spent by the State is enormous. It must be remembered that this high State spending is now combined with rising unemployment, with high prices, naturally enough with high taxes, with certain credit restriction by the banks owing to the general financial position and with a recession of trade.  As far as the Government is concerned, the Government speaks on this matter with two voices.  The Minister for Finance asks us to save, although what he is leaving us to save from is hard to know; but the Minister for Industry and Commerce advises us for the good of trade and industry to spend.  His <Col N="1863" /> colleague, the Minister for Finance for whom he is, of course, responsible is preventing us from saving anything.  It is very difficult to know how anyone can save in the present situation.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, advantages, advantages flowing to a great extent from the policy of the Government which preceded the present one.  The adverse balance of trade is decreasing. Our exports of live stock and live-stock products are up for the first six months of 1952 not only in money value but also in volume.  There are several circumstances in our favour, but this enormous bill combines high taxation, high prices and actually more borrowing than the previous Government indulged in.  It must be remembered also that higher prices, induced to a considerable extent by Government policy, mean a demand for higher wages and therefore still higher prices. It means unrest and strikes, some of which we have at this particular moment.  The higher prices also result from Government action.  As you increase social services, you increase the cost of all health services provided by both local and the central authorities.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Bill here provides for certain sums for social services. It must be remembered that by the removal of subsidies there has been a transfer of taxation&mdash;that which previously provided subsidies now provides increased social services to meet the increased prices caused by the withdrawal of subsidies.  That is to say, the needy, the ill and the unemployed get increases, but the needy, the unemployed and the sick get less advantage out of the increased social services than they did out of the prices of subsidised food.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also&mdash;and I think that all the people in public life should unitedly take steps to tell all those whom it concerns, and it concerns everybody&mdash;that the cost of increased services which this Bill represents comes out of the pockets of people at work and of wage earners. Formerly there were landowners and rich people, but there are no such people now to provide the sum of <Col N="1864" /> money which the Minister is asking for in the Bill, a sum of money totalling over £100,000,000, except the ordinary wage earner.  There may be a certain amount of juggling done and a great deal of talking, but whatever amount of juggling there is and whatever speeches are made, the truth of the whole matter is that those who work, those who produce, are called upon in the end to foot the bill, either by direct or indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence that, enormous as this Bill is and enormous as the burden of taxation is, the Minister is not going to get the money to pay the amount involved in this particular piece of legislation.  I think he budgeted for something like £7,000,000 extra in the year from customs, which would be about £600,000 per month.  As far as I can read the figures, up to the 12th of this month, the amount extra that he received from customs is £1,200,000 for three and a half months since 1st April.  He is not receiving very much more than half what he calculated upon receiving.  In other words, what has been frequently remarked by economists proves, in practice, to be true here, namely, that the law of diminishing returns is operating; the higher you make the taxes, after a certain point, you get, instead of more money into the Exchequer, less.</P>
    <P>That is very much the case with regard to customs since 1st April.  It is also, I think, the case with excise. The Minister expected to get £300,000 a month.  In three and a half months he got only £350,000, which is only at the rate of £100,000 a month.  It should be remembered that, in that period, April, May and June, the price of food had not gone up.  It did not go up until the first week of this month. Purchasing power will now be smaller, and it is therefore to be expected that the product of taxation will be smaller too.</P>
    <P>The truth is that we have surely reached the limit in Government spending and that, when the Minister asks us to save, the obvious answer is that unless saving begins with Government expenditure, nobody else has any margin upon which to save.</P>
    <P>Most certainly, the most downtrodden <Col N="1865" /> and least looked after class in the community, the white collar worker, is put into the position that he certainly can save nothing.  He has to live from hand to mouth.  His position is daily growing very much worse. It was among that class that great saving was previously effected and they are the very class hardest hit by present-day conditions and present Government policy and they themselves cannot now save at all.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to save and to invest in Government loans and to do the things that are necessary to provide for this expenditure and to provide also for development of agriculture, industry and social services, considering the very high level of taxation, the high level of prices and the uncertainty as to the value of one's savings, not only in ten years' time, but even next year.</P>
    <P>There are very real problems shown in this particular measure.  After 30 years of self-Government, for a population of something less than 3,000,000 people, we are spending £100,000,000 and, as I say, there seems to me to be no place where saving can be effected except in Government expenditure. Even with that immense expenditure, it has to be remembered that a great many problems have not been solved. We have not solved the problem of keeping our people on the land and still less have we solved the problem of keeping our people at home.  I can remember the Sinn Féin days when we all promised that it could be done and that it would be done.  I now have to admit, 30 years after self-Government was established, that it has not been done.  When you consider the amount of money being spent by Government, you have to remember also that we have a small population, that we still have emigration, not the thing that is usual in many European countries&mdash;the flight from the land to towns belonging to the particular State; our position is that the people are flying from our land to the cities of another State.</P>
    <P>We have our older age groups steadily increasing older.  We have the most extraordinary figure of a marriage rate.  We have the oldest marriage age in the world, as far as we know statistics.  The number of our producers is decreasing and, although we have <Col N="1866" /> had a very intensive industrial drive, the net result of that industrial drive is that the increased number of industrial workers is off-set by the decrease in the number of agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>When one is asked to pass a measure which involves public expenditure of £100,000,000 which, by the way, is not the whole bill either, the situation that we are in is one almost as bad, perhaps just as bad, as external war because one is always hoping for the end of a war, but the situation that we find ourselves in does not seem to be one which could be easily ended in any appreciable time.</P>
    <P>It has always struck me, looking at our economic and financial problems as typified in this particular measure, that a solution needs unity and co-operation, needs co-operative effort, needs everybody to think as to what he can do and to see that it is done.  But, at the same time, the present Minister for Finance in all his speeches in the other House, in this House and in the country gives the impression of being more interested in blackening his opponents than in solving any problems either economic or financial.  He is much more concerned, much more emphatic, much clearer, much more vigorous in explaining how wrong everybody is except himself than in telling us what particular measures could be taken or should be taken to solve our economic and financial problems.</P>
    <P>This is a very small country of 3,000,000 people.  If we had the whole country united we would have only 4,000,000 people and, by the same token, our economic and financial problems, perhaps, would not be any the less grievous than they are at the present moment.  On a great many issues, a great many spiritual issues and national issues, there is more unity in this country than in any other country in the world.  The things which divide other Parliaments, matters of religion, matters of education, spiritual matters, what are called in the modern jargon, ideologies, do not divide us at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister's Party persist in refusing co-operation with anybody.  To co-operate with the Minister you must do so on one set of <Col N="1867" /> conditions: you must adopt his policy, his present policy, his past policy and whatever his future policy may be. You must adopt it all, hook, line and sinker, before you can co-operate with him.  It seems to me that there are a great many red lights that show themselves in our path that indicate that the high hopes that were once held of what could be accomplished in this country by a native Government and by a native Parliament, hopes which people like the Minister and myself held out, have proved to be very difficult of achievement.</P>
    <P>The difficulties are not all of our own making, but some of them undoubtedly are of our own making, and a great many of them are remediable by action among ourselves.  It may very well be that, if the political fight as at present conducted goes on, there will be political victors, but I do suggest that Ireland will certainly be the loser unless we can come to some conclusion which will enable us to pool our intelligence and our energies to solve those problems which have heretofore eluded us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt, it is the Minister's concern to-day to get this Bill through this House as quickly and as quietly as he can.  He has been through the wars and, although, presumably, he can claim to have withstood many of the shocks and the attacks that were levelled against him, he must still be considerably concerned about the dimension of the Bill before the House, about the problems facing him in his position as Minister for Finance, and the difficulties confronting him in the coming year.  Every member of the Seanad and, indeed, every public man, should do his duty and do his best to help the Minister in his task to bring light and guidance, if that be possible, and to make his contribution in as constructive a fashion as he can. The problem of how the money, which the Minister is raising under the Budget legislation, has to be spent, is a matter with which we must all concern ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us cannot feel very happy that the manner in which taxation is being distributed will bring the best results.  Senator Hayes has already <Col N="1868" /> alluded to the dimensions of this Bill and to the capacity of our people, year after year, to hand over a larger share of their total income to be spent by the State without being given sufficient evidence that the community as a whole have a plan laid out for them which will enable them to raise their own incomes to such a level as will put them in a position to bear the increasing burden laid upon them.</P>
    <P>My difference with the Minister to-day lies in the fact that the scheme which he has planned out for the expenditure of this money will not bring to the State the fruits which we desire, because the money is not really being as wisely spent as it might be. I take it that it is the aim of us all to plan our national economy along lines that will enable us to bring all our people more comfort and a higher standard of well-being.  We appear to differ as to the manner of examining and producing a policy so that these objects can be attained.  Year after year, in this House, when I come to examine the Minister for Finance's proposals, I am at variance with the policy enunciated by him.  I regret to say that there is no more evidence of enlightenment to-day than we had from the Minister and his colleagues at any period during the 16 or 17 years during which they formed the Government of this State.  As I say, it should be the aim of all to raise the standards of our people as a whole.  However, that cannot be done without raising the level of national income.  What is there in this Appropriation Bill to which we can point as the medium being employed by the Government to achieve that end?</P>
    <P>As we know, the agricultural industry forms the basis of our economy.  What is being done under these proposals to raise the productivity of agriculture, to increase the quantity of goods coming from our soil so that a greater amount will be available both for consumption at home and for sale abroad, thus making life better for everybody? In discussing any proposals brought by the Minister to this Assembly, I always feel that he has never yet attempted to give adequate consideration to his responsibility, as Minister for Finance, to the agricultural <Col N="1869" /> industry.  Now, this responsibility will force itself on him to a greater extent than ever before, whether he likes it or not.  The agricultural industry is the concern of Chancellors of the Exchequer in other countries.</P>
    <P>We have evidence that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain is concerning himself with the prospects of agriculture in that country to a much greater extent than previously. Agriculture is vital for the life of Britain, but it is much more vital for the life of this country; all we have got to sell abroad must come from our soil, and agricultural production must give us the surplus to which we look to provide the exchange for purchases abroad.  What is being done under this legislation of the Minister's to ensure that the national income will be increased and that the moneys with which the Minister is being provided, and which he will distribute under this legislation, will be spent in the most profitable way for the country as a whole?</P>
    <P>In his Budget statement, the Minister himself drew attention to this fact that the conditions in the agricultural industry were static.  What is he doing to cheer us up?  What is he doing to make us more efficient?  In other words, what is he doing to make it possible for the farmers to produce a greater quantity of goods this year and in the years ahead than they have been doing in the past&mdash;a period of which he spoke so gloomily in the other House on his Budget statement?</P>
    <P>As I said already, agriculture is an industry with which Chancellors of the Exchequer in other countries are concerning themselves at the present time. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. R.A. Butler, at Chelmsford on 25th July, 1952, emphasised the responsibility that rested on the British farmer and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must aim to reduce our dependence on imported feeding stuffs by increasing our yield of coarse grains and improving the quality of our grass.</P>
    <P>It speaks highly of our past husbandry that the yield per acre last year was higher for all grains than in 1950 and was well above the previous ten-year average.  It shows that we <Col N="1870" /> are learning more about grassland management and are making more and better silage.</P>
    <P>But we have certainly not gone as far as we can and must in raising farming productivity.  The short-term nature of our balance of payments is reason enough.  But the longer-term prospect offers no less powerful an inducement to the farmer. Increased world food consumption shows that we shall continue to depend heavily on what can be grown at home.</P>
    <P>But we want not only more production, but more efficient production, so that our expanded agriculture will not weigh heavily on the national economy, lowering our standard of living and our power to compete abroad.  Our national future will depend on an agriculture that is not only expanded but efficient from end to end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel that our Minister for Finance could profitably repeat that statement; also every one of his colleagues.  I suggest that, in the Bill before us to-day, there are none of the inducements held out to the Irish farmers which the British Chancellor of the exchequer is holding out to British farmers.  The instruments available in Britain to British farmers are not provided for our farmers, though the same reasons for increasing agricultural production prevail in both countries. The same demand is upon us with regard to our balance of payments.  In fact, our whole position hangs on the capacity of our agricultural industry to improve in every respect.  What are we doing, through the Minister's legislation to-day, to reach that end? Here you have the sort of thing which is being done in Britain under the British Ministry of Agriculture.  I quote from a speech made on the occasion of the opening of Northumberland's £80,000 County Farm Institute at Kirkley Hall on Saturday.  The Minister of Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Britain could boast of fine farms and progressive farmers to compare with any in the world, but there are still in our midst&mdash;and we must face it&mdash;too many examples of the <Col N="1871" /> below-average farmer on the below-average farm.</P>
    <P>It was the Government's aim, Sir Thomas Dugdale stressed, first, to bring these below-average farmers up to the level of the average.</P>
    <P>Then we must try to bring the level of the average up to the level of the better and the level of the better to the level of the best.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am quoting from a report in the <i>Farmers Weekly</i> dated the 18th July, 1952.  The previous quotation I made was from the <i>Farmers Weekly</i> of the 25th July, 1952.  What I want to say to the Minister for Finance is that we all have the same objective. We want to make the conditions of all our people better and we want to increase our productivity in field and factory.  We want to provide more goods, better services and we want to have plenty for all.  But there are many things that we have got to provide before that aim can be reached. We are not attempting to do that here. Anyone who is sufficiently interested to read what other countries are doing to-day in the field of agriculture to increase productivity and who makes a comparison with the conditions here can only stand amazed that so much has been accomplished by the farmers having regard to the disabilities under which we labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the plans of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer provision has been made this year for a subsidy on fertilisers to the farmers of Britain to the extent of 30 per cent., on their phosphatic manures and to the extent of £3. 3s., per ton on nitrogenous manures.  The contribution which that has made to the fertility of British farm land to-day is truly immense and the results which have accrued to the British farmers and the British consuming public are equally immense. We are not attempting to do anything like that.  We have apparently set our face against it.  Perhaps, that has its origin in our ignorance as to what the land of the country requires if it is to <Col N="1872" /> do for the country what it is potentially capable of doing.  There you have an illustration from the British Ministry of Agriculture of what they are doing. They are opening an £80,000 County Farm Institute.</P>
    <P>When did we open any agricultural institute or when did we do anything that added even one room to any of the institutes for agricultural education? We have recently, it is true, done something at Johnstown Castle.  I would suggest that my late colleague, Jim Hughes, was the inspiration behind this.</P>

      <P>Not a word was said in public in regard to soil science until he introduced the subject and debated it year after year in Dáil Éireann.  It took a very long time to get anything done about it.  Anyway, we have done it now.  It is an advance&mdash;a definite advance, but it came very late.  Have a look round at the other agricultural institutes in this country.  Pay them a visit, as I have done, and see what they are like.  They are the same to-day as they were 40 years ago, when they were first established.  There is not a place for one more student in those colleges to-day any more than was the case 40 years ago.  I submit that situation is the result not of the attitude of the Ministry of Agriculture but of the Department of Finance.  It is the Department of Finance that is responsible.  Where the Minister for Finance holds such an obscurantist view in regard to agriculture no real progress can be made, and unless the people are made to realise that fact a Minister for Finance in 40 years to come will be standing up here and repeating what the present Minister for Finance stated in Leinster House, when he was introducing his Budget this year&mdash;that the conditions in agriculture were static, and that no improvement could be recorded practically for 50 years.  Whether or not he said 50 years does not matter.  That is the real position.  The whole general picture in regard to agriculture is not any better than it was when this State was established.  Anybody who looks at the statistics of 50 years ago in <Col N="1873" /> relation to live stock and the area under tillage, will find proof of what I say.</P>
      <P>Our people are naturally intelligent, but it is not enough to have a type of brain which will absorb knowledge if the opportunity for absorbing that knowledge is not provided.  The knowledge must be provided.  It is truly astonishing the many thousands of farmers who have no facilities made available to them to improve their knowledge as to what their soils require.</P>
      <P>We require in this country to-day a very great extension of our agricultural education and our propaganda services.  I am quite satisfied that any practical person on the other side of the House will admit that is true, but we are doing nothing about it.  It is no use saying to the farmers: &ldquo;You are not progressing&rdquo;, when the same means are not placed at their disposal that are available to other farmers in other countries to progress.  The truth is that the British people to-day are aiming at increased productivity from their land by 1956 of 60 per cent. above pre-war.  Ours to-day is probably just about pre-war.  Theirs is up to 44 per cent. above pre-war.  For goodness' sake, will the people ask themselves the question why that is so?  Let us try to get to the bottom of the matter. We can do on the land of Ireland what they are doing on the land of England. We should aim at increased production both for ourselves and for export.  By doing this we will be providing opportunities for the people such as they never before enjoyed.</P>
      <P>My complaint is that the Minister for Finance will not face the responsibilities which are ours in this country. The populace accept the policy of the Minister for Finance.  That is why I am unhappy that the plan which the Minister provides for us is not going to provide us with what the nation requires. Increased agricultural production can only be assured when the means to increase production are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I talked at length about the great investment land is on the Finance Bill and I made comparisons between our land and that of Britain.  I am not going over that again.  I would suggest <Col N="1874" /> to the Minister that the Government must seriously tackle the problem of agricultural education.  The facilities available in our establishments for agricultural education to-day are not anything like adequate enough for our needs.  Members on both sides of this House are members of county committees of agriculture.  There is in every county an organisation with a county agricultural instructor or two. My estimate is that not at the end of 100 years would our present staffs, under the committees of agriculture, be able to touch every farmer in the county.  What does it matter to us what things were like then?</P>
    <P>These are all the teachers we have as far as agriculture is concerned. There is no real research being done in regard to agriculture.  We are just tinkering with the problem and spending practically no money on it.  There is no provision worth while for it in the vast sum in this Bill of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The problems confronting agriculture in this country and in the world are immense.  They are of immense significance for the peace of the world, but for us they are of immense significance from the point of view of our prosperity and general living standards. We cannot make progress without spending money on research.  We hear an awful lot in the medical world of the use and benefits which these antibiotics have brought to man.  Could anyone give an approximate estimate of the hundreds of millions spent on research in order to make these aids and benefits available to the human race?  Will somebody look through this Bill and see how much is being made available for research to discover the scientific problems as the root of our failure in agriculture?  There is very little, and when somebody like myself has the hardihood to say these things I suppose he will be attacked all round. There is no answer to these points. The truth is that nothing really is being done, and we ought not to make that an excuse for our present backwardness.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points to which I should like to draw attention. One might say a great deal about people emigrating and the sadness of <Col N="1875" /> it.  One might say something also about the numbers of our people who have gone to Great Britain and the contribution they make through our invisible income towards the living standards of the people here.  One might suggest that it might be profitable for us to make some provision in our budgetary policy to help our people in Great Britain in ways in which I believe they could be helped if a little careful study were given to the situation.</P>
    <P>I should like some information from the Minister on another point.  There has been a great deal of talk about our borrowings from America and the liabilities which have to be borne as a consequence.  I have been alluding to the instruments which agriculture requires to enable it to do its job more efficiently and more fruitfully.  I should like the Minister to tell us what was the justification for lending to the Agricultural Credit Corporation considerable sums, somewhere in the region of £600,000 recently, probably at such a figure as made it necessary for the corporation to charge 6 per cent. to the farmers and lending that money, I presume, from the Counterpart Fund on which I understand no interest is to be paid.  Is the Minister out to utilise those funds in such a way as to make a profit for the Exchequer to the detriment of agriculture?  Is not the same being done in regard to local loans? Are our local authorities not borrowing this money at a considerably higher price than we will have to pay for it when the repayment has to be made?</P>
    <P>Handicaps like these on our efforts, whether productive or for improving the amenities of our people in rural areas, are something which must be seriously condemned.  I do not understand how it is possible for the Minister to deplore the lack of progress in agriculture and at the same time, when the responsibility is upon him to provide instruments that will enable us to get greater production, only to give us the instruments at such a price as will discourage us from using them or make us use them with such frugality that the end cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes.  While <Col N="1876" /> there may be differences&mdash;sometimes they are merely personal differences&mdash; as to our methods, if we are serious and honest there can be no real differences about the objectives which our people have to reach.  Is it not time therefore that we studied seriously the methods which we are employing and, if we discover that we shall not achieve our ends that way, discard them and adopt something new?  In a world that is moving forward our people cannot hold their own by sitting down.  There are many things about our way of life which are delightful, but we have many scars on our economy which must be healed; we have contradictions, and we have difficulties to overcome which we must face.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that every Minister, no matter who he is, must call on our people to work harder.  Whatever other faults Ministers may have, most of them, and the Minister for Finance is not excluded, work very hard.  It is their responsibility to urge on our people that we cannot increase the goods within our own community by sitting down, that every man, and every woman also where there is an obligation on her to serve, must be prepared to work harder so that their labour will yield more.  There are too many people expecting too much for the service they are giving.  Politically, it is not easy to say that that is the approach of many of our people to life, but it is the fact.</P>
    <P>There are numbers of people in this community who expect payment for eight or nine hours' work when the fruits of their labour could be produced in four hours.  That is what makes things dear.  That is the attitude of mind towards work which makes the conditions more unsatisfactory for our people as a whole than they need be. We have to urge on our people that harder work will compensate all of us. If the national income is to be increased, Government policy through the Ministry of Finance must provide the means that are not available from any other source.  They have also got the responsibility when national income is increased of seeing that there is an equitable distribution of it, that it is related to the services which people give.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> I have stressed some of the points as to which I feel strongly the Minister is not doing what I consider is the best thing to be done.  There are many other aspects of Government policy, especially in regard to the agricultural industry, that I should like to discuss, but not just now.  I know the time in which this Bill has to be put through is short.  That is not satisfactory.  This House is not responsible for that, but the truth remains that a much more frank approach must be made to the problems of the country, in the economic and social sense, than has been made up to the present if they are to be resolved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> The two Senators who preceded me were inclined to find fault with the short time left at our disposal to discuss this Appropriation Bill, but then I was glad to observe that they proceeded to point out that this House had no control over the circumstances. Senator Hayes suggested that it would be a good idea if some system were established by which debates on the various Estimates for Government Departments could be so arranged as to have the business of the Dáil brought to a conclusion at a certain time.  I, who have had some experience of the proceedings of the Dáil in my time, would wholeheartedly support that idea, but it is one thing to advocate it and another thing to get agreement on it.  Of course, it requires the agreement and co-operation of whatever Opposition is there to carry out such a plan.  Therefore, all we can do here to-day is to utilise the time at our disposal to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this debate could be carried out over a very wide field and, as Senator Hayes has said, many things that were discussed on the Vote on Account and on the Finance Bill could also be discussed in connection with this Bill.  I do not think it would be altogether right to do that.  I do not like too much repetition in these debates and I, for one, do not propose to follow on that line.  Senator Hayes seemed to find fault with the amount of money that has to be appropriated under this Bill.  At the same time, the speaker who followed him, Senator Baxter, found fault with the Minister and the Government for not spending enough.  He spoke about agricultural education, about spending more on fertilisers, on improving the land and the condition of the soil, and on increasing production.  Well, these are things that cannot, and could not, be done without spending a lot of money.  Unfortunately, we find ourselves now in the position that if we do spend money on these things, it has to be found either out of taxation or by borrowing at home, or both.  We have not now the Marshall Aid Fund at our disposal for the purpose which Senator Baxter had in mind.  Indeed, I must say here again, as I said before on a certain occasion here, that when we first heard <Col N="1879" /> of this Marshall Aid, many of us were given the impression that this money was to be spent on the very things that Senator Baxter mentioned in the House to-day&mdash;that it was to be spent on agricultural education, soil testing, and the fertilisation of the land with a view to increasing production.  We were told that, as a matter of fact, when Marshall Aid was being discussed in the other House, and many of us, as I have said, took it for granted that the money was to be spent in that way.  I am afraid that that did not happen, that our expectations in that regard were not justified or fulfilled.  We must now, as I said, fall back on the ordinary methods of budgeting and appropriation to meet the needs of our time.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the Minister's proposal to borrow.  In fact, he said that the Minister was going to borrow more money now than had been borrowed during the whole of the previous period.  The fact of the matter is that no money has been borrowed yet.  All that has been done by the Minister is to get the necessary authority to borrow money.  I, for one, would not be in favour of excessive borrowing, but at the same time I know that the needs of the country require and justify a certain amount of borrowing for the next few years, especially if we are to proceed with our economic plans, with the development of the country, the building of houses and so on.  In my view, the question of borrowing is not as important as the purpose to which the money borrowed is applied.  What would make the people sit up and take notice is if they saw that money was being borrowed excessively and was not being applied in a constructive way to the development of the country's resources and to the improvement of the national position generally.  The fact of the matter, however, is that the present Minister and his Government, even though they have been in office for well over 12 months, have not borrowed one penny, so that I think the complaint we heard from Senator Hayes has no foundation.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Baxter refer to soil testing and matters <Col N="1880" /> like that in connection with agricultural education, and generally, to the work that is being carried on at Johnstown Castle.  We are all very glad, of course, of the success that has been achieved in that regard, but at the same time we all know, too, that all that was done by the previous Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Ryan.  While saying that, I do not want in any way to derogate from the advocacy of the late Deputy James Hughes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I often listened to him myself when speaking on that matter.  The important thing, however, to bear in mind is who did actually start the school of education there, and in that regard I think there is a tribute due to a former Minister' for Agriculture, Dr. Ryan.  With regard to agriculture generally, we may be pardoned, I think, for devoting a considerable amount of time to agriculture, since it is the basic industry of the country.  There can be no doubt but that a lot of money is being spent on agriculture.  If you take the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture itself, and the Estimate for the Department of Lands, the work of which is closely related to agriculture, you will find that the two together account for a good portion of the national bill.  Now, as I have said, it is not enough for a Senator to tell us that a lot of money is being appropriated under this Bill.  It is not enough either for a Senator to stand up here and say that he has to find fault with the way in which that money is being appropriated.  We should be told, if the bill is too large, how it should be reduced.  That surely would be the constructive way of doing it: to tell us in what field of activity we should proceed to reduce our expenditure. If a Senator tells us that he is finding fault with the way in which money is being appropriated, then we would like to know what are the alternative ways in which the money should be appropriated and spent.  We would like to hear that.  For a Senator to say that the bill is too large and that he does not agree with the way in which the money is being appropriated and spent is just to make a <Col N="1881" /> facile statement.  It is of no use unless we have an indication from these people as to what they would do themselves if the responsibility were theirs.</P>

There is the saying that &ldquo;a man's eye is better than his work&rdquo;.  I think that the people of the country are not doing too badly.  As regards agriculture, I think that the farmers are not doing too badly either.  In my opinion, the farmers of the country have never been as well off as they are at the present time, and if conditions for them continue as they are, they will have no cause for complaint, and I can assure the House that they will be quite satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps appropriate that it should fall to my lot to express appreciation to the Government for making a substantial addition to the revenues of Trinity College under Vote 22.  I came to this House, originally, as a representative of the university.  I am now a member of the House in another capacity.  I think that fact alone is evidence of this, that service to the university is regarded in the highest quarters as service to the nation.  What I have to say will be related to my view that Trinity College is an integral part of the historic Irish nation.  First of all, I would like to say that the Government, in making this additional grant to our revenues, were interpreting the wishes of the nation as a whole, and I might say the nation on both sides of the Border.  There can never, therefore, be any controversy about the propriety of making this grant either now or at any subsequent time.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised as a fact that our college is, historically, an integral part of the Irish national community. I should like to illustrate that thesis by referring to one or two episodes that occurred within my own memory. In 1912 the Home Rule Bill was before Parliament.  The late Lord Glenavy, then Sir James Campbell, one of the representatives of the university in the House of Commons, introduced an amendment to the Home Rule Bill which would have had the effect of excluding Trinity College from the jurisdiction of the proposed Home Rule Parliament.  A meeting of the fellows and professors of that time was held&mdash; some of whom, I am glad to say, are still with us.  At that meeting, they repudiated the whole policy underlying that proposed partition of the university from the Irish nation.  Sir James Campbell had to drop that amendment like the proverbial hot potato.  In other words, the college elected to remain part and parcel of the Irish nation, whatever the future might hold in store.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another episode comes to my mind in that connection.  Sir Edward Carson, the leader of the Ulster movement, was for many years a representative <Col N="1883" /> of Dublin University in the House of Commons.  Dr. Mahaffy was provost of the college from 1914 or 1915 to 1919. He had a poor view of Sir Edward Carson as a politician when Carson finally associated himself with the policy of Partition.  I remember Mahaffy saying to me in 1918, when Carson had the grace to retire from representation of Dublin University and to seek a new constituency in Belfast for the election of that year, after he had tarnished his name with the abominable policy of Partition: &ldquo;Ha, he did well to give up representing Dublin University and to go and represent a Belfast slum in the British House of Commons.&rdquo;  Therefore, in 1912, in an hour of national crisis, our college reacted as an integral part of the Irish nation.  It is very appropriate that, in an hour of financial crisis in the affairs of the college, the nation, as our kindly mother, should react generously and come to the rescue of the college which has been the kindly mother of so many distinguished Irish patriots, statesmen and national leaders.  A word or two about one or two of those leaders in the past will, I think, be quite relevant.  The one I have in mind especially is Bishop Berkeley.  Next year we shall commemorate the bicentenary of his death. Bishop Berkeley made one of the most original and brilliant contributions to economic thinking and to the study of Irish national economics that has ever proceeded from the pen of any writer. In his edition of the <i>Querist</i>, Mr. Hone says on page 14 of the introduction:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a paradox of Berkeley that he combines a mild and benevolent Unionism, &lsquo;what is for the good of one must be for the good of all&rsquo;, with a theory of Irish economic wellbeing which is wholly agreeable to modern nationalist sentiment.  John Mitchel, Irish rebel of 1848, while complaining of some of the &lsquo;slavish&rsquo; queries, declared that the good Protestant Bishop had in him the root of a truly &lsquo;Irish political economy&rsquo;; and Arthur Grffith, the founder of Sinn Féin, almost found in the <i>Querist a breviary.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the philosophy of the <i>Querist</i> has inspired, right down to the <Col N="1884" /> present day, a succession of thinkers and leaders who are concerned with the welfare of the Irish national economy.  Anybody who reads the <i>Querist</i> must be struck with the extraordinary relevance and, one might almost say, topicality of many of the queries and problems.  I should like to illustrate that statement and I should like to relate each of the queries which I shall read out to one or two of the Votes, though not necessarily by number.  In the first instance, I should like to quote a query on page 60 which, I think, might be taken as the text of any rhetorical exercise with reference to our national problems:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether there be any country in Christendom more capable of improvement than Ireland?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On page 36 there is another query on a somewhat different aspect which is, nevertheless, well worth quoting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether, if drunkenness be a necessary evil, men may not as well get drunk with the growth of their own country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, drink Guinness or Jameson if you must drink.  However, that is by the way.</P>
    <P>A query that seems to me to be entirely appropriate to the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce is query No. 105 on page 34. It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether, as our exports are lessened, we ought not to lessen our imports?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that not very topical and very much up to date?  Another query, No. 144, on page 39, might be related to the Vote for the Department of Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether there be any other nation possessed of so much good land, and so many able hands to work it, which yet is beholden for bread to foreign countries?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Query No. 201 on page 45 is entirely appropriate to the Vote for the Department of Education.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether a wise State hath any interest nearer heart than the education of youth?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1885" /> Query No. 248 on page 50 might be borne in mind by the Minister the next time he establishes a banking commission. Bishop Berkeley was an outright advocate of a nationalised system of banking&mdash;a thing which has not yet been achieved in any of the countries with which we are familiar and which is very much a matter of controversy.  I am not expressing any opinion about it, one way or another; it is interesting, nevertheless, to note that, over 200 years ago, Bishop Berkeley was advocating the national ownership of a national banking system.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether, by a national bank, be not properly understood a bank, not only established by public authority as the Bank of England, but a bank in the hands of the public, wherein there are no shares: whereof the public alone is proprietor, and reaps all the benefit?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another query, No. 308, occurs on page 56.  It too, might be of interest to the Minister for Finance:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether interest be not apt to bias judgment? and whether traders only are to be consulted about trade, or bankers about money?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Query No. 348 on page 59 might be regarded as appropriate to the Vote for the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether one, whose end is to make his countrymen think, may not gain his end, even though they should not think as he doth?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have often had that experience myself in the course of my public life in relation to views which I expressed and which were, no doubt, irritating to many people.  They led to a certain cerebral activity on the part of the public, though not always of a kind of which I would approve.  Nevertheless, I was glad that I made them sit up and use their brains.  Query No. 104 on page 97 might be related to employment schemes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether there can be a worse sign than that people should quit their country for a livelihood? Though men often leave their country for health, or pleasure, or riches, yet to leave it merely for a livelihood, <Col N="1886" /> whether this be not exceeding bad and sheweth some peculiar mismanagement?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to the emigration problem, which we still have, we have an interesting query, No. 247, on page 113:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether the industry of our people employed in foreign lands, while our own are left uncultivated, be not a great loss to the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether it would not be much better for us, if, instead of sending our men abroad we could draw men from the neighbouring countries to cultivate our own?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is an interesting query, No. 252, which is quite topical in some ways:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether we had not, some years since, a manufacture of hats at Athlone, and of earthenware at Arklow, and what became of those manufactures?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would be glad to inform the shade of Bishop Berkeley that we have a manufacture of hats at Galway which is not so far from Athlone, and at Arklow the earthenware manufacture has been revived successfully in the last few years.  On page 114, No. 258, there is something which might interest Senator O'Dwyer.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether it be not wonderful that with such pastures, and so many black cattle, we do not find ourselves in cheese?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are now finding ourselves in cheese to a greater extent than we did for many years and I applaud the development in that regard, but there I think the principal problem is not so much to develop the manufacture of cheese as to develop the habit of eating cheese.  Irish people are one of the least cheese-eating peoples in these islands.  The British consume from 8 to 10 lbs. of cheese per head in the year, if I remember rightly, whereas our consumption which used to be only 1 lb. per head per year has risen only to 2 lb. per head per year.  It is desirable that we should develop the cheese-eating habit to a much greater extent than anything we have done so far.</P>
    <P>These queries, I hope, are quite relevant <Col N="1887" /> and topical.  There are just one or two more remarks I would like to make before I sit down, because I must say I find that this extremely hot weather has a damping effect on my eloquence and I think other Senators probably feel the same way about it.</P>
    <P>With reference to statistics, I have on recent occasions drawn attention to the statistics of the number of in-calf heifers on the 1st June in each year and to the serious decline in the number of such heifers, a decline from a figure of about 120,000 in the year to some 80,000 on the 1st June in the last year or two of those figures.  I have a difficulty about this whole matter of in-calf heifer statistics.  There are, as you know, about 1,200,000 cows in the country as a whole, and merely to replace the existing number of our cows on the assumption that the average cow has only about four lactations&mdash;and there I speak subject to correction&mdash;would require at least 300,000 heifers in the year for herd replacements only.  It seems to follow that there must be a great many heifers in-calf at other times of the year that do not appear on the record as in-calf on the 1st June.  In fact, the only heifers likely to be recorded are the heifers which are in-calf with a view to calving between October and December. As we know the Irish farmer is all too much disposed to have most of his cows&mdash;not all of them&mdash;calving in the spring of the year and comparatively few calving from September to December.  I suspect that for every heifer calving between September and December there are probably two heifers calving somewhere between January and March.  Therefore, the statistical record does not really take into account the heifers that are not in-calf after 1st June though they would probably be in-calf in the following September and probably calve in the following spring.  I think it would be an improvement in the record if the same publicity were given to the figures for heifers in-calf on the 1st January each year that we are in the habit of giving for the figures of cattle population, and so on, on the 1st June each year.  I make that suggestion to the Minister in the hope that he will <Col N="1888" /> pass it on to the department of statistics.  I dare say the record exists but I do not think the January figures are adequately publicised.</P>
    <P>To get a proper sense of the total number of heifers that are being put in-calf, you want to know, not only the number in-calf on 1st June, but also the number in-calf on 1st January. Then you would be able to draw some conclusion as to the extent to which we are keeping up and increasing our population of cows.</P>
    <P>I have much sympathy with a great deal of what Senator Baxter said but I cannot help feeling that he seems to over-emphasise the responsibility of government with regard to the failure of agriculture to increase production, and not to emphasise sufficiently the responsibility of the individual owners of land, of whom there are some 300,000 in the country.  After all, in a country that believes in private property and private enterprise, and accepts the economic policy of Sinn Féin, it is primarily a matter for the individual to increase production and only in a secondary and derivative sense a matter for the responsibility of government.  At the same time, I think the Senator made a pood point when he emphasised the absence of adequate provision for higher agricultural education.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that no one made any reference to the recent meeting of the International Society for Soil Science that took place under the auspices of our Department of Agriculture.  It had a number of successful meetings in University College, Dublin, and is now probably touring the country observing various experiments and so on.  I had the privilege of attending one or two of those meetings and I was enormously impressed by the extent to which science is able in many countries to make important contributions to some of the most vital problems of agriculture, the solution of which positively contributes to the growth of agricultural production.  Although we deserve credit for having invited that international body to hold their sessions here, we have fallen behind in comparison with other countries in the provision we have made and should be <Col N="1889" /> making for the higher study of the various scientific aspects of agricultural production.  With those few remarks I now make way for some other Senator.</P>

      <P>The few speakers we have already heard have covered such a wide range of matters, some relevant and some, I suggest, not quite relevant, to this huge Appropriation Bill, that I am going to take an entirely unorthodox line myself.  I think we must accept that this Appropriation Bill, huge as it is, is a regrettable necessity and unless some of us can suggest in a constructive way definite means by which the size of the Bill itself can be reduced, there is not much object in going into those details. We have got to accept the fact that it is now the accumulated results of the demands that we have all, to a greater or lesser degree, encouraged in recent years, that the State should do more and more of those things that in the past we were proud to try to do for ourselves.  Does not the Bill demonstrate, too, that we can do all those things, or most of them, cheaper for ourselves than the State can do them? I wonder if we could get to know the exact figures of the people who to-day are not in production in any capacity in the State but who have to live out of work by those who do in some way produce either agricultural or industrial goods.</P>
      <P>I think there are symptoms of moral decadence in what is happening to-day. Fifteen, 20 and 30 years ago people would have been ashamed to look to the State for the things they now demand from the State almost as of right.  I think the Minister for Finance in any Government is to be pitied in that he finds himself confronted with the necessity of finding moneys for these services which in his heart he knows could and should be provided by the individual at less cost to himself and with, I suggest, greater moral gain to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we are faced with a situation which I am afraid will not yield the Minister the amount that he is looking for in this Appropriation Bill.  I do not want to speak pessimistically.  I <Col N="1890" /> have a fairly close and intimate contact with industrial matters.  Already some reference has been made to figures which indicate that the revenue so far received from certain directions will not yield the amount for which the Minister is seeking.  I wonder will I be challenged if I say that we are facing to-day an altogether unnecessary stoppage of trade?  The artificial stagnation brought about by certain speeches should be removed in the interests of the nation without any further delay.</P>
    <P>I know that there are men with money to spend but they are not spending it because of the uncertainty of things.  There is the extraordinary position of dear money and scarce money.  Those in business know how embarrassing it is to have to use money at 6 per cent.  Farcically enough, the industrialist who is using money at 6 per cent. is being met with all sorts of criticism because the cost of the article he produces is not as low as some people think it should be.  These are realities.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of idle money in the country to-day and idle money earns nothing and produces nothing.  When money produces nothing the State gets no revenue.  We want from the Minister two things.  They are not inconsistent. One speaker to-day said that the Minister and the Government are speaking with two voices.  The Minister for Finance is urging the people to save and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is urging the people to spend.  I think these two advices can be linked up.</P>
    <P>When people who have money spend it, that money begins to earn money and it is out of the surplus earnings the Minister for Finance will get the savings which will make this Appropriation Bill a success.  With a due sense of deliberation, I say that business to-day is in a state of stagnation. It can be revived almost overnight if public confidence is restored and those people who are able to spend are encouraged to do so and, in the ultimate, save and make this Appropriation Bill the success we all hope it will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with 90 per cent. of what Senator Summerfield has said.  Senator Kissane referred to borrowing. He stated he was opposed to excessive borrowing and pointed out with some pride that the Minister, since returning to power, has not borrowed.  I think there is danger there of a misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>The Minister has just announced that there will be a loan.  It is of vital importance from the point of view of every Party and of every section of the community that that loan should be a success.  Its success will help to reestablish confidence.  It will help to check the recession and the stagnation to which Senator Summerfield refers. I think that nothing should be said by anybody that might in any way suggest that it is not possible to have that loan subscribed.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain, and obviously Senator Summerfield agrees with me, that the money is there and can be raised for the ultimate benefit of everybody. If we cannot save and if we cannot borrow we cannot continue the capital programme.  All Parties are agreed, except on minor details, as to the desirability of that programme. From any point of view it seems to me that it is of vital importance that borrowing should be a success.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes said that here we have no serious differences on ideologies. I think that is substantially correct.  Yet, the fact remains that although the vast majority of the people would be extremely offended and hurt if they were accused of being Socialists they are, nevertheless, attracted because of competition between the various Parties more and more towards State services and State control, expecting more and more from the State.  If that is not moving in the direction of Socialism, I do not know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go back 200 years, as Senator Johnston did, to Bishop Berkeley except to say that I did not know that the good Bishop had some socialistic tendencies though I imagine he would have been offended had he been accused of being a Socialist when he advocated State ownership of banking. That is not unlike the position <Col N="1892" /> to-day.  The reason I mention that is because I believe that the huge bill with which we are now confronted will never be reduced so long as the Parties vie with each other for the sole purpose of promising more and more from the State and asking for less and less to be done by the people themselves, either as individuals or co-operatively. Unless we can agree to check that in some way or other we will have larger and larger bills, more and more taxation and less and less for the individual to spend.</P>
    <P>A few months ago I was speaking to a Minister in the present Government and in the course of conversation he made a very shrewd remark.  He said that the hardest thing for any individual to do is to reduce voluntarily his standard of living.  That is quite true. One may have to do it because one cannot help it.  It is extremely difficult to do it voluntarily.  When one applies that to the State, one has to go a considerable distance before the State finds itself in the position that it has to reduce voluntarily.  I suggest the time has come when the principal Parties should get together to the extent of accepting the position that our taxation has reached its highest possible level unless we can prove increased wealth and, if there is to be increased expenditure, other than capital expenditure which can be done from savings, in one direction or another that expenditure can only be met by doing without something else.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is that both in business and in the homes of our people there has to be an involuntary reduction in the standard of living.  In business people have to face the fact that that is all the income there is and if a business man wants to spend more in one direction he has to save in another direction.  There is not very much difference in the position of the State except that it is so much easier for Party propaganda to advocate increased expenditure than it is to advocate any kind of economy.</P>
    <P>It may seem inconsistent on my part now to advocate an expenditure of about £10,000.  I referred to this matter on the Finance Bill and was told, no doubt correctly, that it would be more suitable to raise it in connection with <Col N="1893" /> the Appropriation Bill.  In 1921, the British Government, under pressure to make certain economies, introduced what was known as a &ldquo;super-cut&rdquo; under which there was a percentage reduction in bonuses payable to civil servants whose remuneration then exceeded a specified figure.  The persons most affected were those who are generally called higher civil servants. There was considerable criticism of the action at the time, and, from what I have read of the circumstances, it seems to me that this super-cut was unfair and unjust and imposed without proper and adequate consideration.</P>
    <P>We are not, however, responsible for, or immediately concerned with, what the British Government did in 1921. That is to a large extent only of historic interest.  We are, however, concerned with the fact that in Ireland the salaries and bonus of civil servants from 1921 to 1951 were affected adversely by the super-cut and that the pensions and lump sum payments payable to retired civil servants were consequently reduced.  The Association of Higher Civil Servants endeavoured for a long time to have the super-cut abolished, and if any members of the House are interested in the details, I suggest they should read the memorandum prepared by that association in 1946.</P>
    <P>I am not now concerned so much with the merits or otherwise of the super-cut, because the Irish Government apparently decided that it was inequitable, and, in a circular issued by the Department of Finance in June, 1951, it was abolished as from January 15th, 1951.</P>
    <P>I think the abolition was approved by both Governments.  This affected only civil servants in office on January 15th, 1951, and it had the effect of increasing not only their salaries but the bonus and lump sum payable when they retired.  A civil servant whose remuneration was reduced by the super-cut and who retired before January, 1951, had his pension and lump sum calculated by reference to his salary, as reduced by the super-cut. Having regard to the circumstances, it seems to me only fair and just that these retired civil servants should have their pensions increased from January, <Col N="1894" /> 1951, by an amount equal to the sum which they lost because of the super-cut which has now been abolished.  I do not suggest that they should receive an additional lump sum but do feel that it is not unreasonable to ask that their pensions should be adjusted.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are approximately 240 persons whose pensions would be increased and that the estimated cost is £11,500 in the first year.  The youngest of the retired civil servants, I am informed, is 67 and the majority of them are over 70, so that the annual cost would obviously gradually diminish, and of course the cost to the State, even in the first year, would be less than £11,500, as income-tax would be payable on the increases. Probably £8,000 would be the net cost.</P>
    <P>The majority of the retired higher civil servants who would receive increased pensions are men who played a very important part in the building up of this State.  Most, if not all, could have stayed in the British Civil Service, but they were loyal to this country and preferred to work in Ireland. We are rightly proud of our Civil Service and successive Governments have paid tribute to its loyalty and efficiency.  We do not always, however, realise how much of this efficiency is due to the skill and hard work of these men who helped to build up the Civil Service in the early days of the State.  In those days, it often meant very hard work and very long hours.  If my memory serves me right, the present Taoiseach, soon after he first came into power, paid a tribute to the loyalty of the Civil Service to his Government as well as to his predecessors. I need not develop this any further because I know that every member of the Oireachtas of all Parties who was a member 25 or 30 years ago will agree with what I say.</P>
    <P>When this matter was raised in the Dáil by Deputy Costello, the Minister for Finance made what I took to be a sympathetic reply, in which he showed very definitely that he, too, appreciated the work done by the higher civil servants who have now retired and whose pensions were reduced as a result of the super-cut.  The Minister's main objection to the <Col N="1895" /> proposal that these pensions should be adjusted, if I understood it correctly, was that he believed that those penalised by the super-cut should not have their pensions adjusted, unless there was a general scheme for increased pensions for all State servants who retired when salaries were on a lower scale than at present.  This, he said, would cost millions of pounds, and was more than we could possibly afford at present.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I agree with the Minister that, at present, we cannot afford the taxation which would be necessary in order to grant increases in pensions to all retired State servants because of increases in pay granted for the same service after these pensioners had retired.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contention appears to be that, if he restores the 240 Civil Service pensioners whose pensions are reduced by the continuing operation of the super-cut, he must also grant increases to pensioners of the teachers, civic guards and others in respect of increases granted to these services after such pensioners had retired.  It does not seem to me that there is any clear analogy between the two types of case.  In the one case, a reduction in remuneration which was improperly imposed on the civil servants in question continues to be reflected in their pensions; in the other case, there is no such reduction operating.  It has been recognised, I think, for a long time in the public service that a pensioner is not entitled to claim an increase in remuneration simply because salaries have been increased after the date on which he retired. What I suggest is that the reduction in Civil Service pensions, due to the continuing in operation of the super-cut, should be restored.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, which had stabilised the bonus from 1940 to 1945, recognised the need for revising the pensions of men who retired during that period, and, by the Superannuation Act, 1947, restored the pensions, subject to a certain maximum, to the amounts at which they would have stood if there had been no reduction consequent on the stabilisation of the bonus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> It seems to me that the same principle should now apply following the abolition of the super-cut.  As a matter of fact, as we all know, there have been substantial increases in the salaries of higher civil servants, apart from the adjustments made in consequence of the abolition of the super-cut.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the pensions of these people who retired before January, 1951, should be adjusted in respect of the increases in salaries which have taken place.  I only ask that the pensions should be adjusted in respect of the losses they sustained because of the super-cut.</P>
    <P>In order to make quite clear to the House the exact nature of the proposals I am asking the Government to consider, I propose to quote briefly the effect in two cases.</P>
    <P>First, I will take the case of a principal clerk at a maximum salary of £800, who retired in 1945.  His full cost-of-living bonus would have been £594, but because of the super-cut his pension was calculated on a bonus of £475.  He therefore had his pension reduced by £60.  The consolidated salary now payable to the holder of the same post has since been increased by £215, apart from the increase due to the abolition of the super-cut.  It is not suggested for a moment that there should be any increase in his pension in respect of that £215 increase in salary; the suggestion is only that there should be an increase to the extent of £60, which represents the amount he lost because of the super-cut.</P>
    <P>Another case to illustrate the point is that of a secretary of a Department who retired in the same year.  His salary was £1,200 plus bonus.  His full bonus at retirement would have been £829, but because of the super-cut it was reduced to £497.  He therefore had a loss of pension of £166 per annum.  The full salary now payable to the holder of the same post has been increased by £295, apart from the increase due to the abolition of the super-cut.  I am not suggesting that the pension should be increased in respect of this £295.  My suggestion only is that the £166 which was lost <Col N="1897" /> because of the super-cut might be added to his present pension.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if it was right to abolish the super-cut in respect of civil servants still in office it is equally right that it should be abolished in respect of the 240 retired civil servants who have suffered from it.  I sympathise with the Minister's position.  He gave a sympathetic reply and I know that if he felt he could do it, he would like to do it.  I would ask him and the Government to reconsider the position and see if I am not right in claiming that there was a clear difference between this question and increasing the salaries of civil servants.  Sometimes second thoughts are best.</P>

      <P>When Senator Hayes was speaking he was full of complaints that the Bill was brought in at this particular time, that it was too late, that insufficient time was given for a discussion on it as it had to be law before to-morrow.  It is hardly necessary for me to remind the House&mdash;it is certainly not necessary for me to remind Senator Hayes because nobody knows it better than he does&mdash;that the reason the Bill appeared only to-day in this House was the deliberate opposition of Senator Hayes' own Party and their dwindling number of friends in the other House.  He says that something might be done next year to prevent a recurrence of this.  The only thing that might be done is that Senator Hayes, or in his absence his second in command, Senator Douglas, should give an undertaking that the tactics of the Opposition in the Dáil will by that time be changed and that they will switch over and face the situation seriously in a constructive rather than a destructive manner.  We heard a lot of talk about the various things which should be done for the welfare of the country, but one thing which would benefit the country and benefit it greatly would be that the Opposition in the Dáil should get down to constructive criticism rather than talk for the sake of talking.</P>

      <Col N="1898" /> Senator Hayes accused the Minister of spending his time in the Dáil blackening his predecessors.  I know that the Minister is an expert in colours and if he were to paint his predecessors in the Dáil he would choose some other colour besides black, some colour that would show, that would change them, because if they are not blackened after their history in office, I do not know what would blacken them any more.  It is not necessary for me to add any black to people who are already blackened, so I will pass on to Senator Baxter and deal with matters under the heading of green.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter suggests that the present Government are doing nothing for the agricultural community.  He waves his hands and asks what we have done.  He asks what one thing we have done for the agricultural industry.  He asks whether anybody can name one thing towards extending the investigation of agricultural matters.  He then proceeded to tell us what was done by the previous Government, completely ignoring the fact that, with regard to soil investigation, the institution at Johnstown Castle was not set up by the previous Government, but by the Fianna Fáil Government when they were previously in office.  The entire credit for Johnstown Castle should, in my opinion, go to Deputy Dr. Ryan.  He is the man who started that institution and, as a result of his efforts, considerable work has been done.  I took the trouble of going down there myself, and, therefore, I am in a position to know what is happening and to talk on the subject.  It is a pity that some of the people who stand up to criticise Fianna Fáil Governments, past, present and to come, would not take the necessary steps to visit the places they propose talking about so as to know what they are talking about, instead of standing up to waste the time of this and the other House making foolish statements which have no relation to the facts.</P>
    <P>He goes on to tell us what was done by the previous Government and suggests that nothing whatever was done by the present Government either since they came into office recently or in their previous period of office.  He <Col N="1899" /> talks about manures completely ignoring the fact that the lime scheme was in existence when the Coalition Government went into office.  The lime scheme was already there and all the preparations were made when Deputy Dillon came into power in the Department of Agriculture, but for no reason other than that it was a Fianna Fáil scheme he deliberately set out to kill it.  He succeeded in knocking it out temporarily if you like, but I take it&mdash; I have not inside secrets&mdash;as a result of Dr. Miller's attitude sufficient pressure was brought to bear on Deputy Dillon to make him bring the scheme to life again.  Now that it has been brought to life again against his wishes and the wishes of the previous Government, Senator Baxter and others like him try to claim credit for that scheme.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the land reclamation scheme.  That scheme was already in operation under Fianna Fáil but in case Fianna Fáil might get any credit they decided that they must change its name.  There must be an attempt to fool the people, so that they may not realise it is the scheme that was already in operation.  The people are not such fools as the Coalition think.  The further back you go in the country districts and the higher you go in the mountains, the more intelligent the people are.  In the last couple of by-elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope the expenditure on agriculture will be continued and will be justified and that, instead of a few thousand tons of lime being provided here and there, something like 500,000 tons will be distributed amongst the farmers for use where it is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> Senator Baxter asks for more productivity from the land and says people must work harder.  I would like to know what he means.  What was his attitude when we were trying to get the people to work harder and produce more?  He holds up examples on the basis of what has been done in other countries.  He showed one side of the picture&mdash;the results.  He did not tell us the drastic steps that had to be taken to get those results.  Had he done so, and had he advocated similar steps here as were taken by people with their backs to the wall, he would find few people to agree with him.  He certainly would not suggest it as a political programme for his own Party.</P>
    <P>I am 100 per cent. in favour of increasing agricultural and industrial production, so that everything we possibly can produce would be produced here.  The previous Government, however, put several industries out of production altogether.  I am thinking of one which is under considerable fire at present.  Without taking sides in the matter, I might say there is a big movement towards making provision for dealing with the horse industry, for the surplus or scrap horses.  Many people were not aware that we had a factory here&mdash;established at very considerable expense; it cost something like £60,000 to build&mdash;and the first thing that Deputy Dillon did&mdash;this great man who saved Ireland, as we are expected to believe, but very few people believe it&mdash;was to close down that factory.  It was fit to deal with about 100 horses a day, but it was closed down without any examination into the possibilities of using it in some other way in the future.  Certain people say it was closed down because I was chairman of the company running it, Chappies (Ireland) Limited, and it was another way of getting £500 a year out of my pocket.  There may have been other reasons.  I am sure there was at least one other reason, but he is not in the House, though he is represented here fairly well.  That factory was closed down.  To try to justify what he was doing, Deputy Dillon in the Dáil, like the boy whistling when passing by the graveyard, said that this industry was in <Col N="1901" /> the hands of a bunch of chancers, who had now left the country, and the factory had passed over to honest men. I do not know that it has had a very serious effect on me to be described as a chancer by Deputy Dillon.  I have not left the country, but that is not his fault or that of those associated with him in the previous Government I am in the country still, and I will stay here in spite of him.  Possibly something could be done regarding this industry.  I understand all the arguments against it and do not propose to take sides.  I believe the question is worth examining, since apart from the horses being shipped out, the surplus horses that could not be shipped&mdash;lame or disabled horses&mdash;could be manufactured here and their by-products used for the benefit of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>On the question of agricultural research, the Coalition were not the first people to think of that.  It has gone on here for a considerable number of years and great progress was made.  Agriculture, as an industry, however, was in reverse until Fianna Fáil came to power&mdash;then the industry took on a new life.</P>
    <P>On the question of credit for agriculture generally, I believe that the backbone of the industry is the milch cow.  Deputy Dillon was complaining that he found it very difficult to find £5,000,000 in an afternoon.  In the same afternoon, or the previous forenoon, he decided to reduce the price of milk to 1/- per gallon.  That was his contribution, and I take it that Deputy Baxter was his adviser in that respect.  Deputy Baxter is one man who goes around and has gone around for a number of years with a chip on his shoulder.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is in connection with the advancing of free money to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which the Minister was charged with by Senator Baxter when he was speaking. <Col N="1902" /> Senator Baxter said that the sum of £600,000, I think, was made available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation by the Minister for Finance, that the money was free money, that it was costing the Government nothing and that the farmers were being charged, I think, 6½ per cent. for that money. If the Minister knows where there is any free money going, he should not have kept it to himself for so long.  I am not aware that the Minister is able to provide free money for any purpose.</P>
      <P>A lot of complaints were made here. We had Senator Hayes and Senator Baxter complaining about the expenditure on social services.  I know that wild statements were made in the last couple of months as to what could be done about social services, and I do not mind congratulating the Minister and his Government on what they have found it possible to do in very difficult circumstances.  They have gone out of their way to meet the poorer sections of the people and do everything possible for them.  It was significant that no speaker suggested any way in which money could be saved.  Neither did anyone suggest that any social service should be cut down.  I would like to make some suggestions as to where money could be made or saved, one particular way being through the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, though I do not propose to go into the various items of that Department which are covered in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I merely wish to say that in the last three or four years there has been a trend in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to change over from horse transport to motor transport.  I believe that that is a serious mistake, a disastrous alteration.  It is creating a situation where hundreds of horses have been disemployed and therefore thrown on the market to be manufactured into artificial manure or exported for meat.  Many people may not realise that up to three or four years ago contracts were handed out in various towns for the delivery of the local mails.  In most towns the contracts were given to individuals who kept three, four, five, six or more horses for that purpose.  The same thing applied in Dublin.  In the not too far distant <Col N="1903" /> past that policy has been changed and motor transport is taking over in country districts.  Arguments have been made in the past on the question of comparatively long distances&mdash;which I call short distances.  We have now got to the stage where if you drive a horse five miles people think you are a wonderful man for going such a long distance by horse and car.  I remember driving horses 60 miles and there was no great difference between the time you would get to your destination by that method and the time you would get there in a bad motor car.  If the motor car broke down a couple of times, the horse would pass it.</P>
    <P>There is no use in my advocating a return to the horse as an alternative to the motor car but I do say that as far as short haulage is concerned, such as the haulage of mails in Dublin, it can be done more efficiently and more cheaply by horse.  I want to impress that on the Minister.  I have gone into the figures and I know that it will cost the Department of Posts and Telegraphs less to have mails delivered by horse transport than by motor transport.</P>
    <P>I press that point strongly, because at present the bulk of the mails in Dublin is being delivered by horse transport but there is a move on foot now and I want the Minister to take particular notice of my suggestion so that in a matter of weeks he might go into the matter to see if it would be possible to keep the few remaining horses in employment in the City of Dublin.  Horses are used for similar work in the streets of London, Paris and New York but we seem to have got to the stage where what is good enough for other countries is not good enough for us, although we breed the horses and sell them to other countries.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Department of Defence.  Money is being spent on motor cycles, motor cars and motor lorries.  I understand that the motor agents, some of whom are not too far distant from me now, do not get a chance of selling a motor car there, so they will be on the side of the horses. It is a crazy policy for this country to have a motor cycle escort for the President <Col N="1904" /> or visiting ambassadors.  If we are serious about putting our horses in the shop window, sending them abroad to compete at military jumping competitions, publishing books at considerable expense to advertise the horse industry, we should start at home by providing the various escorts from horses bred in the country rather than from imported machinery which is fed on imported petrol as against horses which could be fed on the products of Irish farms.</P>
    <P>My remarks about military escorts would be supported by about 90 per cent. of the people of the City of Dublin and the country generally.  It is said that you can prove anything with figures.  I doubt very much if anyone could prove with figures that it would cost the country more to keep horses than to continue to provide motor cycles.  Motor cycles must be driven around, burning up petrol.  If we had 100, 200, 300 or even 500 horses in McKee Barracks or any other barracks near the City of Dublin or Cork, I refuse to believe that the country would be any worse off.  In fact, I think it would be better off at the end of the year than it would be by a continuation of the present policy.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister very sincerely on the efforts he has made in such a short time in making some very satisfactory trade agreement so far as this country is concerned.  It must be a pleasure to everybody here to know that to-day you can buy &ldquo;Sweet Afton&rdquo; cigarettes in Paris.  That is about the first time in history that that has happened.  I hope it will be followed by still further exports, and that in future Irish commodities will be available to us in any country we may go to on business or pleasure.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is one matter that has been sadly neglected in this country&mdash;it is one subject that I know something about&mdash;the production and export of whiskey.  Some years ago I had a very great interest in the whiskey business.  I made it my business to find out all about the distilling and manufacture of whiskey. That is when I was interested in Locke's Distillery at Kilbeggan.  At that time, if the deal had gone through, <Col N="1905" /> it was proposed to manufacture patent whiskey there.  Because of all the campaign of slander that was taken part in at that particular time and because of all the publicity that was given to Locke's Distillery and because the people who owned it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to point out the reasons why the development of patent whiskey was not carried out. The plans were there for the carrying out of the manufacture of patent whiskey and, if they had been carried out at that time, we could have exported, not thousands of pounds worth, but at least £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 worth of whiskey in the meantime.  I would ask the Minister to go seriously into that matter.  If he needs any figures, I still have all the files.  I know exactly what the programme would be, what machinery will be necessary, and I would be delighted to furnish that information to the Minister to help him to develop what could be an extraordinary market for Irish whiskey.  We all know we are handicapped to some extent by propaganda of other countries, but the fact is that patent whiskey, without being called &ldquo;Scotch&rdquo;, is being sold under that particular label in America from coast to coast.  If that is being done, why cannot we produce patent whiskey and call it &ldquo;Irish patent whiskey&rdquo; or some other name?  We could call it &ldquo;Kilbeggan&rdquo; and put it in stone jars, and it would probably sell a bit better, because a good deal of money would be spent in publicising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Summerfield said that the principal cause of the increased costs of production of various commodities was the fact that money was not available at less than 6 per cent.  I am not such a fool as not to know that the production of articles is governed to some extent by the price of money but I do not think that the fact that money is available only at 6 per cent. would justify the increase in price of certain commodities.  I remember making a statement in the past dealing with agriculture, that the difference between <Col N="1906" /> 4 and 6 per cent. on the average loan would mean only the price of a lamb.  The price of a lamb has increased but still the ratio would not have changed drastically.  The thing that is wrong is, not the percentage that is being charged for money, but the difficulty of getting money at any rate of interest.  I believe that under the Minister's policy that situation will change in the very near future.  I would go so far as to say that it has changed already and, if the money has not got to the bank counters, at the risk of being accused of being optimistic, I say that the day cannot be far distant because, since the Minister and his Party have taken over the Government, anybody who has taken an interest in figures, or anybody who has been briefed by people who are taking an interest in figures and who were trained under Fianna Fáil to take an interest in figures, will find that during the three months under observation at the present time imports have decreased very considerably and exports to various countries, including England, have increased enormously, as a result of that change in the situation, as a result of the fact that we have ceased importing elephants and things of that kind which were unnecessary. We are now importing what is required and exporting only what we do not require here and what we are producing definitely for export purposes.  As a result of that, in the not too distant future, money will be available for the various industries which have been neglected, not because of the policy of the present Government but because of the drastic state in which the present Minister for Finance found his Department when he took over office a short time ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to get back to this Bill, having listened to Senator Quirke's eloquence in defence of certain policies.  Let me preface my remarks by saying that I was very disappointed with the manner in which this Bill was introduced by the Minister.  After all, this Bill presents to us our national housekeeping, and I understand the Minister's duty would be to explain to the members of the Seanad, both <Col N="1907" /> to those who know and to those who do not know, why he is asking for our approbation of the amount of money sought under this Bill.  He might have explained to us, to some extent, why certain Votes have increased and why certain Votes had decreased.  Instead, he said: &ldquo;There is the position, boys.  I want so much money.  You have already got all the details, so let us have a few words about it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great deal of personal sympathy for the Minister in his attitude towards us.  I know he has gone through crucifixions of various types in the other House during a discussion on this Bill.  I still think that the method of the presentation of the Bill reinforces the sort of public appreciation that exists at the present time of this House.  Senators have seen articles in the Press referring to the fact that the Seanad is being treated in a rather off-hand manner.  I am sorry to say that to-day the Minister has given these people an opportunity to reinforce that point of view.  I would have thought that the Minister would have given a lengthy explanation on a matter of such extreme importance as our national housekeeping.  I presume that, at the end of this discussion, he will give, in a résumé, an analysis of the reasons why so much money is being asked and of the reasons for the spending of it. I do not propose to go into details as to why this or that Vote should be reduced, nor do I think anybody here would be competent enough to do so. I am taking it that the Minister and his advisers have come to the conclusion that, in order to run the State as it is at present being run, they need the money.  I am not criticising the amount of money asked by the Minister, but I would like to draw attention to the figures for 1950&mdash;the latest available to me&mdash;which show that our total production in agricultural and industrial goods was to the value of about £344,000,000 and that 33? per cent. of that is now required for Central Fund expenditure of one kind or another.  I agree with the Minister that a great deal of this Central Fund expenditure will go back to the Exchequer to some extent and that it <Col N="1908" /> only means a transfer of money from one group of individuals to the other.</P>
    <P>My objection is not so much to the amount of money transferred out of the common production pool, but to the fact that State production in itself is not economic, and that every penny and every pound taken from the hands of private enterprise is a national disservice. This would apply no matter what Party was in Government.  I would ask if they were wise in taking so much money out of the common pool and applying it through State direction.  I have discussed here whether State production or State monopoly, in one form or another, is the ideal goal to be sought.  When I was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the early years, I recollect that that Party believed, above all, in private enterprise.  Fianna Fáil has since expressed their belief in private enterprise and so, I believe, has Fine Gael. I believe that the amount of money allocated to State expenditure, of one kind or another, is so large as to be, to my mind, unnecessary.  In my view, some proportion of our national income expended through State sources could be better expended by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, Senator Quirke, or any Senators who may speak when I have concluded, may say: &ldquo;Give us your solution.  What way are we to devise so that this expenditure will go through private enterprise?&rdquo;  I would say that a Select Committee, composed of members of both Houses, should be set up to look into this matter.  I do not think that national expenditure should be a Party political matter; it is a matter which concerns everybody, irrespective of his Party.  The reasons for the expenditure of money from the Central Fund for administrative purposes should be discussed on a friendly basis.  This matter of creating blacks and whites in politics is rather tiring.</P>
    <P>I repeat again that the Minister should explain to us the reasons why he finds himself in the position at the moment of needing £101,000,000&mdash;an amount which he maintains is necessary.</P>
    <P>I deplore the fact that the expenditure is so high.  Whether the Minister <Col N="1909" /> will agree with me or not, I maintain that a proportion of that expenditure would be better employed by private enterprise.  I do not demand that the Minister agrees with me on that.  However, in another capacity, at any rate, he would probably agree with me that it is not desirable to finance expenditure by taking money out of private sources and using it for public expenditure. I think it was Senator Baxter who said that even £101,000,000 would not be sufficient, and that there would be further expenditure.  This amount works out at the rate of £33 from every man, woman and child in this country &mdash;a <i>per capita</i> charge that seems to me to be particularly high.  I do not deplore it in so far as it will be re-expended in this country; the people who will get the most of this money will re-expend it here, and consequently the nation will not suffer from the general Exchequer point of view. But I believe that this money could be spent in a much better fashion. That is the point I am questioning. If it were put in the hands of private enterprise it would give a better result in the long run.  In other words, I am asking: is the State costing us too much?  Is it worth £101,000,000?  Are we getting service from the State for this amount?  These are sane questions; there is no bias about them; there is no Party attitude about them.</P>
    <P>In my view, our duty here is to examine objectively, and not from a political Party point of view, questions that come before us.  I have always stressed the fact that this Seanad is a vocational institution.  It is more by accident than anything else that one sits at one side of the House rather than at the other.  Even though I sit behind Senator Baxter and Senator Hayes, I do not always agree with what they say.  I would probably agree much more with some of Senator Hartnett's pronouncements than with the pronouncements of anybody sitting on this side of the House.  I deplore any development of political lines of thought in this Assembly on a matter of such importance as the Bill now before us.  I hope and trust that vocationalism in the Seanad will be developed. I would say that of all meassures that come before the Seanad for <Col N="1910" /> discussion the Appropriation Bill is the one that should be discussed with the greatest sense of responsibility.  If it were discussed along the proper lines great assistance would be given to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is the annual housekeeping meeting of our House, and because it is that, I regret the Minister did not enlarge, to a very great extent, on his remarks to-day.  I am not blaming him for that.  I can understand the physical pain he must have suffered in witnessing the accouchement of this Bill in the other House, so to speak, but that does not mean he should come along with the child and say: &ldquo;Here is the baby.  Do what you like with it.&rdquo; Although the Seanad has no powers, except to make recommendations on a Money Bill, I suggest it is also a revisionary body.  The atmosphere of the Seanad differs from that of the other House.  Because of these things, I think that the Minister might have given the House more consideration in regard to the length of his remarks in introducing the Bill.  Had he done so, we might have been able to give him more assistance.  On the other hand, it may be, taking the long view, that no matter what we say will not avail, and that if we make recommendations they will not be accepted.  In those circumstances, I do not know whether I am justified in speaking at all or not. I myself am becoming rather of the opinion of certain newspapers&mdash;that the Seanad is nothing more than a talking-shop.</P>
    <P>This meeting of the Seanad should be the most important meeting of the year.  It is a meeting at which we should discuss what we ought to save and spend during the present year, but the matter was treated in a very cursory manner by the Minister in his introductory remarks.  I had hoped that the Minister would have set the lead in initiating a discussion upon the general economic position without the Seanad discussing Party politics.</P>
    <P>We are going through a period of recession in trade generally.  I understand that the farmers are going to get good results from their soil and their crops.  Agricultural prices are good, and I am glad that in this respect Providence has added to the wealth of <Col N="1911" /> the nation.  It must be remembered, however, that a recession in trade and industry has set in.  Indeed, it has been with us for some considerable time.  It is very undesirable that unemployment should grow to any extent in this country.  We get unemployment figures presented to us from time to time which are not true.  I am not saying that this is the fault of the present Government or against any other Government or its statisticians. I am not saying that the figures are necessarily falsified, but they do not include what I might call part-time workers.  In some of the factories with which I am associated some of the workers are only engaged full-time for three days a week, but they do not report for unemployment to the unemployment exchange.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this situation in regard to the recession in trade can be solved.  It may be that many business firms have laid in sufficient stocks to carry them through the years of plenty.  That might be one of the causes of the recession in trade.  The unemployment problem is a serious one.  Some unemployment is being experienced now, and more unemployment is in the offing.  That is the sort of problem with which we should deal without closing our eyes.  It is a problem that ought to be dealt with from a non-Party point of view.  This question of trade recession is a matter which might be suitably discussed on this Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that taxation will not yield the sum desired by the Minister for Finance and his officials.  In that respect, I hope the appeal made by the Tánaiste for support for a new national loan this year will be hearkened to.  I would like to congratulate the Tánaiste on his conversion to the idea that what has been euphemistically termed &ldquo;external investments&rdquo; by certain people in this country can be enticed home either through loans or otherwise.  I hope the Tánaiste will be successful in his appeal for the repatriation of these external investments.</P>
    <P>I remember, when speaking on another occasion in this House, that an associate of his was rather cynically <Col N="1912" /> inclined to speak of those people who advocated a return of these investments as &ldquo;crackpots&rdquo;, a term upon which he himself is an authority.  The Tánaiste has now advocated the return of these investments.  I heartily support him in his plea, and I sincerely hope that the national loan will be successful and that it will help the Minister for Finance in his difficulties.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I deplore that the sums of money in respect of two of the most beneficial Votes have been reduced.  I refer to Vote 48, Forestry, and Vote 49, Gaeltacht Services.  These two Votes affect sections of our people who are most worthy of support.  It may be said by the Minister that the Gaeltacht Services Vote has been affected by the fact that £250,000 has been devoted to services within Gaeltacht areas under the Undeveloped Areas Act, and that, consequently, a certain amount of work hitherto done through Gaeltacht Services will be done under that Act.  Any of us who supported the idealistic approach to forestry development and the promotion of Gaeltacht Services must deprecate the reduction of the amounts under those heads not so much for what they are, but for what they represent.  It seems to me, to say the least, that it was unwise politics to reduce these amounts.  I would ask the Minister, when replying, to give us the reason why the amounts in respect of those Votes were reduced.  No section of our community has exclusive rights to a national outlook, and I am sure that An Seabhach and Senator Pádraig Aghas are just as much-worried about this matter as I am.  I do not think this should be looked upon as a Party matter, and I am sorry that any Government should reduce these Votes.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield referred to the fact that part of the trade recession was due to increased costs, high bank charges and interest costs.  I think he is quite correct when he says that some of the recession is due to these causes, but that is not the whole of the story. It is obvious that a policy affecting the whole sterling area has been carried out here, either willingly or otherwise. Nobody who studies economics would say that the circumstances which obtain here do not obtain elsewhere. <Col N="1913" /> It would be a very ugly thing for anybody to suggest, as has been suggested, that the Minister for Finance accepted any external pressure in effecting this policy.  Nevertheless, it is a peculiar fact that where the same line of policy as is being pursued by the Minister for Finance in regard to financial matters is pursued elsewhere you have the same type of business recession.</P>
    <P>We ought to sit down disinterestedly and do what we can to solve our difficulties. Possibly in the very near future we will have further devaluation of the £.  This is the sort of matter on which certain people will accuse one of being a crackpot if he talks about it.  But we do not mind being styled crackpots if we draw attention to these matters.  I make no apology for continuing on the same line in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>As Senator Summerfield said, it is all tied up with higher bank charges and general financial policy.  We have the unfortunate habit in this country of blaming the joint stock banks for all our troubles.  I am a strange advocate for them, but I think it is time that we should admit that the joint stock banks are only commercial institutions carrying out their ordinary trade in the commodity they have to deal with, which is the issue and withdrawal of money and credit.  If any criticism is to be made in regard to the control of credit and finance, it is not our joint stock banks that should be criticised. It is all a consequence of the Central Bank Act which we in this Legislature failed to implement as it should be implemented.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Senator Quirke in two things.  I should like to support him in his advocacy of the retention of the horse wherever possible. We have both followed horses in one sense, and I am entirely in agreement with him that anything that can be done should be done to develop the horse industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with him wholeheartedly in his plea for the resurrection of the rural distilleries.  One of the greatest tragedies in this country is the fact that rural distilleries were allowed to go out of business during the last 20 or 30 years.  It is a shocking thing to <Col N="1914" /> go down to Bandon and other parts of the country and see what were once thriving industries producing good whiskey falling into ruin and that we should be dependent entirely for our whiskey production on two or three monopolies within the State.  I hope Senator Quirke will succeed in getting the distilleries of the country re-established and so far as I can help him, not by consumption, but otherwise, I will be glad to be allied with him.</P>
    <P>I should like to supplement the plea of Senator Douglas relating to those civil servants who were unjustly treated, I would say, as a result of the super-cut.  You may come back on me and say, &ldquo;Here you are on the one hand asking for a reduction in taxation and on the other hand you are asking for some increase which would necessarily be a cause of further expenditure.&rdquo;  The amount is very small.  The Minister knows the whole case already.  These men gave great national service when we wanted somebody to build up the Civil Service. The great majority of them are old men now.  I understand the youngest is 67, and there are only 240 of them. There seems to be a case of hardship which arose out of circumstances over which we have no control.  There seems to be a case of injustice which should not be perpetrated.  I should like to add my plea to Senator Douglas' that the matter should be reconsidered, that we should show some appreciation for these men in their declining days, and that out of sheer justice we should recompense them for their sufferings during the past few years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister when replying to tell us&mdash;I am sure he will tell us&mdash;that this bill represents the lowest cost of running this State, that where any increase has been made in the expenditure between this year and last year it was justifiable.  He might also tell us what reduction in State expenditure we can look forward to.  There are sections of State expenditure which I should like to criticise, but I would rather do it outside this House where the people concerned will have an opportunity of replying to me.  I do not believe in attacking people because <Col N="1915" /> I have privileges here.  There are, however, certain types of administration upon which money will be spent, and which I think are not giving the best results, but I would rather deal with that outside this House.  I think it is the Minister's duty, however, to justify asking us for a sum of £101,000,000. Any Minister for Finance, no matter what Government he belongs to, must justify his actions, and not merely make a presentation of the case to us by saying: &ldquo;Here you are, boys, here is the cost of running the State.  A sum of £101,000,000 is necessary and I want it.  Tell us what you think about it.&rdquo;  I appreciate his forensic powers. his powers of oratory and his caustic northern wit, and because of that I should like him to answer these questions when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire only to make a brief intervention in this debate. Senator O'Donnell accused the Minister of having treated the Seanad with discourtesy.  I did not hear the Minister's opening speech.  Accordingly, I do not know what justification there is for the Senator's charge.  But, if the Minister anticipated that he would be asked questions of the type which Senator O'Donnell asked him at the conclusion of his speech, that he is required to reply whether this is the lowest bill which could be brought before the Oireachtas, then I think there is some justification for any discourtesy shown by the Minister, if it were shown.  It must be exasperating for any Minister for Finance to come to this House and hear Senators, some of them intelligent Senators like Senator Douglas, suggesting that this bill is too high, suggesting that the Minister should be able to reduce it, suggesting that the Minister should be able to effect certain economies, suggesting that the only reason these economies were not made was because it would not be politically expedient to make them.  When a Senator like Senator Douglas makes a statement like that, I think the Seanad expects him to go further and say that he will recommend to the Minister that the old age pensions be reduced, that the widows' and orphans' pensions be reduced, <Col N="1916" /> that the blind pensions be reduced, that a saving be effected in public assistance or in any of the other social services.  It should be easy to do that.  But I do not think that the Senators are justified in suggesting in a vague and airy way that economies could be made without specifying even one such economy which they suggest should be made.  They could have taken any particular Department. They could have taken the Department of Health and suggested that too much was being spent upon health services. No Senator has gone so far as to do that.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there is the opposite side of the picture.  The Senator might reasonably have suggested, perhaps, that not enough was being expended on the health services. I think it will be agreed that the health services are the most important and the most indispensable of all the services which the Government provide for the people.  In the light of the White Paper issued yesterday by the Government, which sets out their plans for improving and extending our health services, I feel sure that every Senator, certainly every democratically-minded Senator, no matter where his Party allegiance lies, will offer the Government the most sincere congratulation and the most sincere gratitude for the proposals which they have submitted. I think they are bound to say that they will provide a first-class, up-to-date and efficient medical service.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the decision of the Government to establish a non-means test medical service for all women in respect of motherhood and for children up to the age of six weeks. That will be money extremely well spent.  It represents a tremendous advance.  This Government, both in the past, when they were in office, and at the present time, have been responsible for many excellent social measures.</P>

      <P>(ii)  the establishment of an Irish Veterinary Council and the representation of the Irish veterinary profession on the General Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons;</P>
      <P>(iii)  arrangements in regard to such matters as fees payable by veterinary practitioners, the procedure for taking disciplinary action in regard to members of the profession in Ireland, and the superintendence of the examinations at the Veterinary College, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the only training centre for students who desire to become veterinary surgeons is the Veterinary College at Ballsbridge, Dublin, which is controlled and administered by the Department of Agriculture.  This college has since its inception in the year 1900, been affiliated to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, London. By reason of that affiliation, it is the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons that holds at the Dublin Veterinary College the examinations leading to the award of the diploma of M.R.C.V.S., which is the professional qualification in this country. Students who obtain the M.R.C.V.S. diploma after passing the necessary examinations at the Dublin Veterinary College are, as a result of <Col N="1918" /> the 1930 agreement referred to, entered on both the Irish Register of Veterinary Surgeons and on the General Register kept by the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and persons on the general register are also eligible for entry on the Irish register.  It is by reason of this that our veterinary trainees, after obtaining the M.R.C.V.S. diploma at the Veterinary College, Ballsbridge, are able, if they so wish, to practise in Great Britain and countries of the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Under the British Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1948, which became law on the 30th July, 1948, certain important changes affecting the training of veterinary surgeons and the veterinary profession in Great Britain were made. Previous to the passing of this Act, the only portal of entry to the veterinary profession in Great Britain was, just as it is now in our country, the Diploma of M.R.C.V.S., obtainable by students who had attended a recognised veterinary college and passed the examination held by the Royal College. The most important change made by the Act of 1948 was to provide that, under certain conditions, veterinary degrees conferred by specified universities would be accepted by the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons as registrable professional qualifications, instead of being academic distinctions only.  This change necessitated a reconstitution of the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  The Act provided for this reconstitution, which has been carried out.  An important section of the Act provides for giving effect by Order in Council to agreements with the Government of Ireland in regard to such matters as the recognition, for the purpose of registration in the General Register, of degrees conferred by a university in Ireland where, under the law of Ireland, such degrees qualify the holders to registration in the Irish Register of Veterinary Surgeons, and the appointment or election, in accordance with the terms of such agreement, of Irish representatives on the reconstituted Council of the Royal College.</P>
    <P>From the end of 1946, in anticipation of the enactment of the British <Col N="1919" /> Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1948, the Department of Agriculture had had discussions with representatives of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and of the British Government.  The British were anxious that Ireland should bring into operation an arrangement similar to theirs, and the Department of Agriculture, on their side, felt it would be anomalous that our students at the Veterinary College, Ballsbridge, should be the only veterinarians in these islands who would still have only one portal of entry to the profession, namely, the examinations held by the Council of the Royal College, while the members of the profession in Great Britain could qualify through the universities.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate for me to mention here that, since 1946, an arrangement has existed under which veterinary students may obtain degrees in veterinary science at University College, Dublin, and at Trinity College concurrently with their courses in the Veterinary College.  The National University confers the degree of M.V.B. (Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine) on students who pass the university examinations and after they have obtained their M.R.C.V.S. diplomas.  At Dublin University the degree B.Sc. (Vet.) is conferred on students who obtain the degree of B.A. and the M.R.C.V.S. diploma.  For the purpose of this arrangement, the National University, in May, 1946, voluntarily and on their own initiative, established by statute of the university a Faculty of Veterinary Science and appointed the professors of the Veterinary College part-time professors of the National University.  The degrees obtainable under the existing arrangement are not registrable as professional qualifications.  The legislation now proposed in this Bill provides a means by which degrees such as those at present obtainable could be accepted as registrable professional qualifications.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussions with the British authorities, it was recognised on both sides that it would be necessary to have a new comprehensive agreement between the two Governments and discussions were held on matters to be incorporated in the <Col N="1920" /> agreement under the following heads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Reciprocity in regard to the registration in the Irish Register and in the General Register of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The continuance, for some time, of the existing portal of entry to the veterinary profession in this country by means of the diploma examinations of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The provision of a new basis of representation of Ireland on the reconstituted Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons so as to include university representatives as well as representatives of the veterinary profession in this country.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Such matters as the superintendence of examinations, disciplinary investigations and the payment of fees by persons registered in both registers.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of the necessary legislation here and the drawing up of a comprehensive agreement pursuant to that legislation, it was thought desirable to make a temporary arrangement for the representation of Ireland on the reconstituted Council of the Royal College, which held its first general meeting on 1st June, 1949, and accordingly an interim agreement to deal with that point (and another point in relation to the payment of fees) was discussed and settled in London on the 11th May, 1949, between the representatives of the two Governments.  Attached to the Bill is a copy of this agreement.</P>
    <P>Progress with this Bill has been unavoidably held up.  Although leave was given to introduce the Bill in the Dáil on the 18th July, 1950, the then Minister for Agriculture did not subsequently find it practicable to proceed with the further stages before the dissolution last year.  The enactment of this legislation is necessary in order to give registrable status to university degrees, and it should no longer be delayed.  Accordingly, I desire now to proceed with this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is short and simple.  I have explained its background and will now comment briefly on its provisions. The most important section in <Col N="1921" /> the Bill, namely Section 2, will enable the Government, in the circumstances set out in that section, by Order to direct that any person on whom a veterinary degree is conferred by a university in the State shall, on applying in the prescribed manner and paying the requisite fee, be registered in the register of veterinary surgeons maintained by the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  Sub-section (2) of this section provides power for the revocation of any such Order.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will enable the Veterinary Council of Ireland to appoint persons to visit any college or other institution in relation to which an Order under Section 2 is in force and to report to the Minister for Agriculture upon the courses of study, staffing, accommodation and equipment available for training in veterinary surgery and on the examinations leading to a degree.</P>
    <P>Section 4 confirms the interim agreement made with the United Kingdom Government on 20th May, 1949, and provides a flexible arrangement by which the Government may give effect to any further agreements that may be made with the United Kingdom Government in relation to the training, registration and control of veterinary surgeons.  As mentioned by me already a new comprehensive agreement will require to be made with the United Kingdom Government as soon as practicable after this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931, under which the Veterinary Council of Ireland was constituted, contained no provision for later reconstitutions of the council.  The flexible provision made for such reconstitutions under Section 5 of the Bill is necessary not only because of the change the Bill provides for in the system of veterinary training but because a reconstitution of the council will also become necessary under the proposed comprehensive agreement with the United Kingdom Government and possibly under any further such agreements.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will enable the Minister for Agriculture, at the request or with the concurrence of the Veterinary Council, by regulation to make desirable or <Col N="1922" /> necessary alterations in certain minor matters at present fixed by the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill will give the Veterinary Council of Ireland an additional disciplinary power, namely that of suspending the registration of a veterinary surgeon in a case where the council does not wish to go so far as to erase his name from the register.  A corresponding power was given to the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, London, under Section 16 of the British Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill have been inserted at the instance of representatives of the veterinary profession. Section 8 strengthens the provisions made by the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931, against the practice of veterinary surgery by unregistered persons.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives the Veterinary Council the express power to acquire, hold and dispose of land.  Section 10 provides for the acceptance of gifts by the council. Section 11 provides that the Bill, when enacted, shall be construed as one with the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should mention that before introducing this Bill I discussed its provisions with representatives of the veterinary profession and of the National University and of Dublin University.  They all expressed themselves as satisfied with the measure.</P>
    <P>Just one word more.  This Bill does not deal with the future control of the Veterinary College, which is not even mentioned.  One of the Bill's main purposes is to enable veterinary degrees to be given by the universities which will be registrable qualifications. They are at present giving degrees which cannot be registered.  The other main purpose of the Bill is to enable the Government to enter into agreements with the British Government about reciprocity of treatment of veterinary surgeons here and in Great Britain.  This Bill is necessary, whatever is to be the future of the Veterinary College.  If a new institute is to embrace the Veterinary College, then separate legislation will be needed for that purpose, but the provisions <Col N="1923" /> of this Bill will also continue to be needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily congratulate the Minister on the introduction and passage of this Bill through the Dáil, and on its introduction in the Seanad this evening.  We, the members of the veterinary profession, have been anxiously waiting for this Bill for three years.  Actually, as the Minister has explained, the Bill confirms the agreement which is published in the schedule to it, an agreement which was made in 1949.  Therefore, we have actually been waiting three years in order to give that agreement the force of the law by the passage of this Bill through the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>The main parts of the Bill will, I am sure, be acceptable to the members of the Seanad as they have been acceptable to members of the Dáil. This Bill is not in any way a controversial measure, and I assume that the members of the Seanad will be ready to give their assent to the various sections it contains.  Since I came to the House to-day several members have approached me for information concerning this Bill, and mentioned that they had not got copies of it.  Their inquiry, I think, illustrates to some extent the delay that has gone on in connection with the Bill over the last three years.  The Bill, in fact, was circulated early in the year, so that some Senators must have forgotten that they had actually received copies of it.  However, I did give them some explanation of the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators should understand that, formerly, it used to be the boast of the veterinary profession, both here and in Great Britain, that there was only one portal of entry to the profession: on the fact that there was only one body supervising the whole course which the students had to follow from the time they entered a veterinary college until they had qualified.  A change in that position occurred in Great Britain, but not here.  Our own Veterinary College was, I presume, in a position to cater fully for the profession in Ireland.  It was able to provide for the education of the <Col N="1924" /> students and their examination.  As a matter of fact, at the moment there is such a big waiting list that there are many students who cannot gain access to the Veterinary College. However, it was on the other side that they solved the problem by getting a greater number of teaching institutions and, therefore, the Veterinary Surgeons Act of 1948 was passed.  That was four years ago.  When that Act was passed, it conferred on five universities in England, Scotland and Wales the power of establishing in each a faculty of veterinary medicine. We are still awaiting ratification of the proposal whereby our universities can grant qualifying degrees.  Our students, otherwise, would be the only students who would still be examined under the auspices of the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  That would be a very invidious position.</P>
    <P>The members of the veterinary profession wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.  It is simply an enabling Bill to allow universities to grant registrable degrees.  Students who are going through the college at present will be anxious to see this Bill implemented as soon as possible.  In recent years students have had to undergo two series of examinations.  Every professional examination each year had to be duplicated&mdash;the ordinary college examination and a similar examination under the jurisdiction of the National University.  Trinity College had it easier, because there were fewer students.  They had not to conduct duplicate examinations each year.  It will be realised that the fact that the student had to undergo a second examination proved a grave hardship. The answer, of course, was that it was the student's own wish to do it.  At the end of five years a student got the degree of M.R.C.V.S. and also the degree of M.V.B.  The M.V.B. degree is similar to that which the medical student obtains except that &ldquo;V.&rdquo; is inserted to indicate that the holder is a bachelor of veterinary medicine.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained that the object now is to put us in a position similar to that of certain British and Scottish universities.  The degree which they confer is a registrable degree <Col N="1925" /> entitling the student to practise veterinary surgery and veterinary medicine. One of the results of the Bill will be the elimination of the system of duplicate examination in this country.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill to-night does not end the matter.  I appeal to the Minister, once this Bill becomes law, to come to a final agreement with the Council of the Royal College as quickly as possible.  The Irish Veterinary Council has been in contact with the Council of the Royal College with regard to arrangements to be made between the two Governments.  Members of the profession on both sides of the Irish Sea are in agreement on the matter.  All we want is agreement between the two Governments and the speedy implementation of this Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to speed up the negotiations with the British Government. Negotiations have already been carried on between the representatives of the Irish Veterinary Council and the representatives of the Royal Council.  We have practical agreement so far as fees and other matters are concerned.  All we require is governmental implementation of what we have practically agreed on already in our negotiations.  As the Minister has said, a new agreement will be drafted which will operate for the students on this side of the water as well as the students in Britain.  There will be no alteration in present practice when this Bill becomes an Act.  When a veterinary surgeon is registered in Britain he will be entitled to practise in this country and when an Irish veterinary student qualifies he can be registered on the Royal College register and practise in Britain.</P>
    <P>Certain financial benefits also will accrue to the Irish Veterinary Council which, up to the present, has been different from the councils of the sister professions in this country.  They would have no place to meet were it not for the good offices of the Minister who allows the council to meet in the premises at Ballsbridge.  The Irish Veterinary Council need headquarters in the city similar to the pharmacists <Col N="1926" /> and the medical bodies.  They need their own library, and so forth.  Up to the present, they have not had the money for that purpose, because portion of the retention fee which is paid to the Irish Council has had to be transferred to the Royal College, and that has left the Irish Veterinary Council in straitened financial circumstances. For that reason also, I hope the Minister will finish the good work which he has undertaken as quickly as possible.  There has been a delay of three years in bringing this Bill before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's opening statement and from the speech of Senator Sean O'Donovan that the House will speedily pass this measure.  I presume the Minister will be able to tell us that the delay which has taken place was not due to any lack of goodwill on the part of his predecessor in office.  I am quite certain that the purposes for which this Bill is designed to serve are essential, and that we would be prepared to cooperate in their regard.  It comes rather as a surprise to many of us to learn that the veterinary profession&mdash; that all-important profession in this country&mdash;is not in the same position as other professions.</P>
      <P>When the text of this Bill reached me I tried to discover the exact position of the veterinary profession in this country.  From what Senator Seán O'Donovan said, it is obvious that the Minister has more work to do in this connection.  It is important work, and it should be done quickly and efficiently. People in Ireland who have experience, and who realise the vital part which the veterinary profession plays in the economic life of our country, must do everything possible to give the body concerned the official status which we already credited it with having.  Veterinary officers and members of that profession make an immense contribution to the economic well-being of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many difficulties can be resolved only if the veterinary officers in this country are given the status which, from every point of view, they should enjoy together with the power to organise their profession to enable <Col N="1927" /> them to collect evidence and information, to study the problems that confront them and to be in a position to resolve problems in veterinary science which, I take it, because of present circumstances, they cannot tackle to-day. This is not the moment to go into a debate on anything beyond what is contained in the Bill, which is really a machinery Bill, but those of us who appreciate the significance of what the veterinary surgeon means to our live-stock industry to day, and who can contemplate the contribution he can make to the improvement and the better development of the live-stock industry in the future, must be prepared to make all the contribution we can to whatever advances the members of the profession feel are necessary to enable them to do their job better.  I welcome the Bill and I am sure the House will be prepared to give it a speedy passage.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the attitude of Senators opposite who speak with both sides of their mouths <Col N="1930" /> at the one time.  I was referring to the fact that Senators to-day told the Minister he should have been able to effect economies and they criticised him because he had not been able to effect economies.  Where the Minister effected considerable economies, however, by abolishing the food subsidies Senators criticised him very severely for having done so.  To say the least of it, that is not an honest attitude. It is an endeavour to score political points and it does not fool anybody any longer.</P>
      <P>If economies can be effected, then the onus is on the Senators to point out to the Minister where these economies can be effected, even if it is politically unpopular and inexpedient to say so.  Senators should not say one thing outside the House and then come in here and propound a diametrically opposite view.  I referred to the excellent provision this Government is making for the health services.  I have no doubt that the Senators opposite will give their wholehearted approval to the Government's proposals in that respect.  I would appeal to Senators not to confine their approval to the proposals outside the House but to give it inside the House also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I add my voice in support of what has been said by Senator Douglas with regard to that small body of Civil Service pensioners whose pensions have been affected by the existence of the &ldquo;super-cut&rdquo;?  I have read the documents that Senator Douglas has put on the records of the House, and it appears to me that there is a most convincing case to show that injustice is being done to this small body of men.  They number some 240.  The youngest of them is 67 years of age. As Senator Douglas pointed out, the cost to the State would be something in the region of £9,000, and in the natural course of events that will be a diminishing charge and will disappear altogether in a relatively short period of time.  I can understand the Minister's point of view as expressed in the Dáil, namely, that it would be difficult to review this particular matter without, at the same time, reviewing the claims of other classes of pensioners.  Undoubtedly, that is so, but there is the distinction in this case, <Col N="1931" /> as pointed out by Senator Douglas, that it is not a question of an increase. It is merely a question of removing a discrimination.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister, in the near future, will consider favourably a review of pensions generally.  It has been stated that the pensions of the Old I.R.A. will be so reviewed with a view to increasing them because of the lower value of money at the present time.  I think everybody must approve of that step, even if it means, as it must mean, a further charge on taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the courage of his convictions.  If certain things are recommended by Senators and Deputies, things which must involve a charge on the Exchequer, then the Minister must find the funds to implement those recommendations by means of taxation, and when he seeks to find the funds by means of taxation Senators should have a proper sense of responsibility in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>They should not with one voice proclaim that the Minister should not do this, that and the other, and with another voice proclaim that the Minister should increase pensions, make more adequate provision for destitute people and for those who are living below, or just above, the subsistence level.  They should not do that, and then criticise him if, in carrying out their recommendations, he has to increase taxation.  There is no other way of doing it except by increasing taxation.  I have listened to the alchemists on the other side of the House implying that these things can be done without increasing taxation. The bill which the country has to meet is a heavy one.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether or not Senator O'Donnell listens to the debate.  It was stated by Senator Douglas that economies should be <Col N="1932" /> effected, that it might not be politically desirable to effect such economies, but that they were necessary&mdash;I am paraphrasing what he said&mdash;in the national interest.  Senator O'Donnell was in the House.  It would be tedious to recapitulate the other points because other Senators appear to pay more attention to the debate.</P>

If I may take up at the point where I have been interrupted on so many occasions, I am sure the Minister will review the claims of all pensioners. I would ask him, in advance of that, to consider favourably, as I am sure he will, the claims of these 240 pensioners, because I think they are on a different level, and, as soon as practicable, the claims of all other pensioners, many of whom are now in very straitened circumstances as a result of the decreasing value of money. I hope the Government will pay due regard to them and do as much to improve their conditions as they have shown they are about to do with respect to health services in the case of the whole population.</P>

      <P>We are entitled to complain that the Minister gave us <Col N="1933" /> such little information in introducing this Bill to-day.  He outlined the Bill very briefly and made it quite clear that the Bill had to be passed by to-morrow. I do not think the Seanad should be treated in that way.  The Minister should have given us a full statement and it is no excuse for him to say that because he was unable to be here until to-day, he was able to say very little on the matter.  Arrangements should have been made whereby the Minister would have been put into the position that he could fully explain to us the terms of the Bill and the reasons for all the money he requires. Therefore, if we cannot make all the suggestions that we might like to make in considering the Bill, we may be forgiven because the Minister has not dealt with the Bill as he should have.  Senator Hartnett has really no ground for complaining that we have not made suggestions whereby the Minister will be enabled to effect savings. Later on, I will give one or two cases in which savings could be effected.</P>
      <P>In passing, I should say that it is very interesting to hear that the White Paper published to-day by the Department of Health meets with the full approval of Senator Hartnett.</P>

      <P>It would appear that now we may have a practical and reasonably good health scheme.  Like most people, I have been unable to read the White Paper fully, but I may say that it has all the signs of being a good scheme.  The person who prepared it, however&mdash;perhaps it was Senator Hartnett; I do not know&mdash;has made it quite clear in paragraph 38 that a lot of water must flow under the bridges before the scheme becomes effective.  However, it is interesting that it should have the full approval of Senator Hartnett.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell told us a great deal about politics, and said that we should not talk politics in the Seanad. Is that not just nonsense?  What can we talk about if we do not talk about politics?  The sooner Senators who talk like that get it into their heads that this is one of the places in which <Col N="1934" /> politics may be talked, albeit it with some little risk, the better.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I require some education.  Senator Quirke regretted the passing of the horse and told the Minister that he should see to it that considerably less money was spent on mechanised transport. Like Senator Quirke, I regret the passing of the horse, but I am afraid there is really very little we can do about it.  The Senator went on then to say a whole lot of other things.  He is a very remarkable man.  From the time the Seanad commenced to-day and all through his speech, Senator Quirke did nothing but speak about a member of Dáil Éireann.  Why he should do that, I do not know.  I think he should forget about that Deputy.</P>
      <P>He told us about the land rehabilitation scheme and about a land reclamation scheme and suggested that the land rehabilitation scheme was the product of a Fianna Fáil Government. It was no such thing.  The scheme to which Senator Quirke referred was a small land reclamation scheme of which very few people took advantage, and it was only when the inter-Party or, as Senator Quirke would have it, the Coalition Government, came into office that the land rehabilitation scheme, as we and the people of the country know it to-day, was brought into force.  He may claim whatever credit he likes for his small land reclamation scheme, but let it be quite clear that the land rehabilitation scheme, otherwise known&mdash;certainly in the country&mdash;as the Dillon scheme, was the product of the Coalition Government. We approve fully of all the moneys being spent on that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hartnett suggested that we should help the Minister in regard to saving some money.  I suggest he should look at the Estimates of the Minister for Finance and should endeavour to prevail upon him not to proceed with this transatlantic aviation <Col N="1935" /> scheme.  I believe that plans for this are very well advanced and that any day we shall have the pleasure of paying for the transport of comedians and comediennes to and from America.</P>

If he will assure us that he will see that none of this money is spent on inaugurating a transatlantic flying system I will be quite satisfied. I would ask him to see that the money is not spent in any such way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not as much influence as Senator Hartnett.  I suggest that we should not agree to the expenditure of this money.  It may be that the Minister will give us later on very good reasons why we should spend it.  Perhaps if he had in advance explained fully the terms of the Bill we would not have any difficulty about this or any other item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all wish the Minister every success in his projected loan.  We sincerely hope that it will be the success it deserves to be, and every assistance will be given to him with a view to that end.  The Minister must do something to encourage saving in this country.  Practically nothing is being done to encourage people to save. Nothing is done to educate people as to why they should save money.  The Minister and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may say to us: &ldquo;Why should we go about teaching business people about the excellent results that will be obtained from saving?&rdquo;  My answer is that excellent results would follow for the Government if people <Col N="1937" /> were encouraged to save and did so, but nothing is done to develop the idea of saving.  The Post Office and perhaps the Department of Finance put up a few coloured posters here and there, but nothing is done, so far as I know, in the schools to educate the young as to the value of saving.  Nobody seems to care whether or not we save. The Government, through the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, should step in and help the people.</P>
    <P>There is one other suggestion I would make&mdash;this is by way of supporting the Minister.  Every effort should be made by the Minister to restrict imports particularly from hard currency areas. It always seems strange to me that articles which are in the nature of luxuries should be allowed to be brought into the country.  Particularly am I amazed when I see that luxuries are allowed to be imported from hard currency areas.  The Minister, I agree, has himself stressed the fact that we should cut down imports.  By way of encouragement, I say that he should go out of his way to prohibit imports, particularly imports of luxuries and imports from hard currency areas.</P>
    <P>If we on this side of the House have been unable to indicate to the Minister where he could save money he cannot complain, when he comes into the House on the 30th July with the indication to the Seanad that they must put the Bill through by to-morrow, and when in order to give us time to speak he says only a few words, although he should have presented the Bill with a wealth of detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, as well as every other Senator, and I presume everybody in the country, agree that the bill presented this year is definitely huge. We have traversed a lot of ground and discussed the reasons for the magnitude of that Bill.  I think that all the people agree that we have probably reached our limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address myself to some of the remarks about greater production.  If this idea were very closely examined with regard to agriculture, which we all admit is our mainstay, it would be seen that it is <Col N="1938" /> not as easy as it appears to increase production.  The reason is that a pile of land is held by smallholders who are producing the last ounce they are able to produce because they must do so to exist.  If any extra production can be procured it must be procured from the ranches.  If we are to have extra production we must revolutionise our agricultural policy.  I wonder will that be popular whenever it is introduced?  When a Minister dares to bring a measure into the Dáil to increase the holdings of a certain percentage of small farmers in the parts of the country where they are and transplant those who are redundant into the richer lands, the plains of Meath, then there is definitely a possibility of increased production.  That Minister will definitely justify himself but will that measure be popular?</P>
    <P>It is very easy to say &ldquo;increase production&rdquo; but let us examine the whole thing.  It has been admitted that we are poor in mineral resources as a raw material for industry.</P>
    <P>We had one effort made to allot the bogs and work them in order to help to stem emigration and prove a source of income to smallholders, but every effort was made to depopularise the use of turf&mdash;until it had to be used&mdash; until the gun sights had decreed that no more coal would cross the water. It never got the opportunity to which it was entitled.  If coal were cut out definitely by Act of Parliament and everybody had to use turf or a percentage of turf, there would be public protest meetings.  We hear talk about more production and more cooperation, but there does not seem to be any consistency.  If everyone did as much for production as the farmer has done, things would not be as bad as they are.</P>
    <P>Emigration and unemployment have been talked about here and I suppose we could stay here for the next two months arguing about those problems. It must be remembered that these problems are not the direct fault of any Government.  Science has produced a number of inventions which have displaced a lot of men while <Col N="1939" /> placing a few.  Contrast the methods of husbandry now with those of even 30 years ago.  How much more can one man do to-day with machinery in comparison with half a dozen men with spades and scythes?  We can think over the last war, when science was responsible for an economy of armed forces while it was responsible for the greater destruction of the civil population of the countries at war. Owing to the work of science the civilian population suffered more, because the bomber came down on them while the fighting men had only to face those in the trenches in front, as in the 1914-1918 war.  We should examine these things to realise that while science is doing a good job it may put men out of production.  We never examine that; we just say that science is wonderful and we forget the reactions.  We must see how far we can go in this fast travelling world of speed.  Drapers will tell you they would be much richer if the young ladies wore long skirts like their mothers and grandmothers, as they would sell three times as much cloth, and milliners would do better if the ladies would wear more hats instead of the scarves one sees to-day. Furthermore, if the boys and men wore hats or caps there would not be such loss to the manufacturers.  You must take these things into account. However, the people are entitled to do that and that is the hard fact of the problem.  If this were worked out the figures would be as staggering as any in the Minister's Budget.</P>
    <P>I said before and still maintain there are too many handlers here, too many in between the producer and the consumer. That is the cancer, and while it exists there will be hardship.  This competition in trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  People think that these things can be changed by a wave of the hand, that we can <Col N="1940" /> get rid of them by increasing production. I want to point out that increased production is not as simple as it appears to be.  I would also like to remind Senator O'Reilly, regarding the land reclamation scheme, that there was in existence under the previous Fianna Fáil Government a farm improvements scheme which was working very satisfactorily.  It provided a certain sum for every farmer if he did a certain amount of drainage every winter, and did it satisfactorily.  He did that and did not put down imported pipes, but went to the nearest quarry and used Irish manufacture, as in his grandfather's day.  As to whether the reclamation scheme was good economy or not, to me it was not, and I am a farmer myself.  I maintain it is not good economy and not fair to the taxpayers to give £60 per acre drained and only charge £12.  I can understand subsidising, as was done under the farm improvements scheme, when a lot of good work was carried out.  I am not finding fault with the reclamation scheme because it was brought in by another Minister.  Let anyone go and inspect the work done.  I saw a lot of it done in my own parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would be surprised how many people embraced the new scheme and benefited under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw £60 spent on some of the drainage there and the charge to the men who benefited was only £12.  Thank God, I did not need any work done under it.  Of course, if you subsidised only to half that expenditure, twice the number of acres could be improved and our commitments under that part of Marshall Aid would not be as heavy as they are and we would have not such regrets, since we would have made better use of the money which we have borrowed and must pay dearly for.  As far as borrowing money is concerned, all capital development is dependent on the floating of loans, as it cannot be carried out on ordinary finance; but when you are borrowing for a number of years you reach a point where the amount needed for repayment of interest and sinking fund comes to such a high percentage of the national income that it <Col N="1941" /> could have the effect of retarding progress in other directions.  In that respect, any Minister for Finance, be he who he may in any Government, must take into account that he might be robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We are moving quickly in that direction and we have jumped up a lot in ten years. The amount necessary ten years ago was only a small percentage but it has increased.  It is dead money, despite the fact that it is money being paid back for work carried out&mdash;and it is only right, of course, that borrowed money should be paid back, whether it be the case of a nation or an individual.</P>
      <P>I hope that the new loan will be a success, since we know that it is necessary. If it is not floated, the housing programme will have to be stopped. The money is necessary to continue the important works on hands, including rural electrification, which is very much sought after.  In areas where it is not being used to-day, they are pressing forward to get a scheme recognised so that it can start there.  Rural electrification is costing a lot of money and unless money is borrowed for that development the work will have to cease and people who are not blessed with it already will have to go without it.  I dare say no one wants to do that. One must, however, be careful.  One could easily reduce the Minister's demand to half, but the result would be ridiculous.  For instance, one could reduce the Vote for the Department of Education to half and say that everyone with an income of £300 or more should pay for the education of their own children.  There is no Estimate that could not be cut down, but it would be very false economy.  Certain sums of money are necessary and the Minister has had the courage to look for them.  I hope he will realise them to the fullest and, please God, when we meet here in 12 months' time we will meet in more pleasant circumstances, to the extent that things will be going well and the Minister will not have to dig so deeply into our pockets.</P>

      <P>When this Appropriation Bill appeared this year, it occurred to me that the Seanad is given the opportunity of discussing a very wide field of subjects&mdash;in fact, the whole <Col N="1942" /> system of Government and the actions of the Government&mdash;and I felt myself asking what line the Seanad should take on an occasion like this.  From my experience of four years in the Seanad, I have come to the conclusion that for this Chamber to follow the lines adopted in the Dáil is somewhat futile, because the powers of the Dáil and the powers of this Chamber are totally different.  I feel that we should have a different approach in this House to Bills.  I am reinforced in that view by the fact that to-day we are faced with this Appropriation Bill, and we are asked to deal with it in one short session of a few hours.</P>
      <P>I would like to start at the beginning. In spite of Lecky's warning that no worse habit can be implanted in a nation than that of looking for prosperity to politics rather than to industry, people continue to look more and more to the State for the necessaries, amenities and luxuries of life.  When I say &ldquo;people&rdquo; I mean not only the people of this country but the people of every country in the world to-day and, of course, we are no exception. The result is that we see an ever-increasing encroachment of the State into all phases of our national life and into all phases even of the individual's life.  This process is carried on by a continuous flow of legislation in the forms of Bills presented to the Dáil and which eventually come to this House, giving more and more powers to the State, considerably adding to the numbers of people employed by the State and to the cost of running it.</P>
      <P>This trend towards ever-increasing State control and planning must be accepted as an accomplished fact.  It is of no use to rail and complain against it.  I have been one of the people who have been constantly complaining against this tendency, but I am a realist, I realise that nothing can be done to stop this trend nowadays.</P>
      <P>Most thinking people do regard this encroachment of the State more and more into the public and individual life with perturbation and apprehension, but I am afraid this phenomenon must be accepted; it is, apparently, inevitable and irresistible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> I think it is true to say that, individually, most citizens deplore this.  If one talks to any individual of any class or any degree of society one finds that they all deplore this tendency but, collectively, they do not seem to be able to do anything about it, and they seem to acquiesce in a sort of fatalistic manner in this pheonomenon.</P>
    <P>The movement is there and it is a fast movement and a strong movement. It is so fast and so strong that little seems to be done about it.  We have the warnings and protests of social thinkers, particularly of the Churches, constantly talking about this matter, but very little notice is taken of it.  I suggest that we should be realistic about the matter and, instead of just talking against it and objecting to it privately, we should sit down and see what can we in Ireland do about the whole thing.</P>
    <P>I feel that what we could do is: we can accept the fact that people nowadays seem to accept that the State is going to do more and more in the individual and the national life, and we should try to see in what way we can harness that movement and control it and bring to bear our Christian outlook on life upon this strength and power of the State.  I believe that we can evolve a policy that will satisfy both the State-minded people and the people who feel that the protagonists of individual liberty should have control over the State's actions.</P>
    <P>The first thing I would suggest is that the State should take into its confidence the representative and vocational bodies and the people who are concerned with and affected by legislation.  We have in this country very fine representatives of education, people who are interested in education, representing both the parents and the teachers.  We have in all phases of the national life such representative bodies.  We have representatives of the doctors.  We have agricultural and industrial organisations of all kinds.  All these can be called into consultation by the State and by Ministers when they are about to enact legislation affecting these particular forms of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> I can say, and I think the House will agree, that our experience in this State in the past has been that where Ministers and Governments have consulted the representative bodies in the preliminary stages of legislation we have had quite satisfactory results, not only to the people concerned but to the nation generally.  It will be agreed that where the State consulted the trades unions' and the employers' organisations in connection, for instance, with the Trade Union Act and the Industrial Relations Act, the Acts have worked comparatively well and have had the co-operation of the people they affected and the people whose advice was sought early on.  On the other hand there have been cases, not only under this Government but under the other Government, when proper consultation was not entered into at the preliminary stages, where there were sometimes very fatal results.  Things were done that were unworkable and unpractical and which caused more harm than good by their enactment.</P>
    <P>At the moment certain legislation has been introduced in which my own particular interests are concerned&mdash;the Restrictive Practices Bill.  A Bill of that kind can be made acceptable to all if proper preparations are made beforehand; if it is properly handled in the preliminary stages and will have the co-operation of all.  Otherwise it may only be a menace.</P>
    <P>The difficulty at present is that, where Bills are conceived and drawn up in a purely political atmosphere, that is, where they are brought in by a Government which is a political Party or dominated by a political Party, when they are introduced into the Oireachtas, it is impossible to effect any major alterations because any alterations, however necessary, involve loss of prestige to the Government and very often the Government knows in its heart that a Bill is not right and that certain things in it are not right but they dare not withdraw because it would involve loss of face.  That is wrong because legislation does not involve only the particular Government at the particular time.  It will go into <Col N="1945" /> our code of laws for all time and, if it is bad law at the beginning, it will be bad law for ever.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is about time that we set about thinking seriously in a long-term manner.  Therefore, I suggest that it is obvious that we should set about devising some means of examining thoroughly our legislative actions, always having regard to their long-term effects.  At present, we know that much of the legislation that is introduced is of a short-term nature.  It is sometimes on a year to year basis, very often on just an election to election basis and very often with an eye to the next election.  Bills are prepared hurriedly and they are passed in a highly-charged political atmosphere. Moreover, there always seems to be hurry and speed in the putting of these Bills through the Oireachtas.  This speed is bad enough in the Dáil, but it is much worse in this House.  Here it is merely a matter of having time for a few cursory remarks about these important Bills.  As I said already, we must remember that the legislation which we are hurrying through in this manner is legislation for all time. Extreme powers have been taken which may have immediate beneficial and justifiable uses.  However, later on they may prove to be of a most dangerous character.  We are all familiar with the spectacle of Ministers coming in here asking for the most dictatorial powers.  We are told that the present Minister for Finance, or whoever may happen to be the Minister in question, is a decent man and that we can rely on him.  However true that may be we cannot always rely on the future Ministers charged with these particular powers.  They can very easily compromise in the future the liberties and rights of our citizens.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest here a few lines worthy of examination in dealing with this whole problem?  I would suggest, first of all, as I have done already, that Governments should make better use of representative bodies and individuals when bringing in and framing legislation.  Secondly, I would suggest that a better use could be made of the Seanad.  As regards representative bodies and individuals, these already <Col N="1946" /> exist here in sufficient numbers, and they are sufficiently expert to give any advice and help that the Government may need.  We have agricultural bodies, trade bodies, associations of doctors, lawyers, teachers, trades unions and employers.  We have all these bodies and representative individuals competent and ready to help. There is no reason why we should not make use of them.</P>
    <P>The Seanad itself can serve a very useful and distinct function from the Dáil in the purifying and improving of legislation.  I think this is a matter that is engaging public attention, and that we should not ignore it.  I feel that every member of the Seanad is conscientious and anxious to make his contribution to the national life.  It is a pity we are not allowed to do so to the fullest extent of our powers.  There are many criticisms of this Chamber to-day, but the criticism is not against the idea of the Seanad as a second Chamber&mdash;but against the manner in which its functions are being carried out.  The Seanad has little or no control over Bills and legislation, especially, the way matters are being conducted and the way voting is being carried out in this House.  It is a purely mechanical form of voting.  The questions at issue are not really the points that matter when a vote is called here.  It is merely a matter of the side on which you have been lined up.  I suggest that this is not a right approach for a second revising Chamber.  We do not want to be regimented to one side or the other.</P>
    <P>The fact is, and we must face the matter frankly, that the Seanad is merely a rubber stamp for the Government of the day rather than being a Chamber composed of persons&mdash;as far as the Constitution predicates&mdash;with specialised qualifications, whose experience would fully qualify them to take the broad outlook on public affairs for which their experience and knowledge befit them.  They are able to carry out a more objective examination of political policy than is possible in the Dáil where Parties must be regimented and lined up on one side or the other. When the Seanad finds itself dealing with the Bills on exactly the same lines <Col N="1947" /> pursued in the Dáil, it becomes a &ldquo;mere shadow&rdquo; of the Dáil, and it is merely a waste of time and energy for its members, and a waste of the nation's money.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is a very important function which could and should be performed by the Seanad, namely, the examination of legislation by a Seanad composed of persons elected for their responsibility and distinction in their own particular avocations in an atmosphere of calm deliberation&mdash; one in which basic principles and long-term policies would have a primary place.  The present system of election to the Seanad indicates that it was intended to contribute a more objective type of examination of legislation than is possible in the Dáil.  As we are a vocationally elected body this examination could be one based on the vocational and specialist qualifications of the Senators.  If this Chamber is to fulfil a separate function and a function differing from that of the Dáil, it would be necessary for Ministers of State to come to the House with a more receptive and inquiring attitude. At present, the Seanad has no duty except to say: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and the quicker we say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; the better the Minister likes it.</P>
    <P>The Seanad can be good, and it is, I believe, vitally necessary to satisfactory democratic Government.  The Dáil is elected on general issues, and many electors who might vote for a Dáil candidate or a Party on such general issues might be strongly opposed to particular measures that a Government might put forward.  The function of the Seanad should be to protect the country against ill-prepared and faulty measures forced upon it by the Government majority in the Dáil. Vocational examination of Bills in the Seanad which does not prejudice the prestige of the Government would provide a means of rectifying and improving legislation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, if a Minister comes to this Assembly and, as a result of our debates here, realises that certain things should be changed, there should be no loss of prestige either for the <Col N="1948" /> Minister or his Government if he accepts them.  I think it would be a good day's work if the Minister came here and accepted some of our recommendations. If that were the case, it would be found in time that the Seanad would react to the situation in such a manner that we would put our best foot forward in order to improve the legislation brought before us.  I think we are big enough and nationally minded enough to do that.  I know that, for myself, I will always be prepared to suggest what I think is best for the country rather than what is best for the particular Party I support.  I feel that I will be backed by my own colleagues in this House in that particular view.</P>
    <P>One of the most glaring of the weaknesses of the growth of the present purely political atmosphere of the Seanad is that it leaves men elected here on a vocational vote from vocational bodies and from universities in a futile position.  They do not know whether they are to speak here from a vocational point of view or from a political one.  They are in a quandary to know on which side of the House they are supposed to be.  This makes a farce of the whole idea of vocationalism. I realise, of course, that if we have men here who are here purely because they are experts, I am realist enough to know that they might easily be very unpractical.  However, I suggest that it is possible to have a Chamber composed of experts who, at the same time, are politically educated, &mdash;who, so to speak, know the political facts of life.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to say the Seanad is nothing if it is not a consultative body and an advisory body.  It has got no other powers. Members of the Seanad have no real voting powers, no powers over money matters, as we have been reminded again here to-day.  Hence, if we are not a consultative and an advisory body, we are nothing.</P>
    <P>The Seanad, therefore, should be recognised for what it is and used for what it is.  It should act as a consultative and advisory body and should be accepted as such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> In order to safeguard against hurried and faulty legislation, which nowadays is the order of the day, more and more power being given to the State, I would suggest, first, that the Government should, as it has done in lots of cases in the past, consult in the early stages of the preparation of Bills with representative bodies, thereby linking the outer community concerned with the legislation of the State.  In the second place I suggest that a greater degree of consultation with the Seanad should be used.  Thirdly, I would suggest that there should be a greater degree of acceptance by the Minister of the Seanad's advice and guidance because of its specialised wisdom and experience.</P>
    <P>On this latter point it might be argued that a Bill coming from the Dáil bears the democratic imprint of that Assembly and that, therefore, no major changes should be made in the Seanad.  There is an idea that the Dáil is a sort of body that the Seanad should not dare interfere with, but I think that this argument ignores the fact that the Seanad is an integral part of the mechanism of our democratic legislation and government.  It has its place with the Dáil in passing legislation. It must furthermore be remembered that the Dáil itself has, of course, the final word in regard to the sanctioning of Bills, since they have got to go back to the Dáil from this House.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to say that every person, committee or assembly is ultimately judged by its own valuation of itself.  Instead of blaming Ministers or the Government in this matter the Seanad should take upon itself the role of trying to improve legislation and act as an advisory body and as a real, deliberative assembly.  If we only persist in that attitude I feel that Ministers and Governments will react.  They will realise that we are a body that can give real, constructive help in preparing legislation, improving Bills and in ensuring that we get a type of legislation on our Statute Books that will stand the test of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to <Col N="1950" /> delay the House long.  It is a remark by Senator P.F. O'Reilly that encouraged me to get up to make a point to the Minister.  Before doing so, however, I would like to say that I admire Senator McGuire's tenacity.  If I mistake not the Senator made the same points over the last couple of years. He preached the same gospel to the Ministers of the previous Government whom he himself supported.  He still preaches the same gospel.  While I do not disagree with much of what he said I must admire his tenacity, but with all due respect the greater portion of his speech had no relation to the Appropriation Bill.  However, that is beside the point.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly suggested that there should be a restriction on the import of luxury goods from hard currency countries.  I think we would all agree with that, but I would not like to specify the goods altogether as luxury goods.  We are importing goods other than luxury goods.  I have in mind American magazines and so-called American comics with which this country is being flooded.  Many people, who take an interest in the educational welfare of youth, are much perturbed at the amount of this stuff which is being imported.  Some of it is absolutely indecent.</P>
      <P>I understand that representations have been made to the Minister for Justice to see if some prohibition could be put into force against the importation of this stuff.  These things must be paid for with hard currency which we cannot afford to dissipate. We must be very careful of all our hard currency, and we ought not dissipate it on the importation of trash.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister for Finance should examine the position as to whether dollars are being spent on the importation of these magazines and so-called comic papers from America to the detriment not only of our national finances but to that of the youth of the country in the sense that the greater portion of these American magazines and comics is very harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.  Representations have been made to the Minister for Justice <Col N="1951" /> on the grounds that the greater portion of these magazines and comics is indecent. I am making the point that we cannot afford to waste one dollar. We ought to see that hard currency dollars are not made available for the importation of this stuff if we can do well enough without it.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the Appropriation Bill, the Seanad, I understand, gets one of its few opportunities of dealing with general matters of Government policy in relation to economics and finance.  I would like to join with other Senators in deprecating the fact that the Seanad should only be allowed a few hours at this late stage to initiate and partake in a debate dealing with matters of Government policy.  However, the position is that, as the Minister explained at the outset, it is essential this Bill should receive the sanction of the Seanad by to-morrow at the latest.  I think that most of us on this side of the House are willing to facilitate the Minister.  I hope that, when he is concluding this evening, he will be a little bit more expansive than he was while introducing the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like him, for instance, even at this late stage, to tell us whether he, the Minister for Finance, or the Tánaiste has won the tug-of-war regarding financial policy which has obviously been going on within the ranks of the present Government for the best part of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will remember that at the time the Minister for Finance published his notorious White Paper and at the time of the Central Bank Report, most thinking people in the country were seriously disturbed by the open cleavage demonstrated in the Dáil between the Minister for Finance on the one hand and the Tánaiste on the other.  Senators will remember that after the Central Bank Report had been published, after it had been used by the Minister for Finance and by the Government organ as a weapon with which to beat their opponents. the Tánaiste went into the Dáil and completely threw overboard the Central Bank Report and, despite the fact that the Minister for Finance was <Col N="1952" /> sitting beside him, announced that as far as the present Government were concerned their policy would be diametrically opposed to the recommendations in the Central Bank Report.  I have not got the Dáil Debates here, and I do not claim to quote the Tánaiste, but I do not think the Minister for Finance will contradict me.  It is definitely on record in the Dáil Debates that the Tánaiste made it quite clear&mdash;and he was talking as Tánaiste for the Government&mdash; that the Government were not accepting the recommendations of the Central Bank Report, and that their policy was to be diametrically opposed to the recommendations made in that report.</P>
    <P>That was the voice of one Minister, a responsible Minister in the Government&mdash;the Tánaiste.  The Minister for Finance kept very silent during that discussion regarding the Central Bank Report.  But the extraordinary thing about it is that ever since that report was thrown overboard by the Tánaiste each and every one of the main recommendations made in the report has been implemented by the Minister for Finance.  There is a clash there between the two Ministers.  The Tánaiste was more vocal.  The Tánaiste was the man who was most emphatic in giving his views to the Dáil and to the public.  For once the Minister for Finance was silent.  But the Minister for Finance is coming out as the strong man.  He is coming out as the winner, as the man who was able to pull more weight in this tug-of-war.</P>
    <P>That was some months ago.  Then the Budget was introduced and we heard the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance.  All of us will remember the main features of that statement.  Again, I do not pretend to quote the Minister.  But will any of us question the fact that in his Budget statement the Minister was making the point that it was necessary for the people of this country to save?  He was to assist them to spend less money, to live less well, not to eat as much and not to drink as much by ensuring that they had less money in their pockets to <Col N="1953" /> spend on eating and drinking or on living well.  To that end he intended to abolish the food subsidies, or at any rate practically reduce them.  Over and above all that assistance which was to be given to the people by the Government, the Minister made an appeal in his Budget statement to the people to save at least 10 per cent. over and above the money he proposed to take out of their pockets.</P>
    <P>Only three or four weeks ago I was present at a function attended by the Tánaiste and the Tánaiste was publicised widely in the newspapers. What had the Tánaiste to say at this function organised by the Drapers' Chamber of Commerce?  The Tánaiste's message to the people was: &ldquo;Do not save; now is the time to spend.  Do not think that prices will come down.  If you have money to spend, spend it and spend it now.&rdquo; The Minister for Finance tells the people that they are to save; the Tánaiste tells the people that they are to spend.  I want to ask the Minister at the end of this parliamentary session will he tell the Seanad at this stage who is the winner.  Whom are we to believe?  Are we to place any reliance on the deputy chief of the Government when he tells the people to spend or are we to heed the Minister for Finance when he tells the people to save?  Are we to believe the deputy head of the Government when he says that this Government will have nothing to do with the Central Bank Report or the recommendations of that report, or are we to heed, as we are forced to heed, the Minister for Finance when he implements those recommendations one by one?</P>
    <P>Senators will remember what the main recommendations of that report were.  There was to be a restriction of bank credit.  All of us know that such a restriction has been in force, has been imposed on traders and businessmen, not alone in the City of Dublin, but throughout the country for the last six or nine months.  According to the Central Bank Report subsidies were to go.  The Tánaiste said that the Government would not pay any attention, that <Col N="1954" /> their policy was to be diametrically opposed to the recommendations in the Central Bank Report.  The Minister for Finance was silenced, but subsidies are gone or are going.</P>

      <P>That was not what the Tánaiste said.  Apparently this Senator is with the Minister for Finance.  It is interesting to see the line-up.  That is what I want to get clear.  We remember other recommendations in that report.  One was in criticism of the land rehabilitation scheme.  The Tánaiste said: &ldquo;We are paying no attention; our policy is diametrically opposed to these recommendations.&rdquo; Was it not a fair assumption from that statement that the Government, instead of cutting down on the land rehabilitation scheme as proposed by the Central Bank, would continue it in force in all its vigour and would expand and increase it? But, no; the Tánaiste says one thing and the Minister for Finance then cuts down on the land rehabilitation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other recommendations in that report and I am firmly convinced that they are in the process of implementation at the moment.  They will have even more serious repercussions on the lives of the ordinary people, particularly the working people in Dublin City.  I do not want to wrong the authors of the Central Bank Report.  It was not a recommendation, but it was at least a viewing with complacency of the idea of creating an unemployment pool in this country. Again, I do not claim to quote the actual words used, but I am clear in my own mind from the particular paragraph in question in the Central Bank Report that there was a most complacent attitude to the idea of an unemployment pool being created.  That unemployment pool has been created and is growing larger and larger I assert because the Minister for Finance is implementing one by one the recommendations made in the Central Bank Report.  I would be glad if the Minister would either tell this House honestly that whatever squabbles there were between himself and the Tánaiste in the past are over, that he has won outright, <Col N="1955" /> that the Tánaiste has been routed in this battle of finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Suggestions have been made by Senator Hartnett that there is something unfair in a Senator or a Deputy saying that the bill is too high unless he is able to give chapter and verse for the economies which could be made.  I remember, as a <Col N="1956" /> member of the other House, making a somewhat similar point myself when the present Minister for Finance was in opposition, and I remember the reply I got from the present Minister for Finance and his colleagues was: &ldquo;You are the people in charge now; you are the people responsible for making economies and for cutting down the bill.&rdquo;  I want to make the same reply to Senator Hartnett this evening. Senator Hartnett, and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party or supporting it, are the people who are now responsible for presenting the bill, who are responsible for paring down the bill, who are responsible for making economies if the bill is too high, and there seems to be general agreement&mdash; Senator Hartney was one who agreed&mdash; that the bill is particularly high this year.</P>
      <P>There are certain ways in which moneys can be found and in which economies can be effected.  I have never agreed, and I do not yet agree, that there is any necessity for expanding the Army or for spending more and more money on the Department of Defence.  I have no hesitation in saying that I disagree with the policy of the present Government in that matter. I believe that as much as £1,000,000 could be saved in the Department of Defence.  I believe also that there was never any justification, other than the desire to honour a sordid bargain, for removing the dance tax under the Budget.  I believe that the money which the Government would have secured in the course of the year from the dance tax would go a long way towards meeting the grievances of the people to whom Senator Douglas and Senator Hartnett referred in the course of their contributions to this discussion. I would recommend to the Minister, even at this stage, to consider giving a helping hand to those people, to consider listening to the pleas of people like Senator Douglas and Senator Hartnett rather than to be concerned with honouring a bargain made with the dance hall proprietors, a bargain made by the man with whom the present Minister appears to have so many squabbles, the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to a matter introduced by Senator Hartnett <Col N="1957" />&mdash;that is in relation to the White Paper published by the Department of Health. I have not had time to give this document very close study but it does appear to me from reading over the document once, as I say without studying it, to be a worth-while production. Certainly it does appear to be a very much more realistic approach to this matter than the approach made by a former Minister for Health who published circulars dealing with health services and promising, for instance, the free care of children's health up to the age of 16 years.  It is a more realistic approach because of what appears in paragraph 38 of the White Paper and because the Government do point out to the people that these proposals are going to come into effect only very, very gradually.  Section 38 of the White Paper points out that the full additional benefits proposed in the scheme can be made available gradually only.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The enactment of legislation, the recruitment of staff, the provision of clinic buildings and other facilities are steps which must be undertaken before the full services can be made available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that is demonstrably true. I think that that paragraph speaks for itself and exposes to a very great extent all the bluff which caused such a furore regarding our health services a little over 12 months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will not be altogether on the lines of the speeches made by other Senators on either side of the House. I should like to avail of the opportunity which this Bill affords to appeal to the Minister, or at least through him to his colleagues in the Cabinet, notably the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Health, to be a little more co-operative with the representations made by local bodies in matters of local administration.  At the present time in Mayo, and I suppose the same applies to several other counties, huge expensive schemes in the way of water supplies and sewerage schemes are being carried out.  I am not satisfied, and neither is the general public, that value is being obtained for the money spent on these <Col N="1958" /> schemes.  On more occasions than one, it has been pointed out to me that work done 40 or 50 years ago, when piped water was first introduced to some of the larger towns in the west, showed evidence of far better workmanship, far more attention to detail, and much more careful supervision than at the present time, when we have a horde of officials, architects, consulting engineers, clerks of works, etc., employed.  I myself have seen, within the past few months, pipes set in a water installation scheme, removed because they were defective, before the scheme had come into operation at all.  Times out of number attention has been drawn to this matter by local councils, and we feel that if our officials, the local survey staff of the county, were allowed to supervise these works, far more successful and effective work would be done.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw attention.  The Local Government Department at the present time seems to have a mania for the appointment of new officials.  If any improvement is indicated as being necessary in any of the county institutions and the local body meets and goes into the matter and makes a report to the Minister, on the character of the building to be carried out, that report is turned down.  You have to employ an architect to draw up the scheme, to write up the specification and generally to supervise the work. Within the last three or four weeks a case arose in which an effort was made by the local body to provide accommodation for 34 nurses attached to the county hospital, who have to board outside.  When the council met, and was anxious to put up an annexe to the county hospital, it was informed by the Department of Local Government that an architect would have to be employed.  We adopted that view.  The architect was employed and planned a very nice scheme to provide accommodation for the 34 nurses in a building which was estimated to cost £34,000 to start with.</P>

    <P>I assure the Seanad that these are matters which have given a headache to the local bodies.  There is no question of political divisions on them.  As <Col N="1959" /> far as Mayo is concerned they are the concern of every party and section. The whole council is united in trying not so much to get the Department to see sense as to make them understand that the people living on the spot understand matters of this particular kind, and ought to have their views respected.  I know several engineers who have retired on pension, and who, at the present time, are lucratively employed in drawing plans for new buildings, for the first-class houses that are being put up throughout the country.  At the same time, they would not be allowed to co-operate with the local bodies, their employers, in drawing up plans for the building of labourers' cottages and for supervising the building of them, or for the building of additions to county institutions and so on.  The position is that all that must be left to an outside official.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with which the Department of Local Government has turned down suggestions put forward by Mayo County Council.  I refer to the provision of the new service&mdash;fire-fighting services.  I happened to be chairman of the county council when that matter came before us two years ago.  I was quite familiar with the excellent work that had been done by the county surveyor and his staff during the emergency when they organised and supervised fire-fighting services throughout the county.  They are the people who could do that because they have contacts throughout the different parts of the County Mayo which, as Senators know, is one of the largest counties in Ireland.  When this matter came before the county council, I had a discussion with the county surveyor during the adjournment for lunch.  I asked him if he would be prepared to take on that service.  He said: &ldquo;I certainly would like to&rdquo;.  It was agreed by the county council that the county surveyor should look after that particular service, but the provision of that fire-fighting service on those lines has been turned down by the Department. I put this to the Seanad: If the county engineer and his staff are not capable of organising an efficient fire-fighting service, how in the name <Col N="1960" /> of Providence could a stranger, appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners, do so?  We all know that, coming into the county as a stranger, he would first of all have to start to organise the service.  That would mean more than one appointment, because he would require staff. That would mean an expensive fire-fighting service which would not be nearly as efficient&mdash;we are all agreed on that in County Mayo&mdash;as a service which would be looked after by our own engineering staff, the members of which have their contacts right through the county.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  On a previous occasion I commented on the question of the medical inspection of schoolchildren.  In the initial stage that inspection is certainly carried out in a thorough and efficient manner by the county medical officer of health, but it ends there.  He prepares a history sheet for every child examined. He never sees any of those children again.  He can seldom visit a school more than once in five years.  Some time ago the local body decided that the dispensary doctors throughout the county could effectively co-operate with the county medical officer of health in looking after the children who needed care as a result of his inspection; care in regard to their eyes or any other defect.  Though a scheme was drawn up under which the dispensary doctors would be paid on a capitation basis&mdash;they were prepared to co-operate and visit each school at least once a year and attend to those cases which needed special attention&mdash; so far nothing further has been done.</P>
    <P>I understand that in some places where part of the inspection is concerned with eye-testing and attention to defective vision some amusing incidents have taken place.  They would hardly be credible here in Dublin, but the fact is that infants in schools have been examined for defective vision and have been provided with glasses which they did not need, because it was not their vision that was defective but their knowledge.  Senators are aware of the requirements of the Department of Education at the present time.  These definitely provide that the babies or the <Col N="1961" /> infants in schools are not to hear any word of English from the day they enter the school until they leave it. They are taught word-building and everything else through Irish.  When the medical officer or the optician visits the school and puts up his chart, which is in English characters, the children do not know what they are being asked, and are supplied with glasses, not because their vision is defective but because their knowledge is.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to draw the attention of the Minister to some of these matters.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I would like to refer to.  Last year, when the Minister was replying to the various points raised in the debate here, he referred in a rather critical manner, and perhaps from his point of view deservedly so, to the fact that the previous Government, during their three years in power, allowed over 250,000 tons of cement into the country that could have been manufactured here and sold at a cheaper price.  I, personally, am anxious to know whether that position has been improved during the past year, and how the cement situation is now.</P>
    <P>These are the few remarks that I have to make on the Bill.  I sincerely hope, as a result of what I have said about the necessity for more understanding between the Department of Local Government and the different counties throughout the country that it will pay more attention to the representations which are sent up to it from the local bodies.  They are in close touch with the people and have a very intimate knowledge of the services which they are administering and, therefore, know or should know what they are talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally agreed that the sum which we are being asked to vote under this Bill is a very heavy one.  It is further agreed, I think, by all Parties that the best way to meet the bill is by increased agricultural production. Senator O'Reilly, on the other side, advised us that this was a House in which to talk politics, and that it was sheer nonsense to talk anything else. Senator McGuire took the opposite <Col N="1962" /> view.  I am inclined to agree with Senator McGuire.  I think that this House could be very useful, indeed, and that the more it avoided politics the more it could do.  The few remarks which I have to make concern how we can increase agricultural production. The greatest asset we have in this country is the sugar beet industry.  It is valuable from many points of view. It gives very considerable employment. It is very useful to the tillage farmer who grows beet.  Molasses, beet pulp and beet tops are very valuable for feeding animals when winter feeding is very scarce.  At a time like this, when the importation of foods and cereals is difficult and very dear it is a pity that the sugar beet industry is not supported by everybody.  Remarks have been made from time to time by people in high places about the sugar beet industry but I think that it is a very good industry.  We could grow one and a half times the amount of beet we grow if everybody put a shoulder to the wheel and helped along with the industry.</P>
      <P>Every effort should be made to increase the cattle population.  The dairy cow is the foundation of the cattle industry.  Everything should be done to improve the quality of the dairy cow.  High-class bulls have been imported recently and cow-testing is very important to ascertain whether these high-class animals are producing the type of cow required.  We want the dual purpose animal.  We want the animal which will give us a reasonable supply of milk and a good carcase of beef.  The development of cow-testing is important and the Minister might direct his attention to that matter.</P>
      <P>Tillage and mixed farming is, generally speaking, the best policy for this country.  A great many people prefer grassland; it is easier.  It is a pity that the farmers who keep grassland do not put it to better use.  I believe that the liming, manuring and reseeding of our grassland would have the effect of easily doubling the live-stock population of our country.  That would be a valuable achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hartney made a very good point in connection with increased agricultural production when he said that it would have to come from the big <Col N="1963" /> farmers.  It is difficult to get it except by compulsion, and that would be a very unpopular thing in this country. However, there are ways by which it could be achieved.  An increased allowance could be given to farmers employing labour.  At present the allowance is about £6 10s. per worker off the poor law valuation.  That allowance could be doubled.  In that way farmers who employ little labour would be induced to increase it.</P>
    <P>Soil analysis was discussed.  I am not entirely in agreement with Senator Baxter's viewpoint that the credit for soil research in this country must go to one man.  That statement is hardly correct because before the man mentioned by Senator Baxter entered public life I had the soil of my farm tested and several speeches were made on the matter of soil research before the gentleman mentioned by Senator Baxter ever spoke of it in public.  The then Minister ought to be thanked for the work done in connection with that research station.  It is doing very useful work for the farmers.  They are informed of the deficiencies of their farms and of the economic ways to put the matter right.</P>
    <P>Very little work is being done by private landowners in connection with forestry.  All the planting is being done by the State.  If private landowners could have the advice and help of an expert from the Forestry Department, and pay him for it, it would help them to do some planting.  Needless to say, that would be a step in the right direction.  Landowners have not the experience, the skill or the tradition required in connection with reafforestation. If they could get some help, such as that which I have suggested, it might prove very useful indeed.</P>
    <P>I have spoken before in this House about the distribution of petrol.  There are many rural areas where it is impossible to get a petrol pump although it would be very useful to have one.  The petrol companies and the retailers are barring the way.  They are preventing a better distribution of petrol.  That means that, in remote districts, people often have to travel five, ten or 15 miles for petrol before they can start <Col N="1964" /> their day's work.  That matter ought to be looked into with a view to ensuring that there is no racket.</P>
    <P>The harvest is about due now.  In my locality the general view is that, as there is a considerable quantity of oats in the millers' and farmers' lofts, there is great danger that there will not be a good demand for oats and feeding barley.  If that view is correct, then action should be taken about the matter now.  If there is no market for the grain which is harvested it will mean a considerable set-back in tillage for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture talked about the eradication of tuberculosis. That is very important.  He should go ahead with that work as soon as he can find the finances for it.  I think it could be done very well at this particular moment when the price of beef is better than the price of dairy animals.  I think much money would not be lost in the transaction and that it would be very useful work.  We are spending a lot of money erecting sanatoria but we are doing nothing about eradicating tuberculosis in cattle.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke made a plea for the retention of the horse.  I entirely agree with him.  I understand that 700 horses a week leave this country and that three or four horses in a particular district have to go when a tractor comes into that district.  We might find ourselves in an awkward position if we had no horses and if Joe Stalin decided to take a certain line of action. In that connection also I think we should keep big stocks of oil in the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Hartney referred to the farm improvements scheme and contrasted it with the land rehabilitation scheme.  I am inclined to accept his view.  The farm improvements scheme helped those who helped themselves.  If the farm improvements scheme were extended in scope to three or four times its magnitude I think that generally it would be a better scheme for the country and the agricultural community than the land rehabilitation scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been rather astonished at the attitude which has been taken up here by a number of Senators.  There have been complaints &mdash;and I will admit at once the complaints are well-founded&mdash;that the Seanad is presented with this Bill at a very late hour, in what may be described as the first third of the year.  We are within a few days of the period when the money already granted by Dáil Éireann for the maintenance of the public services will be exhausted.  If the Seanad were to hold up this Bill and if the moneys provided under the Vote on Account and the issue which was authorised by the Central Fund Bill from the Exchequer were to be exhausted and that authority were to be spent we would be in the position then in which our public services would have to close down because there would be no authority to spend any money on them.  On behalf of the Government I must disclaim any responsibility for that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We endeavoured to have the Estimates for the public services passed by Dail Éireann and this Bill disposed of by Dáil Éireann in sufficient time to permit the Seanad to consider it during the 21 days within which, under the Constitution, the Seanad may consider Money Bills and return them with such recommendations as the Seanad may care to make to Dáil Éireann.  Unfortunately neither the wishes nor the desire of the Government in this regard were effective, with the result that the <Col N="1968" /> Seanad, as several Senators have rightfully complained, is presented with the dilemma that they must either dispose of this Bill after a somewhat cursory debate or by insistence on its constitutional prerogative allow the public services to close down.  I can readily concede to all those Senators who have been critical of the position in which they find themselves that they have every ground for complaint but the complaint, as I have already said, should not be directed against the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the present Government created the tradition when they were in opposition.  I know they did because I was here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Two wrongs, as the Senator is no doubt aware, do not make a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was another attitude adopted by some Senators which somewhat surprised me.  I would have thought that in the limited time the Seanad had at its disposal Senators would in general have welcomed the fact that I made a very brief statement when introducing the Bill, but, brief though that statement was, it was an all-embracing and a comprehensive one and a quite sufficient explanation of the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell was one of those who were most critical.  He, and I think Senator P.F. O'Reilly, seemed to feel sorry that I had not occupied at least two hours, if not two days, of the Seanad's time in explaining in detail the purpose for which this money is required. Senator O'Donnell said that this was the most important occasion upon which the Seanad met to discuss public business.  Naturally I do not wish to put myself in the position of the Senator in a matter of this kind, and I would not venture to try to adjudge its importance in his view or to relate the importance for him of one occasion to another.  I should have thought that, so far as financial business is concerned, there are two more important occasions upon which the Seanad can discuss public business, namely, when <Col N="1969" /> the Central Fund Bill comes before the Seanad, because the Central Fund Bill, as Senators know, embodies the proposal which Dáil Éireann has already adopted in relation to the granting of a Vote on Account to enable the public services to be carried on until such time as the Estimates have been discussed in detail and the necessary financial provision has been made to provide the moneys essential for the carrying on of the public services.</P>
    <P>The Central Fund Bill is the first opportunity the Seanad has of considering in a general way the proposals which the Government makes for the carrying on of the public services and the expenditure which the Government proposes to undertake in regard to those services.  The only prerogative which the Seanad has in relation to departmental Estimates is to consider them in a general way under the scope of the Central Fund Bill.  It is on that occasion, before the Dáil has debated the proposals in detail and has assented to them, that the Seanad can most usefully make suggestions for the consideration of the Government and of Dáil Éireann.  It is on that occasion that the Minister for Finance, who represents Dáil Éireann here and is responsible for putting the views of that Assembly before this House can, having heard the debate, most usefully go back and convey the suggestions which have been made to the Government. If the Government thinks well of those suggestions and thinks it wise ultimately to submit those suggestions to Dáil Éireann it can do so when Dáil Éireann, in the exercise of the prerogative preserved to it to grant money, is considering the Estimates themselves in detail.</P>
    <P>I use the word &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo;.  I want to make it quite clear that I use the word &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; because it is, I think, very difficult for the Seanad to make recommendations in regard to either the Appropriation Bill or the Central Fund Bill.  If the Seanad were to make a recommendation to the Central Fund Bill or to the Appropriation Bill that would undoubtedly necessitate a detailed debate on those items in the Estimates in relation to which the <Col N="1970" /> Seanad makes its recommendation and that would, in turn, entail such a user of parliamentary time that it is not unlikely that the statutory period of 21 days would have elapsed long before the debate had concluded and the Central Fund Bill would in the meantime have become law.</P>
    <P>The other occasion upon which the Seanad has a full opportunity of discussing the general financial policy of the Government is when the Finance Bill comes before it.  As the House knows, the Finance Bill is usually discussed at greater length in the Seanad than is any other measure.  It is discussed in detail and in the course of the debate on the Committee Stage of that Bill the Seanad has an opportunity, and sometimes avails of it, to make recommendations which naturally go back to Dáil Éireann and have subsequently to be considered there. These, I suggest, are the occasions upon which a more detailed discussion than has taken place here to-day can usually be embarked upon.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Bill comes to the Seanad after Dáil Éireann has devoted a considerable time&mdash;months, in fact&mdash; to the discussion of the individual Estimates for the Public Services.  In the course of these debates, the Dáil takes the opportunity to consider and to criticise the administration of the public Departments.  It does that because, as I have said, it is the Dáil which has the prerogative of granting money for supply and it is to Dáil Éireann that the Government and Ministers as a whole are responsible under the Constitution for the administration of their Departments.  The debates on these Estimates extend over many months and, in general, they occupy the greater part of at least two bound volumes of the Dáil Debates.</P>
    <P>What sort of a situation would I be in if I were to come here, and, in my introductory remarks on a Bill of this kind, were to traverse the whole ground which has taken Dáil Éireann months to go over?  I should like to see the faces of some Senators if I began to open a marathon speech of that sort.  The first to complain would be some of the Senators who have been <Col N="1971" /> critical of the fact that I was commendably brief in my introductory remarks.  I was brief not out of any disrespect to the Seanad but rather out of regard for the fact that the Seanad had comparatively little time at its disposal and that, while it was unlikely that I would be able to deal in detail with any of the points which may be raised here, nevertheless the suggestions and criticisms which individual Senators wish to make would appear on the record and would ultimately be considered.  I trust, therefore, that this suggestion that the Government is treating the Seanad with any disregard for its constitutional position, or in any way endeavouring to minimise its position as a component part of the legislature, has been disposed of.</P>
    <P>I should not do it because I am not a member of the House, but I sometimes am annoyed by some suggestions I hear Senators making here from time to time about the Seanad being of no service, being a mere talking shop.  After all, what is a deliberative assembly except, in one sense, a talking shop?  Of course, it should be talk informed by thought and inspired by deep consideration of public issues, and when it is so informed and inspired there is no service being done either to the Seanad or to the legislature of this State, of which the Seanad is a component part, by using denigratory phrases of that sort. I am naturally jealous of the prerogatives of Dáil Éireann and I assume that Senators are jealous of the prerogatives of Seanad Éireann.  I want to make it clear that I do not desire to see the Seanad usurping the functions of the Dáil or the Dáil trying to override overthrow or whittle down the important functions of the Seanad.  I take pride in the fact that we have a second Chamber in our legislature.  I think I may say now that I was one of those who fought hardest for it and who recognise the great value of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad there is a different atmosphere and a different approach, and views are not held so stubbornly as in the Dáil.  There can be in the debate between Senators a real exchange of <Col N="1972" /> sentiment, to put it that way, an exchange of ideas which ultimately leads, and has led in many cases, as we all know, to very useful amendment of proposals from the other House.  I fought very hard to ensure that this House would have its full 21 days to consider this Bill.  I would have wished that the debate on it would have been fuller and I would have wished that we had had a longer debate on the matters raised by Senators like Senator Ruane, Senator Hartnett and others, who spoke on really important matters which it is useful for the Government to have discussed in the calmer and more sedate atmosphere of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I can say very much with regard to the general questions which have been raised.  I have been asked what I have to say about the general economic position.  I do not think we are out of the wood by any means but I think I can say that the balance of payments situation, which does reflect our general economic position, appears to be improving.  It has been suggested that the Budget has resulted in unemployment and slackness of trade.  I think the slackness of trade and the consequent unemployment this year is the natural sequel to anticipatory buying, to purchasing in advance of actual requirements, which was so pronounced a feature of the latter part of 1950 and the early part of 1951.</P>
    <P>We have been told by one Senator that we have reached the limit of Government spending and when I heard Senators say that I thought how tragic it is that the public should be deprived of the newspapers at this time.  They could interest themselves in reconciling the attitude of certain members of this House with the attitude of their comrades and particularly of the Leader of their Party in Dáil Éireann.  In Dáil Éireann, the Government has been criticised by colleagues of Senator Hayes in the Fine Gael Party for not spending enough.  In this House, we have been criticised on the ground that we are spending too much.  Every measure of social amelioration introduced since this Government took office has been criticised by the Opposition on the ground that the benefits proposed were <Col N="1973" /> insufficient, that is, that they did not cost enough.  It would be easier to square the circle than to demonstrate that there is any element of concord or concurrence of view between Fine Gael Senators and Fine Gael Deputies. I do not want to create a constitutional crisis between these two wings of the Fine Gael Party.  I shall leave them to reconcile their actions.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes did, however, say one thing which, I think, is worthy of note. He emphasised how much more political Parties in this country are agreed upon principles than Parties are elsewhere. I think that we may congratulate ourselves on that, but if we do, how much more must we commiserate with each other on the fact that these common principles seldom inform or shape our handling of public problems? If our State is to survive we must give more than lip service to these common principles.  When, for instance, they tell us that the weight of taxation, the burden of public expenditure, is more than the community can bear, then they should show their sincerity, I suggest, in that matter by opposing further spending and opposing it not merely by speeches but by votes, opposing it not merely in the safe security of this House but also under the spotlight of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>If there were a real live Opposition in favour of economy substantial economies, I think, might be secured, but what has been our experience?  The Government have sought to economise and their proposals have been bitterly attacked and misrepresented, as they were misrepresented here this evening by Senator O'Higgins when we were told that our remedy for the present economic situation was to make the people eat less and drink less.  When the Government took measures to balance the Budget and put the public finances in order their measures were opposed most strenuously by the Opposition. The same applies to the measures which were taken to deal with the heavy deficit in the balance of payments. We were told then that we were trying to reduce the standard of living, trying to make the people eat less, but <Col N="1974" /> this time in order that we might have a larger surplus to spend.</P>
    <P>Now the Government&mdash;and no Irishman, I think&mdash;wants to make the people eat less, but we want them to waste less, which is quite a different matter. We want to bring them back to the reality that the first charge on a man's earnings should be, not his needs in tobacco, whiskey, beer or petrol, but the provision of food and clothing for himself and his family.  That is one of the social principles on which the Budget which has now received the approval of those sections of the people to whom it was put was based.  If we could get real agreement on that principle, and if all Parties strove to give effect to it, then something positive would be achieved.  If we were all agreed that our Budgets must be balanced on the due dates every year, and that that balance must first be sought by using the sharp knife of economy, and that if that fails to give the required balance taxation must be imposed to secure that balance, then we would have achieved something signal indeed, but having regard to our experience this year, having regard to the long course of opposition which often degenerated into obstruction and which was responsible for the late presentation of the Bill to the Seanad, it appears to be futile to hope for it.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I should say regarding the questions raised in this debate.  I have been particularly gratified, however, at Senator Professor Johnston's speech.  Neither the Government nor Dáil Éireann can claim any merit for having regard to the historic place of Trinity in the Irish nation.  We all of us, I know, adopt, have adopted and are prepared to honour the pledge given by the seven signatories to the proclamation of 1916 that when the Irish State was established it would cherish all children of the nation alike.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed: to take the remaining stages now.</P>
    <P>Bill passed through Committee, reported without recommendation, received for final consideration and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>That, pursuant to sub-section (20) of Section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution Seanad Éireann concur with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Appropriation Bill, 1952, on a date which is earlier than the 5th day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.</P>

      <P>We agree to this motion for the reason given by the Minister for Finance, namely, that if the motion does not pass the money already provided by the Dáil and Seanad in the Central Fund Bill will be exhausted to-morrow, the last day <Col N="1976" /> of July, and that if we do not pass the Bill and the Resolution the public services will close down.  We would not like the public services to close down and therefore we agree with the Resolution. We would like to say, however, that that completely disproves the previous statement of the Minister that the Seanad cannot vote money.  That is precisely and exactly what the Seanad has now done.  Would you allow me to put on record disagreement with the Minister that the Seanad's function is to consider, in a general way, administration?  That is not admitted, but we do support the motion.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.10 p.m., <i>sine die.</i></P>
