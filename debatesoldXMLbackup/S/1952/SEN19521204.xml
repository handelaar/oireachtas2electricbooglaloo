      <P>Business will be taken as set out on the Order Paper, with this exception, that at four o'clock the debate on Motion No. 4 will be taken, as the Minister for Finance will be available then, and the debate on the motion will continue without interruption until seven o'clock.  In the event of the business interrupted at four o'clock continuing, it will be continued at seven o'clock until completed.  There will, therefore, be no tea interval this evening.  Items No. 5 and No. 6 on the Order Paper will not be taken.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend to the 31st March, 1953, the period within which the erection, enlargement or improvement of residences of certain types must be completed in order to qualify for the two-thirds remission of rates for five years provided by the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Acts, 1940 to 1951.  The remission in its present form dates from 1940. Senators are, therefore, well acquainted with it and I am sure they will agree to the proposal in the Bill now before the House.  There is no new principle in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This was a Private Member's Bill in the other House and all Stages occupied a little less than a column and a half of the Dáil Debates for 31st October, columns 838 and 839.  The purpose of the Bill, as explained there, was to put the joint burial boards in the position of sanitary authorities and give them power to acquire land compulsorily, presumably under the usual conditions which apply to local authorities getting lands.  The Bill was proposed by a Deputy representing County Dublin and he referred particularly to the Deans Grange Joint Burial Board.  The Minister for Local Government was in <Col N="165" /> complete agreement with the Bill, and it was also disclosed that officials of the Local Government Department had seen the Bill when drafted.</P>
      <P>It may be taken that the Bill was an unopposed measure in the other House. Care was taken in its drafting to see that the usual rules were observed.  I am not in agreement normally with the compulsory acquisition of land, but in the situation in which people find themselves with regard to burial grounds in County Dublin, one feels that position ought to exist with the usual safeguards.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holidays) Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I decided to promote this Bill, I bore in mind that the Oireachtas, by the Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holidays) Act, 1951, had already approved in principle of the granting of a weekly half-holiday to agricultural workers.  The Act of 1951, however, was not framed in a sufficiently clear and workable manner. A grave deficiency in it was that it conferred no power on the Agricultural Wages Board in regard to its enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I decided that the Wages Board should be made responsible for the administration of half-holiday legislation for agricultural workers, I examined the 1951 Act to see whether it would be possible to amend it, but I came to the conclusion, since it required so many amendments, that it would be far more satisfactory to <Col N="166" /> repeal it entirely and replace it by a new Act.</P>
    <P>An important new provision in this Bill is a provision similar to those already contained in the Agricultural Wages Acts and the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, 1950, whereby officers of the Wages Board may take proceedings on behalf of a worker who has been underpaid or not paid at all in respect of work done on the half-day.</P>
    <P>Another very important provision in this Bill is the requirement in Section 6 that before a worker is entitled to a half-holiday he shall have completed 45 hours' work in the five weekdays preceding the day on which the half-holiday is to be allowed.</P>
    <P>I am retaining in the Bill the principle already in the 1951 Act that the worker may, if he wishes and with his employer's consent, remain at work on the half-day provided the employer pays him at a rate not less than a rate to be prescribed by the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    <P>The Bill which I am now placing before the Seanad is substantially the same as that which I introduced in the other House.  A couple of amendments were made in the other House. At the end of Section 4 some words were added to the effect that if the employer and worker do not agree on a day for the half-holiday and if the employer does not fix a day, then the day shall be deemed to be Wednesday.  This amendment has not at all the intention of prescribing Wednesday generally as the half-day.  The employer and worker are free to agree on any day of the week for the half-day and failing agreement the employer may fix any day he wishes for the half-day. I also accepted in the Bill an amendment to the effect that officers of the Wages Board would have the same powers in regard to this Act as they already have under the Agricultural Wages Acts.</P>
    <P>Following representations made to me in the Dáil I intend to introduce in this House an amendment to Section 6 of the Bill which will provide that a Church holiday on which the worker does not work will, for the purposes of that section, be regarded as nine hours' work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> This Bill does not deal with pay for agricultural workers but the Seanad will notice that Section 13 of the Bill requires the Agricultural Wages Board to act with due regard to the provisions of the Act.  At present the board's minimum wage for a man engaged on a weekly contract is based on 54 hours' work.  The board is an autonomous body, but it will no doubt, when this Act becomes law, set about rearranging the minimum wage regulations so as to provide that the minimum rate will be based on a week of 50 hours' work, with overtime payable for any work in excess of 50 hours.</P>
    <P>I think if Senators bear this in mind it will help to prevent any confusion that might otherwise arise in regard to the Bill.  I commend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal has been said on this particular topic previously. This Bill should be a welcome measure.  It is at any rate a workable measure.  It must be clear to anybody with a knowledge of conditions in the country that the agricultural labourer is a skilled worker.  It always struck me as inequitable and bad for the country generally that such a man is expected to do work, at which he must be skilled, under worse conditions and for worse pay than apply in the big factories.  The agricultural labourer must learn his work in different conditions from the apprentice in industry. He is a person who has to know not only everything about crops, but also about animals, and his work varies with the season.  He has to apply a personal interest to his work, and in comparison with others he is not proportionately remunerated.  I think his case should be recognised in the community, and in the circumstances no matter what particular difficulties may appear every effort should be made to obtain goodwill in solving those difficulties, and to give him his half-holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once you have a situation where a half-holiday is universal in town work, and where in agricultural work it is universal in England, then we cannot possibly avoid a measure such as this <Col N="168" /> here.  I would entirely agree with the Minister in the view he has taken up in the other House, namely, that we should not make in this Bill too many regulations, and endeavour to put too much into it&mdash;we should have regard to local conditions.  We should seek to have co-operation between the labourer and the employer with regard to a half-holiday, so that it could be suited to local conditions.</P>
    <P>I would like to express the hope that this measure will work and to say that I believe it will be welcomed by a great many employers who were inclined at first to view it with misgiving. We should not try by rules or regulations to upset the personal relations which have existed between farmers and their labourers.  We should not try in this measure to dot the i's and cross the t's but rather should we leave it to be worked out on a basis of co-operation between the two parties. We should keep the personal relations between employers and the employees and not try to interfere with them by putting too many rules in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to express my amazement that the Minister for Agriculture has the hardihood to come to the Oireachtas with a measure of this sort.  I suppose the House itself will express its amazement that anyone has the hardihood to stand up here or in the other House and express dissent from the concepts indicated in this particular piece of legislation.  The Minister for Agriculture has a great responsibility to the country and he ought to take that responsibility seriously. It is vitally essential for the welfare of the whole community that nothing will be done that will hamper agriculture in the task that it has before it.  As I have said, this House will probably express amazement that anyone should disagree with the philosophy embodied in a measure of this sort.  Of course, in this pleasure-loving, leisure-loving city with its extremes of great wealth and great poverty on the part of the many, with its laziness and great industry on the part of a small section of the community, I know it is not easy to stand out and say that I believe that this is an entirely wrong approach to the solution <Col N="169" /> of our national problems as we see them to-day.  I would have thought that the purpose of any Minister for Agriculture in this country was first to stand over a policy which he was convinced was going to increase agricultural production, but how did the Minister think that this piece of legislation was going to make for increased productivity to-day?</P>
      <P>I have not taken the time to look up the statistics of how many agricultural workers we employ but it is perhaps in the region of 140,000 or 150,000.  I may be wrong but I have heard some such figure as that mentioned.  This half-holiday which is provided for in this measure means that for every one of those workers we are giving them at least one month's holidays in the year by providing for them a half-holiday per week.  That is 140,000 workers in the country will be taken away from agricultural production for one month in the year.  Does the Minister think that this is going to increase agricultural production in this country to-day and is that not the major problem before the people engaged in the agricultural industry? I suggest that as far as the agricultural workers of the country are concerned there was no demand whatever for this legislation.  It is a politically inspired Bill from the very beginning and I am sorry that the Minister for Agriculture has allowed himself to be drawn into this conspiracy against agriculture, for that is what it is meant to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know it is easy to label anyone speaking as I do as somebody backward, an obscurantist not prepared to face the present-day world and the tendency of the times.  I was amazed to hear my colleague Senator Hayes suggest that where you have a half-holiday for industrial workers and a half-holiday for agricultural workers England and the Six Counties it was inevitable that you should have a half-holiday for agricultural workers here.  As I say I do not believe there was any demand from the agricultural workers here for this legislation whatever. Is it to be suggested that because you have a certain type of social-legislation&mdash;I presume this will be called social legislation&mdash;in the Six <Col N="170" /> Counties and in Britain we must follow suit and implement here legislation with the same concept or philosophy? I wonder what some of my colleagues would say if we had a Bill introduced here on the lines of the White Paper on health when that comes around.  It would be easy to see what surprise it would cause if we were to have a Bill embodying some of the things from England in such legislation and that we should be expected to implement them <i>in toto.</i></P>
    <P>A vital fact is that agricultural production in this country is not increasing. It is not as high to-day as it was in 1939 and is not any greater than it was 50 years ago.  In face of such a situation, when, according to the Minister for Finance, we are unable to pay for all that we require to purchase abroad, there is enshrined in this measure the idea that the main producers of the commodities that have to be sold abroad and exchanged for the things that we require are to do less work than they have been doing.  The sooner the people face up to the realities of that situation the better.</P>
    <P>I feel as if I were standing on a mountain path in Spring with the melting snows coming down on top of me. The whole tendency is to drift along, accepting this idea as the right one, the best idea for society, for the human personality and the nation as a whole. I do not believe it; I do not accept it and I shall express my opinion about it as strongly as I can to-day.</P>
    <P>I cannot see progress or success for the people unless they are all prepared to work harder and longer than they are doing.  That goes for every field of activity, for agriculture as well as industry, professions, transport services and all the rest.  What is wrong with the country?  The people in this House and the other House are afraid of their lives&mdash;Ministers and others&mdash;to say that.  Occasionally you will get one Minister who will stand up and say that the people have to work harder and longer hours.  There is no city in Europe to-day where the unit of labour is producing less in the day than it is in the capital of our country.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that when I sit down there will be others who will tell us how well the farmers <Col N="171" /> are doing, of the high prices they are getting for all their produce, and who will bemoan the price the city person has to pay for it.  I wonder if any of them has tried to estimate how much more this type of legislation would cost them in their food.  If 140,000 people or 150,000 people on the land are to be idle, what about the eggs, butter, turkeys and pigs of which we are not producing enough to-day? Are we to adopt the policy of buying more from New Zealand, Canada and other countries?  When the city person tells us that butter is too dear he never dreams that he is raising the price by the philosophy he supports in legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>We are drifting away completely from fundamentals.  It may be that there were some of the Minister's colleagues who pushed him into this position but, frankly, I find it difficult to comprehend how a man who is charged with the responsibility of getting more from the land than we have been getting can stand over this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>Productivity of farms is not increasing. The number of people working on the land and continuing on the land is not increasing.  People are leaving the land of their own free will.  We cannot hold them.  We are going a step further.  We are legislating so that those who remain will work shorter hours than they have been working.  Is that the road to greater production, to a lowering of cost, to improved capacity to export in the years ahead?  I would like some of the people who are skilled in the handling of figures and who have a knowledge of economics to explain how it is going to be done.</P>
    <P>There is great tragedy behind all this.  I am at least as much concerned about the well-being of the agricultural labourer as anyone in this House.  I understand his plight, difficulties and problems as well as anyone in this House or in the Dáil.  I have spent too many days of my life beside him not to know what his life is like, what his work is like and the worth of his work both to the farmer who employs him and to the nation as a whole.  I <Col N="172" /> appreciate his skill and understanding. Although perhaps he may not have got an opportunity for education, he managed to extract from nature an immense store of knowledge that would be of great value to many of the people who pass for being very well educated in our country to-day.</P>
    <P>In my judgement, what the agricultural labourer wants is more wages, and what the country ought to be able to achieve for the agricultural labourer is a higher standard of living by paying him more wages.  Can that be done by reducing productivity on the farm where the labourer is employed?  I do not think it can.  It can be done in another way.  If we make these other people pay much more for their food than they are paying to-day, there will be more money in our pockets, and we will be able to share our store with the labourer.  But, if you ask the people to pay more than they are paying, they are all against it.</P>
    <P>The country cannot have it both ways.  It does not matter whether it is in agriculture or industry that our people are employed.  The truth is that at this moment our people are not working as hard as they require to work if the country is to be built up. We are not a patch on people in other countries in Europe.  That is all wrong. I do not think our economy can stand it.  It is a tragic confession of failure on the part of all the Ministers for Agriculture and on the part of the people that, even now, we have not raised agricultural production to the level of 1939 and that, in 50 years, we have done nothing to increase it.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do about it? This scheme is all against increasing agricultural production.  The people in the country know that very well.  The people in the country have adopted an almost fatalistic attitude about all this type of legislation.  They feel quite powerless.  They feel there is nothing they can do about it, that their leaders and many of their legislators have gone mad and that something will have to happen with regard to them before there is a change of policy or better understanding of the real problems of the country.</P>
    <P>That is not my view alone.  It is the <Col N="173" /> view of people who understand what is going on in the country.  I could appreciate this if we had reached maximum output, if we had more people on the land than were actually necessary for the type of work to be done, but that is not the position.  The Minister knows as well as I know that there is immense work to be done on every farm, that our potential production cannot be reached for very many years and can only be reached after long and arduous toil and good management on the part of the people who own the land and that it requires immense capital investment.  Despite that, the Minister brings in this Bill to cut the number of hours that men are expected to work in the week.</P>
    <P>I will make this concession, that there are farms where this provision need not make any great difference. Take the 300-acre farm or the 200-acre farm where the farmer would be paying income-tax.  He has six or seven men, and he has two or three cows to supply his needs in fresh milk.  He is highly mechanised, and if one man goes off on Wednesday, two on Thursday and two on Friday, he can carry on and this Bill will create no big problem for him.  On the other hand, take the thousands of small farms where there is only the owner and one man, with 12 or 13 cows, as in the case of neighbours on either side of my own farm.  I would like the Minister to tell me what is going to happen on those farms when the 13 cows have to be milked on a summer's evening, with hay down that should be put up into cocks or trams, when the farmer's man has gone off under the law and can tell the farmer to go to the dickens, that if he is not satisfied the man will not come back the next day.  The farmer trudges in at 8.30 at night to milk 12 cows.  How long will he carry on doing that?</P>
    <P>There is a way out and farmers will be compelled to find it.  If you reach the stage where the prices of certain products make them a luxury, as the turkeys were last year&mdash;they are not so much of a luxury this year&mdash;people will begin to complain.  There are others in the House, including men on the other side, who know well that what I say is true.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> A higher authority, who can be much more objective than any of us, addressed himself to this problem recently.  Most Reverend Dr. Kinane, Archbishop of Cashel, speaking at a Muintir na Tíre gathering in Thurles about the disinclination of people to remain on the land, went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a result of this disinclination, life on the farm now is beset with difficulties, and that is accentuated in dairying districts by the unsuitable working hours, which have resulted from State interference in this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is not that true?  Does not the Minister himself know that in his own constituency it is true?  Of course it is.</P>
    <P>I regard this decision of the Minister as a very grave one.  He has introduced this Bill as the instrument of the Government, and that indicates a concept in his mind and in the Department which, in my judgement, is altogether foreign to the point of view that ought to be held by a responsible Minister charged with getting the most out of agriculture by placing at the disposal of those engaged in that industry the facilities which they expect to get from him.</P>
    <P>I am always puzzled when I hear talk about holidays and leisure, when I read the views of people who plan how leisure should be spent&mdash;in a world where there is not half enough to eat or drink, where so many millions of hours are spent day after day in the production of means of destruction, that have to be stored away, that no one can eat or drink.  One would imagine it would be our policy to plan to keep our people working in those other fields and occupations which will provide the necessities for the people. We are following the stream, and I think it is wrong.</P>
    <P>We have this claim that because industrial workers have a half-holiday farm workers must have it also.  I wish the Minister could make some plan to enable farmers themselves to get one. He knows and I know farmers who have never had a holiday, weekday or Sunday.  There is nothing done about that.  In a country where those are the conditions of life, can you wonder if the owners of the land, feeling that <Col N="175" /> things are coming to such a pass, that ownership imposes such obligations and responsibilities, are swiftly developing a frame of mind where they would regard ownership no longer as an asset but as a liability, and where many would be pleased to get out of it and let everything be passed into the common pool.</P>
    <P>I warn that we have our feet firmly planted on that path, and this type of legislation will push us forward.  The factory worker may be deprived of the benefit of fresh air, and it may be essential for him to have a half-day, but those on the land are living and working with nature, which is always turning and never sleeps throughout the whole 24 hours.  We will not reap if we do not sow, and if we separate ourselves from our work and disregard our responsibility, the community as a whole will inevitably suffer.</P>
    <P>This type of legislation will make life on the land, from the owner's point of view, more difficult and distasteful day by day.  Life in the cities and towns is too easy and too simple. We have it so well regulated with so much pleasure and enjoyment that it is pulling the people from the country. That is happening, not alone here, but in many other countries.  In the Argentine and in Canada, in the case of every rural community I read of, it is the same problem the wide world over.  We are marching on to disaster, which is definitely ahead, and people will not recognise it.  All the time it is the people in the urban areas who are attempting to apply conditions to nature and to life on the land that cannot be so adapted.  That is making a big contribution to the disturbance in the social life of the world to-day.</P>
    <P>There was a half-day for the miners in Britain, under legislation I suppose, and then they started calling them back to the mines week after week and one of the big announcements of the B.B.C. each week gave the number of men at work in the mines on that Saturday.  I suppose it will be the same here.  After a while, when the potatoes, rashers, eggs and butter become dearer, some of the people in towns and cities who do not <Col N="176" /> appreciate now the problems connected with the production of these things, will begin to look back again.</P>
    <P>I listened yesterday to the discussion here on the Bill to confirm certain tariff Orders.  I felt disposed to take part in the discussion.</P>
    <P>I would have got up and said how much of a burden that was imposing on the farmers.  I did not say anything about it.  I let it pass.  This will be a much greater burden on the agricultural community as a whole and on the whole community in the industrial and urban centres than any of them realise.  They will march on.  It is the history of the world that urban civilisations have marched to their deaths. I suppose there were lone voices crying out trying to warn them, but they did not take any heed.  The forces of nature are stronger than any of us.  The land will not produce its food if people will not labour.  The Creator meant that men would live by the sweat of their brow.  He gave us one day to rest and He meant us to work the other six.</P>
    <P>We are changing all that.  We are changing it despite the demands of nature, and despite the necessities of our own people.  I do not believe that we will rejoice in what we are doing. I know it is alleged that farmers are doing very well, that they can afford this type of legislation, that incomes are high.  I have been looking over some returns that have been made by men who examined this situation in regard to agriculture very critically.  In some of our southern counties, and in Roscommon as well, men have gone amongst the farming community, examined all their figures, incomes and salaries, purchases and everything they did.  The estimate which these men arrived at indicates that our farmers are earning about £200 per year on a number of holdings in Cork, Limerick and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I ought to have examined our figures of national income and the distribution of national income and brought them here to indicate what exactly the farmer's share is.  If I could have got further how that income was distributed between farmers and workers the House would see some of the disadvantages under which our farmers are labouring to-day.  All that should <Col N="177" /> have been carefully studied by the Minister for Agriculture no matter what pressure was brought upon him before he came to the Seanad with this measure.</P>
    <P>It is the wrong turning for us.  I know quite well that on many farms in this country it just will not work at all. If the illustration I gave a moment ago is typical&mdash;and I think it is fairly typical of the conditions on thousands of farms in this country&mdash;it is a clear demonstration that this will not work. If the farmer who employs labour is put into the position of having to do far more than he himself is able to do he must readjust his whole economy. I would ask that the consequences of that readjustment for the whole community should be carefully studied before we would put such an imposition upon the farmers.</P>
    <P>There is a lot more one might say about this matter, but I have expressed how I felt.  I do not think it is necessary at all.  I repeat again that I do not believe the agricultural workers in the country are demanding it.  If this were to be operated in accordance with the spirit of the law it would create a spirit of disaffection and dissatisfaction between the farmer and the labourer that has not existed in the past.  There was a basis of human relationship but when the law enters in to determine how I am to behave to my men and how they are to behave to me it is unnatural and impossible for agriculture in this country or in any other country to be carried on successfully on that basis.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Seanad again of the opinion of His Grace the Archbishop of Cashel on the policy that is being advanced in this State especially in relation to certain types of farming which are vital to the country's economy.  I know that I cannot halt the progress of this measure.  I believe our people refuse to think sufficiently seriously about the country's problems.  Only a few people do and that is what has the world as it is.  We want to be like the rest of the world, just as unhappy as they are, making life as impossible for ourselves as we can make it.  We are going the wrong road in passing legislation like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1950 the first Bill to provide a half-holiday for agricultural workers was introduced into the Dáil as a private measure.  Perhaps I should first congratulate the Minister on having brought us an amending Bill and of having accepted on behalf of the Government the responsibility for implementing the provisions of whatever measure is passed through this House.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Seanad to cast their minds back to the position that existed in 1950.  Listening to the long and rather weary speech of Senator Baxter one would be inclined to accept that this was the first measure introduced into the House to make provision for a half-holiday for agricultural workers.  That is not so. The Minister is only now giving effect to what I personally at one time put forward in a number of amendments to the Bill which was then before this House.  If these amendments had been accepted by the then majority there would have been no need for this measure to-day.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, the Bill was first introduced as a Private Member's Bill.  The difference between now and then is that we had at that time a Government who were not prepared to accept their responsibilities. On the particular occasion on which this Bill was introduced into the Dáil we had when provision was being made for the giving of a half-holiday to agricultural workers the then Minister for Agriculture, acting like Pontius Pilate as it were, washing his hands not only of all responsibility but going into the Division Lobby and voting against the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had down the years various complaints about the flight from the land. We had from no less a person than Senator Baxter in this House, when provision was made for the giving of wage increases to county council employees and other persons engaged in various activities in the rural areas, the suggestion that we were particularly catering for these type of people and that we were at the same time, by giving them better conditions of employment and so forth, encouraging the <Col N="179" /> drawing off from the land of those engaged in agricultural work.</P>
    <P>We all accept that agriculture is our primary industry.  If that is so, there is no reason why those people who are engaged in that very important branch of industry should not have the same rights and facilities as their brothers who are engaged in industry.  There is no compulsion in this Bill, and I think I said on the occasion when the previous Bill was introduced that I would be the first person to raise my voice against it, and to back it up with my vote, if there was any threat of compulsion in it.  There is a provision in Section 8 that, when an agricultural worker, in consultation with his employer, is not prepared to take the half-holiday, his weekly wage may be increased by the proportionate amount.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that the law relating to income-tax is in urgent need of revision and requests the Government to appoint a commission of inquiry on the subject at an early date.&mdash;(Senators O'Brien and Douglas.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody speaking to this motion must certainly begin by congratulating the Senator who moved it on the peculiarly lucid exposition which he gave us of the history of income-tax in this country, the circumstances out of which it arose and the position in which the code now is.  I am, of course, very familiar with Senator O'Brien's gift for lucid exposition, but I think he is misguided in thinking that this motion is not political.  I think he meant that it was not offered in a partisan spirit, in order to thwart the Minister or to get any particular political or partisan advantage; but it is surely political, because it concerns something which affects the lives of all our people, something which is very important from the point of view of government <Col N="180" /> and which no Government can do without. Therefore, any discussion of income-tax and of a commission to investigate income-tax is, of its nature, political, but it need not be partisan and need not be biassed.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford was pleased to observe that Senator O'Brien advocated changes in income-tax to benefit the salaried classes to which he belongs, and that Senator Baxter vigorously resisted the notion that farmers should pay income-tax at all.</P>

      <P>Senator Stanford thought that was an example of vocationalism, but I suggest it was no such thing.  When I used to go, many years ago, to Foster Place, I think it would have been called class-consciousness. Vocationalism, as I understand it, is rather a different thing from advocating the rights of your own particular class as against other classes.  I think that Senator Stanford, when he met the commercial traveller in the train, was conscious perhaps of the inferiority of professors to commercial travellers.</P>

      <P>Class consciousness always has an element of envy in it, and I should like to go on record as saying that I do not envy the traveller in the Welsh train his bottle of wine or even his brandy with his coffee at the end of his meal.  If income-tax changes have to be made, I do not think that is the case I would advance for making them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a proposal which involves the movers or the supporters in suggesting particular changes.  It is not a hunt after tax evaders, and it would be a great pity if the debate were to turn into an attack on the kind of people, whoever they may be and however they should be described, who are supposed to be evading tax.  We should not accuse any particular class and we need not even bother about whether particular types of farmers should be made to pay income-tax or not.  We should confine ourselves to the broad principles upon which income-tax <Col N="181" /> should be based and the need for a review of these principles in the light of the new circumstances.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one should begin by saying, as other speakers said, that any criticism of the present code or of the way it works does not involve a criticism of the officials.  As a matter of fact, my experience of administration was that the Revenue Commissioners' Department was the hardest pressed part of the Government service and the part of the Government service that was consistenly denied the staff which they thought was necessary to do the work. The very people who produce the money are the people who are, or were until very lately, extremely badly staffed for the collection of money.  It is literally a case of choking the goose that lays the golden eggs&mdash;if the word &ldquo;goose&rdquo; is not to be regarded as an inappropriate or abusive term.  There were, I think, certain changes in that direction, but one of the complaints I have always heard is that if there were a better staffing, more tax could be collected, and, as everybody knows, if more tax could be collected, the burden could perhaps be lightened upon everybody.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien dwelt upon the fact that income-tax in Ireland is just 100 years old, that we will celebrate its centenary next year, but even since 1922, even within the lifetime of a man of 50 years of age, immense changes have taken place, which means that there should be an investigation of the principles upon which income-tax is now assessed.  The first change is the immense difference in the value of money, which affects a number of things.  The second is the immense difference in the relative values and the relative stability of income from investment and income from wages or salaries.  When I was a young man, anybody who made money could invest that money and leave it for his wife or children.  The man who had money invested was sure of an income, and the man who married his daughter was sure of a dowry.  That is far from being the case now.  The most lamentable condition now is probably that of people who exist on a small income derived from investments, and I speak <Col N="182" /> of them quite objectively, because I certainly am not one of them.</P>
    <P>Another immense difference which has taken place even in the last 30 or 40 years is the relative importance of salaries and wages.  When I was a young fellow a wage earner was very depressed in this town as compared to the person who earned a salary, but that situation is very substantially altered now.  The income-tax code is based upon old values and the opinion that a man with earned income deserves more consideration than a widow with a small income derived from investments, and that a person with a salary is better off than a person with a wage.  Investigation is needed under all those headings.</P>
    <P>Considering the decreased value of money, personal allowances are now absurd, and nobody would argue that £140 for a single man and £240 for a married man, with a wife not an earner are sufficient allowances under modern conditions and with the modern value of money.  For example, surtax is paid at £1,500 and, presumably, the idea is that a man with £1,500 is in the luxury class.  But £1,500 is certainly no better than £800 &mdash;and not even worth £800&mdash;earned in 1938.  Nobody in 1938 would dream that a civil servant, an officer of a local body, a doctor or anybody else who had more than £800 should be subject to a special tax on the amount of his income that exceeded £800, but we are doing it now by fixing a figure of £1,500.  The same applies to death duties.</P>
    <P>The change in the value of money has gone far ahead and far faster than any arrangement made in the income-tax code.  If I may take the second point I made, that is the difference between the person with a salary or wage and a person who has investments and lives on the results, that income now has got consistently smaller and is, of course, extremely unstable, as we all know if we have any friend in that lamentable position. That is why Senator O'Brien said that every kind of person is seeking a post with regular income and a pension, if possible, making provision for his wife. The more we drive people into that <Col N="183" /> kind of employment, the more we cramp individual enterprise and get away from the man who is standing on his own feet and doing his own business himself, the more we hurt the national weal.  Literally, nobody nowadays, unless he is making something enormous, can be sure that he will leave his widow sufficient money to give her £300 a year: it is an almost impossible figure nowadays.  Yet the income-tax code still considers that a widow living on the result of investments&mdash;and I am looking at this objectively&mdash;is a person entitled to no allowances and should be subject to tax on all her income, as distinct from a person earning income who is in a much better position than the bulk of people living on dividends.  People living on dividends are really living on the result of previous earnings.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the difference between salaries and wages.  A great many people in this city receive monthly salary cheques which are lower than the wages paid weekly to members of highly organised trade unions working side by side with them and not in the white collar class at all.  Yet the salaried man usually gets caught with income-tax, while very often his companion worker does not.  It seems to me that on these lines, for these reasons, and for the very far-reaching change in our social structure, we should examine the income-tax code now.</P>
    <P>I know quite well a member of a closed trade union who earns a very good wage, never less than £10 a week, and he has only one political topic&mdash; Senator O'Brien will forgive me for calling it politics&mdash;and that is income-tax. I explained to him that by spending his money on drink or betting he was subscribing to the Minister for Finance, but he could not see that. His great enemy was income-tax and, no matter what he earned in overtime and where he went, he did not want to pay income-tax.  However, he thought that everybody else should pay income-tax and had the mistaken idea that the Minister for Finance was not liable for income-tax and neither was I.  He was very clear about that.</P>
    <P>The present income-tax scheme, no <Col N="184" /> matter how difficult it is for the taxpayer, is quite easy for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners are quite a mysterious sect who say to the Minister: &ldquo;If you do that you will lose money.&rdquo;  If you say that to him, you will at once make him tremble no matter what his politics and whether he is Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil: whatever he is, he does not want to lose money and small blame to him.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have a code which has grown up under their hands and they have stacks of rules, files and precedents, and if you listen to one he can explain anything about it to you.  They are the high priests of income-tax.  Nobody else understands it and very few accountants and very few solicitors understand it and I say this with bated breath and whispered humbleness, very few counsel.  Very few understand the code which the Commissioners administer.  The Commissioners know the width of every river and the depth of every pool and it is natural for them to object to any kind of change.  They are extremely hard-worked and have given wonderful service to the country, looking at it from the point of view of the Minister for Finance and the running of the State.  They are always reluctant to abandon the known for the unknown, reluctant to inquire and see whether in extraordinarily changed circumstances the system could not be changed.  They do their job extremely well and very honestly.</P>
    <P>Yet, I think quite a number of people particularly oldish people and timid people&mdash;within whom politicians cannot be counted&mdash;pay, perhaps, too much income-tax.  It seems to me that a case can be made beyond yea or nay for an inquiry and for an Irish inquiry, for making an inquiry ourselves for our own purposes and with regard to our own conditions, without waiting for the report of the British Royal Commission. We have after 30 years' experience of self-government a great many people available with ministerial experience, official experience and business people who have seen income-tax from various angles and given the matter study.  It seems to me that it would not be difficult for a Minister <Col N="185" /> to appoint a commission in which the people would have confidence and whose whose report even if not adopted would give food for thought and lead to some substantial change.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Senator O'Brien that we should not wait for the British Royal Commission Report. Irish conditions are different from British conditions.  My friend Senator Baxter would point out with eloquence how very different they are because of the preponderance of agriculture in our economy as compared with Britain.  The fact is that our business conditions are also substantially different from those obtaining in Britain.  I remember when I was in the Chair in the Dáil some years ago a Minister for Finance explaining that in England, at that time, the great bulk of their revenue in income-tax came from people with an income of over £1,000 whereas here it came from the lower rate of income.  I do not know whether that is still the position but I give it to illustrate the point that conditions here are very different from those obtaining in England and therefore I say we should not wait for the report of the British Royal Commission.  If we were to wait for that report it might take some years, for the British are a leisurely people and have great problems to face.  Even if we waited for that report then we would be faced with the task of adjusting it to our own conditions.  It would be better to make our own decisions ourselves in the light of our own conditions.</P>
    <P>I think Senator O'Brien and Senator Douglas have done great work by bringing in this motion.  We could shorten the debate and perhaps make it more fruitful by recalling that the motion says that the income-tax law is in need of revision and requests the Government to appoint a commission to examine it.  The Minister should do that and if he did he would be able to find the people suitable to carry out the inquiry.  He has within his control a great deal of the facts and figures necessary for the inquiry and I think he would have the support of everybody in the community, both the politicians and those <Col N="186" /> misguided people who think they are not politicians at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>A great case has been made for an inquiry into the revision of the income-tax code.  In my opinion, however, there are many other things that need to be inquired into before we have an inquiry of that kind. The suggestion, I think, as it was made by Senator O'Brien, was that salaried workers were feeling the pinch and that the rural population was not paying its share.  If that is so, I wonder how it is that the cultured boys and girls are leaving the farms, and that nobody is inclined to stay behind except the fool of the family.  I have stated that there are other matters which are more urgently in need of examination.  Why should there not be an inquiry into the lack of amenities in rural Ireland as compared with the amenities which are enjoyed in urban and suburban places?  This year there has been an acute shortage of water in many country places, so much so that the livestock suffered heavily in casualties and sickness.  In the country districts there are no taps from which to draw water, but it has to be carried over long distances, and I heard of one case where a man had to bring water by train.  The shortage of water is an acute problem, and has been particularly acute this year.  This question of amenities is one that should be inquired into at once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everyone will congratulate Senator O'Brien for bringing this matter before the House in his speech of characteristic eloquence and erudition.  We must generally agree that he has made at least a <i>prima facie</i> case for an inquiry into the working of the income-tax code.  We can, I think, admit that the income-tax code as at present operated <Col N="188" /> is archaic, and inequitable as between the different sections of the community, that it penalises enterprise and thrift and makes insufficient allowance for depreciation and the maintenance infact of physical capital in industry.</P>
      <P>These are points that have been developed by other speakers and I do not propose to develop them further.  I would like, however, to refer to one or two interesting suggestions made by Senator O'Brien in the course of his speech.  He suggested that it is important to maintain human capital&mdash;the human capital of income-tax payers&mdash; intact and that to that end expenditure on medical and surgical services during the year should be made exempt from income-tax liability.  I am altogether in favour of that suggestion although I hope I will not have to profit by it myself in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One advantage of that suggestion is worth mentioning.  In America, where the system operates, the income-tax payer must support his claim for exemption by submitting receipts of medical fees paid by him in the course of the year.  Income-tax people are notoriously good at filing all documents that come their way and when they get these documents showing that Dr. So-and-so was paid so much by So-and-so, in connection with his income-tax claim, they have a habit of reorganising those documents in relation to the income-tax liability of the doctor himself and, if the doctor's income-tax return differs widely from and is much less than the total of the receipts in which his name is mentioned, that have come to the income-tax authorities from another source, they know that that doctor has been trying to deceive the income-tax authorities, a thing which I am sure no honest doctor would do.  Nevertheless, it is a useful check on the income-tax liabilities of the professional classes who are notoriously able to get away more easily with paying less income-tax than they should pay than the people who are taxed under Schedule E.  That is a not inconsiderable advantage of the suggestion made by Senator O'Brien and might go far to compensate the income-tax authorities <Col N="189" /> for any loss they may incur by allowing exemption for expenditure on medical services.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred rather disparagingly to the Griffith's Valuation, on which the rating system is based, as another of the archaic phenomena which still operate in the administration of the country's affairs.  I am not sure that I agree altogether with regard to that.  I think the Griffith Valuation of agricultural land is even now a very good rough and ready indication of the relative fertility of different portions of land and, while we attach no significance whatever to the money term in the valuation of land because the value of money has changed enormously in the last 100 years, nevertheless, the relative valuation of one farm as compared with another is still, I think, on the whole, a very good rough indication of the relative natural fertility of the farms in question.</P>
    <P>That brings me by natural transition to the aspect of the matter that I think the House would like me to discuss, that is, the incidence of income-tax on agriculture.  In that connection, I would agree that income-tax must not be considered by itself, but in conjunction with the other taxes that farmers pay, especially rates on agricultural land and agricultural buildings. I think it is quite true to say that many farmers who pay no income-tax whatever, in the technical sense of the term, nevertheless pay in the form of rates what amounts to a very high rate of income-tax in relation to what their actual earnings happen to be, and that aspect of the matter must never be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>I also agree that in any conceivable reform of the income-tax system it is highly probable that most farmers in this country would escape taxation altogether just as most farmers escape income-tax altogether under present conditions.  That is not by any means to say that the present system is perfect in its incidence on agricultural conditions, and I will have occasions to point out later some aspects in which the present income-tax code positively rewards laziness and inefficiency in the <Col N="190" /> use of land and does not adequately encourage enterprise and progress.</P>
    <P>In that connection it is pertinent to point out that, taken in conjunction with the rating system, the direct taxation does go out of its way to penalise enterprise and efficiency.  The best farmers are also the people who are inclined to add to their farm buildings. No improvement in Irish agriculture is more necessary than improvement in the lay-out and in the structure of the farm buildings about the homestead, but the immediate result of improving farm buildings is an increase in rates. I know, Sir, you are going to say that I am out of order, but it is relevant to direct taxation and you cannot consider income-tax in isolation from the effects of rates on buildings and all that kind of enterprise.  The fact that a good farmer is penalised by having to pay higher rates for improving his farm buildings is typical of the kind of way in which any kind of direct taxation penalises industry and enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that later on.  One definite advantage of an inquiry of the kind that we are asking for would be that we might ascertain how many of our farmers are actually paying income-tax under present conditions.  There are 320,000 occupiers of agricultural holdings in the country, of whom only 247,000 are classified as farmers in the sense that they derive their principal source of living from the land.  Many of the other 80,000 are professional men or commercial men, or even perhaps university professors, road workers, railway workers or what not, who happen to be living in the country and who are owners of an agricultural holding.</P>

    <P>If we consider, first of all, the 80,000 who are primarily something else than farmers, I think it highly probable that many of them, at all events, those of them who are members of the professional and commercial classes, are paying income-tax but, if we consider only the 247,000 who are nothing but farmers, then I doubt whether more than a very few <Col N="191" /> thousand of them are at present paying any income-tax.</P>
    <P>During the economic war it was customary for farmers who were liable for income-tax to pay, not on the poor law valuation&mdash;I know what I did myself under those conditions&mdash;but to keep regular accounts and to pay on their farm profits, if any.  If your main income was derived from some other source, you could get a substantial reduction in total income-tax by proving your farm losses under those conditions.  I should think that when agriculture is depressed the tendency is for those who are liable for income-tax to present accounts and to get away with a comparatively small liability for agricultural income-tax, or none at all and, when agriculture is doing rather well, as I hope it is at present, the tendency is to claim to pay on the poor law valuation.</P>
    <P>When agriculture is doing rather well, the tendency is to claim on the poor law valuation.  That is the general practice of those now paying income-tax as farmers.  Under Schedule A I think you pay on the actual poor law valuation of your holding as an owner, but under Schedule B I think you pay on the actual poor law valuation of your holding as an occupier&mdash;so the farmer is liable to pay on what amounts to twice the poor law valuation of his land.  If you consider rates on agricultural land and buildings as a third kind of income-tax, he very often pays on three times the poor law valuation. That might be a real proportion of his real income in certain cases.  Under present conditions, when agriculture is reasonably prosperous, it is probable that if all farmers had to pay on their certified farm accounts, and not on this purely arbitrary poor law valuation basis, the revenue authorities would derive considerably more income-tax from such farmers than they are obtaining now.</P>
    <P>That was, I think, the implied suggestion in Senator O'Brien's speech, though he rather soft-pedalled his remarks on that aspect, being warned by what happened to him before when he emphasised that aspect of the case. I am quite ready to admit that if the <Col N="192" /> farmers pay on their total ascertained profits in present conditions, those at present paying income-tax would probably be paying a good deal more than they are paying at present.  However, what is the nation to gain by making these farmers, the most efficient in the country, pay more than at present?</P>
    <P>Income-tax is a necessary evil; I do not dispute its necessity, but in any free capitalist economy it does operate to inhibit enterprise and acts as a disincentive to production and therefore it weakens the mainspring of capitalist economy and clogs the wheels of its movement.  That is true of the normal operation of an income-tax system which is levied on the actual incomes earned by the persons paying it.  When we consider the incidence of income-tax on farmers who pay on the poor law valuation, the system is not open to that criticism, as it tends to encourage enterprise rather than discourage it, since the greater the production or profit the farmer can make the smaller will be the proportion of his income that he has to pay by way of tax.  Therefore, what is an objection to income-tax in general when levied on total ascertained income becomes a positive merit when levied on a fixed arbitrary figure like poor law valuation which has no relation to the real income that may be made on the farm.</P>
    <P>Consequently, if you succeeded in making the income-tax code too perfect so that it caught every income and ascertained exactly what every income was, you might in this aspect do more harm to the nation than good by its effect in discouraging an increase in agricultural production, which is the one thing that really matters in our present national economy and as compared with which nothing else really matters, not even the desirability of acquiring additional income and improving the equity of the tax.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we could invent a form of taxation which would operate as a tax on inefficiency, a kind of Father O'Flynn income-tax that would &ldquo;help the lazy ones on&mdash;or out&mdash;with a stick&rdquo; and reward the successful ones. I am thinking now of the well-known <Col N="193" /> fact that there are so many comparatively inefficient farmers in all sizes of farms.  I wonder if Senator Baxter or Senator O'Dwyer could put his hand on his heart and say that every farmer in Ireland is 100 per cent. efficient.  No one could say that.  You would find different opinions on that point, as to the proportion of farmers making the most effective use of the manpower and resources they have under their command, in their own interests and in the interests of the country.</P>

      <P>I will come back to it very soon.  You would probably find many gradations of efficiency and if you divided them into tens the difference between the lowest ten and the highest ten would be very wide indeed. Perhaps we need some form of taxation which will penalise the inefficient and reward the efficient.  I would go so far as to remit income-tax entirely in favour of farmers who prove their efficiency by obtaining the maximum return and I would penalise heavily those who do not get the most out of the land for themselves or the country.</P>
      <P>In County Kildare there has lately been established a pilot farm&mdash;which has, no doubt, other objects in view not concerned with the problem before us.  I think the idea could be used in this case.  Why not have a number of pilot farms in different parts of the country?</P>

      <P>In such pilot farms proper accounts could be kept and then if you wanted to tax inefficiency you could say that every person <Col N="194" /> having a farm of that valuation should be obtaining the income which it has been proved possible to obtain on the pilot farm of the same grade and they should be taxed on a national income that they should have obtained, whether they got it or not.  I will not develop that any further.  In general, I would much rather tax farmers for the incomes they do not earn but should be earning, than tax them on the incomes they have earned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened yesterday with great interest to the speeches of the sponsors of this motion.  I readily accepted their statements that the speeches were made without any political tinge whatsoever.  At the same time, I must say that I was very disappointed because I felt at any rate that they did not make any case whatsoever for the type of inquiry they are seeking.  They made a case undoubtedly for reliefs for certain sections of the taxpaying community.  I must say at the same time that they made no suggestion whatever as to how the Minister was to make up the difference that would result if these reliefs were granted.</P>
      <P>So far as I could judge there was agreement between both of them that income-tax was justifiable and that the sum which the Minister demands each year was not to be limited or curtailed in any way.  Consequently, if this commission of inquiry was set up these two matters would not be referred to it.</P>
      <P>In the beginning I thought that these were questions which might be considered and that this commission if it were set up might consider alternative methods of raising revenue which the Minister would require for the services during the year.  But since they were not to be before the commission the only thing I could see that this commission could discuss would be this question of reliefs that certain sections of the community might get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> I was rather disappointed, too, that Senator O'Brien did not elaborate on the question of income-tax on the agricultural community.  From previous speeches he made, I thought it was a matter upon which he had pretty strong feelings.  I thought, in fact, that he felt the agricultural community should be taxed.  I felt that on this occasion we might discuss this thing from the angle that the sponsor of the motion was advocating this particular imposition.  My own belief is that it is a waste of time talking about taxing the agricultural community at the present time and for some years.</P>
    <P>I do not believe&mdash;I am merely expressing a personal opinion&mdash;that there is any possibility whatsoever of a Minister for Finance in present times coming along to change the system of collecting income-tax from the agricultural community.  However, if Senator Professor O'Brien had made that case it would be something, at any rate, that this commission could study.</P>
    <P>We were told by Senator O'Brien that roughly 184,000 people pay income-tax directly and that every person who purchases a manufactured article pays income-tax indirectly and that, consequently, we have at the present time practically every adult citizen and a lot of our younger ones paying income-tax in one form or another, including the farmers.  When we come to this question of the farmers, I often find it difficult to understand what the people talking about farmers mean.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had Senator O'Donovan suggesting that farmers should not be taxed until they were able to pay income-tax.  The Revenue Commissioners, as I understand them, do not collect tax from people who are not liable.  Consequently, a very big percentage of what I call landowners in this country would not be liable for income-tax at all even if we were to impose taxes on them.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston gave us the figure of 247,000 farmers and 80,000 who might be reckoned to be just small landowners.  In my opinion, there are not anything like 247,000 families in this country living solely out of the land.  To my mind&mdash;and I come from <Col N="197" /> a county in which the land is very good&mdash;people are inclined to think that anybody with a small farm of 40 acres of very good land is a small farmer and that they would have to go outside the land to earn a livelihood. When we talk of farms and give figures and include in the list as farmers people with a poor law valuation of less than £10 we do wrong and give to the community generally a completely wrong idea of farms.</P>
    <P>In the retail trade we call a man a shopkeeper.  &ldquo;Shopkeeper&rdquo; is the general term, but then there are a whole variety of them.  We seem to use the word &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; always without reference to either dairy farmers or the various other types of farmer.  We classify them all together.  There is a pretty fair number of farmers in this country who could pay income-tax without any great hardship to themselves but, as I said in the beginning, this question was not to be referred to this commission if it were set up. On that account I suppose it is not worth talking about at the present time.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the type of commission that Senator O'Brien recommended. He said to us&mdash;I hope I am not wrong&mdash;that it should be comprised of certain members of the Revenue Commissioners, some representatives of agriculture and certain representatives of the trade unions.  We have been told all along that the agricultural community do not pay income-tax nor are they likely to be asked to pay it.  It would seem strange to me that they would be some of the people who would be on this commission.  I suppose there are certain reasons why the trade unions should be represented on such a commission, but to my mind the Revenue Commissioners are the people who would influence the commission in any of its findings.</P>
    <P>We were told that the Revenue Commissioners are very reasonable men, and that they are very helpful to people who go to them with their income-tax problems.  They are both reasonable and helpful.  I agree fully with that. They have no wish to take from the community anything more than the State is entitled to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> I feel that, in the long run, if we have a commission on these lines, we would simply have what we have at present&mdash;the Minister who has the responsibility being advised by the Revenue Commissioners who are the experts in this case.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, what was advocated by Senator O'Brien and Senator Douglas was a shifting of the burden.  The white collar worker and the fixed income worker, the civil servant, and so on, were mentioned by both of these Senators, as was also this question of provision for old age.  So far as old age is concerned, I have another bee in my bonnet with regard to pensions.  I was taught that there was a responsibility on the children to help their parents when they became old, and I still believe that is an excellent principle.  The man who is single and who has been enjoying throughout his life a reasonable salary ought to be able to make proper provision for himself in his old age, whether he is entitled to a pension on retirement or not.  I still feel, on this question of pensions, and even this question of old age pensions, that many people now have come to the conclusion that these are a means of livelihood, whereas they were granted in the beginning by the British Parliament as something to help old people when they reach the stage at which they cannot work for themselves.  The fact is that as the young people are the responsibility of the old people in their earlier years, the older people, when they become old, are the responsibility of the young people, and I should be sorry to think that we should ever depart from that principle.</P>
    <P>There has been no suggestion, if we are to shift the burden from the white collar or fixed income group, as to the group to which we are to shift it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the commission, I suppose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just wondering how the commission could do it any better than it is being done at present, because, in the end, it will be a matter for the Minister.  There has been no <Col N="199" /> suggestion as to what other group this shift could be made to.  One man might argue that we should tax the white collar worker more and another that we should tax him less.  But the sole case made was for a shifting of the burden from one section to another.  I am fully convinced that we are all in favour of reliefs in income-tax.  Every one of us wants them, but if we are to get reliefs and if the Minister is to get the sum he is looking for, somebody will have to pay it.</P>
      <P>I do not see that this commission could serve any useful purpose.  If there were a suggestion that there should be a change from income-tax to something else, that suggestion could be examined.  As Senator O'Brien has said, income-tax was started in this country in 1853.  There were other taxes in the period before that which were perhaps heavier than income-tax, and I remember that some very tough battles were fought in this country over tithes, which inflicted much more grievous punishment on the people than income-tax. There might be a question to be decided in whether we should go back to tithes and abolish income-tax, but I do not think anybody would agree with it.  But when we have only to discuss a question of the transfer of the burden from one section to another, when we are agreed that income-tax is justifiable and that we are not going to limit the Minister's demand, I do not see what the commission can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the feeling that commissions are a means of putting off arriving at a decision.  We have had any amount of them over the past 20 years, and, as a general rule, when we talk about them after, we refer to them as stopgaps or something to keep the people quiet for a while, but no real decision is come to because of the information they give us.  While I have no objection in the world to a commission being set up, I think it would be only a waste of time.  It may produce a number of statistics which would be useful and might be helpful to the Minister in levying his tax and apportioning it amongst the various sections, but the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister, <Col N="200" /> together with the Dáil and Seanad, could do the same work and do it more quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to address myself as closely as possible to the terms of the motion, that the law relating to income-tax is in urgent need of revision, and I feel that the important thing for us to do is to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case for the terms of the motion.  The ground has already been covered so well that there already has been established such a case, but it will be my object to try to reinforce some of the things already said and perhaps add a word or two of my own on points that have not been covered.</P>
      <P>The approach of Senator Hayes was the right approach, that we were not here to score points off one another or to point out who was paying and who was not, and all the little faults in the present system.  We are rather dealing with the major question: is the income-tax code at present such that we should set up a commission to inquire into it, to see if it can be improved and, if so, how?</P>
      <P>When one rises to speak on this subject, one feels like apologising and saying that one is not an accountant, an economist or a financial expert, because that is what one needs to be nowadays to deal with the income-tax code as we know it.  We have our income-tax code which must be handled and elucidated by experts applied to the ordinary man, the ordinary business man, the person earning a salary and the people with incomes, all of whom are completely befogged by the whole thing.  For that reason alone, it is obviously unjust that there should be a form of taxation which nobody, but a few experts, understands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system undoubtedly is cumbersome, complicated and, as well, is obsolete.  It has been pointed out by the proposer of the motion that the code is very much in the terms in which it was half a century ago and that the whole thing is needlessly complicated and difficult.  It is also complicated for the officials, and, as has already been said, nobody attaches any blame to the officials who are called on to administer the code.  I think it is common knowledge that the whole <Col N="201" /> administration of income-tax by the officials of the State is in a condition of chaos.  Things seem to run on for years in dealing with estates and people's liability for tax.</P>
    <P>I was told by a solicitor the other day that, in the case of some professional partnerships, it is almost impossible to get any finality in assessments and he said that he had a case that had gone on for two and three years.  One can imagine the state the partnership's finances must be in, if they have to wait three years for an assessment.  Apart altogether from the upset to their business transactions, there is mounting liability, which is one of the worst features of the present system&mdash;the lump sum payments required to fulfil an obligation&mdash;and that applies to the smallest up to the biggest income-tax payer.  The payments in all cases are very high in proportion to the incomes on which they are paid and, moreover, the demand comes for payment in one lump or two lump sums in the year, so that people with £8 and £10 a week find themselves suddenly called on to pay up £30, or, in the case of companies, thousands of pounds, at a time when they may have all their money heavily engaged in their business operations.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this tax, even in its administration, is cumbersome and complicated, and it is in a state of chaos, as I said.  Now, in the same way when we come to the taxpayer himself, it is so complicated with the varying rates of tax, that nobody seems to know where one thing begins and another ends, and there are all sorts of schedules.  I would say that a very large proportion of taxpayers are not able to claim proper reliefs because it would take an expert to find out what reliefs one is entitled to. Therefore, I think that the case of the individual taxpayer goes to show that this code is complicated, out-of-date and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I also think in connection with income-tax that the Exchequer is inclined to look too often and too much to this particular tax.  It is an easy tax from the point of view of getting more revenue, although it is a complicated way of getting it, but it is very remunerative and at least, by putting <Col N="202" /> on an extra shilling in the £, the Exchequer in good times and in a lively economy is able to get large sums of money very easily.  I think that that is a very bad thing, because it inclines the Minister and the Exchequer to look to this tax for easy money, very often with serious ill-effects on the national economy and on the industrial and business community particularly&mdash; I do not mean in their personal capacity but in their earning capacity for the nation.  Secondly, I think it is bad because of the comparatively few people who pay this tax, and it is important to remember that the tax is being paid by comparatively few people, and the burden is out of proportion to the numbers and their ability to pay.</P>
    <P>Those people on fixed incomes should be particularly mentioned, because when an extra rate of taxation is imposed they have no way of increasing their earnings.  This applies to people who are living on capital and who have been left annuities, and so on.</P>
    <P>In the business community income-tax is supposed to be a tax on profits and not a tax on capital, and its very name implies it is a tax on income, but because of the method of assessment it proves to be a tax on capital.  I take it that it is self-evident that profits tax and income-tax as applied to companies are intended to be a tax on income but it appears equally self-evident that true profits in any period cannot exceed receipts accruing from the year's trade, that is, after providing for replacement of physical capital used to provide profit for that period. Allowances for plant and machinery are the same as they were 50 years ago although replacement prices have increased as much as four times, due to the altered value of money&mdash;and nobody will deny this.  The need to make provision for greater allowances for replacement would be more obvious had the degree of inflation in our country been as marked in the last ten or 20 years as it has been in France and Germany, where you had really dramatic depreciation in the value of the currency.  But because depreciation occurred only four times <Col N="203" /> here while it occurred a thousand times in France and other countries, this aspect of depreciation and the necessity for making sufficient allowances for the replacement value of machinery were not seen.</P>
    <P>All our Finance Ministers have stressed the necessity for capital and savings and the present Finance Minister, in his Budget, did stress the necessity for savings, and that is the absolute, essential and basic proposition in private and business life.  It is impossible to save money if all your surplus money is taken in taxation of this kind, because what you would have left may not be enough to continue with your family business or business life.  If proper depreciation value is not allowed to business, it means, of course, that a false profit is, in fact, shown by companies because capital is being run down. At first sight it would appear that the only evil result coming from this false profit shown in business through the system of assessment at the moment would be that too much taxation is imposed on the businesses concerned. But there are further evil effects from this process, and I would like to quote from a paper written by Mr. C. Percy Barrowcliff, President of the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors, in which he refers to this matter:</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>To this matter of taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the matter in which in our income-tax laws there is over-estimation of profits because of the fact that proper reliefs are not given for replacement.  Mr. Barrowcliff says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I start from the point that I think a company cannot be said to have made a profit at all until it has dealt realistically and not academically with this problem of depreciation. In all those years when old assets are being depreciated on the historical cost basis you get a distortion of the profit figure for the business.  That, of course, leads to excessive taxation and distortion in a good many other ways.  This <Col N="204" /> applies not only to accounts, but to a great many things in business and in life generally.  If you start with a wrong picture, no matter what fairly reasonable grounds there are for it, the distortion grows and grows as it might be from mirror to mirror, and all sorts of bad results flow from it.  In particular, I would suggest that extravagance in administration flows from an unduly large profit figure.  You also get a dissatisfaction amongst employees, a wrong idea of what a business is earning, requests for higher wages than can reasonably be paid, and things of that kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, if it is false and a false profit is shown, everybody gets the wrong idea of the trade or business concerned, and even owners themselves are inclined to spend too much money, perhaps even in dividends. Workers are inclined to ask for too much wages and the public in general have the idea that there is prosperity there which is, in fact, not there at all.</P>
    <P>One other thing I would suggest as a subject for inquiry is that there should be some differentiation made in taxation between distributed and undistributed profits.</P>

One relates to the profits which are definitely ploughed back into the business, and it seems wrong that money which is retained in a business and gives more employment and a greater wealth for the business and, incidentally, for the country, is something that should be taxed.  There should be differentiation between profits which are merely taken out of the business and distributed elsewhere and those retained in the business to give employment and create wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish, finally, to support the terms of the motion, that a commission should be set up to inquire into the <Col N="205" /> whole matter of the income-tax code. I suggest that the commission should examine the whole system of income-tax with a view to its simplification and a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation over the different citizens of the State.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with Senator Loughman, who expressed disappointment about the manner in which the debate has gone.  It seems clear that most of the speakers have not really been discussing a revision of the income-tax code, but have been advocating its reduction, which is entirely another matter.  Senator O'Brien may be said to have begun this policy when he suggested a number of ways in which the burden imposed on the salaried classes should be reduced.  He suggested, for example, that the basic allowance should be raised and that provision should be made for medical expenses, insurance and travelling allowances, and that the house repair allowance should be restored.  Other speakers followed on these lines and nearly everyone had some recommendation for reducing the hardships caused to whatever classes they happen to represent by pressing for reductions.</P>
      <P>It might well be that reforms of this nature are desirable, but it does not require a commission to recommend them.  All you need is a Minister for Finance with £5,000,000 to spare in his Budget who could afford to give these allowances.  These are not reforms for which you need a commission.  We have had other speakers looking on the matter from the point of view of reducing hardships without any consideration of what other class of taxpayer was to pay for these reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien suggested two sorts of levelling-off process in which the money for saving the taxpayers in one section could be raised from another section.  He dealt, first of all, with the illegal evasion of income-tax.  He suggested that there was a larger section who should come under the present income-tax law, but in fact did not.  I may be wrong, but I do not think that the Senator himself felt really confident on that matter.  Here again I think the question of raising <Col N="206" /> further taxation from a section of the population who at the moment are avoiding it is not a matter that could be dealt with by a commission.  If people want to be dishonest, there is very little that you can do about it. It may be possible, of course, to increase the staff of the Revenue Commissioners, to appoint additional tax inspectors or to make more efficient the present method of tax-gathering, but it is not surely the income-tax code that is at fault, but the dishonesty of those who ought to be paying the tax and are not doing so.</P>
    <P>One suggestion which Senator O'Brien made was that under the present code there was what he described as legal evasion, and his suggestion appeared to be that farmers should be taxed or taxed further.  Senator O'Brien said that there is a section of the community which deserves to benefit from the present method of assessment. Where I would disagree with that is that I believe the benefit derived at present by the agricultural community should continue.  I do not believe there is any justification for any further general raising of the taxation paid by the agricultural community.  My reason for saying that is that two-thirds of the population of the country live on or from the land, and the last figures for total national income show, in fact, that the two-thirds living on the land share less than one-third of the total national income.  To put it in another way, the income per head of the non-agricultural community is approximately four times the income per head of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that to put the case for the farmer on the basis that he is some important person is entirely wrong.  I do not think that the farmer is more important or less important that anyone else in the State.  One of the most serious aspects of our agricultural economy is that two-thirds of our population should have to live on entirely inadequate standards of life on the land.  I believe it is in the national interest that the farming economy should be so arranged as to provide as high a standard for those on the land as is enjoyed by the people in the towns.  There is a view, very commonly held, but which I do <Col N="207" /> not accept, that the ordinary farmer is living on the fact of the land.  I do not believe that that is so.</P>
    <P>If one takes the higher class of professional workers who have, say, £1,000, £1,200 or £1,500 a year and live in suburban villas, I do not believe there are many even of the bigger farmers whose general standard of living or the standard of whose amenities, the furnishings of whose houses, etc., are as high.  I may be wrong in that but that is my view.  Before any general rise in taxation of the farming community would be brought about there should be much greater equalisation of income and standard of living of the farming community with that of the suburban professional dwellers.  It has been said, and I think truthfully, that many, especially the larger farmers, could do far more than they do to improve their standard of living.</P>

      <P>I shall not pursue that beyond saying that it has been suggested that many farmers could do more than they do to improve production, that many of them lodge money in the bank which could be used to better purpose.  An increase in taxation will not deal with that situation. It is a situation that might well be dealt with but increasing income-tax will not do it.</P>
      <P>I have stated that in my opinion not much of a case has been made so far for setting up a commission of inquiry to deal with income-tax but, on the whole, probably, it is desirable that such a commission should be set up. There are some improvements, undoubtedly, which could be and should be made in the present system of income-tax.  I am not talking about reducing the incidence of taxation on any section of the population or improving reliefs but I am simply saying that the present methods of raising this money are out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One elementary improvement that could be made is one that has been recommended especially by Senator Douglas, that income-tax forms could <Col N="208" /> be written, if not in English, in some close approximation to English.  As Senator Hayes quite rightly said, even counsel find it very difficult to know what income-tax law is.  It should be possible to frame these various forms in simpler language.  It would be very desirable that some sort of small booklet written in plain English should be sent to income-tax payers which would set out briefly what their rights are in the way of reliefs and what their duties are in relation to the sums they are liable to pay.  The ordinary taxpayer as well as the ordinary accountant, lawyer or professional man has extraordinarily little idea of what his position is under the income-tax law.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have suggested various anomalies which could be dealt with.  I do not want to go over those.  There is one which I would like to add to the long list already produced.  There may be some reason for it but to me it is an astonishing state of affairs that a house owner, for example, who has a considerable amount of house property which he lets to various tenants pays only on the valuation of the houses.  I think I am right in this.  He may be making hundreds of pounds every year out of these rents and all he pays is the amount of income-tax due on the valuation, not on the income.  This is a matter that will please Senator Stanford; there is again a clear distinction between businessmen and others&mdash;if he lets the premises for business purposes, he pays income-tax on the revenue from rents.  It is difficult to understand that distinction. That is a curious anomaly which could be examined by the commission.</P>
    <P>In regard to commissions in general, I personally have very little faith in commissions.  I do not think commissions very often do much good.  Since the State was founded a considerable number of commissions of various kinds have been set up.  In the main they have reported in the course of years. In the great majority of cases the reports have been completely ignored or mainly ignored by the Government of the day, and rightly so because reports of commissions have a habit of <Col N="209" /> being entirely impracticable, where their recommendations are not entirely undesirable.</P>
    <P>While there is a chance, if only a small one, that a commission on the subject of income-tax might make some recommendations which could be and should be accepted, it is worth making the effort.  A commission does not cost very much money and even where the commission has sat on some subject and its recommendations have not been accepted, the report of a commission of this kind is always valuable because of the amount of information gathered. If a commission were set up to examine income-tax, even though it might not make any recommendation of any great value, it would gather an amount of information about the incidence and the history of income-tax in Ireland which could be very valuable.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that if a commission of this kind is set up it should be made perfectly plain to the public that it is not going to bring about any great relief in the hardships suffered by various sections in regard to income tax, that it is not a commission to decide what reliefs should be given but simply a commission to recommend how the amount of money at present raised by income-tax could be raised in a way which would be less anomalous and less out of date and which would not press upon one section of the community solely instead of pressing evenly upon all sections.  That should be made clear because certainly, judging by the course of this debate, there is a tendency, when considering the reform of income-tax to look upon it entirely in the sense of what reliefs can be given to &ldquo;my particular section of the community.&rdquo;  I would therefore, in this rather lukewarm way, recommend that a commission of this kind should be set up.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words in support and approval of the excellent case for revision of the income-tax code that has been made by Senator Professor O'Brien and Senator Douglas.  During the past 30 years commissions have been set up on many services that to my mind were not nearly so much in need of investigation as is the obsolete income-tax code which, as Senator O'Brien pointed out yesterday, had its origin 100 years ago, and has since remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Although the motion has been spoken to by representatives of various interests in the House, it is noticeable that there has been no complaint against the manner in which the income-tax code has been administered. The whole complaint has been against the system as it is.  I would like to say that personally I have found the Revenue authorities extremely helpful and more anxious to show me how I could get out of certain responsibilities than to saddle me with them.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot but be impressed with the arguments put forward, and I sincerely hope that he is sufficiently impressed to set up the commission to inquire into this system that is asked for in the motion tabled by Senator O'Brien and Senator Douglas.</P>

    <P>So many questions which might be described as subsidiary and secondary questions have been raised in the course of the discussion that I think the main purpose of the motion has not been discussed at all.  The general impression I got from the debate is that which the late President Coolidge got from a sermon he listened to about sin&mdash;he gathered that the preacher &ldquo;was agin sin&rdquo;, and I think that the same applies to income-tax in the <Col N="211" /> sense that the general body of the Seanad is &ldquo;agin it&rdquo;, but there is this difference, that while we can do without sin the State cannot do without income-tax.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Donnell was one of those who came off the fence and stated emphatically that he was opposed to income-tax&mdash; apparently because of its British ancestry.  We have taken over many things from the British, some good and some bad, and some of them for the time being indispensable&mdash;and I think we can put income-tax in that category. Of course, when Senator O'Donnell rises to speak, we generally look for a certain amount of humour, some wit, very seldom for light, good reason or logic.  Being so strongly opposed to income-tax, he has decided, I gather, to lend his general support to the motion.  There seems to be some inconsistency in that.  After all, if the Senator is opposed to income-tax in principle, why should he support a motion the underlying motive force of which is the hope that the commission would make such recommendations as would render the collection of the tax more equitable and more efficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather that that was the general purpose of Senator O'Brien's motion. It seems to me to have been the general drift of his remarks.  The only thing which shocked me a little was the rather partisan approach which he made to it.  The Senator seemed to be almost embarking on a class war&mdash; a class war of the Schedule E taxpayer against those who are taxed under Schedules B and D.  I notice he carefully omitted any of the enormities of those who pay under Schedule C, that is to say, who are taxed on incomes derived from overseas investments. The people who came in for the greater part of Senator O'Brien's criticism, certainly by implication, if not openly, were those engaged in the distributive trades, manufacturing industry and agricultural industry.  The attack on those sections of income-tax payers was launched, I gather, on behalf of those who pay tax under <Col N="212" /> Schedule E, those whose income arises in the form of remuneration for employment.</P>
    <P>In that connection, he quoted a statement made by Mr. M.P. Linehan at a meeting of the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, held in March, 1950.  He mentioned that Mr. Linehan had said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been repeatedly pleaded that income-tax is the fairest of all forms of taxation in that it seeks to approximate the burden of taxation to the ability of the individual taxpayer to bear it.  In theory, that may be so, but in practice it is the direct opposite, for a big proportion of the taxation thus raised is borne by persons whose incomes bear no relation to the tax imposed when compared with persons in other income groups.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Linehan seems to have originated the point of view which Senator George O'Brien expressed here in the course of his speech yesterday.  There is a certain amount of sardonic humour in Mr. Linehan's remarks.  After all, if the Schedule E income-tax payers feel that they suffer from a justifiable grievance, do not let us forget this very important fact, that a very large part of the taxation which is collected from the general body of taxpayers is paid out in remuneration to a very large number of people&mdash;in fact, one might almost say, to a substantial proportion of those who pay tax under Schedule E.</P>
    <P>We have civil servants and national teachers.  Mr. Linehan, who is complaining about this particular aspect of the income-tax code, is, I gather, honorary treasurer of the I.N.T.O.  The members of that organisation this year and in the year 1951 benefited very substantially from the proceeds of the income-tax raised from the remainder of the tax-paying community.  The same applies to those with teaching posts in universities which enjoy a subvention from State funds.  We could go down the list of people who were grumbling and could find that a very substantial proportion of them derive their remuneration in one form or another from the general body of the taxpayers.  I think it ill becomes them <Col N="213" /> to grumble so strongly and in fact almost to drive Professor O'Brien&mdash; who, as we all know, is the kindest and most amiable of men&mdash;to plead that the income-tax code should be tightened up, in order that taxpayers under Schedules B and D should contribute more to the Exchequer and relieve taxpayers under Schedule E.  The basis of his argument is that those bad boys who pay under Schedules B and D get away with it, but the taxpayers who pay under Schedule E unfortunately, he said, cannot evade the tax.</P>
    <P>The argument was carried to such a degree of absurdity that the kindly Senator proceeded to divide the tax-paying class into two&mdash;those who could illegally evade the tax and those who could legally do so.  I think legal evasion is a contradiction in terms. There cannot be such a thing, because no person is going to pay more than the law binds him to pay, and if the law is in such a form that his income has been assessed under one schedule rather than another, if different rules apply to one schedule rather than those which apply to his fellow-citizen who may be assessed under another schedule, it is because the nature of his income under his particular schedule differs from the nature of the income assessable under another schedule, and different rules have necessarily to be devised in order to enable the income to be assessed fairly. I should deal with some of these matters in greater detail if time permitted.  I have touched on these matters in this way because, after all, we cannot adopt this motion without considering the grounds on which it has been urged.  I shall come to some of them in a moment.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, let me refer to a remark which Senator Denis Burke made and which, I think, is worth a great deal of consideration.  Senator Burke said that income-tax was a tax on industry and agriculture and was far too high and, according to E.C.A., it was the highest in the world.  I am not accepting that contention <i>in toto,</i> but I want to emphasise that taxation is merely the counterpart of expenditure. It is merely a reflection of expenditure and if expenditure is high <Col N="214" /> then taxation must be equally high. Since in our general tax structure income-tax is a very significant element, then if expenditure is high the standard rate of income-tax will have to be high also.  I think that is a consideration to which the Seanad should give great weight.</P>
    <P>There is also another aspect of this matter which, I think, should not be lost sight of, and that is that mainly what has been pleaded here was the case for further and better reliefs and, as Senator Loughman pointed out, no case has been made for the motion by suggesting how the reliefs for various sections of the taxpayers are to be provided for.  None of the Senators who suggested that we should have a different system of allowances for repairs and depreciation, or who suggested that an allowance should be made for travelling to and from places of employment, suggested how these reliefs were going to be given, without involving a consequent loss to the revenue, or how that loss to the revenue was going to be made good.</P>
    <P>May I refer to a remark which Senator Hayes made that naturally there is a great deal of sense and reason in the argument that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance are loth to tamper with the present system.  The present system, taken by and large, is as good a code as could be devised, even for this country.  We have to give credit where credit is due, even though it were a Gladstonian system which Senator Frank Hugh O'Donnell so deprecates.  Even if we had not that system we would still arrive at some similar sort of structure if we were going to have any income-tax code at all.  It might vary in minor details, but its general effect would be the same, and that would be to take £20,000,000 out of the taxpayers' pockets to provide 29 per cent. of the revenue of the State.  There was a great deal of logic and good sense in Senator Hayes' suggestion that when a question of change is mooted, particularly such widespread, sweeping and fundamental changes as were asked for here, the Revenue Commissioners would come along and say: <Col N="215" />&ldquo;Look, if you are going to tamper with this system you will lose money&rdquo;. That is not precisely what they would say to a Minister for Finance.  They would say: &ldquo;If you are going to tamper with it, we are not going to get for the time being such a continuous, constant, reliable and dependable flow of revenue by way of income-tax.  How are you going to make up the difference?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the problem they would put up.  Those of us who have had any experience of trying to pilot Finance Bills through the Dáil or through this House know that it is a very intractable problem to be called upon to face. Naturally, all Ministers for Finance will fight shy of it, just as will all the Senators who have been advocating that I should have a different system for computing, say, allowances for repairs and depreciation, that I should make, for instance, the personal allowance depend on the cost-of-living figure and go up without the cost-of-living figure&mdash;but they would not say that it should come down if the cost-of-living figure went down.</P>
    <P>All who have advocated these varied reliefs to the particular sections of the income-tax payers have not suggested how the Minister for Finance is going to face up to what is really the crux of the problem.  If he is going to forgo a certain portion of yield from income-tax by giving increased allowances, how is he going to make up the deficit?  We have got to remember in that connection that the deficit will have to be made up in one way or another. It will have to be made up either by other forms of taxation or by reductions in Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The irony of all this is that I have never yet&mdash;and I have now, I suppose, been 30 years or more in political life&mdash; in this House or elsewhere heard a member of the Dáil or the Seanad, either in the Oireachtas or outside, nor have I heard any leading politician get up and suggest that the Minister for Finance should drastically prune expenditure on a particular service. They all tell us, of course, that we are much too extravagant, that we are imposing burdens on the taxpayers which <Col N="216" /> are much too onerous for them to bear, but none of them will tell us how we are to square the circle, how we are at one period to reduce expenditure so as to reduce taxation and how simultaneously, we are to improve the standard of life of our people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, if the House would bear with me, I might come to some of the details of Senator O'Brien's speech. Senator O'Brien said&mdash;and let us agree with him in this&mdash;that there is a volume of dissatisfaction existing among income-tax payers.  That is a very natural feeling.  Nobody likes to pay tax&mdash;and here I take issue with Senator Micheál Ó hAodha in regard to this matter&mdash;whether it is income-tax, betting tax, dance tax, excise tax or a tax on beer, spirits or tobacco or customs tax on any of these commodities.  Nobody likes to pay the tax.  The only effective answer to the critics of the tax would be to abolish it. Senator O'Donnell came very near to that position.  Then, again, if we abolish this tax, there would remain the question of how the comparatively minor matter of raising an annual £20,000,000 or so from other sources could be accomplished.</P>
    <P>It was stated by Senator O'Brien that there are many people who are not paying their due under the law. I do not know that there can be such a very large proportion of persons who should pay tax who are escaping their just obligations in that matter, but what is the remedy?  The remedy is, of course, to furnish the Revenue Commissioners with very stern inquisitorial powers, to give them all these powers of investigation which, when they are applied to any one of us, we naturally resent, and by giving them these stern and inquisitorial powers, as I have described them, create an even greater volume of dissatisfaction among the ranks of income-tax payers.</P>
    <P>Then, again, we are told, as Senator Burke told us, that taxation is too high.  If we are to make certain that nobody evades this tax, we must not merely give the Revenue Commissioners these extensive, and perhaps, in the mind of the taxpayer, highly objectionable powers, but we also have to increase considerably the staff which will conduct the inquisition.  I do not <Col N="217" /> think that is possible.  I do not think we have the staff available to us at the moment, and I hope we should never have to resort to the recruitment of such overwhelming numbers of revenue officials as would ensure that nobody evaded the tax.  Senator O'Brien did suggest&mdash;and this is really the point I am coming to&mdash;that if everybody's true liability were captured, the standard rate of income-tax would be reduced by as much as 1/6 in the £.  I do not know whether the Senator has any statistical data to support that contention.  It is something which would certainly have to be substantiated before I could accept it, because it appears to suggest that an income of £13,000,000 is escaping the taxation net.</P>
    <P>Working again on the figure of 181,000 people as representing the number of effectively liable taxpayers, Senator O'Brien suggested that this showed that only one person in 17 was paying income-tax, and he added that it was common knowledge that a much greater ratio than 1 to 17 had incomes of more than £140 per year.  I think the Senator's approach to this matter was unsound under two heads.  In the first place, the number of effectively liable taxpayers should not be compared with the total population. Rather should it be compared with the total number of persons who are at work, and the figure for these is only something like 1,220,000.  From this figure, we should have to make very substantial deductions for persons under 20 years of age and those over that age who are engaged in agricultural work, domestic service, or assisting relatives in non-agricultural work, and ultimately, after making all these allowances, we find that this figure of 1,220,000 is reduced to something over 470,000.</P>
    <P>The Senator was also unsound in basing himself on the figure of £140 per annum as the minimum income which would leave a man liable to tax.  A married man, for instance, must have more than £373 per annum before his earnings attract income-tax liability.  A married man with one child must have more than £450 and a single person would not be chargeable, <Col N="218" /> if his earnings were below £187 per annum.  Bearing these considerations in mind and also the fact that the total number of 470,000 earners or so includes numerous lower grade workers, it is not altogether surprising to find that only a little less than one-third of the total are liable to income-tax. I think I have disposed of that section of Senator O'Brien's case which rests upon the number of income-tax payers as a fraction of the total population.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the case of the five Schedules.  The Senator stated that the five Schedules&mdash;I presume he means Schedules A.B.C.D. and E.&mdash; emerged in 1803 and had never been altered.  They are, he suggested, like sacred writings.  I touched on this point in the earlier part of my remarks, but I want to emphasise that the so-called Schedules are merely sets of rules for computing the different classes of income.  They were styled Schedules, and, I think the lawyers will agree, were properly so styled, because, from a draftsman's point of view, they were Schedules to the Act, but these Schedules are not unchangeable.  These rules have in fact been modified from time to time and have frequently been subjected to amendment.  They are not untouchable, not immutable, not unchangeable and not unalterable as are the sacred writings which Senator O'Brien suggested they were.  It is true, of course, that, despite past and possible future amendments in the substance of the provisions, they remain, in their fundamentals, the same, because the classes of income with which they were designed to deal remain, in their fundamentals, the same.</P>
    <P>The Senator went on to make some criticisms of the allowances at present granted in relief under the income-tax code.  He said, for instance, that the personal allowances were not sufficiently varied with the movement of the cost of living and that he would like to see them related to a cost-of-living index calculated by reference to middle-class incomes.  Let me deal with the first objection to that proposal.  I should say that personal allowances have never been specifically related to <Col N="219" /> any particular standard of living or any particular quantum of income; but assuming that they were, assuming that the personal allowances did increase as the cost of living soared, what would the consequences be?</P>
    <P>Once again, these reliefs in the shape of personal allowances could only be granted at the expense of some other section in the community, and, taking it by and large, I think we will all agree that, if a relief of this type is given to the direct taxpayer, it should not be given at the expense of the man who is not sufficiently well off, who does not enjoy a sufficiently income to bring him into the income-tax class at all.  If we are going to have this system of relating personal allowances to the cost of living, the only thing it would do is that, while we increased the personal allowance, we should compensate ourselves for that increase in personal allowances by increasing the standard rate of tax.  I do not think that anybody, at the end of it all, would be any better off because we had tied up the personal allowances with the cost-of-living figure, on whatever basis that cost of living figure might be computed.</P>
    <P>I think that even the Minister for Finance should occasionally get credit where credit is due.  I share a certain sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator George O'Brien, even if I have to face up to the problem in a more realistic way than he showed in his speech moving this motion.  Naturally every Minister for Finance who gives some thought to ensure that the incidence of taxation will fall with reasonable fairness on the backs of the taxpayers as a whole and is shared with reasonable justice between them must be anxious to give such relief to the taxpayers as the financial position warrants.  In the Budget this year I introduced the most costly personal reliefs ever granted in this State.  I have increased for a single man the non-tax paying limit from £175 to £187 and in the case of a married man from £250 to £270, as well as a further extension of earned income relief and age relief allowances.  The net consequence of this was that the <Col N="220" /> standard rate of tax was decreased, and 170,000 individual taxpayers out of 188,000 had less to pay.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien's objection to that is that we tended to shift the incidence of the tax from the lower to the higher income groups.  That was unavoidable but we did, as far as the mass of the taxpayers are concerned&mdash;I assume that in the general mass of taxpayers Schedule E payers would figure more largely in the lower income groups than any other class of taxpayers&mdash;endeavour to benefit them, but we had to benefit them at some other person's expense.  That brings me back to the crux of the whole problem, namely, that as long as we maintain the present rate of expenditure and the present services we cannot give reliefs without the Exchequer having to compensate itself for the loss of revenue in some other way.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I shall have time to deal with the other suggestions. Senator O'Brien also suggested that the taxpayer be granted allowances to cover the expense of travelling between his home and place of business or employment.  The difficulty about taxation is that it is a practical business, and when we come to consider whether we will give relief or not we shall have to satisfy ourselves as to the extent to which such reliefs, if given, would open any avenue for evasion. We are always anxious to ensure that no fish will escape the net, and Senator O'Brien was even more anxious than I was and, in fact, the whole purpose of his motion was to set up a commission to ensure that no fish would escape the net at the expense of the Schedule E taxpayer.  We are very much in that situation.</P>
    <P>Let us see how we could administer a travel allowance for the expenses which a man incurs travelling between his home and place of business or employment.  A lot of people have motor-cars and would be assessed on a mileage basis.  How are we going to ascertain that they do not make a detour for other than business purposes?  A lot of people, too, travel by bus; would they be compelled to file their bus tickets, and we would have to introduce a regulation whereby <Col N="221" /> every bus ticket would have to be signed by the bus conductor and countersigned by another taxpayer on the bus.  Would these tickets have to be brought in at the end of the year and solemnly presented to the Inspector of Taxes in order to allow him to compute what would be a reasonable travel allowance?  What is going to happen to a man who for the sake of his health does not drive to business but walks?  Will we have to give him a travel allowance to recoup him for the wear and tear of his shoe leather in this matutinal exercise?</P>
    <P>It is easy to make these suggestions, but one should see first how they are going to work out in practice.  You are up against all these practical difficulties which would have to be foreseen, have to be overcome and solved in a practical way if relief of this sort is going to be given.  It is not true either that people are compelled to live outside the city.  I will concede it is more difficult to get suitable houses within a reasonable distance of one's place of employment or business than it used to be, but there are a great number of people living away from the centre of the city by choice, who like to look at the hills and live in the fresher air of the higher altitudes.  Again some districts may have a snob appeal.  Are we to give travel allowances to compensate for all these things?</P>
    <P>These are matters with which a sordid body like the Revenue Commissioners, concerned with getting money, and an equally sordid person like the Minister for Finance, who again has to look on both sides of a penny before he allows it to go from him, and before he can adopt any facile suggestions made here for additional reliefs, have to deal.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford made a very pathetic case based entirely on the fact that somebody sent him Christmas cards which that person did not pay for, and he said that this happened because the person who sent him the Christmas greetings was taxed under Schedule D, and that, therefore, his Christmas cards were provided free of charge.  I think that it might be put this way that if the fellow got away <Col N="222" /> with it&mdash;that is important&mdash;what did happen was that, to the extent he was subject to tax, that portion of the total cost of the card might have fallen on the Exchequer by reason of the fact that the cost of the card was debited as expense against business.  That is a very exceptional case, and I doubt whether on the whole Senator Stanford would feel grateful to a man who sent him Christmas greetings in the form of a commercial card.  None of us can deal with the man flagrantly dishonest in these matters but, if a card was sent out as ordinary commercial publicity, its face would have borne evidence of that fact.  If, on the other hand, it was sent out as an ordinary greeting, and credited as the expenses of the business it was dishonest and, while it was not a grievous crime, it was sharp practice.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is possible for us to prevent shady practices on the part of income-tax payers.  The position is that a person is taxed, whether he derives his income from his business or through the practice of a profession, on those things which are necessary to enable him to earn and maintain his income.  I do not think that we could allow as a deductible allowance&mdash;and I do not think that it is an allowance under Schedule E&mdash; the expenses necessary to enable a man to earn his income, under that schedule.  That may be described almost in the nature of capital expenditure, and that is not deducted as an expense even under Schedule D.</P>
    <P>I think that Senator Stanford was not quite right when he suggested that taxpayers had only three years in which to obtain allowances for earned income.  The relevant time is, in fact, six years, and considering that the taxpayer has all the facts in his possession, then that six years would appear to be ample.</P>
    <P>I think, perhaps, he may have had in mind the three years provided for under Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1934, where a taxpayer may allege that his assessment was excessive by reason of some error or mistake in the return he made.  I think he should be able to detect his own error within three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> Therefore, I am going to take up what I believe is the kernel of the whole matter, namely, the objection which may be made to the motion.  I think that was stated by Senator O'Callaghan and again by Senator Loughman.  The real objection, I think, to setting up this commission is that we have so much more to do; that this is not such an extremely urgent matter as many of the other matters or problems affecting the country which a commission might be set up with a view to their investigation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan mentioned, for instance, the amenities of rural life, the provision of a water supply in rural areas and the falling-off in the beet acreage.  He also suggested that there might be an inquiry into ways and means of securing that more wheat would be grown in the country.  I think that one of the main considerations in regard to this motion is whether in the present circumstances we could devote the time and the personnel to a commission of this nature.  It has been suggested that it was desirable that we should do so, but, nevertheless, there are these other matters which are much more urgent and important.  It would be of great value to the nation as a whole if we could increase the production of wheat and beet.  It would greatly enhance the attractions of rural life if we could provide the people with the other amenities which have been suggested by Senator O'Callaghan and others.</P>

      <P>The Senator has instanced matters which, in his opinion, are of greater urgency than those in the mind of the mover and seconder of this motion and I am bound to say that so far as my judgment is concerned it comes down on the side of Senator O'Callaghan and Senator Loughman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> While the setting-up of a commission of the type suggested in the motion would be desirable, if we had the time and the personnel to devote to it, I do think that it is not so urgent as these other matters.  As I said, I believe that there are other matters more urgently in need of investigation and prior investigation.  Senator O'Callaghan has mentioned one or two of them, and I am sure other Senators could give some more.  Our resources in this matter of experienced personnel are very limited, despite what Senator Hayes has said. If we were to undertake an inquiry of this nature, I believe that, in present circumstances, it would interfere considerably with the present collection of the revenue; for I do not think that we could set up this commission without imposing unduly on the already hard-pressed Revenue Commissioners and without interfering unduly with the effective and efficient collection of the revenue.  In income-tax and ancillary taxes a sum of £20,000,000 is involved, and that represents 29 per cent. of the tax revenue.  Can we, in present circumstances, when every million counts, risk any interference or slowing-up of that collection?</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford, when speaking on this motion, mentioned the Royal Commission on Taxation, and he mentioned quite spontaneously that a commission of that sort would take quite a long time.  We can, therefore, see that such a commission here would impose quite an undue strain on the Revenue Commissioners and would take up a considerable part of time of those business men who might be suited to act on that commission, time which could be devoted to their own businesses.  It would also take up the time of various organisations and professional associations who would naturally feel called upon to give evidence before it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien seemed to think that he would get a unanimous report from this commission, that it would work in perfect harmony and that the farmer would lie down with the Schedule E income-tax payer and that they would lie cheek by jowl with the industrialist and with those other <Col N="225" /> assessed persons who are paying under Schedule D.  That would be the general picture of blessed bliss and co-operation which Senator O'Brien has in mind, but we saw that when this motion came before the House this debate had not proceeded more than three or four hours before there was a marked division of opinion and the views of the various vocational interests began to emerge.</P>
    <P>We may take it then we would have had this commission, instead of presenting an agreed report, presenting a number of minority reports, some of them saying that perhaps the farmer instead of being taxed under Schedule B should be taxed under Schedule D and, of course, the farming interest on the committee in rejoinder would present a report saying that they should not be taxed at all, that instead of being taxed under Schedule B, they should receive a subvention from the State approximately equal to the poor law valuation on their holding.</P>
    <P>I think that is the sort of thing that would undoubtedly emerge if we were to set up the commission of inquiry which Senator Professor O'Brien has suggested.  We would not get any unanimity.  We would not get any agreement.  We would just have the same problems presented to us in almost the same degree of difference as they confront us day by day.</P>
    <P>There is some merit in the suggestion which I made, that in our circumstances, in view of the pressure which there is upon the resources of this comparatively small State and on our very limited Civil Service, and the very limited number of people who would be competent to serve on this commission, we might perhaps await the report of the British Commission before we decide what we can do in this matter.  When we get that report we might find ourselves in a position to do without a commission at all.  It is a probability.  I am not arguing that it is a very strong probability, but it is at least a probability.</P>
    <P>For instance, take the matter with which Senator McGuire seemed to be most concerned, the taxation, shall we say, on trading profits, the allowances <Col N="226" /> to be made for depreciation and replacement and obsolescence in industrial plant and machines.  That has already been investigated by the Tucker Committee in Great Britain, the committee which was set up by the British Chancellor in June, 1949, and which reported in February, 1951.  It was concerned with only a rather narrow sector of the whole income-tax code but it took it almost 20 months to present a report.  It dealt somewhat exhaustively, however, with this question of the allowances which are to be made for depreciation and obsolescence, particularly as these allowances had been affected by the inflationary period in which we now are.</P>
    <P>As the matter has been raised, perhaps I might take this opportunity to put on the records of the House for future reference and for the guidance of those who may be concerned in this matter what this committee had to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the theoretical aspect of the problem, it will suffice to say that we are unable to agree with the view that a proper system of computing profits must necessarily take into account changes in the value of money.  That view is certainly not generally accepted by the majority of accountancy opinion; thus the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, while strongly advocating relief to industry, made it clear that amounts set aside to finance replacements (whether of fixed or current assets) at enhanced costs should be treated not as a deduction in computing profits, but as an appropriation of profits by transfer to reserve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they go on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Quite apart from the weight of authority, however, our own views were strongly against acceptance of a theory which involves departing from known measures of value and dealing in abstractions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before considering the various types of schemes put forward, it will be convenient to mention one objection common to all schemes, namely, <Col N="227" /> that they involve giving preferential treatment to the owners of businesses as against other classes of taxpayer. The non-trader who saved a sum of money before the war and invested it in Government securities or other fixed interest bearing securities finds that it is now worth in terms of real value a half or a third of what it was worth when he invested it.</P>
    <P>The pensioner who draws his pension from a superannuation fund to which he has contributed over his working life may find that the real value of his pension is far less than the real value of the contributions that he and his employers have made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to burden the House or to impose upon your tolerance, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, by continuing to give the results of the detailed examination of all the proposals submitted to the committee, but I would like to give the final conclusion at which this representative body arrived.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After careful consideration of schemes of both classes, namely, revalorisation schemes and schemes for a special replacement allowance, we have decided that we cannot recommend any of them.  Apart from questions of principle, we do not think that any of the suggestions satisfies the tests of being both equitable as between different classes of business, and practicable in administration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, after all, is the result of an investigation into one of the matters which have been put forward as a justification for setting up the commission that the mover of the motion desires.  We have there free of cost to ourselves an investigation into the theory of the various demands that can be made for computing allowances for repair and obsolescence on any other basis than that of historical cost.  We have examined all these proposals and they have been shown to be, in the opinion of the committee at least, unsound.  Any impartial person who gets this report and reads it will agree <Col N="228" /> that the committee was right in the conclusions at which it had arrived.</P>
    <P>If we had time, if we had the personnel, if it could be done without endangering the smooth flow of income-tax into the Exchequer and its collection for the purposes of the revenue, this commission would be desirable.  I have to admit and concede that. Against that, we have limited resources in personnel, and there are many other matters which many members of the Seanad would consider to be more urgent than this.  It would not be right, in the view of many members of the Seanad, that priority should be given to the investigation of this particular problem.</P>
    <P>Taking it by and large, income-tax works with reasonable equity as between one class of taxpayer and another.  It is much lighter here than it is elsewhere, and I think it is, on the whole, more just in its incidence. One does not know what the future may bring, but at any rate when we come to consider next year's Budget and Finance Bill we can give consideration to the possibility of amending and improving the code in a way which will tend to make it more equitable still&mdash; that is, if we can afford it.  If we cannot afford it, if the forecast for next year's revenue does not permit us to do that, I am afraid that, so far as the Government is concerned, we shall have to carry on in the future as we have been doing up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the Seanad more than five minutes.  I do not propose to make a second speech, but I think it would be discourteous to allow the debate to terminate without exercising my right to reply in a few short sentences.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank fellow Senators for the excellent spirit in which they received the motion.  All parts of the House co-operated in helping to put forward this motion and gave a very good example of the way in which non-Party discussion can take place here without acrimony and without people attempting to score debating points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that in putting down this motion I made no reflection whatsoever on the administration of the income-tax code.  In <Col N="229" /> fact, the very efficiency and very keenness of the Revenue Commissioners is one of the grievances from which some taxpayers suffer.</P>
    <P>I would also make it clear that, as I said in the beginning, there is no reflection on the present Government or the present Administration.  It is in that sense I said it is a non-political motion. The present Government has inherited this code from the past.  When I said it is non-political I really meant to say that it is a non-Party motion.  Of course it is political.  The issues involved are of prime political importance.  It is the duty and function of this House to debate political questions.  Therefore, if I were to say it was a non-political motion in the strict sense it really would be irrelevant to the business of the House.</P>
    <P>I want to make just one observation regarding some of the remarks made in the course of the debate by members of the Seanad and one observation regarding the Minister's reply.  As regards the debate, I regret I did not furnish more ammunition to the agricultural members with which to beat me up.  It was perfectly clear that an attack was expected; and, when the attack was not delivered, some of the later speeches were rather concerned with criticising the speech I was expected to make rather than the one I did make.  I apologise for not being more offensive, but I felt I had sufficient ammunition to dispense with an attack on any section of the community. In this matter, we require the co-operation of all sections.  I had no intention of attacking or criticising any section of the community.  That was why I used the words which the Minister has slightly criticised &ldquo;legal evasion&rdquo;.  I simply meant that people take advantage of the law when the law is in their favour.  I quite agree that it is a contradiction in terms.  The reason I used it is that it is a striking phrase and at least it has a respectable paternity.</P>
    <P>I may say that the place where I found it was in a speech made by M. Piney, the Prime Minister of France, who proposes to levy income-tax on the agricultural population according to the basis of the rateable valuation, which in that country is an innovation. <Col N="230" /> It was in connection with the favoured position of the farmers under the present code that the French, with their well-known capacity for epigram, coined the phrase &ldquo;legal evasion&rdquo;.  I assure the Minister that that is the origin of the phrase.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's reply, I really have nothing to quarrel with. He met my case very fairly and certainly I have no intention of wrangling on particular points.  There is one slight criticism I would like to make regarding his observations about the Schedule E taxpayers who receive their income from Government expenditure. He referred to teachers, university professors, civil servants and other people.  It is perfectly true that these people receive part or whole of their income from Government expenditure; but I think it is only fair, as one of those people myself and as a person who represents a great many more of them, to emphasise that if we do receive part of our income from Government expenditure we hope, at least, that we give full value in return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>These large bodies of civil servants, teachers and other Government functionaries are not pensioners or beneficiaries under any State charities; they are being paid for services and I hope that our services are worth what they are being paid. The reason I say this is not any personal one.  I acquit the Minister of any attempt to reduce the debate to a personal level.</P>
      <P>I think it is important from the professional class point of view to insist that the status of professional workers should be maintained in an age when more and more of them are becoming employees of the State in one capacity or another.  The changing status of professional workers is a matter which is engaging a good deal of attention to-day.  In the past professional workers were the bulwark of social stability and political independence. They had freedom to speak their mind and to undertake research which frequently proved of great value to the community.  They were valuable members of the social community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been published recently in <Col N="231" /> England a remarkable book on the dangers of the change in the status of the professional workers, who in medical and other services are more and more becoming salaried employees of the State.  It is because these thoughts are suggested to me by what the Minister said that I am referring to them in this short reply.  The fact that professional people are paid out of State funds is no reason why their status, their independence or their rights should be lowered in any way. In particular, I must insist most emphatically, that, in an age when universities are receiving a larger and larger proportion of their total income in this and other countries from State subventions, it is a matter of extreme importance that the status and independence of university staffs and university professors should still be maintained.  That is perhaps not strictly relevant to the subject of income tax; but perhaps it is not entirely unfair to say those few words, in view of the suggestion that the recipients of Schedule E incomes are in some way or another under an obligation to the Exchequer, which is not the case of the recipients of incomes under any other schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the discussion on this, to my mind, very important Bill I was attempting to point out to the Seanad our appreciation <Col N="232" /> of the Minister for Agriculture for introducing this amending Bill. From the remarks made by Senator Baxter, one would think that this was the first measure that was ever introduced in this House to give the agricultural worker a half-holiday.  I think I have already dealt with that matter.</P>
      <P>It may not be out of place to remind Senator Baxter of the fact that the original Bill was introduced into the Dáil as a Private Members' Bill and that the then Minister for Agriculture would not accept responsibility for implementing the provisions of the Bill without which the Bill would be null and void.  When the Bill came before this House I, as an ordinary member attempted, as best I could by way of putting down amendments, to give some effect to the Bill.  To my amazement I found that the majority Party in this House opposed any suggestion to give effect to the Bill at that time.  I refer to the amendments which I put down to this Bill in 1950.</P>
      <P>Having listened very attentively to Senator Baxter's objections to the implementation of this Bill, I was forced to ask myself one or two questions.  Having done so, the only answer I could reasonably give was that in Cavan they certainly have a very different approach from the rest of Ireland.  When this Bill was originally before this House and the Dáil, we heard from every side that there were very few employers of agricultural labour who would be affected by it because of the good feeling that existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that that good feeling still exists between the farmer and his worker.  If that good feeling does not exist, then there is something wrong in the county of Cavan which is not wrong in the rest of Ireland because throughout the length and breadth of the country I think it is true to say that the farmer and his worker are side by side.  They sit at the same dinner-table and partake of all that is good in rural Ireland.  It is necessary that this Bill should give to the agricultural worker something to which he is not already entitled.  In the majority of cases&mdash;I do not know whether this is true or not in the case of Cavan&mdash;and in the remainder of the 32 counties <Col N="233" /> of Ireland goodwill prevails between the farmer and his employee as can be seen on the occasion of fairs, market days or festivals of any kind.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister for taking responsibility for giving effect to this Bill.  On the last occasion we had a Bill of this kind before the House the then Minister for Agriculture would not and could not because of the make-up of that Government at the time take responsibility to give effect to the Bill.  Senator Baxter makes an annual lamentation.  I am sure it will be the responsibility of the Chairman of this House to lament the passing away of Senator Baxter: he and all of us will pass away sometime. I am sure, when the occasion does arise, that the then Chathaoirleach will be in a very privileged position to announce that our official lamenter has passed away because on every occasion when there was any provision being made to encourage agricultural production, Senator Baxter lamented that there were so many people engaged as agricultural workers. I think he mentioned the figure of 40,000.</P>
    <P>I remember on one or two occasions, when provision was made to give effect to wage increases for county council employees and others, Senator Baxter's voice was loudest in accusing the Government of attracting away from agricultural employment persons who should and could be gainfully employed in agriculture because of the fact that those persons were getting much better facilities through being employed by a local authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter quoted this evening a statement made by His Grace, the Archbishop of Cashel.  I wondered when he quoted that statement how he could construe it to mean anything other than that the persons engaged in agriculture were not getting the same facilities as were given to persons engaged in other activities.  There is an old saying that the devil can quote Scripture to suit himself.  Senator Baxter is one of those persons who can always do that kind of thing.  He talks about increasing production but how are we to increase production if we are going to victimise the people engaged in agricultural production as against <Col N="234" /> those engaged in non-agricultural production?  I think, and the House will agree with me, that if we are to encourage people, and particularly our young people, to go into agriculture the best thing to do is to give them the same facilities and the same opportunities as we give to their brothers going into industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter has done a great disservice to the agricultural community by his speech.  We are all agreed that agriculture is our main arm of industry but if we are to victimise the people engaged in that industry and to say to them that we cannot afford&mdash;and even if we can we will not do so&mdash;to give them the same facilities as we give those engaged in, say, the manufacture of toy dolls for Santa Claus at Christmas, it would be a foolish approach.  If we wish to encourage our people to go into this industry and if we are anxious to hold these people we must at least ensure for them the same hours of work as are enjoyed by their brothers engaged in other industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill, but not with any great enthusiasm, because I think it is a weak Bill.  It is not all we desire and it bristles with safeguards which are not in the best interests of the workers.  However, it at least re-establishes the right of the agricultural worker to a weekly half-holiday. Down through the years, the Labour Party, through its trade unions and organisations, has battled for the right of a weekly-half holiday for agricultural workers.  They brought in a Bill some years ago to establish that right and it was defeated by an overwhelming majority.  In 1950, Deputy Dunne and his Labour colleagues brought in the Private Members' Bill which has been so often referred to in this debate.  It passed through the other House and eventually came to this House.  In fairness to the Senators, I must say that they were very sympathetic and accepted a number of amendments for the improvement of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Bill was passed and placed on the Statute Book, but for some reason or other, did not become operative. <Col N="235" /> The present Bill is a complete replica, although somewhat weaker, of that 1950 Bill, and I do not see any reason why, if the former Minister did not make the necessary provision, the present Minister did not put it into operation 20 months ago.  I doubt if the baby is as strong as the last baby, but we hope to bring in amendments later on and I hope the Seanad will give them the same consideration as they gave the amendments to the 1950 Bill and that the Minister will accept them.  I do not propose to discuss the merits or demerits of the Bill further, except to intimate that we shall certainly bring in some amendments.</P>
    <P>I was surprised by some of the speakers in opposition to this Bill, and particularly Senator Baxter, my next door neighbour.  There is nothing revolutionary or sensational, as Senator Hawkins said, in a weekly half-holiday for agricultural workers.  The County Dublin farm workers have enjoyed that half-holiday for a number of years and the Seanad will agree that the County Dublin farmers, with their early markets and intensive seasonal tillage operations, are a very important body of men.  They evidently see no difficulty in giving their workers a half-holiday. Things seem to be working very smoothly in County Dublin and I do not think there has been a dispute there since the half-holiday was given to farm workers.</P>
    <P>In Wicklow, and particularly north Wicklow, it has been operating for a number of years.  Wicklow is a county which supplies Dublin with milk and most of the farmers are dairy farmers. I was associated with the negotiations at the time and I must say I found them a very reasonable body of men. We made the case that it would be to their benefit to give their workers this half-holiday, that the workers would take a greater interest in their work, that they would be more attentive and more punctual and that the farmers would get a better return.  They accepted the position and gave their workers the half-holiday.  Some of these farmers have met me since and have told me that the statements I made had proved to be true.  They <Col N="236" /> were getting a better return; the men were happier and doing a better job.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in 1952, there is no one in this House or outside it who believes that the farm worker is the next animal to the horse, a man to be harnessed early in the morning, driven to work and then brought home and unharnessed sometime during the night. That day has passed and this half-holiday is long overdue to these people who are the hardest worked people in the land.</P>
    <P>In his support of the Bill, Senator Hawkins had to have a smack at the former Minister for Agriculture and I do not think the present Minister will mind if I have a smack at him on this Bill.  The former Minister did definitely oppose the Bill and vote against it. He had the courage of his convictions, but does Senator Hawkins not remember that, when the division on the Second Reading was called, the whole Fianna Fáil Party scuttled out of the House and refused to vote for it?</P>

      <P>We should approach this measure in a reasonable frame of mind.  I was surprised to hear from the opposite benches two diametrically opposed views and I hasten to assure Senator Baxter that he is unduly perturbed as to the effect of this provision for a weekly half-holiday for farm workers.  I am speaking as a man who has some slight experience as an employer of the operation of this weekly half-holiday.  We have been giving this holiday over a number of years and I find it does not interfere with the operation of the farm, nor has it decreased production.  Senator Baxter has stated that production has not increased over the past 50 years, but surely that could not be laid at the door of the agricultural workers?  The problem of increased production is one that must be tackled by the farmers concerned and the Department.  That is their job and it would be wrong to put blame for any lack of increased production on the farm labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not do that and I am not attempting to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The inference is there. If agricultural production has been reduced over the last 50 years it must be remembered that the workers did not have a half-holiday during that time.  I believe that where there is co-operation and where the employer treats his employee in a reasonable and humane manner he will get a better return from the operation of the weekly half-holiday than he would get by compelling the man to work against his will.  Where there are good relations between the two parties you will get a better return.  When we see other employees in the towns where they are well organised getting these amenities, surely we should not deny them to one section of the community only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that the farmers cannot afford to give their workers a half-holiday, but I do not believe that is quite true.  I believe that any cost it might involve can be met by increased production and that it can be met by better cultivation of the land, better manuring and better management. <Col N="238" /> These three things done well will give more production than we are now getting from the land.</P>
    <P>We are told that people are leaving the land and I agree that that is true, but if you want to encourage the workers to stay on the land then you have to give them some of the amenities which other workers enjoy and which have been denied to them in the past.  Conditions have been improved in rural Ireland over the last 50 years and people who return to the country after a long absence are surprised at the great improvements which they now find in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>If there is co-operation between the farmers on the one hand and the Department on the other hand, and we have some intelligent scheme of operating the land, and if the workers can be kept contented on it, then we will have the necessary increased production. The average farm worker worked from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. for six days in the week and found it difficult to get in to make the necessary purchases for himself and his family.</P>
    <P>Surely he is entitled to a few hours off in the week in which to do those things?  I have always found that where there is a proper spirit of co-operation the worker will not object at times when there is a rush of work, such as saving the harvest, to work his time off when his employer is prepared to pay him the few extra shillings he is entitled to for doing that.  The giving of this half-holiday will not in any way impair production on the farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Grady has covered much of the ground which I had intended dealing with and for a County Dublin farmer I congratulate him on the statement that he has made.  I cannot leave this House without taking great exception to the statement made this afternoon by Senator Baxter.  In that statement Senator Baxter cast a reflection on the workers of Ireland when he said that in this city there was a wealth of laziness.  I think he ought to be ashamed of himself and should have the graciousness to withdraw this statement, which is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish workers are famed in every <Col N="239" /> part of the world to which they have gone for having given an honest return for their pay.  The Irish workers have had to face the world through the years because of oppression and because of lack of employment which in former years forced them to emigrate.  We have never heard from even the greatest enemies of Ireland any criticism of the workers from Ireland who have always done their job honestly, and the statement made by Senator Baxter is very wrong. I hope he will withdraw it.  Is it any wonder that the agricultural workers are inclined to leave the land if they are not given reasonable conditions of employment?</P>
    <P>I worked as a farm labourer.  It is amazing to me that people would have the spirit to remain farm labourers. Take County Dublin.  A farm labourer receives £4 10s. 0d.  His brother who comes into the city and works at any occupation receives at least £2 more than that, and I do not say that that is too much, and he has his half-holiday, good conditions of employment, annual holidays and everything else.  Yet Senator Baxter thinks that the way to prosper farming and the country generally is to give no concession to the poor fellow who remains on the farm.  If the case were to be put to any reasonable judge, he would be inclined to say that the man who remains on the farm must be a kind of omadhaun when his brother who goes to the city can earn £6 and £7.</P>
    <P>I would like to see workers remaining on the land.  Agriculture is our main industry.  Farmers and farm labourers are the backbone of the nation.  The Dáil and Seanad could adjourn until next June, until the next Budget would be required, and the nation would carry on but if the farm workers sat down next spring we would all die of hunger next year.  They are the most important section within the nation and yet there is a member of this House who states that they are not entitled to a half-holiday or should not get a half-holiday.  He views with amazement the fact that we have a Minister for Agriculture who would bring forward such a Bill.  It is a <Col N="240" /> devilish statement to be made by any Senator and I protest against it in the strongest possible manner.  I feel such a statement so keenly that it has put me off the points I should like to make.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for bringing in an amending Bill.  If there is any little further amendment, we who support Labour will appreciate it as I am sure every Senator will.  We have heard a great deal about the flight from the land.  That flight is due to conditions on the land.  Speaking now as a farmer, I say that farmers were never better off than they are, or got better prices for their produce.  I do not say that they are in a position to give very big wages but I say with all sincerity that if they are not in a position to give to their workers big wages and the holidays and conditions of employment enjoyed by industrial workers, they should be put into a position to do so, or if not, be subsidised to that end.  Why should any man work in the field and produce for the other people who have four times and six times his wages and salaries?  Industrial workers will get further increases while the farm labourer who produces their food is not able to have a half-holiday.  I am glad that that position is about to be remedied.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  While it does not give much to the farm labourer, it will show him that the members of the Oireachtas recognise his sad plight. Senator Baxter stated that the farm labourer in this Bill is getting a month's holidays.  I would suggest to Senator Baxter that if he has in employment any farm labourer and if he makes an offer to him of a half-holiday or a month's holiday that he would take the month's holiday.  I would be glad if we could afford to give the farm labourer a month's holiday.  Unfortunately, I will not live to see the day when that will be possible but I hope that younger people will live to see it. Some agricultural labourers hardly ever went to school; some of them were practically illiterate, but they were highly intelligent men and by their skill converted an acre that had a grazing value of £4 or £5 into land that produced £60 of food for the nation.  They <Col N="241" /> were honest men.  999 out of any 1,000 farm labourers would never leave a field and see the crops going to waste.  They are too honest and too scrupulous.  It is a tragedy that they are a class that is dying out. I know that in County Dublin they are as honest and as anxious about their employer's prosperity as their employers are and in many cases more anxious than members of the employer's family.</P>
    <P>We must all give credit to Deputy Dunne for introducing a Private Bill. I am sorry that there was a flaw in that Bill but I am glad that the Minister has rectified it.</P>
    <P>In public life we want honesty and truth.  I do not mind who it is that does anything to benefit the most deserving class, I am prepared to give him credit.  On the other hand, I do not care who the man may be who tries to put down the workers&mdash;I am speaking as a person who has worked with every class&mdash;any man is wrong who gets up and takes advantage of membership of this House to make little of the workers and to say that this is a city of laziness.  I say that it is an untruth and that the workers of the city do not deserve that.  You will find isolated cases of slackers.</P>
    <P>In all sections of workers you will find an odd slacker.  The majority of the Irish working-class people want work and wages and there is no blame to them for looking for conditions of employment, particularly when they see how soft others get money and good conditions of employment.  Irish workers went to America, England and Scotland and not only did they earn enough to support themselves but they earned what kept their parents in reasonable comfort at home in Ireland. Their greatest enemy never said of them what has been said in this House this evening&mdash;that they were lazy.  I resent it and I say that it is an untruth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to give credit to somebody for introducing the principle of half-holidays for agricultural workers, in fairness, Deputy Seán Dunne is the name that first comes to mind.  I am glad to see that <Col N="242" /> the flaws in the Bill that he introduced are being rectified because an agricultural worker is as entitled to a half-holiday as anybody else.  As a small farmer who rarely could afford to employ any farm labour, and coming from a county of such farmers, I feel that this Bill is legalising something that is already in existence.</P>
      <P>We admit the agricultural labourer had no authority to claim a half-holiday but for many years past the average farmer has never denied him a half-day to go here or there so long as the farmer was treated respectfully, and he kept the closest co-operation between them.  Farming is a seasonal type of work and it is hard to have fixed hours or fixed regulations.</P>
      <P>In the dairying section this will be a most unpopular measure.  The farm labourer is as industrious a worker as anyone else, but in nine cases out of ten he is not one bit more hardworking than his employer.  He receives honest pay for an honest week's work but it falls on the employer to bear all the burdens and headaches of management. On Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings you often find farmers and their sons have a harder life than any other type of worker in the country.  Dairy farmers will not give this Bill as good a reception as it may get in other parts of the country.  In the mixed tillage areas it will be different.  In that case there is much to be done in the springtime and in the summer there is the haymaking and then the harvest; but in the winter it slackens off and then the amount of work done by everyone drops considerably. It is difficult to know in such cases whether it is right or wrong to introduce a Bill of this kind, which may cut across the good friendship and good fellowship between farmer and employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we have this Bill before us and a high percentage of the members of the Oireachtas, here and in the Dáil, are in favour of it, so it is only right that it should get its chance and that the workers should get the half-holiday. It is hard to compare the agricultural worker with the industrial worker who starts at a certain hour in the morning and continues practically <Col N="243" /> the same type of work day in and day out, week in and week out.  The industrial worker has regular hours and in wet or fine weather he can attend to his bench and screw on nuts or weld pieces together or cut clothing. It is work of a regular type which he can quite at 12.30 or 1 o'clock and start again at 2 o'clock.  Even if there is snow he can put in the same volume of work.  That cannot happen on a farm.</P>
    <P>In the summer time the agricultural worker has to deal with the harvest but if the morning is wet he cannot touch it until the day clears up and the farmer must find something else for him to do.  Very often he is not asked to do any other work, or if he works around the farmyard his labour does more harm than good.  On the whole, when the weather is bad he has an easy time.  Against that, when the day turns fine and the rush is on, he must put his shoulder to the wheel and work much harder than the industrial worker.  If he is a conscientious worker&mdash;and with few exceptions they all are&mdash;he must bend his back and do more than a man's share.  He does that knowing it may not be so hard the next day, as there may be some break in the weather or something else wrong.  It is one of the peculiarities of agriculture that we are not faced with in industrial life.</P>
    <P>In 99 cases out of 100 at present every agricultural worker enjoys the confidence of his employer and, except on some very large farms where there are regular hours of employment, they are never regimented to the last hour of the day.  The worker can have an easy time for an hour or two one day and an hour the next.  The industrial worker in the machine shop cannot have that.  His work is before him on the bench and he must keep up a certain amount of production and go at the same pace the whole time.  The farm work varies according to the season and cannot be compared with industrial work.</P>
    <P>It is only fair now to let the agricultural labourers get the half-holiday. They may not have the headaches or burdens that their employers have, but <Col N="244" /> they do honest work, they are the lowest paid type of labour in the State and they are as much entitled to the half-holiday as anyone else.  Under this Bill they have the option of not accepting the half-holiday, of working for the employer instead.  I would much prefer to see, instead of this half-holiday Bill, the system of working carried on as at present, with security given to the farmer to enable him to pay them a much better wage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of doing that, we expect a good young man to continue to stick working on a farm for £4 or £4 10s. 0d. a week, when he could go into any small town where there is a scheme of county council houses or other building work and get almost double those wages for the same hours.  Our aim should be, not so much to regimentalise the workers in agriculture as to give their employers an opportunity to pay a much better wage.  Personally, while I welcome the Bill and support it, I make no secret of my belief that in many cases, practically without exception, the good fellowship that exists between farmer and employee was accepted as good enough by the vast majority of agricultural labourers.</P>
      <P>Take the man who had a house on his employer's land.  How many perquisites does he get that the industrial worker does not get?  He has free milk &mdash;no farmer would see his labourer's family short of milk&mdash;he has potatoes, fuel and a garden for vegetables.  In many cases, I know fairly large and extensive farmers who do not begrudge to their labourers, as well as wages, the grazing of a cow to supplement the milk supply.  That is a system of good fellowship.  Whether this legalising of the actual conditions under which the men work will be successful or not I do not know.  However, we are accepting this measure and I hope it will be successful.</P>

      <P>I regret I cannot speak with the experience of a farmer, yet I am all out to give the agricultural labourer his half-holiday.  I come from a county where you could count <Col N="245" /> on the fingers of two hands the people who are in a position to employ farm labour.  I had not the opportunity of coming in contact with such labourers, as Senators in other counties have done.  I quite agree with the viewpoint of those Senators who stated that this proposition will not work out so easily as in other employments. That is pretty evident, as Senator Commons pointed out.</P>
      <P>The success of this Bill depends not so much on the regulations as on the mutual co-operation between employer and employee.  If they co-operate, this legislation will be a success.  I am sorry that the vast majority of farmers cannot have a half-holiday for themselves, but that is beside the question. Those in a position to employ labour have, in most cases, good relations with their workers.  I am satisfied that the passing of this Bill will not worsen those relations and that the spirit of co-operation, the interest and concern of the labourer for his employer and the interest on the part of the employer in the labourer's comfort will continue after this Bill has been carried into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from an area where very little employment is given to farm labourers, where the majority are small farmers who do not employ many agricultural workers, I feel I must agree with everything that Senator Commons has said, and it is only necessary for me to dot his Is. and cross his Ts.  I would like to emphasise the point he made about the regimentation of hours and the reasons which he has put forward very forcibly. That point applies especially to hay making and harvesting times.  There are parts of the day and parts of the week when the weather has been bad and&mdash;with the exception of this year&mdash; that has been a nightmare for farmers for years past.  If agricultural workers are legally compelled to work those hours and there is a strict code of regimentation laid down, it will not be good.  It would be a pity to interfere with the old principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak with experience of 40 or 50 years of living amongst those people and I can vouch for the co-operation that existed between the workers and <Col N="246" /> their employers.  Very few employers ever left their workers or their families short of milk.  If necessary, they had a small place for a garden and were never denied the use of a plot of land, a rood or half an acre, to till.  I speak from personal experience of the feelings that exist between them.  I have never seen places where those workers have been separated from the farmer's family at the family table.  I know from people in dairying districts that it is the farmers in those districts who will have the greatest difficulty, especially in the case of milking large herds of cows.  I do not know what can be done.  There is a growing disinclination, even amongst farmers' sons, to do this work on Sundays.  If things get worse in that respect and unless we can rely on milking machines, I am afraid the general population will suffer in the absence of a supply of fresh milk at week-ends.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill and feel there is not a farmer in the country who would refuse a half-holiday on account of any monetary loss.  The main difficulty is probably the great inconvenience it may cause in dairying districts and the trouble it may cause through regimentation in other districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principle of a weekly half-holiday for agricultural workers was freely accepted and there was not any serious opposition to it in this House when the 1950 Act was introduced.  I did not object to the general principle in the 1950 Act and, therefore, I am not objecting to the general principle of the Bill now introduced, although I will say that in the 1950 Act I was responsible for an amendment which I thought improved the Act in the hope of making it more workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach to a measure like this should be to make it more workable having regard to the interests of the agricultural employers and the agricultural workers.  I think it was in that spirit that the 1950 Act was met in this House.  I should hope that it is in that spirit that this Bill will be approached.  Since that is the case in regard to this Bill it is hardly the best thing for Senator McCrea to try to <Col N="247" /> score just a little point by offering a reason why the Fianna Fáil Party acted as it did when the 1950 Act was passing through the Dáil.  Many people might be inclined to suggest reasons why that happened, but surely the most practical, the most sensible and, indeed, the real explanation would be that the Minister for Agriculture was not prepared to sponsor that measure and that then the onus would be put on the Fianna Fáil Party in putting the measure into operation.</P>
    <P>Senator McCrea knows that quite well.  That is why the present Minister should be congratulated.  At any rate he is practical.  There seemed to be quite a lot of window-dressing in relation to the 1950 Act.  It was within the competence and ability of the promoters of the 1950 Act to insert some little section like Section 12 of the present measure whereby officers of the Agricultural Wages Board may take proceedings on behalf of a worker. That was not done.</P>
    <P>When Senator McCrea made that suggestion I am inclined to reply by saying at this stage that there was a lot of window-dressing in connection with the 1950 Act.  I repeat that nothing was done, such as putting in Section 11 or Section 12 which is inserted in this Bill and which has the effect of making the measure one that will work in practice.</P>
    <P>The agricultural workers are just as well entitled to a half-holiday as any other group of workers.  It is unfortunate surely that in many cases the wage level and the working conditions of agricultural workers are not as good as you would find in comparable employment outside rural areas.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Commons that the good relationship which exists between the agricultural workers and their employers will continue.  I hope that this measure, while improving the conditions of the agricultural workers, will also ensure the continuance of that good relationship.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  I did not hear Senator Baxter speak.  I have often clashed with Senator Baxter.  We <Col N="248" /> often say things to each other.  We often attack each other.  I do not think I had ever occasion to say to him or he to me the things Senator Tunney said to him.</P>

I feel that the Minister should be congratulated as he is in practice ensuring that some Act that has been passed is improved and made operative.  As I have said, nothing was done under the 1950 Act to ensure that it could work in practice. It is an undesirable thing for a legislature to legislate without ensuring that the legislation works in practice. In that sense the Minister is to be congratulated on ensuring that power is taken under the Act to see that it works.</P>

      <P>I opposed the original measure when it came before the House in 1950.  In opposing it I thought it was not practicable.  I am opposing this measure for exactly the same reason.  In the province of Munster what has happened in almost every case is that the farmer is paying his labourer for the half-day.  I suggest to the Minister that the matter could be better met by the Agriculural Wages Board increasing the wages than by giving the men a half-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This half-day can be the source of contention between the farmer and the farm worker.  We all admire the wonderful comradeship they have shown through the land struggle and <Col N="249" /> the way they worked together.  They showed a real example of Christian neighbourliness.  Do not let any town-inspired demagogues come along and suggest that the farmer and the farm labourer are not able to do a good job in their own vocation, because they are.  I believe that the farm worker is probably the most responsible worker that we have in this nation.</P>
    <P>Many of the farm workers look after farms for their owners.  They look after valuable stock and crops and they must know all about crop rotation. They must know the elements of veterinary attention in relation to animals.  I believe they are about the most highly skilled class of workers in the whole community.  The one regret I have is that they are not getting a fairer share of the national income.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister&mdash;I am sure he is aware of the figures already&mdash;that it is shown in the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> recently published that the net income from Irish agriculture is £143,000,000.  That would mean less than £2 per head per week for everybody living by agriculture in this country.  How can we in towns impose conditions on that vocation while it is our duty to help to increase the income from agriculture?</P>
    <P>I would further like to point out that this survey shows that the agricultural community are the main producers of wealth and embrace half the population. In round figures they get approximately 30 per cent. of the total national income.</P>
    <P>That is maldistribution.  It is not distributive justice.  The greatest enemies of distributive justice are the people in the towns who believe in working for short hours under good conditions.  Those who believe in permanent and pensionable jobs, retiring at an early age and working short hours during that period are all taking some of the difference between 30 per cent. and at least 50 per cent. which the agricultural community are entitled to get.</P>
    <P>We will not improve their position until there is a change of heart between the people who live in the towns and those working in other vocations in the <Col N="250" /> country.  The greatest national need is for increased agricultural production. I believe we can only get that by a change of heart on the part of the whole administration of this country and all those people who are working in the secondary industries.  Those who work on the land are the most important economic factor in the nation. Let us not give them sops like half-days which they themselves find are not really practicable.</P>
    <P>I know that in our area, in South Tipperary and North Waterford, the farmers are paying the men for the half-day and it is not recognised.  In conclusion, I think the Minister could deal with that situation much better and much more realistically through the Agricultural Wages Board than he can deal with it by the Bill he has now brought before the House.</P>

      <P>I must thank Senator Hayes for his approach to this Bill. He welcomed the principle of it.  In the other House, when I had this Bill before it, I had an assurance from Deputy Sweetman on behalf of the Fine Gael Party that it had that Party's approval, but I was amazed when I came into the Seanad this evening to find a representative of the farming community, in the person of Senator Baxter, getting up and making an unwarranted attack on the agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a farmer, the same as Senator Baxter and I have as much experience of farm labourers as he has. I have known them all my life and I have worked with them and it would be unfair of me if I stood up without registering my protest against the unwarranted attack made on them. We have heard a lot about the front line trenches during the emergency period.  Who were the people who manned these trenches?  Who were the people who fed the people in our towns and cities?  The farmers were unable to do it themselves.  They had to get assistance, and where did that assistance come from?  That assistance came <Col N="251" /> from one section of the community&mdash; the agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>I have made the statement on many occasions that the agricultural worker was the worst paid individual in this country and I reiterate that statement to-night.  I also state that if it were within my province, while I am Minister for Agriculture, to place him in his proper sphere, the sphere in which he should be, he would be in a sphere up above any other workers we have.</P>
      <P>I see no reason&mdash;I have already made the statement&mdash;why a road worker, a forestry worker, a builder's labourer should be entitled to a higher wage than an agricultural worker and why better conditions should be provided for the men in these categories.  Consequently, I make no apology to anybody for bringing in this Bill to provide a half-day for the agricultural worker.  Neither was it necessary to push me to bring it in.</P>
      <P>When the Bill of 1950 was being discussed, we in the Fianna Fáil Party refused to vote for it on Second Reading, not because we did not approve of it and not because we did not agree with it, in principle, but simply because the Government of the day refused to sponsor the measure and refused to make provision for its operation, if it did become law.  That was the reason. There are in this Bill three sections, Sections 8, 11 and 12, which make provision for putting this Bill into operation. When the Second Reading was passed, the Bill went to a Select Committee and I was one of the members of that committee.  I did my best, and so did my Fianna Fáil colleagues, to make that Bill workable, and, when we brought it back to the Dáil in the form in which it was then, we thought that, even at that stage, it would have been accepted and sponsored by the then Government, and we voted for it. It was not made operative simply because no machinery was made available for putting it into execution and that is the reason it was necessary for me, in 1952, to bring forward a measure to give a half-holiday to the agricultural worker.</P>

There is no use now in people who supported that Government at that time getting up and trying to make excuses in a wishy-washy way for their actions on that occasion.  Senator Baxter must still believe that the same conditions should obtain on the farm for agricultural workers as obtained 50 and 60 years ago.

I am glad, as a farmer. to be the Minister for Agriculture who introduced this measure to place the agricultural worker in his rightful position. <Col N="253" /> Senator Baxter surely does not suggest that the agricultural worker should be kept in the same position as he was in at that period, when he had to go, hat in hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, and if it were not for the help and assistance which the agricultural workers gave to the farmers, large and small, down through the years, this country would not be even as good as it is to-day.  It is the duty of any Minister for Agriculture, if he has any regard for agriculture, if he wants to improve agriculture and increase production, to make conditions in agriculture equally as good as they are in any other industry, and, unless that is done, we are still going to have that flight from the land of which we have evidence all around us. Why have we that flight from the land?</P>
      <P>Is it not due to the conditions and amenities obtainable in other employment? You have the flight here to the City of Dublin where houses are being built.  For whom are you building these houses?  You are building them for the people who flew from the land five or six years ago.  You are continuing to build them and will continue to build them until conditions on the land are made equally as good for workers on the land as they are for the persons engaged in building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I say that unless and until conditions are made as good on the land as they are in other employment you will have a continuation of that flight.  You have the amenities of <Col N="254" /> your towns and cities&mdash;water, light, amusements, dance-halls and cinemas and that sort of thing.  What amenities has the agricultural worker? To-day he has got some of them, of course, because rural electrification has brought them to him, but now he will have this additional amenity of a weekly half-holiday, to which he is entitled.  In getting that he is not getting anything more than his brother who is working in the forests or on the roads.  It has been suggested that this measure is going to have a depressing effect on agricultural production but I do not agree that it is going to have any such effect.</P>
    <P>The weekly half-holiday has been in operation in a number of counties for a number of years and it has not done any harm, nor is it going to do any harm now.  There are provisions in this Bill whereby if the farmer and the workers agree the worker will not get the half-holiday.  It is not enforceable if agreement between the two parties is reached that the half-holiday will not be taken and that the worker will, instead, be paid for it.  If the half-holiday is given on farms with, say, two, three or four men, it can then be staggered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose there is only one man employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is, that also can be arranged.  The number of hours can be arranged by mutual agreement.  It does not necessarily follow that there are fixed hours if there is mutual agreement between the employer and employee.</P>
      <P>One would imagine from some of the statements made that we were going to have a revolution in the country, a sort of war between the agricultural worker and the farmer just because the workman is to be given a weekly half-holiday.  We are not going to have any such thing, nor are we going to have less production as a result, Senator Baxter knows as well as I do that often in the month of November neither the workman nor the farmer can go into the fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>But the workman would <Col N="255" /> be paid all the time and you are going to bring that to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been responsible in the past for any reduction in agricultural production because provision was made for it.  It has been known that for periods of three months no work could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And again the men were paid all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>And yet even in those circumstances the time was made up and there was no reduction in production and this half-holiday is not going to interfere with it either.</P>
      <P>I was surprised when Senator McCrea talked about the principle being re-established in my mind of giving a half-holiday to farm workers. I never lost the principle of giving that half-holiday, so I do not see that it would ever have to be reintroduced into my mind.  If I had not always believed in the principle of a half-holiday for agricultural workers, then I would never have introduced this measure.</P>
      <P>The only question to be answered here during the debate is the question of principle.  Senator Baxter opposed the principle of giving this half-holiday and so did Senator Burke.  These are the only two people, I think, who opposed it.  Senator Hayes welcomed the Bill on behalf of those on that side of the House.</P>

      <P>I ask the Seanad not to accept the statements made by Senator Burke and Senator Baxter who, on reflection, I am sure will regret the statements they made and who, on reflection, I know also will not find the difficulties which they thought to be in this Bill.  It is a workable Bill and it is not going to do any harm to agriculture or to agricultural production because we can now have more satisfied people prepared to remain on the land for the simple reason that they are now given a place in society equal to that of other workers.  That is about all that this Bill gives to this section of the community, which is the only section that has so far been denied the weekly half-holiday.</P>
      <P>I thought that Senator Baxter might have said that the farmers were not getting it, but he did not.  It is true to say that the last section of workers to get this privilege were the agricultural workers and it is my pleasure to introduce the Bill which gives it to them and to ask this House to pass the Bill as it stands with the amendments which I will introduce at a later Stage.</P>
