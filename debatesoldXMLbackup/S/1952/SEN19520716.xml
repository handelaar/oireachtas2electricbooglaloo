      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading, Senator Ruane raised a question on this section as to what exactly it was possible to do under it.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1770" /> I was not able to be here and, as we have not had the Official Debates, I do not know what the position is.  I would like clarification of this section. The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and subject to regulations made under this section, make, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to a person providing and installing in a dwelling-house a private water supply and sewerage facilities, a grant not exceeding £50, if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does that presuppose the installation of both water and sewerage or, if a person desired to advance by slow stages and install a water supply first, is it possible to have portion of the grant made available to him?  Under the schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture, as far as I know, the grant is made available only where the water supply is taken from springs or some supply that would be regarded as permanent.  Is it possible for the owner of premises to trap water and provide a supply which he would regard as adequate or which the engineer operating under this scheme may regard as adequate, and secure portion of the grant under this section?  While the section is clear in one sense, its full implications are not very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not see the Senator's difficulty.  I thought it was clear enough here.  Where the applicant provided water and sewerage&mdash; that seems to be clear enough.  I understand what the Senator means by taking it in stages, but there is no mention of taking it in stages there.  It means water and sewerage; it means the installation of these amenities in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are conscious, of course, of the fact that the Department of Agriculture administers a scheme which is different from this scheme inasmuch as a grant is payable where the house is merely connected with water; in other words, where the water is taken to the house and tapped into the kitchen. There is, therefore, a substantial difference between what is provided for in <Col N="1771" /> the scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture and what is proposed here.  It is intended under this section to provide a grant for the installation of water and sewerage by a private person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has answered to Senator Commons, quite adequately, a point that I wished to raise.  Is there any machinery thought out in respect of the procedure for applying for these grants and paying them?  The wording of the section, if interpreted strictly, would seem to confine the payment of the grant to the period when the work is actually being done.  I assume that that is not the intention and that what the Minister has in mind is that, once a person genuinely sets about doing the work, he can be paid either during the course of the progress of the work or when the officials are satisfied that the work has been completed.</P>
      <P>The net point I want to make is this. Is it the intention that the grant be given when the work is in progress, or that the grant be delayed until some officials are satisfied that the work has been satisfactorily carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The same procedure is followed as in the building or reconstructing of a house.  If a man applies for a reconstruction grant or for a <Col N="1772" /> grant to build a new house, he must follow certain procedure; he must make application for the grant, and it is only when he gets an approval certificate that he can go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (b) of this section provides that the installation of the water and sewerage facilities must be completed on or before the 1st April, 1954.  If, for any reason, such installation was not completed, the person concerned would not qualify for the grant.  It seems to me that some provision should be made for contingencies such as a strike.  The section appears very strict as it stands. It would be better if the Minister or the Department had some discretion in the matter in the way of lengthening the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Our housing legislation has always been on that basis.  It has never been suggested that when this Act expires on the 31st March, 1954, any individual erecting or reconstructing a house or installing amenities such as water and sewerage will not get the grant if he has not completed the job by that date.  The position is that he will be covered by housing legislation that will follow at a later date.  That has always been the case down the years.  It is true that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will expire on the 31st March, 1954, or on such other date as the proposals to take its place will have passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by the Minister.  This is something I raised before.  I do not think the provisions embodied in this Bill are the best way of dealing with the matter.  It seems to me that it would be very much better if there had been a sort of interregnum of three or six months allowed, because there is always the possibility that an Act of this kind may not be continued in its existing form.  What has happened is that there has been a certain amount of uneasiness, certainly in the case of building, until the intention of the Government to bring in a new Act has been made known.  It has never been quite clear to me why an Act of this kind should be only for a two-year <Col N="1773" /> period.  I think the procedure should be adopted of allowing three months extra so as to complete work started before the expiration of an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Even three months or six months would give no safeguard at all, because there are cases in which work undertaken under this Bill may not be completed even by the year 1956.  I feel it is better that the procedure followed down the years should be continued.  Take the present Bill under discussion, for instance.  It was not circulated to the public until the 29th April of this year&mdash;a month after the date on which the former Act expired. When this Bill becomes an Act, it will take effect only from the date on which it was published.  If we were to add a period of three, four, five or six months to the expiring date, the 1st April, 1954, it would be found that injustice would be done to a large number of people who would not have been able to complete their building projects by that time.  As I said already, it is better to leave the procedure as it has been for the past 20 years.  I must say that I have no knowledge at all of any injustice having been done because a building project had not been completed within the time specified in the Act under which the person concerned made application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason why there should have been a precedent for a two-year Bill?  Is there any reason why a certain Bill should not have been allowed to stand and amendments added to it year by year?  It seems such a waste of time that a new Housing Bill should be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas every two years.  The present Housing Bill appears to cater for all existing circumstances. If these circumstances should change with the passage of time, new amendments could be added to this Bill to provide for them.  The points to which Senator Douglas referred are worthy of notice.  I fail to understand why it is necessary to introduce a new Housing Bill every two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure of introducing a new Housing Bill every two years has been adopted by my Department, and I do not think there is anything <Col N="1774" /> wrong with that.  It does not make much difference whether a new Bill is introduced every two years or whether certain amendments, found necessary owing to changing circumstances or with the passage of time, are added to an existing Bill.  Through the experience gained by local bodies, certain amendments suggest themselves as being necessary.  Therefore, it is thought wise and proper that new legislation should be introduced after the expiration of a period of two years. One could argue on the point raised by Senator O'Donnell, but I do not think there is anything in it.  One may as well be discussing a new Housing Bill in this House now as discussing amendments to the 1950 Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that I did not suggest there would be any injustice done in the circumstances I mentioned.  What I did suggest and do suggest is that the period prescribed in the Bill is not sufficient. I am not referring so much to the installation of water and sewerage facilities as to building proper.  I think something should be embodied in the new Bill to get over these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to use the word &ldquo;injustice&rdquo;; I should have used the word &ldquo;hardship&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get back to the point I raised originally with regard to the grant being made available under existing legislation for the installation of private water supplies and sewerage facilities.  This is very desirable and very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this is something which, so far as many of our country people are concerned, will have to be tackled by slow stages, and I suggest that the Minister, in making the regulations, might provide that as portion of the work was completed a proportion of the grant could be made available. There must be a water supply before there can be sewerage facilities, but the cost of installation of sewerage facilities is at an extravagantly high level to-day and I feel that it should be possible to help people along where they decide to take on all this work at the same time.  If you help them to install the water supply, the other <Col N="1775" /> will follow automatically.  If it were possible to provide that a proportion of the total grant will be made available as a support for the first part of the scheme, it would be a definite encouragement to getting the whole scheme taken on.  I feel that you will get more done in that way and I urge that that point be given consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am neither a mason nor a plumber, but there is at the moment a grant obtainable by a rural dweller from the Department of Agriculture for the provision of water to a dwelling house.  The grant specified in this section is provided for the installation of the water system in the house, and, when you start to install a water system, I should say, even though I am not a plumber, that the only practical way to approach it is to take the two together, to complete the job.  I find it difficult to see how it could be approached in any other way.  The water is on the threshold and I do not see what you could do with the water, unless you provide both services. The intention of the section is the encouragement of people who provide these facilities.  I am perfectly aware that this is a costly business and that it will be a slow process.  I am aware, too, that many people will not be able to take advantage of it, but it is designed to encourage those who are in a reasonable position to do so to take advantage of it.  I am afraid that I could not by a process of regulation make the thing any more simple than the section intends it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that a person can get the benefit of two grants, one from the Department of Agriculture and the other from the Minister's Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I did not intend to give that impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought not.  The Department of Agriculture grant is in respect of the erection of a tank and cost of piping, and so much is allowed for the provision of a sink in the kitchen, but that grant cannot be made available in addition to this grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1776" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which I was not clear about until to-day with regard to a hot and cold water system.  It is desirable, and it is the Minister's intention in this Bill, that both hot and cold water systems should be available in each house, and I understood that a person had to have both hot and cold water before getting the benefit of the grant.  The Minister has made it quite clear that he can benefit by having a cold water supply only.  If a bathroom is erected and a bath installed, there is not much use in having a cold water system only, and hot water is also very desirable in the kitchen.  We know, however, that the cost of installing the hot water section of the system would be a good deal more expensive than the installation of the cold water section.  I should like to know if the Minister considers £50 adequate?  Would it be possible at this stage to amend the provision to enable a separate grant to be made available in respect of the installation of the cold water supply and an additional grant of £50 or £25&mdash; whatever the Minister might think feasible&mdash;in respect of the installation of a hot water system as well?  The cost of copper piping, tubing and baths is very high, and I feel that, as we have gone so far in this very desirable section, we should go a little further and bring it as near to perfection as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is thinking of the ideal thing, and those who can afford the ideal thing will have it. Those who cannot will have to do with something which is not the ideal.  There is no prohibition against those who can afford to install the hot and cold water systems doing so, and they will get the grant mentioned here, but there are people who could not, and it is these people we are trying to encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any confusion about this, may I say that this is merely a grant to encourage people to do something?  It does not purport to cover anything like the cost of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a bad effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1777" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say from years of practical experience as a builder that the person who will get water and sewerage facilities supplied to a house in a rural area for £50 is doing extremely well.  With regard to Senator Baxter's suggestion as to making portion of the grant available for portion of the work, from my practical experience, I know that the person who would attempt to avail of this grant would come off much better by doing as much as possible, by bringing the water supply in, even if it were only a cold water supply, and providing sewerage facilities, rather than splitting it up, because the cost of the two bites would be far greater than the original cost.</P>
      <P>There is one suggestion I want to make to the Minister with regard to framing the regulations in respect of the grant under Section 7.  The Local Government Department has been very helpful ever since the Housing Act of 1932 in issuing the standard plans indicating the type of house which would qualify for a grant.  That system has been continued down through the years and, as I say, these plans have been very valuable in giving people down the country an idea of what is required.  I suggest that a standard specification should be made available for such things as the erection of a tank, the bottom of which in many cases might be the roof of the bathroom.  Care requires to be taken to ensure that it is a watertight job.  Many people will do this work by direct labour or by themselves, and it would be very wise if the Department issued some sort of standard specification and plan for that particular type of work, the erection of a bathroom as an adjunct to an existing farmhouse as a guide for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what I have said about hot and cold water systems, I agree that my proposal was as near as possible to the ideal scheme, but we now find that the ideal scheme is only ideal for the person who has a little extra money to enable him to put the hot water part of the scheme into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be possible now&mdash;I would not be asking for too much&mdash;for the Minister to consider that this grant <Col N="1778" /> could only be paid where there was hot and cold water?  I can assure him that I thought that this covered both. I would have put down an amendment, but I know that it is useless to put in an amendment at this stage unless the Minister is prepared to accept it. The Minister knows as well as I do that people who are engaged in hard labour, such as farmers, cannot derive full benefit from the scheme unless they have hot water.  Maybe small farmers and labourers cannot afford it, but it would be a good thing to give them extra encouragement, so that they, as well as their better-off neighbours, could have a hot-water scheme.  I am, of course, in the Minister's hands, but I think the suggestion is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would give us some clear idea of how the income will be arrived at under sub-section (2).  Does this mean that every different housing authority can make its own rules to decide what is income?  In the case of other means tests, such as the test for old age pensions, there are very carefully prepared rules, but there are no such rules in the Bill.  It looks to me as if there could be one decision as to what was income under one local authority and another decision in relation to another authority.</P>
      <P>It also seems to be very difficult to decide who may reasonably be expected to reside in a house.  Take a young man of 22, unmarried, who does not want to reside.  Different decisions could be arrived at all over the country.  Some schedule as in the case of the National Health Bill and some uniformity would be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to lay down any hard and fast method of simplifying this income question.  Local authorities are at the moment making an effort to reckon the incomes of different people for whom they are providing houses, <Col N="1779" /> and I can only assume that if they can make a fairly accurate calculation for that purpose they will be able to make a calculation also for the purpose of paying this grant.</P>
      <P>On the question of who could reasonably be expected to reside, this is what we had in mind: you might have a young man living with his parents, and he might have arranged to get married in a month or so; while his income or part of it might be coming into the home at one time, a month afterwards he would be on his own, married and living apart from his family.  The provision is designed to give local bodies a fair scope.  It is very hard to visualise all the types of cases which might arise.  Local bodies all over the country have had that task to perform for some time, so if they have done it fairly well why should they not do the same in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister reads this wording carefully he will find it difficult to see how it could be interpreted as he says.  If a person has resided in the house at any time during the year his income must be taken into consideration.  Those who may reasonably be expected to reside are those who are not residing, but who in the opinion of the local authority should have been residing there.  I do not think it can be interpreted in the elastic way the Minister says.  I am not objecting to that, however.  My real difficulty is the meaning of the word &ldquo;income&rdquo;.  I am not pressing an amendment, but merely drawing attention to the fact that it is not as it might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A boy might have been residing with his parents, but just at the time the local body was about to determine the family income he might have left and got married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be caught under the Bill if he lived in the house at any time during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not interpret it so rigidly.  I do not think there is any need to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only drawing <Col N="1780" /> attention to the fact that that seems to be unnecessarily rigid while the other part seems unnecessarily vague.  I have no specific amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This time I agree definitely with the Minister.  It will at all times be a difficult task to assess the income of a person described as one who may reasonably be expected to reside in a house.  It is vague and very wide.  Local authorities will have a difficult task in finding out who exactly is the right person for a grant and I do not see how it can be made any easier.</P>
      <P>You have a man who is about to build a house.  He lives in a bad one. Three or four of his family are in England and are contributing very handsomely to his income by sending money home.  How is it possible to track down the income in a house like that? There are many such cases in my own county.  Take a man who has two sons carpenters or plasterers, which are very well paid trades at the present time.  They do not reside in his house but make a handsome contribution every month or every week to their father who is about to build a house. It would be very difficult to assess his income.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, in full agreement with the Minister that it would be very hard to lay down exact rules for this section.  It will depend on the investigating officers of local authorities and in my estimation their task will be a pretty hard one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to provide for the adoption of children.  Many Senators have, no doubt, already read the Bill, and I am sure that all of them will agree with the principle of it.  I do not, therefore, propose to say much about the Bill now, but there are two points to which I should like to direct the attention of Senators.  The first is the fact that the only children who may be adopted are orphans and illegitimate children.  It may be suggested that there are exceptional circumstances in which the adoption of a legitimate child who is not a full orphan would have much to commend it and that provision should be made for this in the Bill.  I am advised, however, that, in view of the fact that the Constitution declares the rights and duties of parents to be inalienable, any provision for the permanent transfer of these rights and duties from a living parent might be unconstitutional. I do not think it would be advisable to take the risk for the sake of the few children concerned.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to comment on is the fact that the Bill contains a number of safeguards which some Senators may consider to be unduly restrictive.  I do not, myself, think they are.  This is the first measure dealing with legal adoption in this country, and, in a matter of this kind, we should hasten slowly.  If experience shows that the restrictions are unnecessary and undesirable, amending legislation can be introduced.</P>
      <P>The text of the Bill is easy to understand and does not call for explanation. Part I contains definitions and the usual preliminary provisions.  Part II deals with the making of adoption orders; Part III with the effects of adoption orders; Part IV with the registration of adoption societies and Part V contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II provides for the establishment of an adoption board consisting <Col N="1782" /> of a chairman and six ordinary members.  This board will deal with all applications for adoption and it is given power in the Bill to make adoption orders.  Only persons of judicial standing or barristers or solicitors of at least ten years' standing will be eligible for appointment as chairman of the board.  The chairman and ordinary members will be appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that only illegitimate children and orphans may be adopted.  The children must be at least six months and not more than seven years old, but the upper age limit will not apply to existing adoptions which come within the scope of Section 19 of the Bill.  An adoption order may be obtained only by a married couple, a widow or a relative of the child.  Generally, the applicant or applicants must be at least 30 years of age, but this provision will not apply to relatives.  An adoption order may be made only with the consent of the mother, guardian and any person having charge of or control over the child, unless the board dispenses with the consent on the grounds that the person is insane or cannot be found.  The applicants, the child and the parents of the child must all be of the same religion.  The provisions in regard to religion are contained in Section 12.  Sub-section (6) of that section deals with four specified religions and it represents the joint recommendation of the authorised representatives of the religions concerned.</P>
    <P>When an adoption order is made, the child's birth will be registered in a special register, an extract from which will serve as a birth certificate for the child.  Neither the register nor the certificate will disclose the child's origin, and a &ldquo;short&rdquo; birth certificate may be issued as if the register were the ordinary register of births.</P>
    <P>The effects of an adoption order are set out in Part III of the Bill.  The object is to place the adopted child, as far as possible, in the same position as he would be if born in lawful wedlock to his adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for the registration of adoption societies.  No society may arrange adoptions unless they are <Col N="1783" /> registered and the board is empowered to require a registered society to furnish information to the board about its activities.</P>
    <P>Part V imposes certain restrictions on the sending of children out of the State.  It prohibits advertisements relating to adoption and it also prohibits payments for arranging adoptions, or payments in consideration of the adoption of a child.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that I will welcome any suggestions for improving the Bill?  I would, however, ask Senators, as I asked Deputies in the Dáil, to bear in mind what I said at the beginning, namely that in legislation of this kind it is better to go too slowly than too fast.  We are not interfering with the existing right to adopt a child informally, and in so far as the Bill goes, it is, I think, a definite advance.  As such, I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on this Bill. I would like to congratulate him on having introduced it and congratulate him on the obvious care and trouble which he has taken to try and make it as workable as possible.  He has more or less indicated that he could himself criticise the Bill in several respects.  So could I.  I am prepared to accept, in general terms, the view expressed by the Minister that what we want is a workable Bill which will have general acceptance.  It would be a mistake to press for points which might be logical and for which, possibly, a very good case could be made, but which might become matters of controversy and might risk the smooth application of the work in the Bill.</P>
      <P>For many years I have advocated the provision of some form of legal adoption.  I am, therefore, extremely glad that this Bill has been introduced. I am very glad, indeed, that it has met with a good measure of support from all classes and that it is likely to become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with minor points, because I think they can be much better dealt with by way of <Col N="1784" /> question and answer on Committee Stage.  There is one point which I feel that I should mention to the Minister now, because it will have to be raised on Committee Stage.  It arises out of the section which was amended in the Dáil, Section 12, which deals with cases where persons who are not of the same religion may, nevertheless, be permitted to adopt a child. I think that, in the amended form, that is at the discretion of the adoption board.  I have no objection to the amendment as it stands, but I have been approached by two of the Protestant bodies which are not mentioned.  There are also two other bodies who have not approached me, but it would seem to me that they also require consideration.  The two denominations whose representatives have approached me are the Baptist Union of Ireland and the Brethren who are commonly called the Plymouth Brethren.  The other two denominations are the Congregational Union of Ireland and the Moravian Church in Ireland.  Neither of these two has approached me.  It is quite possible that, if they knew the Bill was before the Seanad, they might have done so.</P>
    <P>The gentlemen who approached me on behalf of the first two bodies I have mentioned told me that they had some conversation with the officials of the Department, and that the Minister was very anxious to do the right thing in the matter.  It was suggested to them that there would be no fundamental opposition to their inclusion provided the consent of the other denominations who are included in the section were first obtained.  Unfortunately, it is quite impossible to get the authoritative consent of the majority of religious denominations at short notice.  I have been informed that in respect of one of the smaller denominations approached by the Baptists and the Brethren, the consent has been given.  In respect of the other denominations, however, it would be quite a considerable time before they would be able to say whether or not consent would be given.  These four denominations are small here&mdash;I am not speaking on their behalf in this matter&mdash;but judging by an examination of the Dublin directory, it would seem <Col N="1785" /> that though these bodies are relatively small in the Twenty-Six Counties, the Baptist Union and the Congregational Union are very substantial bodies, taken over the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, rather important from every point of view that care should be taken to try and meet particular cases, and that there should not be undue haste.  I am not a member of any of these denominations.  The Church of which I am a member is included among the Churches in Section 12, but I felt it was only right that I should raise the matter when I was asked.  To the best of my knowledge all the four religious denominations I have mentioned are included in the Constitution, which covers all other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of its enactment.</P>
    <P>The difficulty I see in this particular matter is that if we wait until the question of consent or otherwise can be determined, it will probably mean a couple of months.  My greatest difficulty was due to a statement made last week, no doubt in good faith, that we were not going to have any other Bills put through before the Recess. Accordingly, I did not think there was any urgency.  I heard only last night that the Bill was likely to be discussed to-day.  In the circumstances, the only thing I can do is to put down an amendment to include the names of such of those bodies as desire it, and leave it to the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>There are two suggestions made which I would like the Minister to consider between this and the Committee Stage.  The first of these suggestions is not quite so practicable as the second.  It is that there should be an amendment in the Bill that, where in the case of religious bodies recognised by the Constitution and not mentioned in the Bill, adoption might take place if the adoption board were satisfied that consent had been given. That does not appear to me to be as practicable as the other suggestion which was made and which I would like the Minister to consider.  The Minister should have power by means of an Order passed by both Houses and laid on the Table of the House <Col N="1786" /> to include additional bodies provided they are bodies which come within the scope of the phrase in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he states that we should not act hastily. There is no other amendment I intend to put down unless it arises by consent in the course of discussion on the Committee Stage.  Once this Bill is passed it is very unlikely that any Government will want to change it for three or four years.  I do not think it would be desirable that it should be changed until the adoption board has had experience and is able to make a full report as to how it worked out. For that reason, I do not like to leave these denominations in an uncertain position for three or four years.  If it were possible to provide the safeguards I have suggested and if the number is restricted to religious denominations covered by the phrase in the Constitution, it might possibly meet the case.</P>
    <P>I propose to put down an amendment for the Committee Stage to include those denominations who desire inclusion so that the question can be debated again.  The Minister can then consider what is the best thing to do. The last thing I want to do is to delay the passing of the Bill.  I welcome the Bill and wish it as speedy a passing as possible.  I do not know whether the Minister would like to deal with the matter around the 1st October, but that would give ample time to find out about this matter of the consent.  If the Minister would prefer to get the Bill through at once, I suggest that he takes power to add names in Section 12.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister would be the first to give primary credit in this Bill to the Legal Adoption Society and to the private Deputies who introduced the original private Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They did a great deal of the necessary softening up in this rather controversial topic, and I am quite sure the Minister would be the first and, in fact, he has been the first, to give the primary credit to them.  We are all very grateful to the Minister for his own fatherly adoption of this Adoption Bill.  It is a baby that does very great credit to him, as the adoptive father, as well as to its original legitimate <Col N="1787" /> parents.  I would like to assure him that every person to whom I have spoken, has been highly appreciative of the work which his Department has done in support of it.  I know from my own personal negotiations in the matter that both the Minister and his Department have spared no pains, and have taken the greatest care to satisfy the scruples and the needs of all parties involved.</P>
    <P>There are profound religious principles involved in this Bill, and there are constitutional questions and difficult personal problems involved, and if we had not had such patient consideration by the Department there might have been a good deal of hard feeling about it.  So far as I know, there is no justifiable objection to the Bill as it stands, and I have heard no one say that this or that clause in the Bill is wrong or unjust or unfair.  I will mention a little later one further concession that might possibly be granted, but that is all I will plead for.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that the Minister has been very wise to give us what might be called a minimal Bill, and has not tried to do too much at the beginning.  We would all agree that it is better to have a plain dish where all the guests are in peace and friendship than some rich banquet where there is quarrelling and dissatisfaction around the table.  That is what the Minister has given us.  It is an easily digestible dish, and I am sure it will do good to the body politic in general.  Since there was no provision at all for legal adoption in this country before this Bill, everything in the Bill is something gained, and we must be grateful for that.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to what Senator Douglas said on this very thorny section, Section 12 on page 5.  I have some diffidence about reverting to this because I know the Minister and his Department have taken the greatest care and have been given a good deal of trouble over this clause.  I would like to repeat that we are very appreciative of the patience he has shown in dealing with the rather <Col N="1788" /> tricky questions of principle at issue between the smaller religious denominations in this country.  If we all belonged to one religion, it would certainly have simplified this Bill, but legislators have to take things as they are and to be patient with things as they are, perhaps with a view to amending them later.  I think our legislators and our Minister have given us a very fine example in this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas has mentioned two Protestant bodies who might feel a little aggrieved under the section.  I think he said&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the Plymouth Brethren and the Baptist Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that these two bodies had approached me.  There were two others as well that seem to be in a similar position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Senator has definite information from these two bodies.  I would like to remind him and Senators generally that there is a very delicate balance involved here.  There is within the Protestant community a more liberal, a more exclusive element.  There is one sect, a Protestant sect, that has not the slightest doubt about my being damned for eternity unless I change very quickly, and there is another that considers that only 144,000 souls out of the whole population of the world can and will be saved, which means a very grim look-out for some of us, I am afraid.  You can see that, for one of those 144,000 souls to allow a child of theirs to be adopted by a body which is unlikely to contribute much to that quota is a very delicate matter, and we who do not ostensibly belong to the 144,000 who are certain to be saved are a little uneasy about reciprocation along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the bodies mentioned in Section 12, as amended on Report, see entirely eye to eye in this matter. They have come together.  They have discussed it and rediscussed it, and agree that this is the right amendment to the Bill.  These other bodies have been floating around and, apparently, voicing some objections, but why have they not done something already, why have they not approached the four <Col N="1789" /> main Protestant denominations, why have they not made their case quite clear to the Minister?  They can hardly complain that they have not had time. I sympathise with their point of view, but it cannot be assumed, as Senator Douglas seems to assume, that if these bodies say: &ldquo;We would like to come in under this clause&rdquo;, the other bodies would stay in; they might say: &ldquo;Very well, we opt out&rdquo;.  That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is very tedious; it is very trying; but that is the situation, and I do not know what is the best way to cope with it now that Senator Douglas has raised this point.  I would agree with him that we had better not rush this Bill and, on the whole, I would tend to agree that if on Wednesday next Senator Douglas is still convinced that the small denominations would feel aggrieved under the Bill as it now stands, perhaps we should wait until October, although that in many ways would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>I would only like to insist that it is not just as simple as adding a few more names to this amendment.  That will not do.  The whole thing would have to be taken up all over again, and something completely new drafted.  I would really like to spare the Department of Justice, as well as the Houses of the Oireachtas, the complications that may be involved there but, on the other hand, if Senator Douglas is quite certain that there is a genuine grievance, I suppose we will have to wait.</P>
    <P>As I have said, personally, I am entirely satisfied with this Bill as far as it goes and I know that almost all members of the religious minority to which I belong are very well satisfied with it also and, therefore, very appreciative of what the Minister has done.</P>
    <P>I would plead for one further concession, for one more provision.  As the Minister has stated earlier to-day, the Bill allows only orphans and the children of illegitimate unions to be legally adopted.  No legitimate children can be adopted under the Bill as it now stands&mdash;Section 10 (c).  The Minister, in a sense, has forestalled me in this but I would plead for him to think again on this matter.  The <Col N="1790" /> reason, as the Minister has explained, is the danger of some infringement of the Constitution, if we interfere with the rights of the family.  I will read the Article of the Constitution, to make it quite clear.  It is Article  Paragraph 1:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is very clear and very firm.  By interpreting this, it seems that no family exists where there is no legitimate marriage.  Therefore, imprescriptible rights do not arise in the case of a mother and an illegitimate child.  I find that a rather subtle distinction.  I personally wonder why, if a mother has no imprescriptible rights over her child, a mother and father have such rights.  I know that this is a subtler problem than we could go into here, and I am not going to press that line of argument.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible, in the case of an existing adoption by a mother and father in the Republic, of a legitimate child before January 1st, 1952, to give, <i>de facto</i> and retrospectively, without opening the door to any more adoptions of the kind, the board discretion to make an adoption order in that case? There will be hard cases involved if such a concession is not made.  I will give an example of the sort of thing that occurs.  Last year a mother and father adopted a legitimate child of English parents&mdash;an infant aged about one and a half years.  These adoptive parents are at once faced with two difficulties.  What is the nationality of that child going to be?  Its adopted parents are Irish and its legitimate parents are British.  Under the Bill as it stands, presumably, it will remain a British child, which may prove very awkward, indeed.  If the adopted mother and father are suddenly killed in an accident, that child has no legal right to an inheritance.  I am assured by one of these parents that it is rather difficult legally to make sure that an adopted child will inherit in the absence of legal adoption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> There is definite hardship involved in such a case, and I would plead as earnestly as I can that the Minister should go one step further.  I will ask him now if he will accept an amendment from me or from some other Senator which would give the board discretion to grant a legal adoption order to Irish parents who have adopted a legitimate child before 1st January, 1952.  I know this would be an immense relief to many parents in the Republic.  I am sure those parents would be perfectly willing to risk an action under the Constitution, if necessary, and to bear the brunt of such action, if the Minister would only grant that concession.  Of course, I am well aware of the difficulties in the way of it, but I plead with him to do as I ask, and I ask those Senators who feel inclined to support my point to think over the matter.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister and I assure them that the religious provisions would be most carefully observed, and that they would be exactly as they now stand in the Bill.  It is simply a matter of allowing a special concession in this way in the case of a legitimate child adopted before the 1st January, 1952.  If the Minister shows any favour towards that view, and I earnestly hope he will, I will introduce an amendment at the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, not controversial, which may be helpful in time.  The proposal as it stands in the Bill is to set up a board authorised to make an order for the adoption of a child.  Unless the board is prepared to be as wise as Solomon and as patient as a tortoise, it will run into difficulties.  Unless it is prepared to hear both sides of the question with care it will be faced with obstacles.  It is very doubtful if seven members can spare time to hear both sides of the question fully in every case.  They will find it very difficult to get at the essential facts.  The decision of the board must rest on the value of the reports furnished by somebody who has had personal contact with the mother, the child, and its proposed adopted parents.  The person giving the reports will need to have a very intimate knowledge of the backgrounds of <Col N="1792" /> the child and of its future adopted parents.  He or she must know whether a particular child will suit particular parents, and whether particular parents will suit a particular child.</P>
    <P>That is not the sort of decision which can be casually arrived at.  Certainly, it cannot always be arrived at by an official investigation.  Surely, it will be necessary to have investigation officers, or some such persons, to look into each case.  These will have to be people of the highest integrity, people with appropriate training, and people capable of judging human values.  By simply sitting around a table and interviewing a child and its proposed adopted parents, the board will not be able to make the personal assessment which is essential to the success of an adoption order like this.  I am now coming to the exact point I want to put before the Minister.  I hope he will keep in mind the need for recruiting officers of this kind from the schools of social science in our universities.</P>
    <P>In our two universities in the Republic we have flourishing and well-equipped social science schools.  If the Minister, by appointing officers from the graduates from these schools, gives encouragement to the schools, he will both be helping the universities and ensuring the success of the Bill. At the moment, there is very little employment in this country for these graduates.  Two graduates are employed by two societies in Dublin to deal with social problems and two are inspectors of boarded-out children for the Department of Health.  Four officers of this kind are a very poor total in a country with a population of three millions.  I feel that this kind of legislation will need to draw more and more on these qualified students in social science.</P>
    <P>There should be a very much greater need for specially trained women workers when this Bill becomes an Act. For example, between the years 1944 to 1949 the annual number of children born illegitimately in the Republic who might come within the scope of this Bill, was between 2,000 and 2,600.  A great many other children who will come within the scope of this Bill are <Col N="1793" /> born in England because their mothers leave Ireland for social reasons.  It is very hard to estimate just how many more there will be of those born in England.  One rescue society in London, I am informed, provides information that, in one year, 550 unmarried Irish mothers sought their assistance.  That is in London alone. It is hard to say what the total would be, if all the rescue societies in London, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow supplied the figures of their Irish applicants.  I quote that only to show that there is a need for trained workers and to remind the Minister that, in the social science schools of the two universities, he has such people waiting and able to do the work.  I hope that when this Bill passes, he will look onwards or perhaps another Department will look onwards, towards providing these very necessary sympathetic officers who will give the board a skilled and personal assessment in every case.</P>
    <P>I can only repeat that this Bill does very great credit both to its original parents and to the Minister, its foster parent, and I should like personally to thank him on behalf of the religious denomination to which I belong for the exemplary care and patience he has shown in framing it.</P>

      <P>Might I make an explanation with regard to Senator Stanford's reference to the two denominations and the question as to why they did not approach the other bodies?

      <P>I simply wish to support the last point in Senator Stanford's speech.  I am speaking also from the point of view of university training, and I suggest that this Bill cannot be really successfully operated unless the services of the people who take out diplomas in social science courses of the universities are employed in its administration.  The board will require the very highly expert type of advice of whole-time officers.  It will consist of seven members, and it would be impossible <Col N="1794" /> for them to investigate every case with first-hand knowledge thoroughly.  They will have to rely very largely on the expert advice of their own officers. People will not be in a position to give the type of advice required, unless they have had a certain amount of social training.  They will have to be familiar with the background of the child, with the background of its parents, and of the proposed adopting parents.  That is the sort of advice that requires a good deal of knowledge of social conditions, and cannot be undertaken simply by amateurs.</P>
      <P>The two colleges in Dublin are producing a large number of skilled social workers, and it is a rather melancholy commentary on the state of affairs in this country that the great majority of these social workers have to emigrate in order to find employment. The only reason I am intervening in this debate at all is simply to add my voice to that of Senator Stanford, and to suggest that here is an opportunity of absorbing a certain number of highly trained university students and, at the same time, assisting in the administration of this highly admirable scheme.  If the products of the universities cannot find employment at home, and if they have to emigrate to find it elsewhere, it is very discouraging to the universities who produce them, to the parents who pay their fees, and to the students themselves, and I therefore ask the Minister to consider whether it might not be possible, in the operation of this scheme, to find employment for a certain number of highly skilled people of that kind.</P>

      <P>Like the other Senators who have spoken, I welcome the Bill.  It will relieve certain difficulties that exist to-day, and everybody concerned with its introduction is entitled to the thanks of many families &mdash;families which, following the passage of the Bill, will be made permanent families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may, by Order, appoint.  I should like to know why the Minister thinks there will be any necessity to appoint a day on which the Act will come into operation.  Why should the <Col N="1795" /> Act, as in the case of most Acts, not come into operation on its passing? Section 10 provides in sub-paragraph (b) that a child in respect of whom an adoption order is applied for shall be at least six months old and not more than seven years old.  I suggest that these age limits might be less restricted, that, in regard to the six months, an application might be made for an adoption order at any time after the child has attained the age of one month and that the age of seven years might be extended.  I can imagine cases in which it would be very desirable that an application could be made almost immediately or very shortly after birth and cases in which an application might be in order to be made after a child had passed his seventh year.  Perhaps the Minister might extend that age limit to ten years.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that the board will have jurisdiction in respect of existing adoptions, that is, the case of an adoption by, say, agreement between the parties, and sub-section (5) provides that an application under the section must be made within 12 months after the commencement of the Act, or within such further period as the board, in any particular case, may, for reasonable cause, allow.  Even though the Minister intends that the board will exercise discretion, that clause might be worded a little more directly to compel the board to extend the time in any case.  When boards and judicial authorities are restricted as to the doing of a thing by a section, they very often accept altogether too literally the wording or prescription of the section and say: &ldquo;The Act says that we may do this, that we may extend the time, but we do not think we should, because you have not given us any reason.&rdquo;  In such a case as this, where any reason is given, the board should be compelled to extend the time beyond 12 months.</P>
    <P>We all know our experience with regard to parties who are entitled to benefits under Acts which prescribe that claims under the Act may be made within a prescribed period.  Notwithstanding great publicity, many persons fail to apply within the prescribed time <Col N="1796" /> and there is always trouble afterwards. In cases of existing adoptions, it is quite possible that people may be late with their applications and I feel that sub-section (5) should be extended to give an applicant more easily the right to have his case considered by the board.  Perhaps the Minister would amend that section or agree to its amendment.</P>
    <P>Clause 21 provides that the board may amend an adoption order by correcting any error in the particulars contained in the order.  I would like to know what exactly is intended by that.  Where will the board get particulars of the error?  Is it contemplated that these particulars would come to it through its officers or from any party interested in the adoption order?  It seems strange that the board should have power to amend an adoption order without having the parties again brought before it.  However, the Minister may be able to help me there.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us some indication, if he can, whether he contemplates that there will be many applications to the board.  I rather gather from some of the speeches that there will be a very big number. Frankly, I cannot understand how the Minister could ascertain that, but it may be that in his office he has heard from time to time of the difficulties of a large number of people who, without a Bill such as this, could not do what they would like to do.  If the Minister can give us this information, I am sure that it will be of some assistance.</P>
    <P>With other Senators I welcome the Bill and give credit to the Minister and to all the other parties concerned in its introduction.  There is no doubt whatsoever that it will relieve in many cases very great difficulties.  I am at one with the Minister when he says: &ldquo;Let us, in this House, hasten slowly,&rdquo; even though our slow progress may cause some little difficulty.  Certainly the passage of the Bill, insufficient though some people may suggest it is, will alleviate great trouble and then, as the years go on, we can gain from experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those who have complimented the Minister and <Col N="1797" /> the officers of his Department on the production of the Bill.  Anything I have to say may not be of great importance, but I think one should comment on the fact that at least two of the people who represent the religious minority in the country have spoken in favour of the Bill, have complimented the Minister and his officers, and have expressed the opinion that the religious minority are quite pleased and satisfied with it.  It is a great thing, not alone for this House, but for the country to have such statements made here by public representatives.  It is a very good answer to people inside and outside the country who refer, when it suits their policy, to religious bigotry in this country.  There is no such thing.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious to anybody reading the Bill that a tremendous amount of work has gone into it.  Very knotty problems had to be resolved, and the fact that they were resolved must be a great satisfaction to those who did that tremendous amount of work.</P>
      <P>As in the case of all Bills, I suppose, certain things have not been catered for here which some of us think should have been catered for.  As the Minister stated, it deals only with orphans and illegitimate children.  I think that a very strong case could be made for dealing with other children.  It is quite possible that a whole family of, say, five or six children might be deserted by their parents, and it is pretty hard that they cannot be provided for under the Bill.  The Minister said that it might be unconstitutional. It is all right for me or somebody like me to say that something might be unconstitutional, but it should be easy&mdash;I am not a constitutional lawyer or a lawyer of any kind&mdash; to say definitely whether it would be constitutional or unconstitutional.  The Minister says that the courts would have to decide a thing of that kind, and probably will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something which has been worrying me for a considerable time, and I think it only right that it should be mentioned.  I have very strong views on the question of illegitimate children, and have taken a considerable interest over a number of years in people who happen to be in that <Col N="1798" /> unfortunate position.  I would go so far as to say that even in a Bill of this kind they should not be referred to as &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo;, although I did not know what is the way around it. There is no such thing as an illegitimate child, but only illegitimate parents, and it is too bad that children who, through no fault of their own happen to be in that position, have to navigate through life with that handicap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am dealing with questions you run up against every day of the week.  The question of birth certificates also arises.  I do not think that that is sufficiently catered for in the Bill.  I have had to deal with such matters, as a public representative, if you like, or as a human being.  In one case I had to get a birth certificate for a person who was what is called illegitimate and who was about to get married.  I knew his parents.  When I got the certificate I found that the name had been changed three times before the actual point when the man was getting married. Something definite should be done to save a person who finds himself in that position.  It is very humiliating that such a man must go through this roundabout method of having his name changed more than twice before he can actually approach a clergyman to get married under the name by which he is generally known.  I have known more than one case of that kind, and they certainly had a tremendous effect on me.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien, I think, suggested that the best people to implement this Bill were people trained in universities. I think that Senator Stanford probably took the same line.  It is quite normal, I suppose, that people like Senators O'Brien and Stanford should feel that people specially trained for a certain job are the best people to do that job, but, in my opinion, for work of this kind, people who have worked in a voluntary capacity in this sphere for a number of years are at least as well if not better qualified than any people technically trained in any university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are passing compliments <Col N="1799" /> about, it is only right that we should compliment the people who have given voluntary service to the country and to humanity generally in this particular line of work over a long number of years.  I feel quite certain that no matter what steps are taken under this Bill the work they have done will not be and should not be overlooked. They have given tremendous service to society generally and they will be rewarded not alone in this world but in the next.  I hope they will be included in that very small number that Senator Stanford heard for a fact will get to Heaven.  If they do not, I do not know who will.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate those responsible for the Bill on the achievement it represents in getting unanimity between various denominations.  I was glad to hear Senator Douglas mention that there are two other religious bodies which were not included and should have been.  I hope the Minister will ensure that any section that should be included is included.</P>
      <P>Our thanks are also due to a group of citizens known as the Legal Adoption Society who have worked for many years for the introduction of a Bill of this nature.  They are a group working entirely outside the House trying to create an atmosphere that such a Bill is necessary.  I am sure the Minister will agree that our thanks are due to them to some extent for this Bill being before us.</P>
      <P>I was rather interested in other aspects of the Bill than those which are actually embodied in it.  One of them was mentioned by Senator Quirke.  I do not know what exactly the legal definition of &ldquo;an orphan&rdquo; is. I presume that it is a child whose parents are dead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quirke has put this case, and I reinforce it.  We know families where the mother has died and the child is left, and the father is a waster.  Relatives may wish to adopt that child, but it seems to me that, under this Bill, they are absolutely precluded.  Hitherto they adopted by mere acquisition&mdash;the child could go of its own volition to an aunt's house and be reared there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill specifically states that adoption can be only of an orphan or an illegitimate child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That is legal adoption, The old form can continue.  However, there might be a wrong impression abroad as though this were going to make any change in the present position.  There is no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>So a child can still go back to its aunt's house&mdash;though not legally?  Again, is there any reason&mdash; apart from that of the inalienable rights of the family&mdash;why a person could not be legally adopted by an aunt, as apart from fraternal adoption?</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly or Senator Stanford mentioned certain legal disabilities on children who could not be adopted under certain circumstances.  If a relative adopts a child or if a sister adopts the child of a brother and it is not legally adopted, can legal measures be taken in a punitive fashion as a result of that adoption?  I am not a lawyer, and I can only refer to the matter.  I wonder if, in any way, this Bill, by omission, would inflict any hardship on a child under such circumstances.</P>
      <P>I wonder, too, if the Minister would tell us the legal position of a girl who gives birth to an illegitimate child and who, years afterwards, wants to recover that child.  Has she any rights at all once the child is adopted legally?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same? I am just using the Senator's own definition for my own purpose.  It seems to me that there is a great hardship in that, apart from the legal or religious point of view, human nature being what it is and they being what they are.  It is said that the just man falls seven times in the day and the girl once in a lifetime; yet, due to the circumstances, the child being legally adopted, it is taken away from her.  It seems to me that it would take a lot of moral argument to justify a refusal to give back that child when she is in a position to ask for its return.  I can see difficulty about the matter, but I can see the clear point arising that this is an infliction of a terrible penalty on the sinner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  We will go back to that.  I was going to reinforce Senator Quirke's argument that social workers as such who are already in being should receive some recognition. While I appreciate the social science training given in University College, and agree that it is desirable as far as possible to use these people, those who have given years of their lives to social work should be remembered first.  There has been a tremendous amount of voluntary work of that nature, and in so far as these social workers could be employed under this Bill they should get some sort of prior consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister also, under Section 39, in Part V, which says that a child under seven years of age cannot be removed from the State, can it be suggested by inference that a child over seven years of age can be removed outside the State?  There was an extraordinary case in England not so long ago where parents allowed a child to be removed by a film actress and it caused a lot of trouble.  Is there any legal reason why removal of any child <Col N="1802" /> at any time should be allowed? Section 39 (1) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person shall remove out of the State a child under seven years of age who is an Irish citizen or cause or permit such removal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do you limit the age to seven because that is the age of reason?  Is that the only reason for its limitation or is there anything in the Bill that prevents a child up to the age of puberty, at any rate, being removed from the State?</P>
    <P>There is another point.  Under Section 40 you forbid people to advertise&mdash;at least, this is my interpretation of it&mdash;the fact that one is willing to make arrangements for the adoption of children.  May I ask in what way can they make it known, unless through the Adoption Society, that they are willing to adopt a child?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would do so.  Outside those points, I welcome the Bill in so far as it solves a problem we have had for many years.  I only hope it will not be misinterpreted in its mission and, because of that, more use made of it. I cannot say in broader words exactly what I mean, but it may be possible that a lot of people here might misinterpret the section and instead of curing the situation it might add to the trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other members of the House, I welcome the Bill.  I feel that the Minister should be very happy at the way in which it has been received.  This is a very important matter.  I would like to say how glad I was to listen to Senator Douglas and Senator Stanford.  We are a community the overwhelming majority of whom are of the one religious persuasion.  We do not discriminate against the minority who do not agree with us in the matter of religion.  It is indeed a happy state of affairs that people like Senators Douglas and Stanford can, in this Seanad of the Republic of Ireland, have our respect in advocating the wishes <Col N="1803" /> and the viewpoint of a minority of our people.  They have our respect.</P>
      <P>Having said that, might I say that there is no greater tragedy in this country than that of the unwanted child?  This Bill will do something to take care that the child born into this world, call it what you like, will be adequately taken care of.  With Senator Quirke, I think that we should drop the title of illegitimate child and say illegitimate parents.  Why should the child be branded with the sins of its parents?  This Bill will ensure that any child which cannot be taken care of by its parents will be adopted under conditions that will ensure for it a happy future.</P>
      <P>I think it is important to emphasise that this Bill is not a proselytising Bill. In so far as any Bill or any Act can enact, this Bill will ensure that the child will be brought up in the religion of its forebears.  I happen to be a Catholic member of this House, and I think it worthy to emphasise that we in this legislation are trying to ensure that there shall be no penalty on any child no matter to what religious denomination it may belong, whether it be Plymouth Brethren, Baptist or anything else.  This Bill is endeavouring to ensure that where legal adoption is advisable or necessary for a child born in what I might call unfortunate circumstances, the child will get a chance in life.</P>
      <P>I think it is a very happy augury that we in this Seanad of the Republic of Ireland can discuss this very important matter affecting the lives of children born under unfortunate circumstances. They will get a chance in life under proper conditions.</P>

      <P>As I have said in Irish, with the other speakers, I consider the introduction of this Adoption Bill a step in the right direction and an attempt to supply a long-standing need in the social life of this country.  It is a measure that does not lend itself to a long Second Reading debate.  It is of a highly technical character.  Therefore, I do not propose to deal at any length with the principles underlying the measure.  There are, however, a few questions that I would like to ask in connection with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 sub-section (2) says that the board shall consist of a chairman and six ordinary members and sub-section (5) says that the board may act notwithstanding the existence of one <Col N="1805" /> vacancy in its membership.  I would like to be clear as to what &ldquo;vacancy&rdquo; means exactly in this case.  Does it refer to a member who has died? What would be the case if a member becomes ill and cannot attend the meetings of the board for a considerable length of time?  Would that be regarded as a vacancy for the purpose of the Bill?  There appears to me to be no provision in the Bill to cover that.  I may be wrong in my interpretation but will it be necessary for the chairman and six members to be present at every meeting of the board or can some members of the board act when other members are absent?  I hope I have made myself clear.  My reason for asking the question is to get further clarification.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of age, are we satisfied that the age limit of seven is not too young?  In the case of readoption or the adoption of an existing arrangement the question is left to the members of the board as to whether a child over the age of seven would be admitted to the benefits of this measure.  I may be wrong in this as, unfortunately, I have not had time to read the Bill carefully.  If that is the case, what is the deciding consideration? Why is there a definite age limit in the case of adoption, namely, seven and, in the case of readoption, or the legalising of an existing adoption arrangement, is it the position that the age can be extended beyond seven?</P>
    <P>There is the highly technical question of the devolution of property on intestacy.  I refer to Part III of the Bill, Section 26 (1), which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, at any time after the making of an adoption order, an adopter or the adopted person or any other person dies intestate in respect of any real or personal property (other than property subject to an entailed interest under a disposition made before the date of the adoption order), that property shall devolve in all respects as if the adopted person were the child of the adopter born in lawful wedlock and were not the child of any other person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that there is a distinction there between an ordinary <Col N="1806" /> child and an adopted one in respect of what we call an entailed estate and that an adopted child can never become what we call the heir-at-law in the event of intestacy?  In the other cases of the devolution of freehold property, there appears to be no distinction between an ordinary child and an adopted child.  Of course, registered land devolves in the same way as personal property.  Therefore, there appears to be no difficulty about that but I would like to know whether, in the case of an entailed estate, definite provision is being made here to ensure that an adopted child can never become an heir-at-law unless, of course, the adopter, who owns the property in question, makes provision during his lifetime to have it otherwise.</P>
    <P>These are the two remarks I wanted to make on the Bill.  It is a technical Bill and I suppose as much has been said about it as could usefully be said at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my own appreciation of the action of the Minister, first of all, in introducing the Bill and, secondly, in introducing such an obviously fair and workable Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Senators Stanford and O'Brien regarding the employment of the graduates of our social science schools here.  Anybody who is associated with a hospital knows that from time to time it is necessary to get detailed information about the home background of cases and knows also that that is sometimes a matter of extreme difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people employed in hospitals for this purpose have a very long and specialised training and even then mistakes sometimes arise.  When this Bill becomes law, those excellent people who have put so much work into promoting this cause over such a long time in the past and have done it all on a voluntary basis must be consulted about the machinery for working it, but it will always be necessary to have somebody who will go around and find out about home background in the case of the suggested parents as well as in the case of the adopted child.  For <Col N="1807" /> this purpose, surely the specialised training which the graduates of our social science schools have obtained will be a distinct advantage.  I do not say that they are the only people who are qualified to do this but I do think that they are people who have the necessary qualifications and that these qualifications would be valuable in this work, provided, of course, that they are associated with the necessary human qualities on the part of the people who possess the qualifications. That is, of course, a matter which will be gone into when these people are being appointed for this task.  The point is that in working out this machinery these people should be taken into account and, in that particular point, I agree very heartily with Senators Stanford and O'Brien.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, may I say that the particular sect I referred to in my speech was not one of those which Senator Douglas referred to in his speech?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to inform you of that.  In the other House I said that I did not claim any special credit for this Bill.  I realise that it was the work of Deputies of all Parties in the other House and of the Legal Adoption Society.  Two members of the other House put their names to an Adoption Bill.  Both of the Deputies concerned are quite satisfied that their Bill was not quite as satisfactory as the one now under discussion.  All credit is due to those two Deputies, to Deputies of all Parties and to the Legal Adoption Society, which has been working for so long to bring about this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always took an interest in legal adoption, and when I was Minister for <Col N="1808" /> Justice in former years I hoped that it would be possible to introduce legislation to deal with it.  However, there were other more urgent matters which had to be dealt with at that time.  I am very happy to be introducing this Bill, and I hope it will prove to be successful.  If not, as I said in my opening statement, we can always learn by experience and bring in amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I would rather not deal with the point raised with regard to Section 12. That is the most delicate matter in the Bill, and it has to be settled by agreement. I cannot deal with it here. What we have done already has been achieved with the full agreement, as far as we could possibly get it, of the people concerned.  If something else is necessary under this section, we will consider it again.  I do not want to hurry the Bill in any way and, if the Seanad is agreeable to that course, I will wait until October for the Committee Stage.  That will give us ample time to consider the other amendments that may be necessary, and we can be occupied in the meantime in preparing the machinery to put the Bill into operation when it becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can deal with the point raised by Senator Stanford, namely, the granting of an adoption order to the adopted parents of a legitimate child informally adopted before the 1st January, 1952.  I do not think that would make any difference. The adoption is either constitutional or unconstitutional.  The fact that the children concerned were informally adopted before this Bill is passed will not change the fundamental point&mdash; whether or not the adoption is constitutional. I am informed very definitely by my legal advisers that it would be unconstitutional to take away from parents the rights that have been declared inalienable under the Constitution. If we were to accept some amendment, some parents might come along years afterwards and challenge it in the courts.  This might result in the whole Bill being declared unconstitutional. That is why that, for the present at any rate, we thought it best to tread as safely as we can.</P>
    <P>If a child is illegitimate, it simply <Col N="1809" /> means that he or she was not born in lawful wedlock.  I cannot understand why Senator Quirke and Senator Summerfield object to the term &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo;.  A child is either legitimate or illegitimate.  If children are legally born, they have a name at any rate, their parents are known, and they can get an ordinary birth certificate. If legitimate children have been informally adopted, those who adopt them can leave them any property they like by will.  Of course, if the adopted parents die intestate, the informally adopted children will have no claim. However, if people think enough about a child informally to adopt him, surely they will provide for him by will.  I do not see much substance, therefore, in the point raised by Senator Stanford.</P>
    <P>The whole point of this Bill is to give a name to illegitimate children.  If we were to consider the point raised by Senator Stanford the whole Bill would be in jeopardy, because somebody might come along afterwards and claim the child Some of the points that have been raised are very intricate.  I am advised quite definitely, in so far as I can get advice, that it would be unconstitutional to provide for the legal adoption of a legitimate child, except in the case of a full orphan.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of the First Schedule makes provision for the appointment of inspectors.  I have no doubt that when the time for recruiting comes, the proper people will be chosen.  I think it was Senator P.F. O'Reilly who asked how many applications we thought likely to come in.  We will not know that until the board is at work. Undoubtedly, it will be necessary to have investigation officers.  I have no doubt that, when they are being recruited, only the most highly trained people will be taken into consideration. I do not suppose anybody wants to confine the posts to social science graduates, though I have no doubt that they will have a better chance of being selected than most people.  I can assure the House that the best inspectors possible will be selected.</P>
    <P>If Senator P.F. O'Reilly does not mind my saying so, I think that a lot <Col N="1810" /> of his points would be better dealt with on the Committee Stage.  If he feels there is any matter he likes elucidated, he should put down an amendment, or else he should raise specific points when the Bill is being dealt with section by section.</P>
    <P>The Senator wishes to know why a child aged one month could not be adopted.  If people want to adopt a child, there is no reason why they should not adopt him when he is one month old, but he cannot be legally adopted until he is aged six months. I feel sure most people would like to have the child they are considering adopting in the house for a while prior to receiving an adoption order, say, for a period of six months.  This would give them some time to decide whether or not they liked the child.  The idea of fixing a period of seven years was designed so that the children would grow up in a house and come to regard their adopters as their real parents. This is an arbitrary age, of course, but it is supposed to be the age of reason. It is felt that if the child were any older he might not fit in as well with the family.  Of course, in the case of existing adoption, we provide that where a child has been informally adopted and is over the age of seven, he can be legally adopted under this Bill, provided he was taken into his present home before the age of seven.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke said that the question of birth certificates is not properly dealt with in this Bill.  I think he is quite wrong.  We are making sure in this Bill that the short certificate that was approved recently would apply in the case of adopted children also.  If Senators look at the certificate in the Schedule, they will see that it is practically the same as the ordinary birth certificate, and I do not think there can be any improvement in it.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a point in the matter which Senator O'Donnell raised as to how people are to know that there are societies who are anxious to have children adopted.  They may be people down the country who may be anxious to adopt a child and who might not know where they should apply.  We will consider the point before the next stage.  Senator Kissane <Col N="1811" /> asked why we provide that you can readopt a child when you cannot adopt in the first instance.  I suppose it is to provide a home again, but there is a point there about which I am more or less in a jam.  I shall have to look into it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the way in which the Seanad has received the Bill.  It was received here in the same way as it was received in the Dáil.  Everybody tried to be as helpful as he could and we will now have a couple of months in which to consider framing amendments.  I should like any amendments that Senators wish to table to be sent in as soon as possible so that we may consider them and make the Bill as satisfactory as possible.  I again express my thanks for the way in which the Bill has been received.</P>

      <P>There could possibly be a case for taking the Committee Stage before the recess and the Report Stage after the recess, because it seems quite clear from the nature of the Bill, when we discuss it in the friendliest possible way, that some points will arise, so that we are almost certain to have two stages.  I do not mind what decision the House comes to, but there will have to be two meetings.  Perhaps we could meet before the Dáil reassembles.  The Dáil, I understand, is to adjourn until 22nd October and we could perhaps meet in the first week in October, which would allow time for two meetings.</P>
      <P>It is almost certain that points will be raised in regard to which the Minister will want to bring in amendments. Most of us are hesitant about putting down amendments&mdash;we merely want to raise points to find out if the Department thinks there is anything in them. Putting down amendments would look as if we were trying to hinder the passage of the Bill.  Points will, however, be raised and it will then be for the Minister to decide whether they are of sufficient importance to justify amendments.  Therefore, there are sure to be two stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That this House is of opinion that, owing to the general increase in traffic on our roads and, in particular, the increase in the number of tourists taking their cars to this country, the Government should take steps to improve the system of road signs and markings and should make rules and regulations designed to ensure order and promote safety on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give the Seanad the reasons which prompted Senator Douglas and myself to table this motion.  I want to remind the Seanad that motor traffic in this country did not show any worthwhile development until the early 20's <Col N="1814" /> after World War No. 1.  Then with the world economic depression in the early 30's that development was retarded by poor economic conditions in the country generally, and with the advent of World War No. 2 it was almost entirely arrested.  The various State bodies concerned and motor organisations did not find it necessary to draw up the code of rules and laws which exists in other countries.  About 1945 or 1946, however, motor traffic began to develop to proportions unknown in this country. It has created a sort of social revolution and certainly it is true to say that it has created chaos on our roads.  My problem is not to deal with the social aspect but with that chaos.</P>
    <P>The first approach to order on our roads must be the awakening of public conscience.  That can best be achieved by education, first in the schools, then in the churches, on the radio, in the Press and in the cinema.  This to me is a very serious problem in that it often causes the death of the breadwinner of a family or maims him so that he becomes a burden on that family for the rest of his life.  The public conscience has certainly not been stirred in this country in the way it should be.</P>
    <P>Various motoring bodies like the Irish Automobile Club, the Automobile Association, the Racing Motorists' Association, the Safety First Organisation and private motorists' associations should be called together by the Minister for Local Government.  An advisory committee should be formed from them and his officials should discuss with that committee ways and means of formulating a system of road rules and laws such as other countries have found necessary in order to protect their citizens from bodily harm and death.  I do not propose to bother the Seanad with details because I believe that these bodies must be called together to discuss them and make suggestions which would be practicable for the conditions of this country.  I think, however, I should give a few recommendations, some of which should be adopted as soon as possible.  If they could be adopted before the Minister called these bodies together it would be for the public good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> There should be a definite system of priorities for all roads in the country. Where two roads cross or join, one should be considered a priority road. A white line should be placed across the other, making it necessary for anybody entering that priority road to stop first.  The inadequacy of our road markings and signs is the most fruitful cause of accidents.  Where the greatest ambiguity occurs is where two minor roads cross.  Nobody knows who has prior right and usually the person with the least consideration asserts himself and that is how accidents occur.</P>
    <P>A driving test should be introduced. I can see considerable difficulties, however, and I do not think that it can be applied in all cases.  All drivers who have had accidents and who have been convicted should be subjected to such a test.  Anyone who knows himself to be suffering from some disability such as an artificial limb should seek such a test before he drives a car.  There are people with artificial limbs who are most careful and competent drivers, and who can show that during, perhaps, a quarter of a century of motoring they have never had an accident, but there are others whom it must be dangerous to allow on our roads, and it is only fair that they should ensure that they are capable of driving a car, because a motor car in the wrong hands is virtually as dangerous as a lethal weapon.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government in consultation with the various motoring bodies should compile a small booklet giving the rudiments of the traffic law and of courtesy on the road. Great stress should be laid on courtesy because if we all had good manners and respect for the other person I believe that accidents on the road would be reduced to a minimum.  If we always said to ourselves that we would suppress our ego and give in to the other person, even if he consciously or unconsciously is infringing our rights, I believe that there would be very few accidents.</P>
    <P>It is hard to lecture adults on good manners, whether on the road or elsewhere, but that mission could have <Col N="1816" /> been got across in the form of a booklet. In the case of golf, you often find congestion and it is difficult to say to people that they should go away; but the method used is to give every member a book of rules and he reads the things he should do.  It is only in that way it is possible to play, particularly on the congested courses around Dublin.  The same thing could apply to motoring.  If people know the rules and the reasons for them, they would be prepared to adopt them, and that would be of great advantage.</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which we can have the rules adopted&mdash;one is by incentives and the other is by the force of law.  The chief incentive in making people observe the laws, rules and courtesies of the road is a considerable increase in the penalty imposed by insurance companies on those who have accidents, particularly on those who have convictions, and a reduction in the penalty on motorists who for several years have never had an accident.  You find people have been driving motor cars for 25 or 30 years, yet only enjoy the benefit of three years' grace.  For every year a person has not an accident he should get some reduction in the insurance premium, even though it may be very slight.  The risk that the insurance company holds in giving a person like that a policy is very small indeed.  We could in great measure reduce accidents by that incentive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt, but I would remind the Senator that that has nothing at all to do with the motion.  If we are to have a hunt outside the terms of the motion, it will take a long time and the motion itself will be vitiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish with that point, but I think it is an incentive to a person driving a motor car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Senator, as a driver of over 30 years without ever having had an accident, but my suggestion is that it is not within the terms of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is not, strictly speaking.  Again, we should have more mobile Garda patrol cars to enforce the rules.  If some Gardaí were <Col N="1817" /> sent through the country in those cars in plain clothes, they would see within a few months that the laws were observed properly.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I may summarise by saying that what is required is an awakening of public conscience by propaganda in the schools, the Press and the Churches; secondly, the co-operation of Government agencies and motoring bodies; thirdly, the incentives given to the good motorists; and fourthly and finally, the full force of the law on those who do not conform to proper standards of good behaviour on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put my name to the motion at the request of Senator Burke was that in the discussion on the Tourist Bill we were informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the money it was proposed to spend on improved signs would be mainly to direct persons to places of interest, and make it easier to travel, from the point of view of direction.  It seemed to me then insufficient, either from a tourist or internal point of view, to increase the signs marking directions so that you may get to Killarney or Donegal more easily, if steps were not taken at the same time to make a substantial improvement in the marking of signs from the point of view of safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a limited number of signs. To those who know the code, the signs which show &ldquo;Major Road Ahead&rdquo; should be reasonably clear.  However, they are small and a person approaching a major road at some speed could very easily miss that sign. I noticed only yesterday that such a sign near where I live is practically covered by branches of trees, which come down over a wall.  I am not blaming anyone, but it is one of the things to which public attention should be drawn.  The small &ldquo;Major Road Ahead&rdquo; signs are not sufficient, nor are they the best way.  In France you will always know when you come to a Route Nationale, which is a major road, as it is clearly marked by a large notice.  You are also told that to the left is Paris or to the right is Dijon as the case may be, so that you know to which side of the road you should <Col N="1818" /> go.  It is comparatively simple, but it is of great importance.  That is the point where there is most urgent need for marking.  There are minor improvements needed, but I intend to keep to that one which is important.</P>
    <P>The most important thing is a substantial notice ahead; the next thing is a line; and the third thing is that there should be an obligation to stop at that line, whether there is anything coming or not.  There should be a substantial fine for failing to stop. It is not only when you have an accident that you should be penalised. That has been enforced in other countries and according to my information it had good results.  You must have the line and to be effective you must have the notice before it; and, thirdly, you must try to enforce the provision that people must stop.  A few fines and some publicity would soon make drivers realise that.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the insurance question, but I am not at all as impressed as Senator Burke is regarding the iniquity of people who have had an accident.  In many cases they have no responsibility of any kind for the accident and in such cases I do not think there should be any such thing as Senator Burke said, though I do not think he meant it, of being convicted of having an accident.  They could be convicted of carelessness. Many people who approach a major road and know it perfectly well and turn well out instead of stopping are far more to blame than some of those who have had the misfortune to have an accident for which they could not under any circumstances be blamed.</P>
    <P>He made one suggestion, the issue of a booklet.  I am in favour of that, but issuing a booklet is no use unless it is read.  I would have the booklet issued at a price of 6d.  It would be just as reasonable, when a car is stopped, to insist upon the driver producing a copy of that booklet as to ask him for his driver's licence. Drivers should have a copy of that book.  That, to my mind, would be more important than the driver's licence.  All the driving licence means is that the tax has been paid.  Some effort should be made to ensure that the existing laws be carried out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" /> It is really painful to watch at the traffic lights in Dublin.  Detectives should periodically take up positions at the traffic lights at irregular periods.  In that way the public would never know when the detectives would be on duty.  There is hardly one important traffic light in Dublin at which there is not an infringement. Detectives in plain clothes would not have to wait more than half an hour to detect an infringement.</P>
    <P>Dangerous driving is not nearly so easy to detect.  This is a very important matter.  Senator Burke said that if we gave way to the motor hog there would be less accidents.  Watching the Bray Road, as I do every day, I am simply amazed at the forbearance of the average motorist.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is due to the fact that the vast majority of motorists give way that we do not have accidents every day on the Bray Road.  I can claim to be a cautious driver.  I have driven for the past 40 years and I cannot say that I have had what could normally be called an accident.  Cars ran into my car but I was not in it. Every night, when I go home, there are three or four cars, not always the big cars, being driven at a dangerous speed.  Those who drive them pay no attention whether they are passing one, two, three or four motor cars. Accidents are avoided just because the other cars give way, often reluctantly, but, nevertheless, with great regularity.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the most important things for the moment are to widen the laws and make a big effort by means of traps to see they are kept and that there should be main road signs on the lines suggested.  I confined myself to those things because I thought they were the most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a certain amount of doubt as to the wisdom of this motion because, being couched in such general terms, I felt that the real purpose of the motion might be lost in a whole lot of minor by-roads or side roads.  I must say that, like Senator Douglas, I had intended merely to <Col N="1820" /> make two comments and they were exactly the comments which Senator Douglas made.  I intended to bring them in under that part of the motion which asks that steps should be taken &ldquo;to improve the system of road signs&rdquo; and asking to make &ldquo;rules and regulations designed to ensure order and promote safety on our roads.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I see day after day cars approaching a major road and even though in a lot of cases the cars may slow down they still move out on the main road.  They are as big a danger as if they had shot out.  I have often expressed the view that a sign, visible by day and by night and which will not be in danger of being overshadowed in summertime by branches of trees coming down and blotting it out of view, should be erected stating &ldquo;Major Road Ahead of the Junction&mdash;Stop.&rdquo; I would make it an offence if a car did not stop.  I would also make it an offence if the car, having stopped, had not changed down to start off again. We have to be practical about this. There is no use in uttering pious sentiments if they cannot be carried into effect.  How can they be carried into effect?  There are very great difficulties.</P>
      <P>In England, where I have driven, it has been accepted for years that, even though the sign is not there, you stop and change down.  Even if the sign is not there and the road you are entering is of the same importance as the road on which you are, you still stop and cautiously edge out to see if anyone is coming.</P>
      <P>If, as the result of Guards being placed at certain of these junctions, there was a certain number of summonses and fines, and if breaches of the law were given publicity, it would become generally accepted, in the course of time, that drivers of all cars should stop when approaching a main road and not try to jump the signal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret I was not in for the beginning of Deputy Burke's speech, but there were some members of the House who had to attend an important committee meeting and they had to leave.  If there are not more accidents on the Bray Road it is merely because people on that road are so terrified of <Col N="1821" /> the small number of people who are road hogs that they proceed very cautiously and carefully.</P>
    <P>Under the law, it is illegal not to have a dimming device on your car. The curious part of it is that it is not illegal not to use it.  It is an offence not to have it, but it is not an offence not to use it.  You can be summoned for various other things, but you cannot be summoned for not using the dimming device.  You can be summoned for driving dangerously or carelessly.  As a result of that, you have a number of cars upon which the dimming device is ineffective.  There should be periodic inspections of cars by competent people to ensure that the dimming device is working all the time.  It should be made an offence not to dim when approaching another car at night.</P>
    <P>A deplorable development in regard to the front lights of cars has taken place within the past few years.  It is as bad, if not worse than not dimming.</P>
    <P>You find a car with a huge single centre headlight and even though the person driving that car may dim, it has no effect on the centre light, which glares and makes it equally as impossible as if he left on the full, blazing headlights.  That is an undesirable development and is the cause of a great deal of nervousness on roads.</P>
    <P>Because of the danger of driving, particularly on roads like the Bray road, at night, it should be made an offence to have headlamps on lorries that, in the course of time, have developed a shake, and produce a dazzling effect.  That is the worst feature of all.  A man who has a lorry on the road and who pays tax and insurance on it has a further liability to ensure that the lorry will not be a menace to other users of the road and to keep it in pretty good trim.</P>
    <P>If the two suggestions I have made were put into effect they could bring about a great degree of safety on the roads.  I would prefer to see the motion couched in narrower terms, and I would like to impress on the Departments concerned and local authorities that if they could start in a small way it would be far better than diffusing <Col N="1822" /> energies over a very big field, because the field is very big.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion gives some of us who have a bee in our bonnet about the use of the roads a chance to air some of our views.  I am glad on that account that the Senators put down the motion.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on what Senator Burke said, first of all, about driving tests.  I do not believe that driving tests would serve any useful purpose. I do not believe that it is inexpert driving that causes accidents to any great extent.  I rather think it is careless driving.  You could have the most expert driver in the world and, because he was careless, he could cause a number of accidents.</P>
      <P>There might be some case for having a driver's sight or hearing examined. Senator Burke said that a person might lose a limb and yet be able to drive.  That is quite reasonable. There are people driving cars who are practically deaf, and there are some who are very nearly blind.  It should be a qualification for a driving licence that sight and hearing should be normal.  These two matters should be attended to.  If there is any test, it should be with regard to sight and hearing.</P>
      <P>The lighting of cars is a matter which always seems to bother me. Driving at night time at present is a frightful experience.  Some people dim their lights but, as Senator Hearne mentioned, on some occasions that seems to make no difference because the dimmed lights on some cars are as strong as the full headlights on other cars.  I often feel that there should be a maximum standard for lights on cars.  At present if a person wishes to get the better of the other user of the road, it seems to be the rule to get a more powerful light.  That puts the person whose lights are not so powerful at a terrific disadvantage, and very often he has to stop to allow the person with the powerful lights to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any reason why a <Col N="1823" /> tremendously powerful light should be attached to any car in the night time. It only gives a licence to drive faster and, consequently, is a source of greater danger both to the driver and to the road user.  The Department would be well advised to examine the question of limiting candle-power for lighting purposes.  While I do not believe in reducing the speed limit in day time&mdash;I think, sometimes, a case could be made for getting slow drivers to move faster in day time&mdash;I feel that speed limits in the night time should be fixed at 40 miles an hour.  The person who drives very fast at night is a menace to himself, to every person and to every animal on the road.</P>
    <P>I find that passing out other cars or lorries on the road leads to a lot of near accidents.  This is particularly the case when three or four motor cars, a heavy lorry travelling at the rate of 25 miles per hour, and another lorry behind that one, are lined up behind one another.  It means that the motor car has to travel a considerable distance before it can pass out the two lorries.  That is a difficulty for which I cannot find any solution.  All the motor car drivers want to get through as quickly as they can.  However, the lorries may keep to the centre of the road, or as near as possible to the centre, leaving the space for passing them out very narrow.  This question needs a lot of attention.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the greatest danger on the road is the driver who has taken a little more drink than the ordinary person.  In my view, the great majority of road accidents occur because people driving motor cars are under the influence of drink.  The only solution I can see for that is that the courts might be even more severe in their punishment of such drivers than they are at present.  I suggest that the courts might remove such people's licences altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not know if other people feel as I do about pedestrians on the road. While people are always inclined to blame the motorists, I think that pedestrians contribute towards many accidents on the road.  It has been my experience driving through towns, <Col N="1824" /> particularly in the evening time, that the great majority of pedestrians, instead of confining themselves to the footpaths, walk in the middle of the streets.</P>
    <P>They seem to resent a motorist sounding his horn and he has to drive the car practically up to them before they will move out of the way.  In several towns I have had to bring my car to a standstill because pedestrians would not get out of my way.  I would not like to go into the difficulties that arise on a fair day in a country town.  The country people certainly resent a car being driven through a fair, and they take absolutely no notice of the hooting of the horn. Maybe they are right.  Maybe they have as much right to hold up traffic as anybody else.  However, the person in the motor car feels very sore about such a hold-up.</P>
    <P>Though the driving of cattle on to the roads does not seem to cause a lot of accidents, it certainly causes a lot of inconvenience to drivers, particularly if they are driving along main roads or by-roads in the evening time.  People just drive their cattle out on to the middle of the road when motorists are least expecting it.  Stray animals on roadways are another menace, and I will relate an experience I had some time ago.  The trouble was with horses on this occasion.  I was driving along a road, not very fast, and I met a car coming towards me with fairly strong headlights.  I had to stop my car, and it was lucky for me that I did; when I moved off again, rather slowly, I found the two horses were charging right into my headlights, and one of them kicked my front bumper as he passed.  He could quite easily have jumped over the car.  It so happened that, a half a mile back, I met tinkers driving along, with horses running loosely in front of their car.  Another motor car frightened the horses.  In fact, the car had to travel a half a mile before it could pass them.  When I came on, the horses were running madly, and plunged towards my headlights.  The law ought to be very severe on people who allow animals to stray along the roads at night time.  Particular attention should be paid to tinkers <Col N="1825" /> who allow their horses or other animals to stray along the roads in the way I have recounted, because they are a source of great danger.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the parking of cars comes within the scope of this motion, but I feel it is a question which ought to be considered, especially where towns are concerned. In towns one can see cars parked on both sides of very narrow streets at times.  If one happens to drive into a town at this particular time, and if there is a car coming in the opposite direction, one must turn back, because there would be great difficulty in trying to go forward.  The Department should try to make some arrangement which will not be too inconvenient for those wishing to park cars but which, at the same time, will allow people to travel over the roads in comfort.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Burke that the rules and regulations for the road should be inquired into.  We could keep talking on this subject for hours because every one of us is aware of the difficulties that arise.  Therefore, the Department should make a definite inquiry into the present position with a view to seeing if it would not be possible to devise rules which everybody would understand&mdash;the pedestrians, the cyclists and the motor-car users.  Most of the blame is attributed to the motorists, but I feel that much of the blame attaches to the cyclists. Any person who drives a car in this city between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. or between 5 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. feels that he is in great danger all the time because of the way in which the cyclists carry on.  I recommend to the Minister that he should agree with Senator Burke's recommendation that this whole question should be examined with a view to making it easier for all road users to travel in safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Burke on putting down this motion.  I suppose he is surprised at the wide range of the debate on what is a fairly concise motion.  I heartily agree with him that the time has come for the Minister to have this whole question of road safety examined.  As a result of pretty long experience, not <Col N="1826" /> only in my capacity as a private motorist but as the owner of a big business, I have seen the results of accidents on the roads, and I say that something should be done to prevent this state of affairs.</P>
      <P>I assert categorically that 50 per cent. of the road accidents are avoidable, and avoidable for two reasons. I have driven on the Continent and in the States.  In all the big cities in the United States, all traffic emerging from a side road, from what they call a junior road, on to a main road has to stop, even though the visibility is perfect and the driver can see quite clearly whether anything is coming or not.  In other words, it is an offence to drive out on to a main road without coming to a complete standstill and I urge that on the Minister as one provision which would go a long way towards ensuring some degree of safety on our roads.</P>
      <P>I want to say something now on a subject in relation to which I feel I have the sympathy of every member. We have an enormous development of building, particularly in our cities, and we are daily perpetuating rectangular openings on to main roads.  We are permitting houses to be built right up to acute corners.  Why?  Why should we introduce blind corners when we could so easily do without them?  There is no use relying on human nature. The human being is human and will continue to be human so long as the race exists, and we have to do something to control the irresponsible human being who will come out of an acute rectangular opening on to a main road without stopping.  That is to be seen within a mile of this building&mdash; new building schemes with acute rectangular openings on to main roads, with the building of houses right up to the corner permitted by the responsible authorities.  These are two points which could and would obviate many of the accidents we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, take the country districts.  We have been worrying in recent years about how to use some of our male labour, and about all sorts of schemes to keep our men employed.  Will anybody challenge this statement of mine, that there is enough work for months, <Col N="1827" /> if not for years, even now, for the surveyors in every county in surveying all side roads leading out on to main roads and throwing back the hedges to ensure good visibility for traffic emerging from them or entering them?  These are things that can be done, and I am glad to pay tribute to the foresight of some county surveyors who have had this work carried out.  They do not need to widen the roads and make perfect bellmouths, but they can throw the hedges back and allow drivers to see clearly what is coming against them.</P>
    <P>Speaking from very practical experience as a motor trader, may I ask how many Senators have seen accidents and have been afraid of accidents because of the habit of the drivers of lorries on our main roads of ignoring the law, which states that they must carry a driving mirror in such a position as to enable them to see overtaking traffic from their cab?  If the Guards checked up on the lorries using the roads at present, they would condemn a pretty big percentage of them on that one point alone.  Many accidents have been caused by drivers of private vehicles, in their impatience to pass a lorry, the driver of which could not see them coming, taking the chance that has involved them in an accident.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to a driving test.  I say deliberately that a driving test is useless.  Quite a big percentage of the accidents on our roads are due to experienced drivers and not to novices.  In quite a large number of cases, it is the case of the man who thinks he knows all about it and who takes that extra little chance which sometimes does not come off.  I am afraid that if you institute a driving test, it will not only not achieve its purpose but will add to the cost of motoring and of administration.  I am with those people, however, who say that where a driver has a very bad record, where he has been convicted on more than one occasion for reckless or dangerous driving, something should be done to prevent him continuing to drive and to be a menace to other road users.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Senator <Col N="1828" /> Douglas pay a tribute to the average driver.  We have to remember that in recent years the number of motorists has grown to an extraordinary extent, and I think it can safely be said that it is due to the extraordinary consideration and care of the average motor user &mdash;I use that term in relation to the private car, the bus and the ordinary lorry&mdash;that there are relatively so few accidents on the roads.  I was on the Bray road on Tuesday night&mdash;I have a daughter living out that way&mdash;and I, with 50 years' driving behind me, get scared every time I go on that road. I have a modern car with all the safety devices that human ingenuity can provide.</P>
    <P>What happens on that road?  It is there for anyone to see&mdash;the fellow with the car who will not keep in the traffic line, and who breaks that traffic line. Here again there is a suggestion I would make to the Minister.  Where there is a straight traffic line of considerate drivers, all driving with consideration for other road users, and somebody in his impatience breaks that traffic line, he should be given, as they say in America, a ticket and so cure him, because he is a menace to other road users.  Senators know the Bray road, with the central division.  On Tuesday night, I saw a driver compelled to stop because he had moved out of line and could not get back, and had to wait until there was a break which enabled him to get in.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Loughman say that it is unfair to suggest that the responsibility for road accidents is entirely that of the motor user. Has any Senator driven out to Howth at one o'clock in the day, and met the battalions of cyclists, cycling 14 abreast on the Strand Road and, as Senator Loughman says, they resent any indication from a motorist that they are endangering their own lives by cycling in such a widespread array across the road?  Can anybody tell me why, when there are traffic lights which cause traffic to stop, the only traffic that stops is motor traffic?  The cyclist, 100 yards behind the front motor car which has to stop, continues to crawl on until he can lean against the wings of the leading car or get out in front, and when the line of cars has to move on it has <Col N="1829" /> to move through 20 cyclists who have crept up from behind.</P>
    <P>These are not vexatious or trivial comments.  These are the comments of a man who knows what he is talking about.  These are the things that are happening, and if we are serious about this motion, upon which I compliment Senator Burke, we have to take notice of the things that are happening.  These things could be avoided.  It is true to say that it is an offence in law for cyclists to ride more than two abreast. If that is so, there could be wholesale convictions any day or hour of the week in any Dublin street.</P>
    <P>The question of lights is a very vexed question.  I deplore the suggestion made by Senator Loughman that the Government should endeavour in any way to regulate the lights on a motor car.  I do not think it is practicable, but I do feel that something should be done to control the road hog, who, in addition to having a dimming device on his car&mdash;it is pretty common on all cars nowadays&mdash; has powerful spot lamps, which are a far greater danger than the ordinary headlight.  They are very much more powerful, and are generally focussed in such a way that they shine into the face of the oncoming driver. Something should be done to deal with that.</P>
    <P>There is a lot I could say on this subject, which is one of my pet subjects, but I do not want to use this little motion of Senator Burke's to go into a general discussion on road safety.  I think that all we should do in this little debate is to give the Minister practical suggestions upon which he could act.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke suggested that we should compel motorists to stop when emerging on a main road.  I think that I was the first to urge the other rule, that there should be bell-mouthed entrances to main roads all over the country.  That could be achieved without any great expense, but with a considerable chance of diminishing that crop of accidents which comes from the driver, who, because he has had too much drink or otherwise, is in a hurry on to the main road.</P>
    <P>I will make way for other speakers, but I would stress that this is a very <Col N="1830" /> important motion.  I hope that the Minister will regard it as one worthy of consideration, and I hope that some regulations will emerge which will diminish the number of accidents on our roads.  In my opinion at least 50 per cent. of the accidents need not happen if we do these two things&mdash;if we do other things we could reduce the number further&mdash;provide bell-mouthed entrances to main roads and compel traffic to stop before emerging on to main roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Seanad will welcome this motion of Senator Burke's.  In introducing it he has done a service to the State, and I hope that the Minister will give it the consideration which it deserves.</P>
      <P>In considering this motion we must bear in mind that as the law stands the Government have not any great responsibility with regard to the operation of the Road Traffic Act, 1933. The Minister for Local Government merely approves the regulations regarding traffic and the erection of signs, which have been prepared by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. Undoubtedly, of course, the Act suggests that the Minister will not merely wait until these regulations are made, but that he should, if they are not made, indicate to the Commissioner that he would like an opportunity of approving regulations.  These regulations, made by the Commissioner and approved by the Minister, should in the main be sufficient for the safety and control of traffic on our roads, because regulations have been made regarding the signs, pedestrian crossings and the general control of traffic throughout the country.  However, very frequently these regulations are not observed by the public and, less frequently, they are not enforced by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one regulation which was apparently never made, that suggested by speakers&mdash;the white line and stop on minor roads as they emerge on major roads.  In England on every minor road as it enters a major road you have a sign and a white line at which motorists must stop, and you have only to drive in a country where that regulation is in force to appreciate <Col N="1831" /> how useful it is.  There is no doubt in the world that it is most valuable in the prevention of serious road accidents, and I would suggest, as other Senators have done, that the Minister should see that such a regulation is prepared and approved by him. The Commissioner and the Minister can do very little, however, with the regulations already in force unless they get the co-operation of motorists and pedestrians.  It is pathetic to see motorists refusing to follow regulations which were made for their advantage, and for the advantage of the public generally.</P>
    <P>Local authorities sometimes either mistake their obligations or fail to carry them out properly.  At a road junction in a district not far from here you have two signs, one at the mouth of the major road and one at the mouth of the minor road indicating &ldquo;slow&rdquo; without indicating to the traffic which road has the prior right.  Such signs lead only to confusion.  There must be clarity and the local authorities who erect them where the Commissioner prescribes must carry out their duty properly by putting up correct signs.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are motorists must be reasonable about cyclists and pedestrians.  It is simply nonsense for a motorist in the City of Dublin to complain if he is held up at noon or at one o'clock in the afternoon because there are a large number of people who cannot afford a motor car and who must cycle to and from their lunch. We must be reasonable in this matter as we must be reasonable with farmers on fair days.  A farmer is quite right to hold up traffic on a fair day.  Why should a motorist expect to blow through a town on a fair day when people are engaged on their lawful occasions?  A motorist must not expect pedestrians and cyclists to get out of his way as soon as he comes along and neither must he expect farmers to scatter their cattle as soon as the Ford or the Rolls comes the way.  If the motorist is reasonable and pedestrians and cyclists observe the regulations things will be all right.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this is a shocking country in which to motor and <Col N="1832" /> that there is chaos on our roads. There is no such thing.  We are very little worse in the matter of traffic control or road behaviour than any other country; in fact, I do not think we are in any degree worse.  I cannot understand the people who complain about the awful things that happen on the Bray road.  Nothing more happens on the Bray road than on the road to Clonmel, Tipperary or anywhere else. If the regulations already in force were observed there would be no very great difficulty in motoring in this country&mdash; I am not suggesting that there is great difficulty at the moment.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there is a regrettable number of accidents, but I suppose that would be so no matter what regulations are made.  As Senator Summerfield said, quite a number of them are avoidable. I quite agree.  Invariably there is no really serious accident unless there are two motorists badly at fault. If there is only one badly at fault the other motorist, because he is driving with care and caution, is able to avoid the very serious results of the dangerous driving of the other man.  I have a little experience and am quite satisfied that you have no serious road traffic accident unless the two motorists are badly at fault.</P>
    <P>I think we should have no driving tests.  Generally the novice is very careful, and when he has got a little experience all he needs is common decency, and if he has that there will be no difficulty.  As to the examination of applicants for driving licences, it must be remembered that under the Road Traffic Act an applicant must declare that he is not suffering from any physical disease or disability which would be likely to cause him to be a source of danger in driving in public. It is an offence to make a wrong declaration. There is no necessity for a driving test and we should not worry unduly in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Garda motor patrol is the greatest cure for the road hog.  It has been an unqualified success.  It makes me think of the cartoon in a well-known picture, which showed all the traffic in a long line until a particular car left the line and went up a by-road&mdash;then it was Hades for leather, that car having been the patrol car; <Col N="1833" /> as soon as it went up the by-road, everyone was free to do what he wished.  Most of us have noticed that when there are many cars travelling to sports fixtures the Gardaí operate patrol cars with great success.</P>
    <P>Their presence is an indication that the regulations must be obeyed and every tribute must be paid to the Commissioner and to the Gardaí because of those patrols.  To-day we can recognise the patrol car&mdash;a magnificent station wagon in a prescribed colour. I suggest that the Minister might consider asking the Commissioner to make new regulations providing that an ordinary private car might be used.  It would be an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>There is no point in making regulations if the people will not follow them, or in erecting road signs if people, young or old, throughout the country will pull them down or point the indicators in the incorrect way or remove studs from the road.  The young&mdash;and perhaps not so young&mdash;should be educated to the view that these things are in the interest of the people generally.</P>
    <P>In regard to car parking in the cities, we are acquiring property for rehousing and so on but no public authority&mdash; which is obliged to provide, in conjunction with the Commissioner, for the parking of cars&mdash;will have the courage or good sense to acquire derelict or uninhabited property for that purpose.  There is any amount of money to spend on many things, but none for a matter which is vital in cities and big towns.  Some effort was made by the Dublin Corporation&mdash; there is an excellent car park at Golden Lane&mdash;and other authorities in cities and towns might follow that example. The Dublin Corporation might do a little more, by acquiring more property for that purpose.  There is a big number of people to be considered &mdash;the trader in the city, the man who must come to his office or business, the tourist and the country visitor who comes for business or shopping.  It is very difficult for people to obtain parking space merely because it is not provided as is should be.</P>
    <P>Some people might think that I am too modern in making the suggestion that I now make.  There is a wonderful <Col N="1834" /> space at the top of Grafton Street, Stephen's Green, an excellent park. People will say I should not say this, that it is a shocking thing to say.</P>

      <P>Again, the enforcement of the regulations could be more effectively done by the Gardaí.  Frequently, we see cars parked immediately opposite a bus stop or within the prescribed distance of a bus stop, with the result that bus drivers must stop out on the roadway, completely blocking oncoming or overtaking traffic.  If the law were enforced and if it were made clear to the public that they could not break the law with impunity, we would be relieved of that difficulty.  If people spend a little more time parking than is prescribed, they should not be put to a great deal of trouble merely because they have overstayed their time by five or ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Seanad accept the motion proposed by Senators Burke and Douglas, but I want to make it clear that the Minister is entitled to say: &ldquo;I have approved of certain regulations&mdash;that is my function in the matter&mdash;and there is nothing more that I can do.&rdquo;  I would say to him: &ldquo;Perhaps there is; you might ask the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána <Col N="1835" /> to submit to you a fresh draft of new regulations, having in mind what you have heard here this evening.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little left for anybody else to say.  I felt like telling a story, but was told that somebody else told it just before I stood up.  When people think you are faced with a terrible calamity it often turns out to be a blessing.  It is a good job for a lot of people that there are no newspapers being printed to-morrow. Senator Burke, in co-operation with Senator Douglas, was complimented for introducing this motion.  All I would say to Senator Burke is that he is very lucky that this discussion will not be published in the newspapers to-morrow.  If it were he would have to get police protection when he went back to Clonmel, because if all those suggestions in regard to road tests and driving tests were seriously put into operation, I doubt whether any person would drive a car at all.</P>
      <P>I am quite convinced that this country is not what it was represented to be by several of the speakers who contributed to the debate to-day.  I do not think there is anything seriously wrong at all in this country. This motion has done some good when it gives me the chance of disagreeing with Senator Loughman and agreeing with Senator P.F. O'Reilly.  Accordingly, there must be some good in the motion.</P>

      <P>I think it would be a very serious thing if a lot of the speeches made were taken seriously. That applies to speeches from both sides of the House.  It would have a disastrous effect on tourists.  Not only would it prevent them from coming, but it would force the people who are already here out of the country as quickly as they could before they would be run down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain improvements could be made but anybody could name all the improvements necessary in half a dozen words or at least in not more than a dozen.  If you had regulations of some kind to prevent people travelling on to <Col N="1836" /> a main road without exercising care, and, if you could get cyclists to display rear lights on their bicycles and, of course, deal with headlights there would be very little more necessary.</P>
    <P>It was Senator Loughman who complained about the difficulty of getting through a cattle fair, but there are few towns I know of in which there is not some way of by-passing a cattle fair.  If things go on as they are going it will be very easy to get through a cattle fair.  It will be only a matter of time before there will be no horses in the fields let alone on the roads.</P>
    <P>In connection with the cyclists, Senator Summerfield said that two cyclists could not ride abreast if the law were enforced.  I would not like to be the one who would suggest that a boy and girl could not cycle abreast on the road in the city or any other part of the country.  I would not like to be the one to suggest that they should not.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of driving at night, some Senators suggested that there was not much necessity for speed limits during the day but there was during the night.  Again, I am of the opposite opinion.  I think there is very little necessity for a speed limit during the night because at night time every driver&mdash;unless he is a lunatic and in that event he would be locked up before very long&mdash;has his lights on.  At night time the situation is not as dangerous as in the day time.  There is necessity for a speed limit during the day time.  I believe that this question of driving at night will become more serious as the number of vehicles increases. Probably something could be done to eliminate accidents caused by people driving at night.</P>
    <P>The non-dimming of lights at nighttime has become so common that it is now almost accepted that one does not expect a person to dim his lights. It has almost reached that point now. If the law does not require a person to dim his lights it should probably be made obligatory on him to do so.  A lot of old cars have not dimming devices. I am not talking about the 1901 or the 1902 models.  It would be difficult to dim the lights on some of the cars that were manufactured not so very long ago.  I would say that it is certainly disastrous to have very <Col N="1837" /> powerful spotlights on cars which cannot be dimmed.  Nobody thinks of putting them off and if one of those lights were flashed into your face there is a very good chance of your going off the road if not going over the fence.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield also referred to the question of pushing back the hedge. There is no doubt but that Senator Summerfield has made a great study of motoring.  It is his line of business and he knows a lot more about it than most other people.  I think a good deal of good could be done by pushing back the hedge.  I take it he meant taking the hedge down and putting up some kind of a paling over which people can see when approaching a cross-roads.  If that is what he meant, I am with him 100 per cent., but I think that money is being spent unnecessarily on what is called straightening the roads in certain places.  Straightening the roads gives people a chance to get up terrific speed. I have been in motor cars, not my own, when the people driving them thought they were doing fine with a speed of 80 miles an hour.  If the roads were not straight they would never get that speed up.</P>
    <P>As I said in the early stages, if we were put to a severe test I am afraid that a good many of us would be put off the road.  Some of us may have very high-powered cars, some may have low-powered cars, while others of us may have efficient or inefficient cars. The fact is that the situation here is not nearly as serious as it was represented to be.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Minister has as much sense as I think he has, he will discount a lot of the advice he got and, like the rest of us, agree that certain improvements could be made.  It is a good thing that we are not getting publicity for everything that was said. It would be disastrous for the country, particularly with regard to the tourist industry.</P>

      <P>This debate has covered the ground from the motorists' point of view, but, as one who walks, might I put in a word for the ordinary pedestrian?  At the present moment one would need a helicopter to cross from one side of Grafton Street to the <Col N="1838" /> other.  Road markings are of no avail whatsoever.  Motor cyclists, particularly the Post Office messengers, are a public menace.  One cannot cross any of the main streets to-day without one of those members of the Post Office messenger service coming up at 80 miles an hour and stopping dead behind you.</P>
      <P>The poor pedestrian in Dublin gets a terrible time.  I suggest that the zebra sign should be adopted in Dublin and that it should be obligatory for the motorist to stop.  I was in Derry and Belfast recently, where vehicles dare not cross the zebra sign when a pedestrian is crossing.  All motorists observe that.  I hope that the regulations will be observed more strictly here.</P>
      <P>While on that subject, might I make a plea for the points policemen on duty?  They are deserving of the greatest consideration.  I suggest to the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether this is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government, but if it is not, I would ask him to pass the suggestion to the Minister for Justice &mdash;that those policemen should direct the traffic from a rostrum, where they would be protected from the weather. They should direct by lights rather than by hand.  That has been done successfully elsewhere.  Anybody who has seen the policemen at Stephen's Green directing traffic, coming from four different directions on a wet day, will have the greatest sympathy for them.  The same is true of the policemen at the corner of Middle Abbey Street and at College Green.  It should not be impossible to erect rostrums at those places so that the policemen could have some kind of shelter during the bad weather and so keep their feet dry.  I understand that one of them became ill from a cold. I make that suggestion on behalf of the Dublin policemen who do an exceedingly good job of work under great difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the signs be not put at cross-roads and that the signs are too small.  If you do not know a road and want to find where you are going you must stop your car.  I suggest that a sign would be placed at least a mile <Col N="1839" /> from the next signpost to indicate the direction of the turn.  I understand that that has been tried in other countries and has been successful.  If cars are going at 70 miles an hour, as Senator Quirke said, and they suddenly come to a cross-roads and have to find out where they are going, they have to pull up very quickly.</P>
    <P>There is the common joker who turns signposts around.  He is a public menace.  It should be made a punishable offence to turn signposts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be a punishable offence.  Senator O'Reilly probably knows the countryside better than I do.  I have had the unfortunate experience of going 15 miles in the wrong direction due to a signpost being turned around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always amazed that the Bray Road is not strewn with bodies every night and every morning.  It is a great tribute to the average Dublin driver that it is not.  It is amazing to me that there are not more accidents every day on that road, due, not to the general run of drivers, but to the odd driver who, as Senator Summerfield said, breaks the line.  The Grand Prix was never run as the races from Donnybrook church to Mount Merrion are run.  I suggest to the Minister that he should get police patrol cars to cover that area from 5 to 7 o'clock in the evening, that the men should be dressed in ordinary attire and should not be in the usual truck, which motorists recognise.  When the police patrol is on the road, there is some semblance of decency, but when they are not on the road there is indiscriminate driving.  Last evening an M.G. sports car passed me on that road doing at least 70 miles an hour.  That was just beyond Donnybrook church on the rise of the hill.  On that road that speed is suicidal, and if something is not done about it something terrible may happen.  Already we have had six deaths at one corner there.  Some people attribute that to the camber of the road.  I think it is due to careless <Col N="1840" /> driving.  It is a very grave responsibility. It is a tribute to the ordinary motorist that there are not bodies strewn on that road every morning and every night.</P>
    <P>The only thing of any avail that can come out of this motion is the suggestion that there should be larger signs. When a motorist is driving at night he simply cannot read signs as they are placed at the moment.  I understand that they are mainly Automobile Association signs and that consequently they are not under Government control.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that in addition to the white line at major cross-roads there should be a belt of cat's-eye studs so that the motorist may be aware that there is a major road ahead.  Senator Burke and Senator Quirke know that there was a terrible accident in their own territory not very long ago due to the fact that a man and his wife and family were driving out of a side road and there was a car going ahead on the major road, and there was nothing whatever to indicate that there was a cross-roads.  The sign was hidden by a side ditch and the unfortunate woman was killed.</P>
    <P>This motion should do good.  It should be accepted by the House.  The Minister cannot easily avoid the implications of the motion.  He should not easily avoid the fact that there is a certain amount of disquiet about the traffic problem generally.  I cannot say whether the suggestions made here will solve that problem.  The motion has evoked comment on the present position, which may not be as bad as some of us think or which may be worse than some of us would hope.  Anything that will help to ease traffic congestion on the road and to warm the careless driver will be of help.  I have seen boys and girls in sports cars recently, particularly on the Bray Road, doing 60 to 70 miles an hour.  These people should be warned of the danger to the community.  Anything that can warn them of that danger is of service even though it might not be implemented in legislation.</P>

      <P>There is one special point that I would like to emphasise because I do not think it <Col N="1841" /> has been sufficiently emphasised.  Signposts may serve for direction or for identification.  When I motor through unfamiliar parts of the country, as tourists normally do, I find it very disturbing not to know the name of each village or town that I come to.  In most cases there is no indication whatever of the name of the particular village or town in the Republic as you approach it, unless I am very much mistaken.  Perhaps I am wrong.  I think it is something that must be kept in mind.  Some people think I am right and some think I am wrong, so perhaps I am partly right.</P>

      <P>It is worth raising the point because I know there are cases where one has to search on a map or inquire or look for the local post office before one can get the name. It was particularly bad after the war because, of course, by Government Order, all these signs had to be removed, in case of invasion, and in some cases they simply have not been put back.  I do not want to enlarge on that point, but I would like to remind the House and the Minister that we want signposts for identification sometimes as well as for direction.</P>

      <Col N="1842" /> Cé go bhfuil feabhas mór tagtha ar chúrsaí na mbóthar le tamall, tugaim féin fé ndeara gur féidir feabhas níos mó a chur orthu.  Siad na lochta is mó a thugaim fé ndeara ná daoine ag teacht amach ó na taobh-bhóithre. Tagann siad amach uireannta go hanmhear agus tá riail ann go bhfuil ceart slí ag an bhfear ar an mbóthar mór.  An fhaid atá an riail sin ann, deineann sé i bhfad níos measa é má thagann daoine amach go mear ó na taobh-bhóithre.</P>

Chonnaic mé i bpáipear Sasanach le déannaí gur tháinig fear amach ó chúl-bhóthar go mall.  Bhí Garda in aice leis agus dhein sé íarracht stop a chur leis. Níor stad an tiománaí.  D'fhéach sé mór-thimceall air agus chonaic sé nach raibh éinne ag teacht ó threo ar bith, agus d'imigh sé leis.  Tar éis tamaill, tugadh ós comhair na Cúirte é agus cuireadh fíneáil deich scillinge air. Dúirt sé: &ldquo;D'fheach mé mór-thimceall orm agus ni raibh éinne ag teacht ó threo ar bith.&rdquo;  Dúirt an Giúistís leis: &ldquo;Tá an dlí ann, agus níor stad tú.&rdquo; Dúirt an fear a bhí i gceist: &ldquo;Ach, tháinig mé amach go mall.&rdquo;  Ars an Giúistís leis: &ldquo;Ní mar a chéile teacht amach go mall agus stad,&rdquo; agus cuireadh an deich scilling fíneála air.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is no other matter on which people are prepared to give such ill-balanced or ill-considered views as this question of traffic and motoring. I did not intend to speak at all, but, having listened to so many speakers, I felt that I could not be less responsible in my statements than they were. There is no point in one section of us saying that motorists are completely irresponsible, in another group suggesting that the fault lies with the cyclist, and in yet another group saying that the blame should be put on the small group who use motor cycles.  It is perfectly true that, relatively speaking, there are fewer motor cyclists in this country than in other countries; statistics prove that. All these different opinions show that we have not a proper approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke deserves quite a lot of sympathy.  He put down this motion in good faith, and I suggest that the fundamental consideration embodied in it is the question of signposting. It is clearly unfair to Senator Burke that members who, apparently, did not give much consideration to this matter should use his motion for the purpose of dragging up every possible by-road.  Members should have confined <Col N="1844" /> themselves to a discussion of the terms of the motion.</P>
    <P>This question of signposting leaves some room for improvement.  While the control of signposting is vested in local authorities in conjunction with the Gardaí, there will be no standardisation. Standardisation, as well as efficiency, is needed in this matter. Some people say more signposts should be provided; some people suggest the signposts should be bigger, while others have different ideas on the subject.  Has it occurred to anybody that there can be over-signposting? I know of certain roads where every single corner is signposted fairly well.  What is the result? Nobody takes any notice whatever of these signposts.  In my opinion, signposts should be erected where there is a reasonable need for warning and a reasonable chance of danger.  The fact is that there is reasonable signposting in some areas and over-signposting in other areas.  The latter position can prove to be just as dangerous as the former.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that this motion will produce some results in the way of standardisation in signposting.  It has been used by members to cover very wide ground.  Some members, like Senator Summerfield, had some regard for the facts of the case.  He said that 50 per cent. of the accidents that occur could be avoided. Immediately after that Senator P.F. O'Reilly and Senator Quirke became possessed of the same evil spirit, and tried to prove that that was not so. Before Senator P.F. O'Reilly sat down, the evil spirit had been exorcised but, apparently, it took possession of Senator Quirke, because he adopted the same tactics.  These two Senators tried to prove that there was no danger at all.  That is not a reasonable view because the statistics of accidents prove that there is danger.</P>
    <P>I heard Senator O'Reilly suggesting that St. Stephen's Green should be taken over as a car park.  I was slightly annoyed by that, to say the least of it, and I felt inclined to interrupt him to suggest that he should also take over Glasnevin on the north side and Trinity College in the centre of the city.  He would then probably make it possible <Col N="1845" /> for everybody to be within reasonable distance of their cars.  I do not think he really meant that suggestion, but perhaps he did.</P>
    <P>The only point I wanted to make in this debate was with regard to over-signposting. I suggest that there is room for improvement in the general situation with regard to traffic.  I do not at all agree with those who say that there is no danger at all, or that motorists and motor cyclists are not really dangerous people, but I suggest that some of the accidents which take place in rural areas could be avoided, if a few of the practical suggestions made by Senator Summerfield were adopted, such as the cutting down of hedges&mdash;not necessarily removing them but cutting them down with an ordinary hedge knife.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many accidents could be avoided by the provision of wider openings on to major roads and if people were compelled to stop when entering a second-class road from a third-class road, or entering a first-class road from a second-class road.  I know that that system operates in America and it has been so long in operation there that the people obey it, but, with all respect to Senator Summerfield, I am afraid it would be a very long time in operation before people would obey it in Ireland, although if it were obeyed, it would obviate many of the accidents.</P>
    <P>That point is as important in a rural area as in the cities, because people living in a rural area who have private roads up to their houses are inclined to come down these roads in a hurry and out on to the main road where they find themselves in collision, or nearly in collision, with a tractor or a car. There are more near misses in this country than direct hits, and that is probably a tribute to the relatively good drivers in Ireland, but the fact that we have so many near misses proves that by better regulation some accidents might be avoided.  The best we can expect is that the Minister will give consideration to this matter with a view to making better provision, by means of, I hope, reasonable regulations, because regulations which are unreasonable will be unworkable and will defeat their own purpose.</P>
    <Col N="1846" />
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this discussion on the need for a new set of regulations in relation to our road traffic and one would, I think, be pardoned for coming to the conclusion that the mere drafting of regulations would suddenly bring about some change in our approach.  We have heard various Senators propound their solutions and Senator O'Donnell suggested that, in the case of cross-roads, there should be a sign a mile away indicating the situation of that crossing.  To my mind, that is a suggestion that what we should aim at is giving us throughout the country a racing track, because if one does not intend to engage in that very serious and, so far as this motion is concerned, obnoxious activity, speeding, there should be no necessity for any such indication.  To my mind&mdash;I speak as one who has not the proud privilege of being the driver or owner of a car and as one who has not driven a car for a considerable number of years&mdash;we must have some regard for the responsibilities of those who are owners and drivers of cars.</P>
      <P>I think it is unfair to suggest that the majority of such people are irresponsible persons.  The least amongst us has an appreciation of the value of his own life, and in giving people permission to drive a vehicle on the highways, even though our regulations may be regarded by some people as somewhat lax, we must always bear in mind that every driver of such a vehicle realises that his own life is at stake.  It is not at all fair to suggest that the majority of these people are irresponsible.  My view is that the more improvements we make in our highways, the more dangerous corners we remove and the straighter we make our roads, the more we encourage an increase in speed, and the more liable are we to have accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper place in which to tackle this problem and many of the problems facing our people is not here, by passing motions or suggesting that a Minister should have power to make regulations.  There is very little use in passing a Bill unless it is going to be enforced and there is acceptance of its provisions.  The proper place in which to approach these problems and many of the other problems we have is our <Col N="1847" /> schools.  It may be taking a long term view, but if we could instil into our people a sense of their responsibilities when they take out a driver's licence or engage in many of the other activities in life, we would be approaching this problem from the right direction.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell suggested that our signposts were too few.  With that I agree, particularly from the point of view of visitors to our country, but, as Senator O'Reilly said, you can overdo signposts.  If you go along a road on which you find innumerable signs you are inclined to take very little notice of them, whereas if you find that they are placed only at important junctions or before entering villages or towns you will appreciate them.</P>
    <P>Young people and people without a proper sense of responsibility find amusement in re-directing signs.  You come to a cross-roads and find that the sign is pointing the wrong way.  That is probably the act of a school-child, but we should not blame the school-child alone.  Surely there are responsible people in that parish who, in passing that sign on their way to church, to fair or to market, have contributed in their own way to the inconvenience which is caused to travellers like our friend Senator O'Donnell, who seems to be very grieved by this re-direction of signs. We should instil into our people a proper civic spirit, and if we do that we will have very little need to pass motions like this or ask the Minister to draft regulations.</P>
    <P>We are bound to have accidents and, considering the increase in traffic on our roads and the increase in the number of vehicles registered during the past few years, there is no substantial increase in the number of accidents.</P>
    <P>About 12 months ago we had a motion on these lines before us, and the Bray Road was mentioned particularly. I have travelled on that road at various hours of the day and night, and I have not seen more danger on that road than on any other, provided that the persons in charge of vehicles are responsible, and I do not see why special reference should be made <Col N="1848" /> to it.  There have been accidents on it, undoubtedly, but there have also been accidents on roads in remote parts of the country.  I could refer to roads and crossings in the Country Galway, where there have been more numerous and more serious accidents than on the Bray Road.  Something has gone into our blood here which makes us harp on that road all the time, merely because something has happened in the past, and I do not think it is fair.  Motorists on that road are just as capable and as careful as on any other road.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Senator O'Donnell suggest that the Minister for Justice should employ a special branch of the police provided with cars which could not be distinguished from the ordinary vehicle to track down people who infringe the law.  I wondered how the Senator or any other Senator or responsible person would like it if such a proposal were put into effect.  Our people have looked unfavourably in the past on any special secret service engaged in spying on any section of our people. We would resent such a force employed politically, and we should also resent the use of such a force to spy on motorists, cyclists or anyone else. I am sure Senator O'Donnell would be the first to object if such a police force, paid out of public funds, were used to track him down and see that he complied with the regulations which he has suggested the Minister for Local Government should draw up.</P>
    <P>If, instead of starting in this House, we instilled into the young people in our schools a sense of responsibility, we would be going in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an easy job to keep two Houses going.  I apologise for being compelled to leave.  I heard a lot of talk in this discussion and I suppose a lot of what one might expect to hear on a motion of this nature on which every motorist has ideas of his own.  Always when a discussion of this nature is provoked here, in the Dáil or indeed in any other assembly, those who are motorists take advantage of the opportunity to describe all their problems on the road and to complain of the carelessness of the pedestrian, <Col N="1849" /> the cyclist, the man at the fair with the cattle, and so on.</P>
      <P>The movers of the motion would almost give the impression that they were urging upon the Government and those responsible to take steps which were not taken before, to make new regulations and indeed to amend the law if necessary.  I would not claim to be an authority on this subject because I was in doubt up to recently whether I or the Minister for Justice should take this motion here, but when it fell to my lot to appear I found that my officials during Senator Burke's opening remarks passed across to me a handful of regulations of all kinds and by-laws made down the years since 1933, designed, all of them, to protect the motorist and the public to the best of the ability of those who designed them.</P>
      <P>Although Senators wandered over the whole field, I do not think there were any really new suggestions or that anyone suggested putting in the hands of the law any instrument that was not already there.  Therefore, we must fall back on the enforcement of the law and of the by-laws and regulations already in existence.</P>
      <P>Senator P.F. O'Reilly made the speech I should like to make in so far as he explained the responsibilities of the Minister.  Being a solicitor, and handling hundreds of those cases all over the years, I suppose he would be fully conversant with the legal position and with the division of responsibility as between the Commissioner and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine now some of the suggestions that have been made here in order to reduce the number of road accidents or wipe them out entirely. No two Senators would agree completely as to the type of sign, where it should be placed, and what size it should be.  One person complained that signs were being damaged by youths or irresponsibles, and that would suggest that the larger the sign the greater the difficulty in protecting it.  Others wanted the signs not at the cross-road, but some distance from it.  Some Senators complained that there were too many signs.  Only a short time ago I was driving along a road on which an enormous expansion <Col N="1850" /> of signposting had taken place, and I happened to remark to the driver: &ldquo;People often complain about roads not being signposted, but we may soon reach a stage when it will be overdone.&rdquo; We were looking at danger signs here and other signs there, and came to one particular spot where there might have been on the one post 20 or 30 different signs, one showing the number of miles to one town, another the distance to a particular village.  There were other types of signs as well, and you had to look around that signpost for a long time to get the indicator you needed.</P>
    <P>The discussion on this whole question reminds me of a discussion in the other House on wireless broadcasting. No matter what pains those responsible take to determine the most attractive programme, Deputy after Deputy says that this or that should be in the programme.  One Deputy is enthusiastic about one item, but the two Deputies following him would not agree with that suggestion at all.</P>
    <P>I heard Senators here speak of the driving records of motorists.  Well, I travelled with some of those who claim to have an unblemished record of 30 years' driving.  I have one particular Senator in mind&mdash;he drove me across this city three or four years ago, and my heart was in my mouth until I got out of the car.  Like most Senators, I have been on the road for a long time, and I know that, in the main, it is not so much a matter of the regulations you make but, as many Senators have wisely stated, it is the extent to which you can by some means or other induce the public to co-operate with you.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford and Senator Douglas emphasised the desirability of indicating by a chalk line and the word &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; the approach of a minor to a major road.  Some Senators who supported that line of reasoning gave the impression that this was a common practice in Britain.  I am told that, while it has been adopted to some extent, it is not widely adopted there. As Senator P.F. O'Reilly said, the Gardaí are the people responsible here for keeping a check on the causes of accidents, and they maintain that this is not by any means a very substantial <Col N="1851" /> contributing factor to the pool of accidents that occur on the roads in any one year.  In 1951 only one fatal accident occurred as a result of crashing from a minor to a major road.  I make this remark in order to show that it is not a common practice in Britain to signpost those roads in that particular fashion and also to show that the matter has been given some thought here by those responsible.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the difficulties that there are and having regard also to the fact that it has not contributed largely to the number of accidents all over the country, the authorities have suggested that, so far, at any rate, that course need not be taken.  I would be prepared to ask them to examine that matter again and, if it is found practicable, there should be no difficulty about giving my approval, if the initiative were taken, as it must be, by these people.</P>
    <P>On this matter of signs and warnings, in backward parts of the country there are cross-roads where both roads are equally important, or where it is difficult to see which is the more important, and very often there are no signs of any kind.  I find that when you have not got these signs people exercise quite a lot of care because they are in doubt.  It would not be right to say that we would be better off if we took none of these precautions at all. Whether it is the propaganda that has been distributed, the warnings given in the Press and over the radio, the lectures to school children, the many other steps taken to educate the public as to the dangers, the cases that arise in the courts in respect of which a good deal of publicity is given to regrettable accidents in which claims of one kind or another arise&mdash;whether it is all or any of these, I have figures to show that while there has been a tremendous increase in the number of vehicles that have come on the road since 1938, the number of accidents has been reduced.  It would not, therefore, be right to say that we might be better off if no action at all were taken.  These figures would appear to suggest that the action that has been taken to educate the public mind as to the dangers has had its effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> Senator Burke suggested that booklets should be issued.  That has already been done.  I have a booklet here, which is only one of three issued by the Department in the last few years. I want to say to the Senator that when I came to drive a car first, only a few years ago, I received one of those booklets.  I never opened it.  As a matter of fact, I never knew what was in the book at all until I was told that I had to come to the Seanad to speak on this particular subject.  Does not that admission&mdash;I think it is an admission that many people who drive motor cars could truthfully make&mdash;prove that although it is an excellent little book it is not read?  It is not very heavy. It is excellently produced and is very artistic and the instructions it contains are set out with an economy of words. Yet the Senator who put down this motion in this deliberative Assembly has urged me in the course of his speech to produce a booklet when one is already in existence.  There is not only one book in existence but three.</P>
    <P>It is the general experience that you need simplification if you have to give orders.  If you have to make regulations and if the instructions given to the general public are too heavy, very little will be achieved.  Senators want signposts that are large and they want signposts that are clear.  In other words, they want something on the roads in the form of signposts that they can fly past at 50 miles an hour and pick up all the information which is required by them.  If that is impossible and if you make the lettering small and give them quite a lot of information in that fashion they are not satisfied, just as they would not be satisfied if, in producing a book like this, you make it too heavy.</P>
    <P>If I, in my foolishness, could not find time to read this booklet, how much more so would I find it impossible to read something that was too wordy?</P>
    <P>My officials have showered all kinds of notes on me, giving me information on many points made by Senators.  I want to make it clear, although Senator Burke unwittingly tried to establish the reverse in moving this motion, that there are no grounds for believing that those responsible have been negligent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" /> I want to assure him that the law already provides quite extensive powers in respect of all the matters to which he has referred.  If the Gardaí are suspicious that the driver of a vehicle is incapable of driving, they can bring such driver in and put him through a test.  The regulations already in existence and the by-laws that have already been made give all the coverage necessary.  There would be fewer accidents on our roads if we could secure the public observance of the rules.</P>
    <P>Other Senators suggested that the law obliged motorists to have dimming apparatus on the motor cars.  They castigated those motorists who refused to dim where they had an advantage over the oncoming car in the power of their lights, who ignored this dimming apparatus and just dashed through, obliging the other people to stop until they passed.  I am not an expert driver, but I must say, from my experience in driving a car on the road at night, that it would be dangerous to oblige all persons to dim their lights.  Any time I found myself in real difficulties and any time I saw the other fellow in danger, it occurred only on a couple of occasions, when I did dim my lights with a cyclist ahead, I found I was quite near to the cyclist before I was conscious of the fact. From my own limited experience, I would hesitate very much, even if I had the power to do so, to oblige all who drive motor cars to dim their lights.</P>
    <P>There again you have a conflict of opinion as to what should happen. One man with more experience than another would say it should be obligatory.  With my experience, I would say that it would be dangerous to take such a course.  It all boils down to the fact that we must, within reason, try to induce those who use the roads to exercise great care.  When you come to decide the methods by which you will bring that home to the public, you find yourself having to make a decision at the stage where even propaganda fails.</P>
    <P>It is all right to have a certain amount of well thought out propaganda on the way in which the road should be used, the way in which <Col N="1854" /> motorists and cyclists and pedestrians should behave, and so on, but, if you concentrate upon that type of propaganda too much, you will reach the point when it will not be effective. In working out any scheme by which the public mind could be made more alive to all these dangers, you have to exercise a good deal of care and make sure that you will not tire them and make them resist you in the line along which you want them to think and to travel.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the use of danger signs.  Mention has been made here of the cats' eyes studs and the chalk marks on roads.  I have often felt that the extensive use of these cats' eyes in some counties is nullifying the good effect that they can have.  When they were first introduced here they were used only on very dangerous corners.  By degrees they were used on less dangerous corners, and in some counties now they are continued on very long stretches of road where there is not very much danger at all.  Of course, the more they are used in such positions the more the public will come to disregard them.  A person will say: &ldquo;I used to look upon these as indicating that I was approaching a dangerous bend; now I find them being used in all kinds of places&rdquo;, and if he is not familiar with the road, he will take a chance and the worst can happen.</P>
    <P>My officials here have advised me that it is the opinion of those who have made a study of this matter that the use of the signs: &ldquo;Danger Ahead&rdquo;, &ldquo;Major Road Ahead&rdquo;, too frequently all over the country may result in people becoming careless and indifferent and saying: &ldquo;They are using these particular signs at all kinds of places.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This discussion, as I have tried to convey, has been largely availed of by Senators to describe the conditions that prevail on our roads and the extent to which regulations, by-laws, and all the rest of it are broken.  It has been a sort of general criticism of the manner of enforcement of the laws and the regulations that are at present in operation.  It was right for Senator <Col N="1855" /> O'Reilly to say that the description of conditions on our roads as chaotic is a gross exaggeration.  I have not been abroad very much, but I have been on the Continent, and have seen what happens in some of the towns and cities there.  If one could describe the conditions here as chaotic, I do not know what words would describe the conditions in these places.</P>
    <P>The conditions here, I suppose, are very far from being perfect.  Our cyclists, pedestrians and the people who go to fairs and markets are, perhaps, careless.  They happen to be the people who have slow means of moving, and they look upon the person driving a motor car as the person who has all the advantages and who can quickly make up for any loss of time. That is their outlook.  It is an outlook, I suppose, that should not be encouraged, but it is one that we should try to understand.</P>
    <P>If, on reading the reports of the speeches made here this evening, anything emerges that requires further examination on the part of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or if, as a result of the suggestions and the criticism that have been levelled here, the making of any new regulation might be considered, I can assure the Seanad that we will draw the attention of the Commissioner to that and to the undesirable things that Senators have referred to as happening all over the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to press the motion to a division.  I would not mind allowing the motion to pass except for the fact that it suggests that the people who are responsible have been negligent up to this point, negligent about taking all the steps and all the precautions that might be taken to ensure that better conditions, from everybody's point of view, would prevail on our roads.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, therefore, I feel I must resist the motion, but I do so while at the same time giving the assurance that if anything worth while emerges out of the discussion I will see to it that it is examined by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and, if he thinks fit to make any further regulations <Col N="1856" /> that would help to mend matters, I will give him the co-operation that the law imposes upon me to give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in my reply to this motion.  I do not think the Minister wished to convey the impression that everything was all right in regard to this matter.  I am sure the police authorities, the Departments concerned and local authorities in this and in other countries are continually devoting their time to traffic problems. This is a growing problem.</P>
      <P>There is chaos on our roads because most of our roads were not designed to carry the type of traffic that is using our roads at the present time.  There has been much talk about the Bray Road but anyone who uses the Naas Road and tries to pass 20-ton lorries and trailers will realise that such vehicles were not designed to use the type of roads that we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some special regulations governing that type of vehicle would have to be introduced to allow the person to pass in safety.  A great deal of this debate has hinged around the question of signs and direction posts.  There has been some confusion with regard to these.  The Minister said there are too many direction signs at some cross-roads.  I am inclined to agree with him.  One may see ten or 15 places mentioned at a cross-roads, which tends to be confusing.  I am very interested in the question of providing warning signs.  Where danger exists such signs should be provided.  This would be a great help to people who are unfamiliar with a particular district.  That is why I specifically mentioned the word &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; in my motion; tourists both from Europe and from Britain are used to using roads which generally carry a much heavier amount of traffic than our roads and which, for that reason, have better warning signs than are provided in this country.  It must be very disconcerting if a tourist comes on from a link road to a main road without being aware of that fact.  Such a warning would be given in his own country. I motored in many parts of Britain&mdash; though I agree with the Minister when he suggests that I have not motored all over Britain&mdash;but where I did motor <Col N="1857" /> the white line was used and people were required to stop coming from side roads on to main roads.  Senator Douglas assures us that in Northern Ireland that system is universal.</P>
    <P>There is one matter of which I certainly feel we have reason to be proud; the number of road accidents has been reduced from 1938 to date despite the enormous increase in the numbers of persons using the roads.  I am delighted to know that a booklet with regard to the rules and regulations on the road is in circulation and that it is not a heavy tome but one which can be read quickly by anybody. However, no Senator who spoke on either side of the House appeared to have seen or heard of this booklet.  I have a vague memory of having picked it up one time in a garage.  I think it was not circulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been circulated a long time ago when road users were only a fraction of what they are at present.  I suggest that it should be re-circulated and handed to all recipients of a driving licence. Then any time those prosecuted said they did not know the rules of the road, they could be told that they were handed a booklet embodying such rules and regulations, and that it was their duty to read it.  They could not plead ignorance of these rules and regulations.</P>
      <P>Driving tests have been suggested. I suggest that such tests should take place only in the case of persons suffering from a disability, such as an artificial limb or, as Senator Loughman suggests, defective hearing or defective eyesight.  When a person receives a driving licence, it is accepted that he is capable of driving a motor car and not suffering from one of the defects mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress what Senator Hawkins has said; he believes the approach to this problem of safety on the roads ought to be taught in the schools.  He thinks that if youth are taught along the proper lines they will develop a proper road sense, and that this will do a great deal to solve our problems.  Very often it is found that <Col N="1858" /> adolescents using cycles and other vehicles give signs efficiently and effectively, while many of the older people, not accustomed to motor transport, do not give any signs at all.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think that police patrols would be of great value.  If these patrols went up and down the country they would act as a deterrent to a number of people using our roads, who constitute a danger to the public generally.  It must be remembered that there is always a small percentage, perhaps 2 per cent., 3 per cent. or 4 per cent., who are prepared to misuse the roads to the inconvenience of others.  It is due to the good sense and co-operation of other people who are prepared to give way that accidents are avoided.  I feel that the people who misuse the roads should be brought to book by police patrols.</P>
    <P>I do not want to press this motion on the Minister.  It goes forward here as a suggestion to him that there should be some improvements in connection with the rules and the laws of the road, and that some of these rules need revision and bringing up to date. The Minister says that he would like to have this debate examined by the proper authorities.  I hope that whatever good he finds in it will be considered and, where necessary, appropriate regulations made to promote better order on our roads.  When I put down this motion, I did so as a motorist with considerable experience, and also in the knowledge that there are some road users who constitute themselves a danger.  It is by propaganda and by the ventilating of our views on the subject that people will be brought to realise that they should always consider the other users of the road&mdash;men driving cattle to fairs and markets, the cyclist in the City of Dublin cycling home to lunch, and all the other road users.  I suggest that every road user has a duty to his fellow users, whether he is a motorist, a cyclist or a pedestrian.  I am grateful for the manner in which this motion has been accepted, and I hope that it will bear much fruit.  I now formally withdraw it.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.20 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
