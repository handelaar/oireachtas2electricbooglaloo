    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1957  (  Certified Money Bill )  &mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seeks to raise the limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund <Col N="1004" /> from its present level of £110,000,000, as fixed by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1956, to £135,000,000. The extension has become necessary as the commitments of the fund are nearing the existing limit; the new limit of £135,000,000 proposed should suffice to cover issues for a further two to three years.</P>
      <P>Issues from the fund, since its establishment on 1st May, 1935, up to the 30th September, 1957, amounted to just over £93,500,000, made up of approximately £75,500,000 for housing, over £14,000,000 for sanitary and public health services and £3,750,000 for vocational schools and various other services.</P>
      <P>The net commitments of the fund in the same period aggregated some £105,000,000, the excess over the figure for issues being due to the fact that most loans are issued in instalments to meet expenditure incurred as work progresses.</P>
      <P>With the growing satisfaction of local authority housing needs according as main building programmes are completed, demand on the fund from a number of areas has fallen, but up to the present any relief in this way has been more than offset by demand from Dublin and Cork Corporations. The requirements of these corporations, which were formerly able to fill their capital needs by means of independent borrowing, continue to constitute a heavy burden and it is this factor which makes it necessary to seek a further extension of the statutory limit for issues from the fund within a year and a half of the passage of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1956, which raised the limit from £90,000,000 to £110,000,000.</P>
      <P>I hope that in another year or two there will be significant overall relief to the fund and thus to the Exchequer which finances it.  Such relief is essential so as to keep down the burden of public debt and to free more capital for investment in selfperpetuating enterprises that will add to the country's wealth while also providing continuing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there is not <Col N="1005" /> any objection to this Bill because all Parties realise that certain essential services must be developed and expanded. I understood the Minister to say we put £95,000,000 into these services over the years.  I have no knowledge whether or not the Department of Finance have figures to indicate the position.  However, if I were to ask the Minister for the viewpoint of his Department with regard to the amounts which will be required, say, over the next five years, to go near completing schemes of house building, sanitary and water works, and activities of that nature in which local authorities are engaged and for which they draw from the Local Loans Fund, what does the picture look like?</P>
      <P>When one sits at a county council meeting and proposals come up frequently for borrowing in respect of a water scheme here, a sanitary service some place else, housing in different parts of the county, and so on, it is difficult to keep track of just how much one is doing.  Then, at the end of a period, when you ask what your borrowings are costing you for the year, their total amount and what they represent on the rates, the reply can be rather staggering and represent many shillings in the pound for every county council.</P>
      <P>At this stage, we ought to be able to bring a little more order into the problems confronting local authorities &mdash;problems which ought to be well on towards being resolved.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that many local authorities can now nearly see the end of their housing needs.  That is probably very true.  It ought to be possible, therefore, to have a fair idea of what are likely to be the total drawings on this fund for the next five or six years&mdash;or how far are we away from the completion of all these schemes which we regard as essential now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of interest which local authorities pay is of great importance. Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us on this point.  I take it that we will draw on this fund?  It will be assisted from the recent loan.  What will that cost local authorities?  I take <Col N="1006" /> it that the interest paid is the rate of interest fixed at the date on which the loan is passed out?  Is that really the position?  May I also take it that, as far as local authorities are concerned, there will be available to them from the Local Loans Fund such funds as they deem necessary to meet their needs over the next year or two?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us to what extent the loans now given to the Dublin Corporation and the Cork Corporation are restricting desirable schemes, such as water schemes, in other parts of the country. I feel there is rather a slowing-down of schemes of that nature.  I am aware that the amount of money demanded to supply regional water schemes in many of our counties is considerable.  However, I feel that the citizens of Dublin and Cork are looking for an undue share and that they may be responsible for showing-down certain works in the country which, if they are not entirely productive, assist production.</P>
      <P>We have often heard talk of hewers of wood and drawers of water.  There are still many drawers of water in Ireland, and there are many schools where water is not readily available.  I should like the Minister to tell us how far the demands from Dublin and Cork are slowing-down that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will indicate, for the information of the House, if the same facilities will obtain in future as obtained in the past for the local authorities to borrow money from the Local Loans Fund.  A number of schemes are yet unfinished&mdash;housing, sewerage, and piped water supply schemes.  I am particularly interested in housing in my own county of Sligo. Recently, sanction was given to Sligo County Council to borrow a certain sum of money.  We fear that the amount sanctioned may not be sufficient to meet the demands on us for the payment of supplementary grants.  For that reason, we are very anxious to know now if the same facilities as obtained in the recent past will obtain in the future.  Will money be as readily available in the future as it was on other occasions to enable us to guarantee those applicants who have not, perhaps, <Col N="1007" /> started work yet but who are willing to start?  We are anxious that they should get the same facilities apart from the rate of interest.  The housing problem has not yet been solved in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments on housing, particularly in urban areas.  The position is rapidly being reached where members of urban councils and corporations, such as myself, believe there are many people who cannot be rehoused because they cannot pay the rents.  Nobody knows better than I do that that is not the fault of the Minister.</P>
      <P>We have the problem of scarce money and dear money.  The Minister has to buy it and pay his price just as he has to buy any of the commodities the country needs.  Even though money is a commodity and has its price, the situation has now developed where poor people&mdash;there are many poor people in urban areas, in particular, where sewerage schemes and water supplies have also to be paid for and which increase the rent of the house&mdash;cannot afford to pay the rent on a new house.  It is a question of whether or not the differential rent approach is right.</P>
      <P>However, the stage is being reached when the Minister will have to reconsider whether the old system of subsidies of 66? and 33? from the Central Fund for local authority housing will not have to be stepped-up and if, in fact, the State will not have to carry more of the cost of building a house and the local authority and the tenant will have to carry less.  It is really a question of the rates and the tenant. The rates demand and the rent demand on the tenant are both going out of proportion.  In this respect, things are not as they were a few years ago.  The whole situation needs overhauling and perhaps the Minister would direct the mind of the Minister for Local Government to that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Baxter's figure of £95,000,000 the figure of issues so far is £93,500,000, <Col N="1008" /> not £95,000,000.  Of course, we are committed to £105,000,000 already. That is the difference.  It would be a very difficult matter to say what would be required over the next five years for housing, sanitary services, and so on.  The Department of Finance are very interested in that question.  They would like very much to be able to produce that figure, if only for their own information.  If they were able to produce a firm figure, they would not mind sharing the information with everybody else, but there are so many unknown factors.  For instance, it is only in the last few years that Dublin and Cork came on the Local Loans Fund.  Before that, they did their own borrowing.  I might answer another question that arises there.  I think it was asked by Senator Burke. As a result of that, the provincial towns are not suffering because the total amount issued by the Local Loans Fund for housing in the three years 1953-54, 1954-55, and 1955-56 was £7.25 million, £6.37 million and £6.56 million, but then, when the Local Loans Fund began to finance both Dublin and Cork, it jumped suddenly and in 1956-57 went to £8.43 million and is estimated at £9.75 million for this year. The fact is that the Local Loans Fund is carrying the financing of the Cork and Dublin Corporations, while at the same time the amount left for all the other urban and rural areas remains about the same.  There is no change in it.</P>
      <P>Reverting to Senator Baxter's question, there is not only that unknown factor of whether Dublin and Cork might be in a position again to rely on their own borrowing but even in smaller matters, a number of the counties, for instance, have been borrowing for, let us say, vocational schools and in some cases they have found it difficult and they come under the Local Loans Fund, too, and sometimes they go back again to their own borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last question, that would give us more trouble in estimating, is the amount of housing needed.  Every estimate we get of that appears to differ from the previous estimate, even if it is made by the same authority or <Col N="1009" /> the same person, because the conditions change.  One item, as an instance: the number of houses surrendered to the Dublin Corporation in the last year or two has been much higher than the number surrendered before that and, therefore, if the Dublin Corporation were making an estimate again now as compared with an estimate they made, let us say, three years ago, their figure would probably be quite different because they would estimate now that they would get 1,000 houses back per year, whereas they got only 300 houses back per year two or three years ago.  All these factors change so much that it would be very difficult to make a firm estimate, but, generally speaking, it looks as if most of the housing authorities outside Dublin and Cork expect to have filled their housing needs, as they see them at the present time, in a comparatively short time, let us say, three or four or five years.</P>
    <P>The rate of interest charged varies. The rule that was applied there usually, which has not been followed exactly, was that ½ per cent. would be added to the rate at which the Government was getting money, so that, before the recent loan was issued, the rate of interest was 5¾ per cent.  The rate of interest now for housing is 6¼ per cent., but we thought it well not to raise the rate under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts because a number of people were negotiating for a loan and had made arrangements and perhaps had gone even so far as to make arrangements to get married on a certain calculation of interest, and so on, and we thought it better to give notice there at least.  So, the rate of interest in the case of Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts housing will remain at 5¾ per cent. until 31st March next.</P>
    <P>That is not altogether an altruistic move on the part of the Minister for Finance because the Minister for Finance would prefer to see money spent on Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts housing rather than on local authority housing because, from his point of view, it is a cheaper way of disposing of the housing question.</P>
    <P>I am asked by both Senator Burke <Col N="1010" /> and Senator Roddy whether money will be available.  I think so.  I do not think we need anticipate any very big change in policy in regard to housing.  At the beginning of this year, although our finances were very difficult and it was hard to make ends meet in many ways, we did meet the Minister for Local Government in what he estimated to be the amount of housing that would be required for the year and I think the amount that we allocated for that purpose is quite sufficient to meet any demands that may arise.</P>
    <P>Of course, I know that certain Senators would say in answer to that that, of course, if sanction is held up, it is easy to make money hold out, but I do not think sanction is held up for that reason.  There may always be other reasons, of course, for the delay of sanction, such as the need to get certain information which the Department of Local Government might require.  I can say that as far as my Department is concerned and as far as I am concerned, the Department of Local Government have not been asked to delay housing in order to make the money hold out longer.  They have been given the money on the understanding that housing would go on in a normal way and there was no question of delaying things in that way.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan said on behalf of the local authority that the local authority finds it difficult to pay its part of the houses that are built at present cost and that the tenant finds it practically impossible.  It may be argued for the tenant that the rent is now very high on account of the increased cost of building, but the Senator will have to remember that the one-third cost which is divided between the local authority and the tenant may create certain difficulties but the two-thirds cost certainly would create difficulties for the State and it would be difficult for the State to consider giving any higher proportion than the State has been giving up to the moment.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a question that will always merit consideration and I have no doubt that the Department of Local Government and the Minister for Local Government will discuss the difficulty of meeting the cost of houses at the <Col N="1011" /> present time.  How that is to be got over, indeed, I do not know at the moment.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages today.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I go back for a brief moment to the queries I put to the Minister?  I consider that, from the State's point of view and, indeed, from the point of view of local authorities, it would be an excellent idea to get an assessment made of what we are likely to require in the not distant future in regard to expenditure from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>I seem to have a recollection that during the inter-Party régime a requisition was sent to local authorities to make an estimate of what their total expenditure was likely to be.  I do not know whether that was for one year or for a period.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be a very sound idea.  It is not possible, naturally, to have an exact estimate.  My colleague on the county council, Senator Cole, is younger and his mind is probably more alert and he will probably be able to say exactly, but, as far as I can recall, the repayment of our borrowings in our county amounts to 5/- in the £ on the rates in the year, though I cannot be quite sure of that figure.</P>
      <P>We are coming to the point in all local authorities when the representatives are rather frightened of taking on additional liabilities.  At the same time, there is necessity for the completion of schemes on which the State and the local authorities embarked a number of years ago.  Those left unexecuted are as necessary, the equities in the position are the same and there is as much justification for carrying out the schemes not yet started as there was for those completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> Local authorities, because of the dimensions of their borrowings and liabilities, are rather frightened and it would be well for us to clarify our minds on this.  We are nearing the end of this type of expenditure; it will mean so much expenditure in the year for local authorities and they have to face it.  When you know what you are likely to have to face, you are able to cut your coat according to the cloth and there can be an effort to bring in income to meet the burden which will have to be carried.</P>
    <P>No one can expect an estimate to be exact&mdash;it cannot be any more than an estimate&mdash;but it would be a healthy thing to have it as near as possible. There is a total of £95,000,000 going out from the Local Loans Fund.  How much comes back into the fund through the Exchequer annually of this total sum?  When those repayments of original loans come back, at what rate of interest is that money lent out again to local authorities? Obviously, out of £95,000,000, a considerable sum is repaid annually. What happens to it?  Does it come back into the fund from the Exchequer by some process of revolution; does it go out again to local authorities and at what rate of interest?  These are points I should like to have clarified, if the Minister has the information available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what I said, that it is extremely difficult to get an estimate for more than two years ahead.  We try to get it for two years ahead from the Department of Local Government, as we like to see what the expenditure is likely to be in 1958-59 and we also like to see where we will be going in 1959-60.  All the factors vary very much.  There is one thing we may be fairly sure of, that the cost of housing so far as the Local Loans Fund is concerned will not be higher.  It should tend to diminish at the very outside, I would say, after about two years, because a great number of the local authorities in small towns and so on appear to be reaching the end of their housing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is about £2,000,000 coming <Col N="1013" /> back into the fund every year by way of capital repayments which, of course, appears rather uneconomic. Out of a total sum of £93,500,000, we get back £2,000,000.  When one considers the very high element of subsidy in housing, it is understandable that about £2,000,000 is all one can get back.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In sub-section (3), line 32, after &ldquo;services&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to excessive profit margins at any stage&rdquo;.&mdash; (Senator Sheehy Skeffington).</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any necessity for this amendment.  In so far as excessive profits can be defined at all, or can be attributed to the manufacturer charging prices that are too high in particular instances, it seems to me that these circumstances are fully covered by the phrase in the section: &ldquo;owing to causes within the control of manufacturers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the manufacturer is charging too high a price and if that is the reason for the excessive profits, then that is a cause which the manufacturer has within his control, which he can deal with and which the committee can comment upon and make a reason for requiring the Minister to make an <Col N="1014" /> Order.  Therefore, I do not see the necessity for this amendment at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who oppose this amendment do so not on its real wording, not on what the Senator who proposed it said, but rather on what they imagine the Senator thinks.  To my mind, the spokesmen for the employers are doing their people no great service by strongly opposing this section, especially at the present time when the trade unions are being urged to have a sense of responsibility and not to press wage claims and when a maximum increase has been agreed at top level.  They are not doing a great service to their people by that type of opposition.</P>
      <P>The words proposed to be inserted are &ldquo;excessive profit margins.&rdquo;&ldquo;Excessive&rdquo; is a matter of opinion. It will not be Senator Sheehy Skeffing-ton's opinion, but, according to the section, it will be the Advisory Committee's opinion of what is excessive or not.  The recommendation of the committee has to go to the Minister and then again it will be the Minister's opinion as to excessiveness or otherwise of the profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was merit, I think, in Senator Ryan's point and I was afraid somebody would think of it.  It is quite true that if there are excessive profits, it would seem that the Advisory Committee in investigating the position and reporting to the Minister would take not of that fact or give their opinion on it.  At the same time, it is no harm whatever to have the words in.  It could probably be as easily argued that the words &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo; are unnecessary because of the preceding words in relation to persons rendering a service, because the supply of labour in such an instance would be rendering a service.  The people opposed to this amendment might think again on it and recognise that there is no real objection to putting in a reference to excessive profits.  The argument is not that profits should not be taken, but that the Advisory Committee should have regard to excessive profits and what their idea of excessive profits would be.  As I say, when trade unions and labour generally are asked to exercise restraint, and <Col N="1015" /> when we have in this section a reference to undue labour costs, which has not yet been explained, it is good and proper that there should also be a reference to excessive profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary by this time must be getting amused at this battle which is raging around him.  At last I am in agreement with my colleague, Senator Murphy.  With reference to whether prices are unduly high owing to undue labour costs, you would have to define &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo;.  Are they costs that arise owing to the inefficiency of the manufacturer, owing to the fact that he has too many workers in his factory?  Are they undue owing to the action of trade unions or some group of workers who happen to have a monopoly?  We can show the obverse side of the coin referred to by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, where there might be a monopoly among small groups of workers who have a particular form of ability or capacity.  I think Senator Murphy has a point that since undue labour costs went in, there might be some justification for putting in a reference to profits.  Of course the wording in the amendment &ldquo;excessive profit margins&rdquo; has no meaning.  The words &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo; in the section also have no meaning.  If it was that prices are unduly high owing to causes within the control of manufacturers or of persons rendering a service in connection with the manufacture of the article, or something like that, you would have a coherent phrase which would cover the universe, so to speak; but &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo; suggests a precision which is not there.  However, I will say this much for it: it has a shade more precision than the reference to &ldquo;excessive profit margins at any stage&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the earlier speeches, but, since I am the person who started this hare, I want to make my own position clear in regard to this amendment.  This amendment is not in any way animated by hostility to labour or to trade <Col N="1016" /> unions.  This Bill is very carefully drafted and there is a distinction between Parts II and III.  Part III deals with cases where there is an element of monopoly or restriction on competition and, on Section 14, there are amendments which seem to me could possibly be relevant there, because if a monopolist or person who is not subject to competition is netting a very large profit, then the result of that is possibly to keep the price of the commodity higher than it otherwise would be.  Therefore, what I am saying about the amendment to Section 10 does not bind me to say the same things about the amendments to Section 14 because the two parts of the Bill are fundamentally dissimilar.</P>
      <P>I should like very briefly to repeat what I said yesterday, that, in the industrial process, where there is competition profits do not raise prices. Profits emerge at the end of the year's trading and nobody knows what the profits will be until the year's trading is over.  Actual experience shows that the companies that pay the biggest dividends and have the highest profits are the companies that can undersell their competitors, and the companies with the biggest record of profits in Great Britain, for example&mdash;I do not wish to mention names, but perhaps I might mention Woolworths, a very well-known firm&mdash;are companies which, by their efficiency, are able to keep down prices to such an extent that they are able to compete successfully at lower prices to the public.  The success of these companies is shown not in high prices, but in low prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I am drawing a distinction between Parts II and III of the Bill. In Part II, where competition is working, and where there are no restrictive practices, high profits can never be the cause of high prices.  The profits emerge at the end of the productive process.  High prices may be caused by unduly high labour costs or by unduly high other costs of production within the control of the manufacturer or possibly outside his control, but profits are an entirely different type of income. They are the rewards of successful manufacturers.  They fluctuate very widely.  It must be emphasised that <Col N="1017" /> negative profits on the whole are more common than positive profits.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the mover of this amendment would be prepared to consider the possibility of making some allowance for profits which are excessively low because &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; here so far has been interpreted as being excessively high.  Supposing a manufacturer is unfortunately making excessively low profits, is anything going to be done to help him?  The people who go into business, the ordinary shareholders and business men, take the risk of production.  At the end of the whole process, when their costs have been incurred, their sales made and the prices determined in competition, they make a profit which is frequently negative, that is, a loss.  To say that the residual income for the risk taken in business can raise prices when competition prevails shows a fundamental misconception of the nature of business.  That is why I say the amendment is ill-conceived.</P>
    <P>The mover of the amendment has, I think, seen the point of my observations and, therefore, has been trying to explain the amendment by emphasising the term &ldquo;excessive.&rdquo;  As I said, &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; may be excessively low; it may cause unemployment and drive people out of business, but in this amendment, it is meant as excessively high.  As I said last night, if anybody can befine what is an excessive profit he is assuming there is something in the nature of a normal profit, because one cannot say something is excessive except in relation to something normal.  As I said last night, if it could appear that in a debate in this House in December, 1957 a normal profit was defined and therefore the basis for an excessive profit established that would be as great a landmark in the history of economics as the launching of the satellite has been in the history of physics.</P>

      <P>In putting forward this amendment, I referred to the potential factor, among other factors for unduly high prices, the possibility of excessive profits, as well as the possibility of undue labour costs, and I felt I was putting forward <Col N="1018" /> a plea for fair play.  The sub-section which I am seeking to amend, sub-section (3) of Section 10 says, &ldquo;an Advisory Committee shall report to the Minister... and if it reports that the prices or charges specified in its report are unduly high... owing to undue labour costs, shall state whether in its opinion circumstances are such as to require the Minister to make an Order&rdquo;.  I feel it unfair to single out for mention undue labour costs, and to omit all mention of the possibility, which I think is a possibility, despite what has been said, that a factor may be&mdash;I do not say necessarily is&mdash;but may be excessive profit margins. Senator O'Brien has talked about &ldquo;excessive losses&rdquo;, and asked would I be prepared to consider them.  As Senator Murphy has pointed out, I shall not be on the Advisory Committee, but I could imagine an Advisory Committee being told by a manufacturer: &ldquo;You may think our profit margin was a bit high this year, but clearly last year there was a loss&rdquo; and certainly that would be taken into account.</P>
      <P>My view is that there are many factors for possible high prices.  We mentioned some of them.  One is the cost of labour being unduly high, but another is the cost of capital, which may also be unduly high, and we do not mention that.  We mention one but not the other.  There has been underlying part of this debate the view that there is no such thing as an undue profit.  I do not know whether that really is the contention.  I do not know if anybody would get up and say it could not happen, that excessive profit exists only in my mind, that it does not exist in reality.  I did ask in my opening remarks that the amendment itself be treated and not the whole question of whether you should have profits or not. I asked that the question of excessive profits should be considered.  If I may quote what I did say last night:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I realise that any time one mentions the word &lsquo;profit&rsquo; it creates a great deal of confusion and even indignation because if one says there should not be exorbitant profit or excessive profit, people get up and say: &lsquo;Apparently you do not think <Col N="1019" /> there should be any profit at all,&rsquo; as if the only kind of profit was exorbitant profit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear to me, as explained by several speakers, that profits are one thing and excessive profits are another. But it is no defence against my amendment to say you &ldquo;must have profits,&rdquo; and therefore must not talk about excessive profits at all.  You must have labour costs too, yet we do talk about undue labour costs.  Labour costs can be too high, and we mention that as a possible factor.  I suggest, in spite of all that was said, that profit margins can be too high.  If we mention one, we should mention the other.  I see no point in the argument against it, unless it can be proved that profits can never be too high.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it may not necessarily be the manufacturer, or the people &ldquo;rendering services&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps it may be the middleman&mdash;who may be responsible for excessive profits.  If you see a cabbage for which the producer got ½d. costing 5d. in the shops, you do get the impression that somewhere along the line there was an excessive profit.  If a fisherman gets 9d. a stone for herring and if the housewife has to pay 1/- a lb., he would be a bold man who would see no great ground for suspecting an excessive profit somewhere there.  Senator O'Brien says you cannot limit the profit margin.  I am not proposing that; I am merely asking that it be considered as a factor. I am merely asking the Advisory Council to go into the question of excessive profits as well as of undue labour costs.</P>
    <P>It is true, as was stated by me, that we do limit certain profit rates.  Senator O'Donovan admits that we limit dividends on things like gas but that gas &ldquo;is a monopoly.&rdquo;  My point is that a monopoly-situation exists in relation to the price of very many more commodities than many people recognise, because of price-fixing rings.  A monopoly-situation might well require the possibility of excessive profit-taking being examined by this Advisory Committee.  It may not be the manufacturers. It may be the traders' ring which may insist on excessive profits <Col N="1020" /> being taken by retailers under threat of stoppage of supplies.  I cited a case that was proved in open court, as it were, before the Prices Advisory Body, and here I think Senator O'Brien is under a serious misapprehension.  He thinks he is living in a free competition economy.  Things would be very different if that were so, but again and again we find that it is not so.  I am glad to note that he made a distinction between Part II and Part III of the Bill.  Part III relates to the Fair Trading Commission, and restrictive practices, but I am of opinion that Part II might relate to situations where as yet no restrictive practices had yet been proved to exist, and where there might be a factor of excessive profit causing unduly high prices.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan suggested that the amendment was &ldquo;not necessary,&rdquo; because the question of excessive profits is &ldquo;in the control of the manufacturers,&rdquo; but I think, if it is necessary to mention labour costs as a possible factor, then we should mention the capital cost factor also.  In other words, we should mention neither of them or both.  I did not notice any amendments being put down by those who differ from me, to the effect that we should not mention &ldquo;undue labour costs,&rdquo; because of the fact that the working man must get his wages. Nobody suggested it was insulting to the worker to put in &ldquo;undue labour costs,&rdquo; with no mention at all of the possibility that excessive profit-taking might be influencing the price, and might be making it unduly high.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan mentioned the way in which this debate had been going around and that he had come to agreement with his colleague, Senator Murphy.  I hope the debate will come full circle and that he will come to agreement with me.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with one point lest it might be thought that Senator Sheehy Skeffington had <Col N="1021" /> anything in it.  He talked about monopolies existing in this country. Anybody who keeps up with the facts of economic life around us is aware of these monopolies in small articles which are produced for general use, but, when you are considering a matter in this way, you must look at the general situation.  The great bulk of the average person's income goes on food, clothing and shelter. There are no monopolies in food that I am aware of.  The clothing and boot and shoe industry is one of the most highly competitive in the country being composed of a very large number of small firms.  We know what the position of the housing industry is at present.</P>
      <P>Let us take an opposite example, pointing the opposite way, to the example Senator Sheehy Skeffington gave last night.  The first group of people whom the Fair Trade Commission examined in this country were the builders' providers.  That was one of the greatest economic jokes ever perpetrated in this country.  When the facts relating to the economic situation were being built up in the Department of Industry and Commerce in the years 1945 and 1946, the people in the builders' providers' industry were in a monopoly position and were making more profit, perhaps, than was reasonable to expect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; for that short period.  When the Fair Trade Commission went into action, they took the industry which had been one of the causes why the Fair Trade Commission had been set up and examined first the builders' providers.  Any person with any connection with that industry realised it was one of the biggest economic jokes ever perpetrated in this country.  There was cut-throat competition between the builders' providers; they were going down like ninepins.  They were in the <i>Gazette</i> every week and they were going bankrupt and the Fair Trade Commission went solemnly through the farce of examining the whole case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad knows the kind of articles I refer to, particularly those in <Col N="1022" /> the light industries, but even there you have a fair measure of competition. You have five or six big firms manufacturing wire and you have certain small articles where only the one firm is involved.  The fact is that, taking the economic situation as a whole, the Legislature cannot provide for a minor article representing one-fiftieth of one per cent. of the national income or something like that.  There is no use in saying that the monopoly situation of this country is such that you can put down an amendment like this referring to excessive profit margins, something intangible, which you cannot define and which is of no use to the community.</P>
    <P>I have already said&mdash;and it is true&mdash; that I would have doubts about the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;undue labour costs.&rdquo;  I do not understand what is intended to be achieved by the phrase &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo;.  So far as I am concerned, if the Parliamentary Secretary wants to take out the phrase &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo; and meet everybody's view, I certainly would be quite satisfied with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to prolong the debate, but I am trying to clear up the issue for my own sake and for the sake of the Seanad.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington is an exceedingly skilled debater and he shifted his ground very skilfully in his last few remarks.  I wish to try to clear up the issue a little more.  There are just three points I want to make very shortly.  As regards the use of the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;, excessive profits are dealt with in Part III of the Bill. I do not propose to speak against the Senator's amendment to Section 14 because I think that, where there is an element of monopoly, profits may be excessive and in that way prices may be put up.</P>
      <P>I draw a distinction between that and the second part of the Bill where we must assume that competition prevails. If competition does not prevail anybody who is dissatisfied can go before the Fair Trade Commission and the machinery in Part III of the Bill then comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington shifted his ground very skilfully and for the first time brought in the phrase &ldquo;cost <Col N="1023" /> of capital&rdquo;.  I want to make it perfectly clear that the cost of capital is not the same as profit.  The cost of capital is what has to be paid for capital. If a company has to borrow from the bank or on debentures or on mortgage, and contracts to pay so much per cent. on its borrowing, so much has to be paid on that.  That would be the cost of capital.  Incidentally, the cost of capital in this country tends to be high because profits tend to be low.  The way in which to get cheap capital into industry is to encourage people to take ordinary shares and risks of production; to stand losses where there are losses; to have no dividend in a bad year and to avoid all these contractual obligations involved in bank borrowing, debentures and mortgages.  The way to get capital costs down is to encourage plenty of profit.  It is the risk capital that is prepared to work without any reward and very often at a loss for many years.  Profits are the pool from which capital is built up for investment in the country.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, there is a fundamental contradiction in thinking in this country about investment.  Everybody is called upon to invest in Irish industry, but as soon as anybody does so successfully and makes any profit, he is accused of profiteering.  He is taxed.  There is income-tax, distributed profits tax and undistributed profits tax, not to mention surtax and death duties.  Businesses are taxed until the good is gone out of their profits.  Now it is suggested that, in addition, they should be hauled before an Advisory Committee because they have been successful in earning a good profit.  I suggest that to shift the ground from profits to the cost of capital is a very skilful debating point, but it is unsound because profits do not reward the cost of capital.</P>
    <P>We could not have a debate on this subject without the cabbage.  The cabbage is always the prototype of the article for which the housewife pays too much and the poor farmer gets too little.  Might I suggest that if the price of cabbage is unduly high and farmers are unduly badly paid, that is not the result of anybody getting an excessive <Col N="1024" /> profit?  It is the result of an unduly expensive distributive mechanism. Everybody, from the farmer to the small shopkeeper who sells the cabbage is getting not a high profit but a low profit.  If the cabbage is dear, it is not because of the high profit of the hucksters' shops or the small farmers. It is because of the bad type of distributive mechanism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point. We imagine that the inquiry of the committee will be into profits.  The committee will be inquiring into prices.  It seems to me that before the Minister would issue a warrant to the committee, there should be concern about the prices.  If we have an efficient industry producing goods at a low price and taking a good profit, then it is efficient and they do not seem to come under this and there would hardly be an inquiry into their prices. This is a Prices Bill and if they are looking into prices, surely they should have regard to the extent of the profits taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to repeat what I had already said previously for the purpose of replying to various other speakers.  I suppose I should be flattered that my reply called forth other replies.  I do not propose to say very much about what was said.  There are three main points I want to make.  Senator O'Brien made very complimentary remarks about me being a skilled debater.  I would respectfully suggest that Senator O'Brien could buy and sell me as a skilled debater and probably make a considerable profit, even though the commodity was not worth very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He says I have shifted my ground.  I felt that was rather hard because he had said earlier on, and now again after listening to me, that I was speaking about excessive profits and, in order to refute that accusation, I quoted the words I used in my speech last night before I started to develop my speech this afternoon at all.  He did not come back to that, but said I was shifting my ground because I was talking about capital cost&mdash;that the dividend paid because of the risk run <Col N="1025" /> on invested capital was quite different and should not be thought of in the same light as profit.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan has referred to my impression that there is a monopoly situation, a situation which enables certain group interests to fix too high a price, an inflated price.  He says there is no monopoly situation in relation to food.  I wonder if he has had a look at the facts.  I wonder what factors he thinks make for the price of bread and flour.  Would he agree with me that at least the view can be held that the price of flour is based on the costings of the most uneconomic mill in the country and that, in fact, you have pretty well, in effect, a monopoly situation&mdash;people being kept, if you like, artificially in business, perhaps, by reason of a price that, by any community standard, is far too high?</P>
    <P>It is true that, in relation to the ordinary things you buy in a grocer's shop, since very recently, there has not been a monopoly situation because the Minister implemented the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission on supplies of groceries.  We are told by the Minister that he will revise that and look into it.  He may then change it.  I hope he will not.  I hope Senator O'Donovan is right in saying that the present free competition in groceries will continue.</P>
    <P>I suppose that, like myself, Senator O'Donovan has given up consuming infant foods for some time past.  Still, they are foods and there are a number of allied products which come under the heading of food and which most emphatically have their price fixed by people within a monopoly situation.  I do not quite follow the reasoning about the cabbage, I am afraid.  There was no mention of the herring.  The suggestion apparently is that you must not talk about excessive profits when a half-penny cabbage costs 5d, or more, by the time it gets to Dublin, because it is not excessive, because it is wholly bad mechanism and apparently a whole series of little profits which make up something which looks very like a total excessive profit for one reason or another.  In view of the fact that there has been no suggestion <Col N="1026" /> that we should omit the words &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo;, I should like to press for the inclusion of some reference to &ldquo;or to excessive profit margins at any stage.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think there has been a misreading of the phrase &ldquo;persons rendering services&rdquo; in line 32.  It seems to me that the reference made to it suggested that these were services incidental or ancillary to the provision of commodities.  There are two matters which the Bill will control&mdash;(1) the price of commodities and (2) the rendering of services.  These are two separate matters.  It is in that sense that the word is included here.</P>
      <P>I do not know exactly what Senator Sheehy Skeffington means by the expression &ldquo;or to excessive profit margins at any stage&rdquo;.  Does he mean at any stage of the manufacturing process?</P>

When you come to the later stages of distribution, it has to be dealt with by the later provisions of the Bill. However, that is more or less beside the point.</P>
      <P>The simple answer to the amendment is that the section is much better than it would be if the amendment were added to it, even from Senator Sheehy Skeffington's own viewpoint. It has been suggested to me that if you put in a phrase of this sort, it will be a qualifying phrase to some extent and that it is much better to leave the expression &ldquo;causes within the control of manufacturers&rdquo; as it stands, that it is a far more effective use of words to achieve Senator Sheehy Skeffington's point of view than the amendment he suggests.</P>

Under Section 10, I do not think the Minister would have power to specify in the warrant that the Advisory Committee inquire into distribution costs.

      <P>No. The Advisory Committee will advise the Minister in relation to matters raised in discussion. The Minister may refer matters to this Advisory Committee. He can also refer matters to the Fair Trade Commission.  There are the two stages which affect the cost, the manufacturing stage and the subsequent distribution stage, and this deals here with the Minister's efforts under this Bill to ensure that manufacturing costs will not be unduly high and he has the help of an Advisory Committee there.  Generally speaking, he has the help of the Fair Trade Commission in the matter of distribution, but the Senator knows what the three main causes will be of any action on the part of the Minister&mdash;a monopoly situation, restrictive practices and, then, these emergency situations which might arise from time to time.  The Minister, in his speech in the Dáil, indicated that the Suez Canal crisis and its consequences were a good example of that.</P>

      <P>I make one final attempt to elicit from the Parliamentary Secretary what is meant by &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo;.  I have been thinking over what he said and I am still far from clear as to what is the intention. If it is thought by the Advisory Committee that the manufacturer, or whoever he may be, is paying too much <Col N="1029" /> in wages, I do not see how the fixing of a maximum price by the Minister, presumably having regard to that fact and knowing fully the existing price, will help.  If the employer has entered into an agreement with the trade union to pay certain rates of pay, I do not know how he will stand when the Advisory Committee say, in effect: &ldquo;We will not allow you to charge the present price which takes account of the rates you pay to your employees&rdquo;. It may not be likely, but it could be used by the Minister to force a cut in wage rates generally.  He could put the gun to the employer's head and say to him: &ldquo;You will have to cut your wage rates; you will have to cease paying the rate agreed with the trade union and bring it down to a lower level if you want to continue in business and sell at the price I am now fixing&rdquo;.  Is that not possible? If that is not the intention, it seems to be the only possible intention.  I grant that it is probably extreme, but it is the only intention that I can think of immediately. If the Parliamentary Secretary sees other reasons for putting in a reference to undue labour costs, I wish he would tell them to me because, so far, he has not enlightened me.</P>

I do not know whether Senator Murphy wants to involve me with trade unions or not in this matter, but he has asked if the Advisory Committee will advise the Minister to force down wages because costs are high by taking action to fix a price that would require the manufacturer to take such a course in order to maintain the economic character of his business.  I do not know whether that is the best example or not.  I do not know whether Senator Murphy has ever heard of skilled tradesmen leaving their employment because they were forced to do so little work in the day that they were in danger of losing their skill through lack of application of it.

      <P>There were no &ldquo;ifs or &ldquo;ands&rdquo; in the Senator's categorical statement.  The provisions of this Bill are designed, devised and intended to frustrate any such manipulation by rings.  I do not know whether I can give specific examples that would satisfy Senator Murphy as to what the meaning of &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo; is. He may, as I suggest, want to involve me with trade union organisations and, if that is the case, there is nothing I can say to him that will satisfy him, but can he not think of any situation in which this phrase might be very apt?</P>

This is not an extreme example either &mdash;employers are very good at arguments and I could expect that some employers, in negotiations in future, will say: &ldquo;Ah, but I must have regard to this, that I might be told, if I agree to this increase, that there would be undue labour costs.&rdquo;  The union may say: &ldquo;That is ridiculous, these are not <Col N="1031" /> undue labour costs,&rdquo; and the employer may say: &ldquo;It is not my opinion, it is not your opinion: it might be the opinion of the Advisory Committee or the opinion of the Minister.&rdquo;  We have no guidance now as to what is intended or meant.  It could, in fact, be used as a method of keeping down wages or forcing them down.</P>

The principle is that when an authorised person gets certain powers of investigation, not merely shall he be furnished with an authorising warrant, or certificate, but he must produce it on request.  That is a matter sometimes taken for granted, but I would like to welcome the fact that it is here written into this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (d), line 35, before &ldquo;require&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very small amendment and might almost be regarded as a verbal or drafting amendment.  Sub-section (1) of this section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An authorised officer may, for the purpose of obtaining any information which the Minister may require for enabling him to exercise his functions under this Act, do any one or more of the following things&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there are five paragraphs dealing with the entering of premises, the requiring of a person to give any information &ldquo;which may reasonably be required&rdquo; in regard to books and so on, the inspection and copying of extracts from books, and the requiring of any such person to give him any information he may require.  I feel that, accidentally perhaps, the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; was omitted in paragraph <Col N="1033" /> (d).  It is included in the others; it is included in (b), &ldquo;such information as he may reasonably require&rdquo;; it is included in (e), &ldquo;information which he may reasonably require&rdquo;; but in (d) he may require such person to give him &ldquo;any information he may require&rdquo;.  I take it that that is too wide a power and that there is not really an intention to give the authorised officer power to get any information he may require.  The qualifying adverb &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;, which is felt to be necessary in the other clauses, should be inserted here, and that is the purpose of my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the adverb is necessary to produce the required qualification.  I think the better qualification is contained within the brackets.  That indicates quite clearly the type of information which this officer will be seeking.  Right through this section and its paragraphs, the words &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; are mentioned so often as to indicate to the officer that he must act reasonably. It is obvious that with regard to books, documents and records, care would have to be taken and the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; is inserted; but when the officer comes to require information about the identity of an unincorporated body of persons, information in regard to the membership thereof or the committee of management or other controlling authority, it is quite obvious that what the officer will be seeking is to establish the identity of people from whom inquiries would subsequently have to be made.  I think the absence of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; there has no diabolical significance&mdash;if that is what the Senator wishes to suggest.</P>
      <P>In any event, the officer will be operating under the general control and direction of the Minister and if the Senator has any apprehensions that this power may be abused, the general tenor of the entire section and its parts, ought to allay that fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not satisfied with the Parliamentary Secretary's answer.  He first says that the nature of the information is made clear in the brackets, but the bracket begins with the wording &ldquo;including <Col N="1034" /> in particular&rdquo;.  The paragraph at present reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) require such person to give him any information he may require in regard to the persons carrying on such activity (including, in particular...)&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and so on.  It is not a comprehensive bracket at all: it just indicates some type of information he might ask.  The paragraph itself gives very sweeping powers.</P>
      <P>The second argument which the Parliamentary Secretary puts forward is that the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; has been used so often in the section that it need not be used in this paragraph. Yet it is found necessary to use it in the following paragraph.  It is apparently felt to be there too often to include it in (d), but not to include it in (e).  That does not seem logical.</P>
      <P>Finally, I do not suggest that there is any diabolical power intended or that inspectors are wicked people; but I think we in this house ought to be jealous of the power we give under these Bills, and not give more power than is required.  We should not give excessive powers simply because we are assured that the chances are that they will never be abused.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary requires the power for his officers to do more than require information which they may reasonably require, as is stipulated in all the other paragraphs.  Therefore, I would press him to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>It seems to me the Parliamentary Secretary might reasonably accept this amendment.  I do not think there is any intention anywhere to exercise excessive powers, but the argument the Parliamentary Secretary makes would seem to me to be an argument for deleting the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; wherever it occurs in Section 24.  Everything he says would apply as much to paragraph (b) and paragraph (e) as to paragraph (g), but it certainly would not be a bit of harm to the paragraph if the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; were inserted before &ldquo;require&rdquo;.  It would not shake the foundations of the State if the Parliamentary <Col N="1035" /> Secretary did this and it certainly would not be any harm.  He might very well do it because it brings that paragraph more into line with the others and the words within the bracket are not exclusive; they are inclusive&mdash;&ldquo;including, in particular&rdquo;&mdash;and it would show a willingness on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary to listen to us now and again.</P>

      <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider accepting this amendment.  It would take away no power from the Minister or the officer concerned.  We should try to visualise what will happen if the person refuses to give the information. Presumably, he is brought before some court and the judge or justice will have to decide whether the person committed an offence against this Act or not.  He would be in a much better position to consider the situation if the wording &ldquo;reasonably require&rdquo; were there, because he is going to try to find some way out if he is asked to find a person guilty of an offence under this section, if the person has been asked to give information which was unreasonable.  He would be in a much better position to meet the situation if the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; were there and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this amendment favourably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be most willing to avoid any difference with the Seanad on this matter, but the fact is&mdash;this is not the reason on which I have been arguing against the amendment&mdash;that any amendment now will require that the Bill will have to go back to the Dáil.  That would delay very considerably the passing of this Bill into an effective Act.  The régime of control will end on 31st December and we want to have the new régime ready to <Col N="1036" /> take over on 1st January.  That cannot take place if we amend the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the merits of this amendment, I should point out that the refusal of any information by any person does not carry with it an automatic penalty. There is a safeguard there.  The Minister must decide that the facts are such that a prosecution should be brought and if he does come to that decision, there is the further safeguard in the fact that the court must try the charge.  There can be no very serious cause for complaint by leaving this as it is and letting this Act come into force on the day on which it was intended it should become operative.</P>
      <P>As I say, many persons questioned under this section will make their own decision as to what is reasonable and what is not reasonable and will refuse, I take it, to answer very many questions, in the early stages, particularly, before these authorised officers have gained sufficient experience. People may flatly refuse to answer the questions they are asked and it is conceivable that the authorised officer will make his complaint to the Minister in the ordinary way.  The Minister will assess the merits of the authorised officer's complaint and in a great many cases the Minister will possibly agree with the refusal.  Therefore, this is not as compelling on the individual to be questioned as it may seem, and refusal to comply does not automatically carry dire consequences, seeing that there are at least two further stages at which the refusal must be sieved and vetted.  That is on the merits of the case, but I am afraid, in connection with the other reason I have given, I have no option in the matter.</P>

      <P>This is really one of the finest cases of all for the abolition of the Seanad.  We are wasting our time completely talking about this Bill, if we cannot amend it.  If this Prices Bill has a time limit, it should have been brought into the Dáil sufficiently early to give us time to consider it.  In any event, in the situation in which the Parliamentary Secretary finds himself now, I will make him this offer.  Let him accept this amendment and the next amendment, No. 5, and we will give him all <Col N="1037" /> stages of the Bill to-night.  It can be brought back to the Dáil then and I am sufficiently experienced in the Dáil to know that the Dáil can suspend its proceedings for half an hour, or whatever it is, to consider these amendments.  They would require only about two minutes.  It is humiliating to sit here listening to a discussion which can have no finality at all according to the Parliamentary Secretary. This is an old point and I make this concession to the Parliamentary Secretary: it is not confined to his Government but it is characteristic of all Governments.</P>
      <P>They are always bringing in things that have to be passed by a certain time.  There is always a hurry.

Going into Committee is just a waste of time, unless we can amend.  Furthermore, I do not think there would be a situation of disaster if, between 1st January and 15th January, next, say, there is a kind of interregnum, and the Prices Advisory Body cannot be replaced for 15 days.

However, it was pleaded it should replace ultimately the existing control and it is for that reason I made the suggestion I have made.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) No one shall be required by virtue of paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of this section to answer any question or to give any evidence tending to criminate himself or in respect of either of which he would be entitled to claim privilege (as being a matter of confidence between him and his legal adviser) in the High Court.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the house but I think this amendment is one of some substance and importance.  Paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 24 states that an authorised officer may require a person &ldquo;to give him any other information which he may reasonably require&rdquo;.  I can envisage a situation in which a person, questioned by an authorised officer, might plead he was doing certain things that were within the law because he had been so advised by his legal adviser. It has long been established that communications passing between a client and his legal adviser are confidential. The courts protect the confidential character of these communications and do not compel a client to disclose them. Consequently, there should be some saving in this section in the form in which I have drafted this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the House to the fact that Section 28 (2) of the Office Premises Bill, with which we dealt last night, states that no person shall be required to answer any question or to give any evidence which would tend to criminate himself.  That is an attempt to safeguard the rights of the individual in not supplying <Col N="1040" /> information which would criminate himself.</P>
    <P>The information which a person may have got as a result of discussions with his legal adviser may be of a kind which would enable an authorised officer to take proceedings under this Bill against the person in question.  It is all the more unfortunate in this case because the penalties provided for failing to give information, which an authorised officer may reasonably require, may include a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. If an authorised officer required the disclosure of communications passing between a businessman and his solicitor, and the businessman refused to disclose those communications, the officer would be entitled to take proceedings in court.  That might be one of the several charges that might be laid against the businessman and I think a justice or judge, as the Bill stands, would be bound to hold that an offence had been committed, and some penalty as provided under Section 26 would be inflicted on the individual.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph 12 of the Second Schedule, dealing with the powers of the Advisory Committee, protection is afforded to witnesses appearing before the Advisory Committee.  In sub-section (3) of the paragraph it is provided that a witness before an Advisory Committee will be entitled to the same privileges and immunities as if he were before the High Court.  This amendment I move is in line with the provisions relating to the conduct of witnesses before an Advisory Body and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in view of his approach to a somewhat similar problem, to accept it.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment for the reasons given by Senator O'Quigley.  In fact, if Senator O'Quigley is willing to agree, I should like to see the parenthesis omitted, and have it read &ldquo;that he be entitled to claim privilege in the High Court.&rdquo;  There are communications between people and their professional advisers, other than solicitors, in respect of which they are entitled to claim privilege and I think limiting it to a legal adviser is unnecessarily <Col N="1041" /> limiting the privilege.  If Senator O'Quigley would agree to that, it would be an improvement in the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of the amendments follows very closely sub-section (2) of Section 94 of the Factories Act, 1955, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No one shall be required by virtue of paragraph (f) of sub-section (1) of this section to answer any question or to give any evidence tending to criminate himself.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is one of the misconceptions, that the functions of the factory inspector and of the authorised officer under this Bill are exactly similar, but there is not an exact analogy between them. It is obvious that the questionings of an inspector under the Factories Act may have a very vital bearing on subsequent proceedings, arising out of serious injury or a fatal accident.  I think it was for that reason it was so worded in the Factories Act.  A result of that kind can hardly be anticipated in connection with this Bill.  If anybody is likely to incriminate himself by his answers to questionings by an authorised officer and if he has any doubt in his mind, it seems he will take the sure course of refusing to answer and let his refusals be adjudged in the first place by the Minister and, if the Minister decides to prosecute, by the court.</P>
      <P>Seeing that a good deal of apprehension has been expressed that we are not serious about this Bill, it seems to me inconsistent that we should try to force on the Minister amendments of this sort which, in fact, will very effectively tie the hands of his officers in trying to make a good job of it.</P>

      <P>The Factories Act was quoted a good deal yesterday.  I was not aware that there was a section like this in the Factories Act, and I must disclaim any knowledge or connection with the Factories Act in putting down this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not dealt with the most important part of the amendment&mdash;the second part&mdash;that a person should not be exposed to the threat of a penalty as provided for in Section 26 of this Bill to disclose confidential communications passing between him and his solicitor.  That is the important thing.  That is the ordinary law, that a person is under no obligation to disclose, even in court, communications passing between himself and his solicitor.  What this Bill does by implication is to amend old-established law that people are not compelled to disclose those communications.</P>
      <P>The authorised officers will be able to get all the information they require without being given authority to pry into communications passing between persons being questioned and their legal advisers.  That is the important thing, that we should not amend the ordinary law of the land by implication in this way.  If somebody refuses to disclose to an authorised officer the communication which has passed between a client and his solicitor, that becomes an offence under the section and once it becomes an offence, it is something a court will have to deal with.  There is no use saying: &ldquo;Leave it to the court.&rdquo;  The court will find that an offence has been committed. That is the reason why I put down the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seems to me to give two entirely contradictory reasons for opposing the amendment.  The amendment, as pointed out by Professor O'Brien, is restrictive in a particular way, but it does give some protection to the person who is questioned.  Paragraph (e) is very wide.  The Parliamentary Secretary objects on two grounds.  First, he says it is not necessary and, secondly, that if this amendment were inserted it would hamper the Minister in his genuine attempt to put the Bill into <Col N="1043" /> operation when it becomes an Act.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>If it is not necessary, that is all right, but if it would hamper the Minister, it ought not to be put in.  The Parliamentary Secretary certainly does not require power to have an officer put questions to people which might tend to incriminate them or disclose a matter of confidence between the person questioned and his legal adviser.  Paragraph (e) is too wide.  I was saying to the Minister in private conversation that all Bills are drafted in this way.  When they want to accomplish a certain thing, they draft a Bill which covers everything.  That is the standard scheme.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to say that nobody will put it into operation like that. Paragraph (e) seems to be amending a recognised principle of law and I do not think we should allow it.  I do not think a person would have any defence, if paragraph (e) were quoted.  It may very well be, of course, that between the reasonableness of the officers, the reasonableness of the official to whom the officer reports and the reasonableness of the Minister in the last resort, nothing wrong would happen, but, all the same, it is there.  We have got to see it is as good as we can make it. Either the words in the amendment or some words to accomplish the object sought should be inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not agree at all that my two points are mutually contradictory.  I say this section is not necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the person against incriminating himself.  What I say now is that if this section went into the Bill and I were questioned, I would tell the officer I would not answer any of his questions.  Every one of them might incriminate me and I would give no answer at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that would not be a defence for me?  Surely a court would decide that was an insufficient answer on my part?  There must be some method of discovering what a sufficient answer is and that is not a sufficient answer.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggests that by putting in this section a person would say the question would incriminate him as would every other question.  I should like to point out that care has been taken in respect of provision in regard to matters upon which information must be given.  These are the matters which will produce the information upon which the Minister will decide whether a prosecution should or should not issue.  That information will be found by entering the premises, inspecting them and taking copies of accounts.  This apparently is only to cover up any of the rather unimportant matters which may not have been thought of or covered by paragraphs (a) to (d).</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not yet dealt with the position that this section, as it stands, requires a person to disclose confidential communications passing between him and his legal adviser.  That is old established law and if the person refuses to disclose that information, when requested to do so, then, under paragraph (e) as it stands, he commits an offence for which he can be prosecuted. We ought not leave citizens of this country open to a charge in the District Court and liable to a penalty not exceeding 12 months.</P>

      <P>I cannot see how this matter will arise at the point where the person is questioned by the authorised officer.  I think in that case the person will make up his mind for reasons which are not legal ones at all. Where this will arise is when he comes into court and is asked to defend himself.  I think he should be able to say as a defence that the question he was asked might tend to incriminate him.  I do not think the matter arises when he is asked the question.  It should be open to him as a defence when the matter comes before the court.  I cannot agree with Senator O'Quigley that it will be of any great importance when the question is put in the first place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that Senator O'Quigley has made a very strong case against the section as it now stands, which appears to create a new offence out of an action which, so far, has been regarded as the legitimate right of every citizen under the common law, namely, to refuse to <Col N="1046" /> give information which may incriminate himself.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 5 (2), line 3, before &ldquo;remove&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on the recommendation of the Committee&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but this amendment deals with the Second Schedule, paragraph 5 (2), page 13.  It refers to the Minister's right to remove from office a member of the Advisory Committee under three circumstances: (1) through ill-health; (2) if he has ceased to be a member of the panel, or (3)&mdash;and this is the paragraph that I want to amend&mdash;if his removal &ldquo;appears to the Minister to be necessary in the interests of the effective and economical performance of the duties of that Advisory Committee.&rdquo; It has seemed to me that this is giving too much power to the Minister, in relation to the removal, which is a rather important thing, from the Advisory Committee of any member, and I should feel happier about it if the Minister were allowed to have this power and to act upon it only on the recommendation of the committee.  If the committee feels that a certain member of the committee is preventing the effective and economical performance of the duties of that committee it is reasonable to give the Minister power to remove him, but to give the Minister power to remove him whether or not the committee feels that he is impeding the work of the committee <Col N="1047" /> seems to me to be giving too much power to the Minister.  I should like the section to be amended to enable the Minister to have that power to remove only on the recommendation of the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>You really cannot confuse the functions of this Advisory Committee and the functions of the Minister.  The Minister appoints an Advisory Committee under certain conditions and I do not see any method of preventing the Minister from taking power to remove a member. He does it as an administrative act.  It may be questioned in the Dáil by way of parliamentary question, adjournment debate or, if necessary, by way of motion.  He is acting as Minister and does something for which he can be held responsible, which can be argued about and for which he can be censured and I think, on the whole, there is no case for saying that he must wait for the recommendation of the committee.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his absolute discretion, can appoint people to the committee, and it seems to me that, if the Minister has made a mistake for any reason, he ought to be able to have absolute discretion to correct it.  Quite apart from that, the amendment does seem to visualise a very embarrassing situation for the other members of the committee. Presumably, the person to be removed will be entitled to take part in the discussions of the committee as to what his fate as a member is to be and I cannot see any committee of ordinary people discussing without embarrassment, or indeed agreeing to discuss at all, the fate of a colleague while he is present.</P>

      <P>I see some substance in the contention of Senator Hayes and also in that of the Parliamentary Secretary, in that the Minister appoints, therefore, he should have the right to remove, but I can envisage a situation in which an Advisory Committee is actively pursuing an investigation into the high price of a certain commodity, and it <Col N="1048" /> might be suggested the Minister might be lobbied and told even that one member of that committee was being over-zealous, asking extremely awkward questions, was not prepared to accept evasive answers.  I do not suggest that it would happen often, but I do not think it is absolutely impossible for a Minister so to be influenced, and I am reluctant to give him a blank cheque for the removal of anybody that he likes from an Advisory Committee, without any proposal to that effect being put to him by the Advisory Committee themselves, who know whether, in fact, such a member is impeding the action of the committee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph 11 (5) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An inquiry by an Advisory Committee shall normally be held in public.</P>
      <P>My concern here is to amend the provision on page 14, in sub-section (5) of paragraph 11 of this Schedule.  My intention is to suggest the opposite of what is implied by the present sub-section. The present sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An inquiry by an Advisory Committee <Col N="1049" /> shall not be held wholly or partly in public, except with the prior consent in writing of the Minister&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my view, half the value of these committees will be lost unless their sittings are in public.  I believe it is part of the democratic process for this kind of inquiry to be held in public, for the questions to be put in public, for the answers to be heard in public. We are dealing with the factors which lead to unduly high prices.  The committee is concerned only with those, and, if prices are unduly high, the public should hear both the type of question asked and the type of justification put forward.  I think it a bad principle to say that these inquiries shall take place behind closed doors. I do not suggest that anything wrong would necessarily happen behind the closed doors but justice should not merely be done, but should also appear to be done.  Not merely should the inquiry be carried out on correct lines, and correct questions be asked and the full justification given, but it should appear in public to be so done.  I feel that an Advisory Committee of this kind sitting in public, as the Prices Advisory Body did on many occasions &mdash;but not on sufficient occasions, in my opinion&mdash;is far better than a private meeting of the committee, the proceedings of which are not even covered by the Press.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Senator Sheehy Skeffington on this matter.  I think, as he said, it would be more democratic that the proceedings of these committees should be held normally in public.  The amendment does not rule out the possibility of their being held in private, if that is thought necessary, but normally they should be held in public.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there cannot be any public confidence in the work of these bodies if the proceedings are held in secret, in private.  To get public confidence, if it is necessary to hold an inquiry into any price, it would be better that it should normally be done in public and I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is suggested that the committee should normally do its work in public.  I think the very suggestion of a committee involves private deliberation and consideration.  One can think of a very large variety of committees which do their work in private.  As a matter of fact, it seems to me that it is for the purpose of deliberation, not distracted in any way by undesirable publicity, that committees are set up to deal with important questions.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, it is most undesirable that the business of any citizen or incorporated group of citizens should unnecessarily be exposed to the light of a lot of very often undesirable publicity.  If the circumstances in any case demand that the public interest can best be served by a public sitting or by an entire public inquiry, the Minister has power so to direct.  In the normal practice, it should be&mdash;and common sense demands that it should be&mdash;conducted in private.  The assumption should not be made straight away that the person involved in every one of these inquiries is condemned beforehand and therefore should be exposed to all the publicity which it is possible to give him.  The other assumption is the proper one and the affairs of the concern should be examined privately.</P>
      <P>There is a better chance of all the facts being elicited by a private inquiry than we could hope for from a public inquiry, in most cases which are likely to come before these Advisory Committees.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary himself is here before this House, in Committee, which is sitting in public, and I do not think any of us regard him as being thereby condemned beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reputable persons responsible for reputable business can appear before committees and before the Press when they have nothing to hide, and can come out with their heads up.  I do not think the fear of &ldquo;the light of publicity <Col N="1051" /> because of possible condemnation&rdquo; is a sound argument.  The amendment would improve the Bill, and improve the functioning of these <Col N="1052" /> committees and therefore I wish to press it.</P>

I mean victimisation in that sense.  Has the Advisory Committee any power at all to ensure that he will not be commercially victimised by reason of the fact that he has come forward in a public-spirited manner to give evidence about certain factors that led to unduly high prices?</P>

      <P>I think the immunities and privileges referred to here possibly are not necessary for the same type of safeguarding of witnesses who give evidence before the Advisory Committee as is the case in respect of hearings in open court.  We all know that a witness in court can say things that would be slanderous if he said them outside the court.  We know that if it is part of the evidence and if he is answering questions put to him by counsel, he can say things that he could not say outside.  That is a simple example of the type of immunity which a witness has.  If the Senator visualises a similar situation in relation to the administration of this Act, then these immunities and privileges will also apply to protect the witness.</P>

I am in agreement with the Seanad there, and it seems to me there is a feeling that there is not going to be a rampage of profiteering next month simply because this Bill will not be in force.

      <P>I notice from a reply given in the Dáil last week to a question about the distribution of the amount of grants made since the passing of the original Act that Galway, Sligo, Kerry, Mayo, Donegal, Clare, Leitrim and Roscommon all got something.  I notice, at the bottom, that apparently parts of Cork did not succeed in getting any grant approved or any grant paid.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether that is due to lack of initiative on the part of the people concerned, or are there at the moment any proposals under consideration for any activity in that area?</P>

      <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act is based on the assumption that private enterprise can be induced to come into the undeveloped areas and set up industries there with the aid of an initial grant.  Having set up the industry, it then becomes their property.  There is no obligation on the Minister in respect either of losses <Col N="1055" /> or profits made by the industry.  He cannot, for instance, call on any part of the profits by way of refund of the grant and neither can those who establish the industry make a further call on the Minister to help them to offset losses made.</P>
      <P>In other words, this Act gives an initial push to people who have either money or technical ability, or both, to overcome the disadvantage of establishing an industry in these undeveloped areas.  It depends mainly on the ability of the promoters as to whether or not it will be a success.</P>
      <P>There is no obligation on the Minister or on An Foras Tionscal to make inspections of the various areas for the purpose of inducing local people to undertake industrial enterprises. Therefore, the giving of an industry, or otherwise, to any area depends, as Senator Ó Maoláin suggests, on the initiative available inside the district. It does not mean that the capital and the technical ability must be available in the locality, but certainly there should be some agency inside the area which can go after it in other areas or outside the country and induce it to come along with the help of whatever local support can be got.</P>

When I say &ldquo;proposal,&rdquo; I do not mean it in the sense in which it is understood by An Foras Tionscal, but in the ordinary way in which we use the term.

      <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated and I take it that the sense and meaning of this Order are already understood by Senators.  However, Quota No. 45 Order 949, as amended, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that woven cotton piece goods which have a pattern in colour woven therein and which contain more than 90 ends per inch to the warp shall be excepted from the prohibition of importation effected by the Order.  This provision was designed to exclude from the scope of the quota Order certain finely woven materials which are not manufactured by the Irish mills while ensuring protection for the heavier cloths, for example, striped flannelette for shirts and pyjamas produced by the Irish mills, and the Cotton and Rayon Manufacturers' Association reported that an importer was offering to the trade a woven patterned pyjama flannelette which qualified for exemption from quota restriction, on the grounds that it contained more than 90 ends per inch to the warp.  The association represented that the unrestricted importation of this cloth would have serious repercussions on the home production of striped pyjama flannelette.  Sales of striped pyjama flannelette by Irish <Col N="1057" /> manufacturers have been as follows: Year 1955, 148,00 square yards; year 1956, 144,000 square yards.  Employment is given in the Irish mills on the production of flannelette to 62 workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) (a) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a lease is for a term of not less than 50 years and either commences on or after 1st January, 1914, and the rent reserved by the lease is less than the rateable valuation of the land thereby demised together with the buildings thereon as first fixed or revised subsequent to the date of the lease pursuant to the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, as amended and adapted, or commences before 1st January, 1914, and the rent reserved by the lease is less than half the rateable valuation of the land thereby demised together with the buildings thereon as first fixed or revised subsequent to the date of the lease pursuant to the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, as amended and adapted, it shall be presumed until the contrary is proved that the buildings were erected by the person who at the time of their erection was entitled to the lessee's interest under the lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to remove an ambiguity in the Bill.  The Bill, as it stands, is unfair to leases made prior to 1914.  I understand that the majority of rents fixed since 1914, where the rent is less than the valuation, are ground rents.  The assumption is quite false in connection with rents fixed before 1914.  It was the normal practice in fixing rents for long leases, to allow the tenant to pay a rent which was less than the full rack rent as an encouragement to him to look after the property and keep it in <Col N="1058" /> repair, and this was especially the case when a house was let to a new tenant who carried out repairs, at his own expense, at the commencement of the lease.  Many landowners were more concerned with the security of their rent than with obtaining the highest possible income.  It would be quite normal in such a case to let a house for a long term at, say, 66 per cent. of the full letting value.  In the case of lettings made before 1914, this figure would be less than the Poor Law Valuation.</P>
    <P>I have a number of examples, with which I do not wish to weary the Seanad, of building leases where, in fact, the rents were a good deal less than the valuation prior to 1914 and I would ask the Minister to consider if the amendment which I have put down would not be more suitable, in the circumstances of the case, than the section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to meet a point raised on the Report Stage in the Dáil.  Section 7 provides a number of tests for determining whether a sublease granted by a building lessee has had the effect of transferring the beneficial or proprietary interest to the sublessee and whether it has accordingly given the valuable right to a reversionary lease to the sublessee to the complete exclusion of the building lessee.  One of the tests is that the sublessee must have paid a substantial capital sum to the building lessee as part of the consideration for granting the sublease. It is provided that this sum must have been at least 15 times the rent or the greatest rent reserved by the lease, but for this purpose a penal rent or any exceptional rent charged or chargeable for a period not exceeding five years is to be disregarded.  The exceptional rents which were intended to be covered by this provision were those charged for merely the first few years of the term, the rent thereafter dropping to a nominal figure.  It is understood that a number of these leases, which were really in the nature of conveyances, were granted in comparatively recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that, on the wording of these provisions, a sublessee <Col N="1060" /> whose lease contained a provision for paying a higher rent on an alteration of user and who in fact became liable to pay the higher rent at any time within the last five years of the term of the sublease, would qualify as a proprietary lessee.  The amendment is designed to remove any doubt there may be on the matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 7, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he substitute ten years for 15 years.  I think it is the normal practice in relation to rent generally that a rent can be bought out for ten years' purchase.  It is a general rule of thumb.  In this case, 15 years seems to be a bit high.  I would ask the Minister if he could consider between now and Report Stage whether it would be possible to substitute ten for 15.</P>

      <P>I suppose that, if we are to consider certain matters on Report Stage, this could also be considered. However, this amendment, was brought up at the Select Committee which went out of existence when the last Government's term of office came to an end.  There was no opportunity of discussing it apparently, at that committee, but there was an amendment put down before it.  The commission which dealt with this matter in what I think was a very meticulous manner did not have any representations made to it in this respect, nor did they themselves make any recommendations in regard to it.  In view of what Senator Ryan has raised, I will undertake to have it examined, without giving any assurance that we can meet the point.</P>

    <P>(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a lessee executes a mortgage by subdemise of the whole or part of the land comprised in his lease, retaining a nominal reversion therein, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the land comprised in the subdemise is sold for the enforcement of the mortgage,</P>
    <P>the purchaser shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have acquired the interest of the lessee in the demised land for the entire of the unexpired term of the lease, including the period of the nominal reversion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment also meets a point raised in the Dáil and has the effect of giving a right to a reversionary lease to a purchaser from a mortgagee by subdemise who has gone into possession and sold the entire of the lessee's interest in the premises except for what is called the nominal reversion, that is, the last day or so of the lessee's term.  In such a case the purchaser would have acquired the interest of the lessee except for this nominal reversion and can reasonably be regarded as having as great an equity to a reversionary lease as a sublessee from a building lessee who may have retained a far longer reversion.  The result of the nominal reversion being left outstanding is that such a purchaser does not qualify as a building lessee or a proprietary lessee. The disentitling effect of the nominal reversion is now being removed.</P>

    <P>15&mdash;(1) Where the court is satisfied that a lessee would, but for the <Col N="1065" /> provisions of Section 14 of this Act, be entitled to a reversionary lease, compensation in lieu of such reversionary lease shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>(2)  (a)  The compensation shall be payable by the successful objector or if there is more than one successful objector by them in such proportion as the court may determine.</P>
    <P>(b)  The compensation shall be paid to the lessee unless, apart from the provisions of Section 14 of this Act, his title to a reversionary lease was subject to obtaining the consents required by Section 10 or Section 11 of this Act, in which case it shall be paid to the lessee and the proprietary lessee or lessees whose consent was so required in such proportion as the court may determine.</P>
    <P>(3)  The measure of compensation under this section shall be the loss which will, in the opinion of the court, be suffered by the lessee and by such proprietary lessee or lessees, if any, as a direct consequence of the lessee's having been declared not to be entitled to a reversionary lease.</P>
    <P>(4)  The compensation payable to a person, being the lessee or a proprietary lessee, under this section shall become due and payable on the occurrence of whichever of the following events is the later, that is to say, the expiration of one month after the amount of the compensation is fixed or the date on which that person's lease terminates either by effluxion of time or by agreement between the parties to it.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where compensation is payable to a person, being the lessee or a proprietary lessee, under this section and the interest of that person in the land comprised in his lease is subject to a mortgage or charge for securing money, the mortgage or charge shall attach to the compensation and any person who is liable to pay compensation and who has <Col N="1066" /> notice of the mortgage or charge shall pay the compensation in accordance with the joint direction of such lessee or proprietary lessee and the mortgage or chargeant or, in default of such direction, into court.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where compensation awarded by the court under this section is not paid within the time specified in sub-section (4) of this section or within such extended time as the court may allow, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any building lessee, subject to obtaining the consents required by Section 10 of this Act and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of that section, and any proprietary lessee, subject to obtaining the consents required by Section 11 of this Act and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of that section, shall be entitled to obtain from his immediate lessor a reversionary lease of all the land demised by his lease;</P>
    <P>(b)  the provisions of Section 14 of this Act shall not apply;</P>
    <P>(c)  the granting of the lease shall operate as a discharge of the said award of compensation; and</P>
    <P>(d)  the court may make an order for the payment by the successful objector of such damages as the court considers proper for the loss which the building lessee or proprietary lessee has suffered as a direct consequence of the declaration of disentitlement to a reversionary lease.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section &ldquo;successful objector&rdquo; shall, where the context so admits, be construed as including his executors, administrators and assigns.</P>

      <P>The reason for this amendment is that in old leases it is not unusual to find that there are very few restrictive covenants.  In modern leases there are nearly always restrictions on user and on the erection of additional buildings. The object of this amendment is to enable a landlord to frame a reversionary lease in modern form, without incurring a reduction in rent.  It has never been disputed that in equity the landlord is entitled to the value of the land, as opposed to the value of the buildings. Therefore, he should be able to frame covenants so as to ensure that any new ground rents from new development will come to him.  The value of property as a whole will depend on the use to which it is put; and it is, therefore, impossible to ascertain what is the letting value unless the user is prescribed.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 39, before &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and who has applied to his immediate lessor for such a reversionary lease&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the present effect of this sub-section is to create a perpetuity, that is, if the lessee, having made at the correct time his application for a reversionary lease, does nothing, he will be entitled to continue to hold the premises on the terms of the expired lease so far as applicable. When this becomes known, there may be tenants who will never proceed beyond the application stage.  Section 24 as it stands would not enable the court to determine the tenancy so created, although it might do so, if amended by the insertion after the word &ldquo;grant&rdquo; in line 47, of the words &ldquo;acceptance or refusal&rdquo;.  Even if this were done, however, it would still leave the matter very vague.  Accordingly, I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of accepting a new amendment which is not on the Order Paper and which I will read; that at the end of Section 22 there should be an express proviso in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided always that if any such person who shall have made an application to his immediate lessor for a reversionary lease under this Act shall refuse or neglect to proceed with such an application, or to accept a reversionary lease the terms of which shall have been fixed by negotiation, for more than three months after having been required in writing so to do by his immediate lessor, then and in any such case such <Col N="1069" /> immediate lessor may apply to the court and the court may make such order as justice shall require, and in particular may make an order determining any tenancy subsisting by virtue of this sub-section.</P>
    <P>I am informed that if some proviso of this kind is not inserted in this Bill tenants, by masterly inactivity, by doing nothing at all, can acquire a tenancy in perpetuity and it is to prevent that from happening that this additional clause is suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is undoubtedly aware, the Children Acts make provision for the protection of children and young persons, for the regulation, recognition and assistance by the State of industrial and reformatory schools and for legal proceedings in relation to young offenders.  The principal Act is that of 1908 which amended previous legislation dating from 1858.  The 1908 Act has since been amended by subsequent legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purposes of the present Bill are to amend the Children Acts in order (a) to provide for children under detention in reformatory and industrial schools living outside these schools in certain circumstances and for the payment of the capitation grants for maintenance to the school managers for the period of absence out of school; (b) to bring existing legislation relating to the discharge of children from industrial schools into conformity with the provisions of the Constitution in the matter of parental rights; (c) to make suitable provision for the determination of disputes between the Minister for Education and parents in relation to such discharge; (d) to amend certain provisions of the Acts relating to the nursing and maintenance of children for reward; and (e) to provide for the protection by the local authorities of children, who, while in the custody of persons other than relatives or <Col N="1072" /> guardians, are placed in employment in circumstances requiring them to reside away from the home in which they were residing before entering such employment.</P>
    <P>These latter provisions apply to children up to the age of 18 years.  The amendments dealing with leave of absence, payment of maintenance capitation grants and for the provisions for the discharge of children from industrial schools are sponsored by my Department, and others are sponsored by the Department of Health and the Department of Justice.  I will take the provisions which are sponsored by my Department first.</P>
    <P>Since 1924, when the industrial schools system came to be administered by the Department of Education, it has been the practice to grant &ldquo;home leave&rdquo; to children detained in these industrial schools.  Children are allowed a period of leave or vacation every year, provided the homes to which they are sent are suitable and the parents, relatives or friends, to whom they will be entrusted, are willing to take them, and are considered suitable to be entrusted with the care of these children.  The maximum amount of home leave allowed each year was seven days originally, but in 1935 it was extended to 14 days. Following the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Reformatory and Industrial Schools System, 1934 to 1936, the period of home leave was extended to 21 days.  In 1948, it was further extended to 31 days as it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>At the present time, about one-third of the children in industrial schools avail of home leave during the ordinary vacation period and the average number of days they are out was, for example, in 1956, 20 days.  In addition to the ordinary home leave, school managers may allow children special leave under certain necessary circumstances and may give them casual leave and in some cases, also, it may be desirable to permit children to leave the industrial schools for the purpose of undertaking a course of instruction that would benefit them in a school other than an industrial <Col N="1073" /> school, that is, where such instruction is not available in the industrial school itself.</P>
    <P>While the practice of home leave has been in existence since 1924, as I have said, there is strictly speaking, no legal authority under the Act for it, that is, there is no legal authority for allowing children or young persons, committed to a certified school, to live elsewhere than in that school before their period of detention is completed except under a supervision certificate granted under Section 67 of the Act of 1908.  The purpose of the supervision certificate is to enable a child to be given over by the school, on certain conditions, to the charge of a trustworthy person who undertakes to care for him, while, at the same time, the school continues to retain its right to recall the child from the school in case these conditions are not being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1950, it was not the custom to issue supervision certificates to cover home leave, but about that time it was discovered, in the case of a parent who refused to permit the child who was allowed out on home leave to return to the industrial school, there was no power to require that parent to return the child to the school, that is, there was no legal power.  Since then, therefore, children are sent on home leave under a supervision certificate.</P>
    <P>What applies to home leave applies also to the case of a child who is permitted a course of instruction in another school or to be absent on casual leave for any special purpose. Hitherto, unless a supervision certificate were issued to cover the absence, a child who refused to return to school after such absence, could not legally be brought back to school.  This difficulty is now being met in Section 6 of the Bill before the House.  Children who are, in future, allowed home leave, casual leave or leave to attend courses of instruction outside the school will be deemed to be under detention in the school and, accordingly, can be brought back to the school in the event of their exceeding that leave or refusing to return on its exhaustion.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, mention here that <Col N="1074" /> home leave extends also to the case of a child taken by a friend or trustworthy person for a period of holidays. As members of the House will no doubt be aware, many homes in the vicinity of industrial schools apply to the managers of the schools for a child or a particular child to be permitted to spend a holiday with them.  Oftentimes the child is allowed to work under proper circumstances&mdash;perhaps in a shop, a business or on the farm of that person, not necessarily being a parent or a relative.</P>
    <P>In relation to this matter of home leave, the Bill is designed to meet a further difficulty which arose some time ago.  As the House is aware, local authorities, as well as the State, are required to contribute towards the maintenance of children detained in certified schools.  Some time ago, however, a local authority raised a question in regard to its liability for the payment of maintenance grants in respect of such children for periods spent by them on home leave.  Sections 7 and 8 of the present Bill are intended to validate the payment by the State and the local authorities of capitation grants for maintenance in respect of youthful offenders or children detained in certified schools, for the period of their absence from school on home leave, casual leave or leave to attend instruction outside the school. These grants have always been paid for the period of such absences and the provisions now being made are merely to place the question beyond doubt and to regularise the payment of maintenance grants made heretofore in these cases.</P>
    <P>Another important purpose of the Bill is, as I have already stated, to bring existing legislation relating to the discharge of children from industrial schools into conformity with the provisions of the Constitution in the matter of parental rights.  In December, 1955, the Supreme Court declared that part of Section 10 of the Children Act, 1941, which amended Section 58 of the 1908 Act, to be repugnant to the Constitution in so far as it deprived a parent, with whose consent a child has been sent to a certified industrial school, of the right to resume control of the child so as to provide for its <Col N="1075" /> education when that parent was willing and able to do so.</P>
    <P>Following this judgement, the Minister for Education was advised that Section 58 of the Children Act, 1908, was open to successful challenge under the Constitution, unless amending legislation was introduced to provide machinery for the parent who is anxious, able and prepared to exercise guardianship, recovering a child committed to an industrial school under that section.</P>
    <P>The legal advisers were of opinion that legislation authorising the State to undertake the care and training of children, if it is to stand against the constitutional rights of the parent, should be justified under Article 42 (5) of the Constitution and that such legislation should make provision by which the State's intervention be limited in time to the duration of the parental need or parental default. Section 5 of the Bill before the House is intended to meet this position.  It seeks to provide ordered machinery to deal with any dispute which may arise between the Minister for Education and the parent in regard to the discharge of a child committed to an industrial school under Section 58 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Thus, under Section 5 of the Bill, where a parent or guardian makes application to the Minister for the release of such a child and the Minister is satisfied that the home or other circumstances which led to the child's committal no longer exist and are not likely to recur if the child is released, and also that the parent or guardian is able to support the child, then the Minister must order the discharge of the child.  If, however, the Minister is in any doubt in regard to the case, he may refer the application to a District Court for decision.  If, on the other hand, the Minister comes to the conclusion, on the evidence and information available to him, that the child should not be discharged, he may refuse the parent's application, but, in that case, the parent may refer the matter to the District Court and, in the case of an adverse decision in that court, the parent may appeal to the Circuit Court.  The section also makes <Col N="1076" /> provision for the award of costs to a successful applicant.</P>
    <P>I may say that any Minister for Education, operating the provisions of this section, will, naturally, have regard to the conviction which influences social considerations in this country, particularly in relation to parental rights and certainly leaning always, in exercising his discretion under the section, in favour of the parents.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, certain sections of the Bill deal with matters for which the Minister for Health is the appropriate Minister.  The first of these, Section 2, deals with the obligations of persons who receive children for nursing and maintenance under arrangements providing for the payment of reward, except in the case of illegitimate children when the obligations apply even where the nursing or maintenance is not for reward.  While it does not introduce any new principles, except in the case of illegitimate children to which I have just referred, it effects certain modifications which experience has shown to be desirable.</P>
    <P>Thus, for example, it provides for the giving of seven days' notice, in lieu of 48 hours' notice as at present, to the health authority by the person receiving such children.  It also requires, for the first time, that the person or body making arrangements for the placing of a child in a foster home will give similar notice to the health authority.  A 48 hours' notice has been found to be too short to enable the local authority to satisfy itself as to the suitability of the proposed foster home.  On the other hand, experience has shown that a prospective foster parent is likely to be unaware of the legal requirements in regard to notification, or he may assume, especially where fosterage is arranged by a voluntary organisation, that all legal requirements have been attended to by the organisation.</P>
    <P>At present, a foster home and a child placed in it for reward are subject to local authority supervision only until the child reaches the age of nine years. It is the opinion of persons interested in the welfare of such children that supervision should continue beyond that age.  It is accordingly provided <Col N="1077" /> that the age limit will be raised to 16 years, which is the age up to which supervision continues for children boarded out in foster homes by health authorities under the provisions of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>So far, I have been referring only to children placed in foster homes for reward.  This section applies to illegitimate children even where the fosterage is not for reward.  This provision was introduced as a result of an Opposition amendment in the Dáil and as a result of a joint deputation of organisations who had responsibility for the care and welfare of children. It was pointed out to me that, even in the case of illegitimate children who might appear to be sent to good homes, they would often require the necessary supervision by a local authority to ensure that they are maintained in proper conditions and circumstances. The effect will be that any illegitimate child taken into a household other than the household of a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt, will come under Part I of the Principle Act, that is, the part which deals with supervision by local authorities in so far as notification of the arrangement to the health authority and supervision of the child and the home by that authority are concerned.</P>
    <P>I might say that, in relation to cases where it would merit it, the health authority can make an exemption order in the case of a home in which the authority is satisfied that such illegitimate child is being cared for by responsible persons.  The Minister for Health, in this case, can revoke that exemption order, if the circumstances later so warrant it.  I should say, too, that under the operation of Section 32 of the Adoption Act, 1952, illegitimate children placed for adoption under an interim adoption order or a final adoption order are exempt from the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 refers to foster children who take up employment in circumstances which require them to reside in their employer's house or in accommodation provided by him.  The Minister for Health is satisfied that the interest of such children requires that the health authority be empowered <Col N="1078" /> to supervise their accommodation and conditions of employment.  It could be held that a child without a normal home or the protection of his parents who is taken into employment and accommodated in his employer's premises may be exposed to greater risks than a child in the usual type of foster home.  The section provides that where an arrangement of this kind is made by any person who is not a relative of the child, the health authority shall be notified seven days in advance of commencement of the employment.  The duty of notification will rest on the person or body making the arrangement, unless they are outside the State, in which case the obligation to notify will rest on the prospective employer.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that the age provided for in this section is in respect of children under 18 years of age.  The original section provided for children under 16 years of age and the extension by two years was again as a result of an amendment from the Opposition which I accepted.</P>
    <P>Minor amendments of the Children Acts are contained in Sections 4, 9 and 10 of the Bill, the first&mdash;that is, Section 4&mdash;removing the anomaly of a person of 16 years being responsible for the custody of a person up to the age of 17 years.  The second&mdash;that is, Section 9&mdash;regulates the maximum amount of parental contribution in respect of children detained in certified schools, that is, that contribution cannot exceed the amount of contribution made by the local authority and the State. Section 10 brings the Act into conformity with the School Attendance Act, 1926, in relation to the minimum age for compulsory school attendance.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as Senators know, was prepared before the change of Government. It appears now substantially as the draft was presented to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should be welcomed.  As the Minister has just said, it was prepared in the period of office of the previous Government.  I think he has accepted it in the proper spirit.  It is a step forward in certain directions.  It is a loosening-up of the authority of the Minister and it leans <Col N="1079" /> towards the parents.  It is a step towards making schools more for reform and improvement than for punishment.</P>
      <P>The Minister met certain suggestions in the other House very fairly and it seems to me that the Bill is highly commendable.  I have no amendments to move on Committee Stage, but I feel it is essentially a matter that might be discussed in Committee rather than on the Second Stage.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I should like to welcome the Bill. Reading the debate which took place on it in the Dáil, one is struck not merely by the way the Bill was brought in but by the accommodating manner in which the Minister received amendments.  It seems to me that we have before us the context of both a good and a very useful Bill.</P>
      <P>Something ought to be said here, also, about the long-term preparatory work for legislation of this kind which was carried out by the voluntary Joint Committee of Women's Societies in Ireland, who, to my personal knowledge, have been endeavouring for many years to have some such legislation as this put through the Oireachtas and to whom, I think, some measure of tribute is due from us here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to welcome the introduction of this Bill and, incidentally, to welcome the Minister for Education here.  The provisions in Sections 2 and 3 are particularly desirable and will undoubtedly afford better protection for the children concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was quite clear to social workers and members of local authorities, particularly, that the 48 hours' notice given by the person or body placing a child in a foster home and by the person receiving the child for reward was completely inadequate to enable the local authority to conduct a proper check as to the suitability of the proposed home and the suitability of the person receiving the child.  The improvement in the Bill in that respect, by providing for seven days' notice, <Col N="1080" /> should ensure satisfaction to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I think there will be general agreement and approval, too, for the raising of the age from nine to 16 years as the period during which children placed in a foster home, and the home itself, will be subject to the supervision of the local authority.  I regard Section 3 of the Bill as very important because foster children who go out to work up to the age of 18 and who are required to accept accommodation in the home of their prospective employers are to a great extent defenceless. This section gives them the protection of the local health authority, which is empowered to check the accommodation provided for them and to supervise their working conditions. In view of past happenings in regard to such children, this is a most desirable provision.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to make is in regard to capitation.  We know that the capitation grants paid to industrial schools and homes of that nature generally are miserable.  They are small and have not kept up with the cost of living and the increase in the cost of commodities needed for the children in those homes. I should like to express the hope that the Minister will consider the desirability of an improvement in that respect as soon as the national finances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not seem to be much left for me to say except to thank the House for the manner in which it has received the Bill.  As has been stated on all sides, the provisions are most desirable and, in many cases, necessary.</P>
      <P>As to the contribution of Senator Sheehy Skeffington, in which he referred to a certain joint committee of women's societies, I think I can say that it was largely as a result of their suggestions that some of the provisions of the Bill were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only note that might be considered to be in any way discordant was struck by Senator Ó Maoláin. Somebody in the Dáil mentioned the particular problem that he referred to, that is, the amount of the grants paid to these schools.  I am aware that the <Col N="1081" /> grants are very limited and that the managers and staffs of these schools work under considerable hardship and difficulty, especially having regard to the fact that costs have risen over the past number of years, such as the cost of food, clothing, heating and lighting, whereas the capitation grants have remained stationary.  I have met a deputation of school managers in the recent past, as a result of which I have certain proposals under consideration by which I hope in the near future to improve that position in the certified schools.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to implement the agreement signed on 16th March, 1957, between this country and the United States of America.  That agreement provided that a sum of £500,000 out of the American Counterpart Fund of £6,000,000 should be set aside to promote mutual understanding between the countries by wider exchange of knowledge and through educational contracts.  I must say, as was said by the Minister for External Affairs in the Dáil, that the Government and the people of Ireland are very much indebted to the Government and people of the United States of America for this generous contribution and we hope that, through it, the closer contact that will be made between the peoples of the two countries, particularly in the educational field, will tend to strengthen the ties that exist between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of this special fund to be administered by a board known as An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cómalairte.  The board will consist of seven persons, four to be Irish citizens nominated by the Minister for External Affairs, and <Col N="1082" /> three, citizens of the United States of America, to be nominated by the chief of the American Diplomatic Mission in this country.  The chairman of the board will be one of those members nominated by the Minister for External Affairs; in other words, an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>The functions of the board will be as set out in Section 5, to provide for the financing of studies, research, instruction, teaching, lecturing and other educational activities of Irish citizens in America and of American citizens in this country.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be operated in cooperation with the United States Board of Foreign Scholarships.  In addition, the board will be required to set forth its estimated budget for one year commencing on 1st April of each year and will also be expected to set out its proposed programme for that period.  The Minister may then, if he thinks proper, approve of that programme and budget for the ensuing year.</P>
    <P>The board will be required, before 30th June of each year, to present its annual report to the Minister, which will be laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas.  The board will meet at least once a quarter and Section 10 contains provisions for the absence of the chairman and the appointment of a deputy chairman for any particular meeting, and provisions in relation to the quorum.  Any member of the board may be required to resign, by the Minister or by the Chief of the Diplomatic Mission of the United States, according as that particular member is nominated by one or the other.  Membership of the board will last for two years, subject to that membership ending on 31st December of the second year next after the appointment of that member to the board; but he will be eligible for reappointment on the termination of his period of appointment.</P>
    <P>The board will be required to invest so much of the fund as is over and above their normal requirements, in securities to be approved by the Minister for External Affairs.  The board will also be in a position to reticula <Col N="1083" /> ceive gifts of money, endowments or otherwise, to add to its finances.  The board is intended to be a permanent board, but naturally provisions have to be included in the Bill for its winding up.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill were very carefully considered between the two Governments before it appeared in draft and I would ask the House to accept the Bill in its entirety, as it appears before the House.  In doing so, we can confidently expect that the exchange of persons of high academic standing between the two countries will strengthen the friendship and understanding which already exists.  I am sure that Irish students of all branches of learning&mdash;arts, economics, agriculture and industry&mdash;will benefit greatly by the provisions of the Bill and by the moneys provided in the fund.  The citizens of the United States will also benefit greatly by their coming to this country and learning what higher knowledge we have to offer; and by so doing, they will come to understand the Irish mentality and the Irish economy better.  That will still further promote the friendly associations to which I have referred and which everyone knows exist at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to express our very great thanks to the United States Government and people for their hospitality, as is evidenced by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I should like to associate the constitutency which I represent, the University of Dublin, with the Minister's expression of gratitude to the Government of the United States for financing this Bill.  It is a very generous measure, indeed.  It shows&mdash; and this is reassuring for persons like myself&mdash;a respect for learning and a respect for teaching.  Recently, in the United States, there has been some censure of the people called &ldquo;eggheads&rdquo;, the intellectuals of the country.  We &ldquo;eggheads&rdquo; have been mildly perturbed by that.  The practical measures of this Bill are a very clear and definite reply to all such foolish <Col N="1084" /> suspicions of the intellectual.  The intellectual is not the be-all and end-all of any State or any country, but he has his part to play.  I feel that in helping to build up the morale of intellectuals and educationists by a practical measure of this kind, the United States is doing something very worth while, indeed.</P>
      <P>As the Minister says, it will foster and promote friendliness and understanding between the two countries. In a way, that is hardly necessary between Ireland and the United States; but it is strange how occasionally misunderstandings arise and, from it, unfriendliness may result.  If the best educated people of our country are sent to America and others from America are sent back to us, that is one of the best ways of avoiding these misunderstandings at the higher levels. Although the relations between the two countries are very happy, they have to be safeguarded and this is one of the best ways of safeguarding them. I should also like to congratulate the Government on bringing this Bill in speedily and efficiently.</P>
      <P>There is one matter of detail I should like to raise.  The success of this Bill will depend entirely on the good working of the board.  I do not think it would be fair to ask the Minister now&mdash;and he probably would not answer me, anyway&mdash;what the constitution of the board will be and what kind of people will be selected; but I would urge on him&mdash;and I know he has the matter very much at heart&mdash; that unless the board is fairminded, impartial and imbued with the highest ideals of education, this generous gesture may go sour, may fail.  I know he will give serious consideration to the fact that this money must be spent on merit alone.  There is always the danger of scholarships or awards of this kind being obtained by efficient lobbying.  One of the things which is damaging this country to some extent is at times the success of that kind of lobbying.  I urge on the Minister with great earnestness that he should see that this board is such as will give these awards only on merit, irrespective of any other consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, if it were possible for a representative <Col N="1085" /> of my own university to be on the board, we would be very pleased.  But that may not be possible because all educational institutions must be considered.  Above all, we must prevent this Bill being misused; we must prevent inferior minds from profiting from this simply because they have the pull or the push behind them. If he can ensure that, this will be a very fine achievement, indeed, in educational matters between the two countries. I repeat that we are most grateful to the United States, and I congratulate the Minister on this fine Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, feel great pleasure in being associated with the expression of thanks to the United States Government for their very generous gesture.  I will go beyond it and express our thanks for what they have done for our students in the past. I had the good fortune to be allowed to work my way through an American university for three years and I experienced nothing but kindness and helpfulness right through.  I think we owe a great deal to the American nation for what they are prepared to do for us.</P>
      <P>On the present Bill, I should like, first, to point out that the amount involved, £500,000, gives an interest of £30,000 per year.  That is a fairly sizable sum, a least in comparison with the amount we will be discussing next week for the agricultural institute, which has only the best part of double that amount.</P>
      <P>This is called a Scholarship Bill, but we must not be frightened by the term &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo;.  I read in Section 5 that the aim is to encourage the activity of Irish citizens in schools, universities and institutions of higher learning.  I want to emphasise that the word &ldquo;schools&rdquo; is used.  In other words, it is to provide opportunities of travel and education for all concerned with education.  I take it&mdash;and I hope I am correct&mdash;that the primary teacher in the national school is as much a concern of this as our leading professors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that there are three categories involved here.  First, we have schools mentioned.  There are primary, vocational and secondary schools.  Personally, I think nothing would do <Col N="1086" /> more to revive the spirit of our nation and to bring it abreast of modern ideas than that our teachers should go and work abroad as teachers for a period of at least a year.  As an ex-Christian Brothers' boy, I have the highest respect for the religious teachers in our schools, but I feel that both religious and lay teachers would benefit enormously from the opportunity of spending a year abroad in similar institutions, and this would cost only a mere return ticket to the United States.  I take it once they get there, that, if possible, they will no longer be a burden on the scholarship scheme.  Likewise, a two-way traffic is envisaged here and we will have educators, teachers, from the United States coming to teach in our schools.</P>
    <P>That is one arm, the teaching arm. The second arm to which I wish to call attention is the agricultural arm, the advisory services, who are really the adult education teachers of our farming community.  I believe they should participate, and participate very much, in this scholarship scheme.  I see no difficulty whatsoever, under the Bill as it is drafted, in members of the advisory services participating in the scheme.  They can go to institutions of higher learning, as they are called in the United States, because the advisory services there are linked to the universities and, according to the terms of this Bill, any of our advisory services are free to go and function in the American advisory services.  Unfortunately, I feel the provisions here do not permit that to be reciprocated, because, as far as the Bill goes, United States citizens can only come here to schools, universities, institutions of higher learning and other suitable institutions.  I wonder if we could class work under a county committee of agriculture as a suitable institution? Perhaps when the agricultural institute is set up, work under that institute would qualify in that respect.</P>
    <P>I come then to the third category involved, the universities.  Again, I believe that all the universities should share in this.  I echo what Senator Stanford has said, and, in furtherance <Col N="1087" /> of that, I suggest that our much-neglected college in Maynooth should share equally with the other universities within the country.</P>
    <P>If my interpretation is correct, that the scholarship scheme applies to all three main divisions, the schools, the adult education advisory services and the universities, then I believe that the board should be constituted accordingly.  While I would welcome adequate representation of the universities on the board, I do not for one moment believe that they should have all the board, or anything like it. There should be at least one representative from the primary teachers, secondary teachers or the vocational teachers, someone to speak for those bodies.  Perhaps this is unconstitutional, but, seeing that this matter is so important, I wonder if the Minister for External Affairs could nominate the Taoiseach on the board.  If we want the best educational authorities and the men with the most comprehensive and broadest view of education, that would seem to be desirable.</P>
    <P>I would also urge that the board should be rather sparing in its grants, sparing to the extent of not discouraging the private enterprise of persons who can go to America without such aid.  It is a well-known fact that many of our leading educationists, university members, and so on, especially in the science faculties, can arrange exchanges without very much financial aid.  We are reaching the stage when our post-graduate students are being snapped up by English and American universities.  We had a case in U.C.C. this past session where one of the lowest placed men in our graduation class in engineering was given a first-class teaching assistantship in an American university.  The Americans are satisfied that they get value by having us do some teaching for them and I think that in the case of every applicant, the board should ensure, first of all, that he has made an effort to arrange something for himself.  If he is assisted he should, as far as possible, while in the States, pay his own way. Whatever institution he goes to, he can fit in with the teaching staff and <Col N="1088" /> thereby pay his way.  If we give £1,000 to each man sent out, we can only send 15; if we give only £100 we can obviously send out 150.</P>
    <P>The board should try to make the money go as far as possible by combining the two factors, working in the United States and the giving of a limited supplement from here.  There should be a definite obligation on those availing of the scholarship to return and work in this country.  It is our experience that many of our scholars who go from the universities to work in the United States and who get their post-graduate degrees stay over there.  We have no means of bringing them home.  They cannot work on the salaries we can offer them.  At present, I would say we are losing two out of three of our graduates we are sending to the United States.</P>
    <P>I should hate to think that this scholarship exchange would become a means of siphoning our graduates into American life.  Those granted help under the scholarship scheme should sign an agreement to return home to work in this country, say, for a minimum period of five years; something like the undertaking teachers sign at present for their training expenses.  In default of that, they should return the money spent on them.  I think that is only fair.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am delighted to see it is the Minister for Education who is presenting this Bill because I have just one small point I can raise, a point which is slightly extraneous to this Bill.  It would be a very good idea to promote exchange of students, staff and so on with the American universities but why could we not begin at home and have an exchange between our universities here and the university in Belfast?  Maybe that might have some bearing on Senator Stanford's motion on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>We can do a little more.  We should make it quite possible for a professor in Galway University to come up and give a week's lectures in Dublin and we might entice the U.C.D. professors to come all the way to Cork.  There should be exchange between Belfast and Dublin, and so on.  That is the way we can build up fellowship in <Col N="1089" /> Ireland.  Let us not forget the home problems.  Our universities here, in participating in this scheme, might reasonably be expected, on their own initiative, to start their own system of exchange as their contribution to the valuable exchange idea.  Again, I welcome this Bill and I hope its benefits will be distributed all over our educational system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinlan, on account of his experience of the United States, has made a very valuable contribution to this debate.  I notice that he was not able to discuss America without speaking of Cork.  I felt while he was appealing to the Minister for Education that it was a case of deep calling to deep.  Whether there will be any result, I could not quite say.  I agree with Senator Quinlan that the exchanges, if possible, should be on all levels and not on the university teacher level only.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it costs a great deal less for a person in the United States with his salary, to come here than it costs to send somebody from here to the United States.  I am speaking from my experience of university life in Dublin.  If a professor is asked to go to the United States, even though we pay his full salary, the expense of his journey to the United States, particularly if he travels in the United States, is so great that his salary is very little use to him.  The relationship between the two countries in regard to costs is very difficult to manage.  As Senator Quinlan has suggested, if people can get work of an educational character in the United States, they should be encouraged to do so and not be dependent entirely on this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some knowledge of the science professors who went there recently to investigate matters in regard to atomic energy.  They received most extraordinary hospitality and were given the most wonderful facilities.  They came back here very much enlightened, but the fact remains, that travelling and other expenses in the United States are very high indeed.  It is highly desirable that a person who goes away should, if it could be arranged at all, return, but I have very grave doubts whether any legal means are available <Col N="1090" /> which would in fact compel such a person to return.</P>
    <P>It seems a pity in regard to science people that the travelling scholarships in the National University, which used to be considered very good prizes, are not in some cases competed for by science graduates who, once they get their honours degree, can get a £500 scholarship at Liverpool, while here they can get only a £300 scholarship. That is the situation in regard to science which will inevitably tend to denude us of our best people, and even of people who are below the level of the very best.</P>
    <P>I should like to join in thanking the American Government and people for the provision made in this Bill.  I should like to make one allusion with regard to a statement by Senator Stanford in relation to the constitution of the board.  He hoped the board would be so constituted that scholarships would not be awarded by lobbying.  That is an extraordinary thing to say to a Minister of any Government.  I have rather long experience of scholarships in this country as a university teacher, as chairman of the Cultural Relations Committee and as a member of that committee under different Governments, and I have had something to do with the awarding of scholarships.  I must say I have not seen any example of a scholarship where there was even a suspicion of its being awarded by lobbying.  I do not know what particular thing Senator Stanford is talking about.  As everybody knows, I am in profound disagreement with the present Government, but I have not the slightest suspicion they will appoint a board, the members of which, who will include three Americans, when awarding scholarships will be amenable to lobbying. I should like that to go on record.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words on a particular matter, but I will not refer to it until I have said what I want to say.  I notice that Senator Quinlan talked about working his way through an American university for three years.  I regret having to admit that I did not work my way through three American universities in one year, but I was in three American universities in one year.  That is exactly the opposite to what happened to Senator Quinlan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Bill has been exceptionally well put together from the point of view of economising on the money. I notice the Minister is going to provide offices and so on.  I think that is a very good idea.  Before the Minister mentioned it, I was trying to work out <Col N="1093" /> the answer to the question raised by Senator Ó Siochfhradha as to what the income would be.  I took it that if the board wanted to preserve the fund, the income would be £30,000 a year.  I also rather thought that the fund would have to meet the expenses in each case of the Americans coming here and Irish people going to America, except that there might be other arrangements. I disagree&mdash;I think it is implicit in the Bill-with the view that people should go to America on the income from this fund and get only their transport there.  It is quite clear from the Bill that the money includes payment for transport, maintenance and other matters.  That is the proper system.  It may mean fewer people going, but I do not think that in relation to this kind of fund it is desirable that people should work their way through American universities when they go over.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I agree with Senator Quinlan's sentiments about this matter. I think I disagree with nearly every suggestion he made about administration. In particular, I do not agree with the narrow views expressed by both Senator Quinlan and Senator Ó Siochfhrada about putting some obligation on people to come back.  I think the bulk of the people do come back. That is particularly true of people who go away on fellowships or scholarships of this sort.</P>
    <P>I should say that I agree with Senator Hayes, but I am surprised at Senator Stanford referring to the award of scholarships by lobbying.  I have not as much experience perhaps as other people of the award of fellowships or scholarships, but the board that will make the decisions in this case will be composed of independent people who will form their own judgment on the candidates.  Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.  One has heard of the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded by lobbying on occasions, but that is a different matter, involving international questions.</P>
    <P>The particular matter I want to refer to is that, in thanking the American Government for making these moneys available, we should particularly mention Senator Fulbright as, without his efforts and the particular influence <Col N="1094" /> Senators have in the American governmental system, we might not have this Bill before us to-day.  Speaking from recollection, when the proposals for the utilisation of these moneys went back to the United States, Senator Fulbright was either the chairman or a member of the committee and, happily both for his country and other countries, he insisted that some portion of these moneys should be utilised in this fashion.  Therefore, it is right and proper that, if any individual is to be given credit for this Bill which we are so happy to have before us, we should recognise that that man is Senator Fulbright.</P>

      <P>As Senators well know, I do not represent any university.  I rise, however, to join with other speakers in welcoming this further example of American generosity. Speaking as an ordinary Senator, I welcome anything that strengthens international understanding.  The reason why I want to intervene in the debate is that, representing Labour here, I want to say that we in the trade union movement have had experience of American generosity, and I should like to record our appreciation of the help and generosity the American Government and the American trade unions have provided to the representatives of trade unions in Ireland who visited the United States.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I should like to refer to a matter raised by Senator O'Donovan. I did not advocate that all the money should be restricted to mere travelling allowances.  I advocated that the money should be made to go as far as possible&mdash;that we should explore every other means of getting help so that we can send out the maximum number.</P>

      <P>As a representative of an agricultural association with 60,000 members, I feel it my duty to welcome the Bill and echo the sentiments expressed by the Minister and several other speakers in thanking the American Government.  £500,000 for scholarship purposes is something that educational people can appreciate and even people like myself who have no education can appreciate it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was good to learn from Senator <Col N="1095" /> Hayes that these scholarships will be awarded on merit.  Senator Stanford expressed some doubt about it.  I think, however, we can take it that Senator Hayes has more experience and that there will be no lobbying in connection with the granting of these scholarships.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, a portion of the money allotted to us should be reserved for agricultural students.  Furthermore, I believe there should be some obligation on the people who avail of these scholarships to come back and give some service in the country.  Senator O'Donovan expressed some doubt about the wisdom of that, but, nevertheless, it is my view.  An agricultural student who came my way as a farm apprentice for a short time is now a student in Cornel University, New York.  He is very brilliant.  It would be a great calamity if a boy such as he did not come back.  I am sure he will have many inducements to stay away, but it would be a serious loss to the country if he and other boys like him did not come back.  I would regard it as a great loss if Senator Quinlan and Senator O'Donovan who appear to have been in American universities were not with us.</P>

      <P>B'fhéidir go mba chóir dhom tagairt a dhéanamh, ar dtúis, don méid adúirt an Seanadóir Ó Siochfhradha.  Bhí sé ag iarraidh a thuille eolais ar an mBille.  Ní féidir liom an t-eolas go léir a thabhairt dó ach is féidir liom a rá go bhfuilimíd ag súil, do réir an teacht isteach bliaintiúil, le breis agus £25,000 sa mbliain &mdash;is é sin, do réir ús ar 5%.  Ina theannta sin, táimíd ag súil go dtuitfidh an ráta maidir le costas airgid. B'fhéidir go mbeidh an tsuim níos lú ná sin mar beidh caitheachas as sin anois agus arís.  Tá baoghal orm go mbeidh sé níos lua ná £25,000 féin, ach sílim go mbeidh sé timpeall an méid sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis na costaisí a lua an tSeanadóir, an Seabhac, beidh ar an mBord costaisí na nAmericánach a thiocfaidh anseo a dhíol.  Ní mic léin amháin a tiocfaidh anseo ach daoine <Col N="1096" /> gur féidir leo teagase a thabhairt sa tír seo i ngnéithe éagsúla.  Dá bhrí sin, beidh orainn, fé mar atá sé sa Chonnradh, costaisí na ndaoine a thiocfaidh anseo a dhíol as an gCiste.</P>
    <P>I think the first point made was that of Senator Stanford when he said, very rightly, that the success of the scheme will depend on the work of the board and that the work of the board will depend on the membership.  I am grateful to Senator Hayes for his confidence that the Government will appoint the best possible board it can get.  It would be right to appoint a board as representative of one or other institution, but a board whose outlook will be sufficiently broad and which will have the interests not only of education but also of agriculture at heart.</P>
    <P>I do not think any board set up for this purpose would be complete without due regard being had for agricultural learning, science and techniques. The Minister for External Affairs made that fact clear when replying to the debate in the Dáil.  For my own part, I think the board should have regard for industrial learning as well as for agriculture, the arts and the sciences because I believe there are many techniques in industry, in marketing, salesmanship, packaging and others, in which we can usefully learn a lot from the Americans.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the amount distributed should be carefully watched and that some regard should be had to the possibility of those who go abroad being in a position to earn something to supplement the grant or awards they get from the board, I think that suggestion is a good one and when the board awards an advance or scholarship to an individual who is in a position to impart knowledge, I do not think he would be precluded from receiving payment in America or the American from receiving payment in Ireland, for any knowledge he could impart.  I think it is reasonable and, as Senator Quinlan pointed out, it would preserve the fund to some extent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fears expressed by some Senators that people who would benefit under the scheme might remain abroad and not bring back the <Col N="1097" /> benefit of their training or learning to this country, I should point out, and perhaps I should have pointed out at the start, that the visas given to persons receiving these grants or scholarships for the United States of America will be only interim visas, designed to last for the period of their training or teaching.  As well as that, there will be provision that a visa will not be granted for their return to America for a certain period.  That, of course, is not contained in the Bill, but there is an agreement between the Department of External Affairs and the appropriate Department in the U.S.A. to that effect.  I take it that that will safeguard the interests of the country in so far as we hope to receive benefit that will inure to the advantage of the country from these visits of people abroad.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 5 are sufficiently flexible to enable the fullest and widest possible use being made of the fund and I am sure that the board will, and must, under the terms of the Bill, have regard for all levels of education, all levels of people who require education and, as well as that, every aspect of education, be it art, science, agriculture or industry.</P>
    <P>I think some of the Senators were unduly hard on Senator Stanford.  I feel that a certain amount of lobbying might be forgiven in this respect.  I am not suggesting that lobbying should be done for certain individuals, but lobbying, perhaps, by organisations who feel that a certain type of instruction would benefit the country.  For example, if a particular agricultural activity is engaged in in the U.S.A. and a certain organisation feels that if some person were to go to the United States to become expert in it, it would redound to the welfare of this country, I think it would be the duty of that organisation to approach the board and I believe that we can depend on the integrity and the discretion and judgment of the board to have due regard for such suggestions.  I do not think there would be anything wrong in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be lobbying at all, surely.  It would be a <Col N="1098" /> statement of an opinion of an organisation, quite a different thing.  It would be done publicly, presumably.  Senator O'Callaghan did it this evening publicly.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Seanad has welcomed this Bill, as the Dáil welcomed it.  As the House will see, Section 8 provides for the preparation of the budget programme and the ordinary programme of the board to be submitted for the approval of the Minister before 1st April.  It would be in our interests that the Bill be passed through the House in all its stages this evening so as to give an opportunity of appointing the board, first of all, and secondly, to enable the board to be convenced and to have a scheme, if possible, prepared before April next, so that we can take advantage of the academic year commencing in 1958.</P>

      <P>The last paragraph of Section 5 says, &ldquo;in co-operation with the United States Board of Foreign Scholarships, the selecting of students, professors, teachers&rdquo; and so on.  In other words, it implies that the selections will be made in co-operation with the United States Board.  I presume the United States Board will have the selection of their representatives to come across and that we here will have the selection of our representatives going to the United States, but I <Col N="1099" /> wonder does the word &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; provide for the case of a disagreement between the two bodies.  Can one veto the other or have we the last say in the selection here, just as it would be reasonable that the Americans should have the last say in the selection on their side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the word &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; speaks for itself.  The fact is that the board will administer the fund.  Therefore, I have little doubt that substantial agreement will be found amongst the members themselves, but I think the implication is clear enough that the United States Board of Foreign Scholarships would be the proper board to select students on the other side and make suggestions to the board when it is set up, who possibly in most cases will accept their suggestions in the case of the selection of personnel from the United States. There will be no conflict of interest because it is the board set up under the Act that will decide who goes and who comes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to extend the Rent Restrictions Acts for a further period of one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the Acts after the 31st December is necessary to enable the Government to examine the recommendations in the Conroy Report on Rent Control.  Senators will recall that this report, which was presented in 1952, recommended the extension of <Col N="1100" /> control to all dwellings, whenever built and whether let furnished or unfurnished. It also recommended that landlords of the houses which are now controlled should be allowed an increase in rent where they are responsible for repairs.  The report contained a large number of other recommendations many of which, although of a technical character, also involve important issues of principle.</P>
    <P>At present, the main recommendations of the Conroy Commission are being examined departmentally, in view of the various relevant changes which have taken place since the report was compiled.  At that time, economic conditions were considerably influenced by the Korean crisis, which was then at its height.  Since then, conditions have become more stable and the supply of houses has improved, especially in the rural areas and towns; but there is still a serious shortage of rented accommodation in Dublin and Cork and it will be some years yet before even the needs of the local authorities in these areas can be met.</P>
    <P>I shall bring the matter before the Government when the departmental examination has been completed but, owing to the importance and complexity of the problem, the Government will need to study it thoroughly before taking final decisions.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it is desirable that the Acts be not allowed to expire, and accordingly the Bill proposes to preserve the <i>status quo</i> for landlords and tenants for another year.  The Bill is identical with those passed in recent years except for the necessary changes in dates.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Bill passed through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration, and passed.</P>
