      <P>On the last occasion, I raised the question of the provisions of Section 2 (1) of the Bill.  I do not want to go into the arguments or repeat anything I said then.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he would examine the provisions to which I referred.  Perhaps he is in a position now to indicate the necessity for giving moneys to be advanced under sub-section (1) priority over existing charges on property of the Turf Development Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the points raised by the Senator examined by the experts of the Department of Finance. The position is and has been that the only lender to the board hitherto was the Central Fund and no charges on the board's property were made to secure the repayment of such advances. I take it that they were not considered necessary.  Now the Bill enables the board to go to other sources for capital. It enables charges to be made on the board's property to secure the repayment of such loans.  What the section does, in fact, is enable the Minister for Finance to give priority to the claims of such outside lenders <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In any event, they cannot be put into any position inferior to that of equality.  A section exactly similar to this was inserted in the E.S. Act, for the purpose of enabling the E.S.B. to raise money in similar fashion, but, in fact, when a prospectus was issued, there was no reference to any such charges at all because they were not considered to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that, in respect of any particular issue which may be <Col N="79" /> necessary, the terms and conditions will be decided upon in the circumstances of the time at which the money is being sought.  The net point in the section is that the Minister cannot be put into a superior position to these outside lenders and the best he can achieve under it is to be put on a footing of equality.  If any difference will be created between claims of the Central Fund and other lenders, the difference will be, and must be, in favour of the outside lenders.  I think the Senator's apprehensions in respect of such outside lenders are not well founded.  I take it this assurance should allay whatever fears he may have had in the matter.</P>

      <P>Tá an méid seo le rá agam ar an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the Dáil, this Bill implements the decision of the Government to grant a general increase of 1/- a week in social assistance payments extending to adult dependents and one dependent child in order to offset as far as possible the effect of the ending of the food subsidies.  It provides for persons in receipt of old age and blind pensions, unemployment assistance and non-contributory widows' pensions.  A recipient who has no dependent within the statutory definition will receive an increase of 1/- per week, and a person with one dependent 2/- per week.  For a person with one adult and one child dependent, the increase is 3/-.</P>
      <P>The increased rates of social assistance will be payable as from mid-May and it is hoped to commence payment at the higher rates in the first week of July.  Arrears will be paid with the first payment at the new rate.  I regret that it would not be possible, for administrative reasons, to start payment at the new rates any sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in social assistance <Col N="80" /> payments proposed under this Bill will cost the Exchequer approximately £642,000 in a full year.  Of this sum, old age pensioners will receive £432,000, recipients of unemployment assistance £127,000 and those in receipt of non-contributory widows' pensions £83,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish&mdash;I suppose, in common with all other Senators&mdash;to oppose this measure, but I want to say how critically I look upon it and the meanness with which the Government attempts to make up for the increase in the price of essential foodstuffs for the people in receipt of these social assistance benefits. What is proposed here is an increase of 1/- per week and this stems directly from the decision, announced in the Budget, of withdrawing the food subsidies.  I note that the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, at column 946, Volume 161, said that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Based on average consumption per head these subsidies over the past year have been worth approximately 1/1 per week to each individual in the community.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All of us know in our hearts that the lower the income of a family, the greater the importance of the price of bread and butter to that family.</P>
      <P>It might be mathematically correct to say that the average benefit of the subsidies to an individual is 1/1 per week, but it is not giving compensation to those people in receipt of these social assistance benefits to give them 1/- a week to make up for the increase in the price of these essential foodstuffs. We know that the family depending on unemployment assistance, the blind and the widows, do not have cereals or bacon and egg for their breakfast and perhaps a piece of toast to finish off with.  Their breakfast is bread, and if they are lucky, butter. Again, their lunch&mdash;with the size of these benefits&mdash;must be bread and butter once more, or perhaps, as it was said in the Dáil, some of them living in the country have to depend largely on potatoes.  Again, their evening meal does not consist of a dinner.  It is what we know as tea and bread and butter again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> It follows from that that these people must eat more bread and butter than the people in receipt of the higher incomes who are fortunate enough to have the type of breakfast I describe, a lunch and a dinner that evening.  But the calculation has been made that the extra cost to these people, as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies, is 1/1 and the Government proceeds to give them 1/-. I must welcome the fact that they are at least getting the 1/-, but I must criticise the meanness of the recoupment given to them.</P>
    <P>When we look at this Bill, the question arises as to whether at least some similar increase should not be given to the people in receipt of unemployment benefit and the widows and orphans in receipt of contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  They, as well as the others, must be burdened with an increase brought about by the withdrawal of the food subsidies and they are not given even this small increase.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators will believe me when I say that I do not want to make these people, the unemployed, the blind and widows political shuttlecocks. I want to appeal to the conscience of the Senators, no matter on what side of the House they sit and no matter to what Party they are affiliated or whether they are affiliated to any Party at all.  We must have some conscience in this matter.  We boast of being a Christian State and this is how we treat our people who are out of work and our widows and orphans.  We are fond of criticising the pagan country across the water and yet we know they have more practical Christianity in this matter than we.</P>
    <P>It may be said that it is a rich country.  Certainly, it is rich, but the benefits to those people in Britain are paid by a redistribution of income. The State cannot automatically increase the benefits to the old, the unemployed, the blind and the widows. It must take it from some section of the community to give it to other people in need.  I say that the Government have a duty to take that money.  I go further and say that quite a proportion of the people here <Col N="82" /> in this country now&mdash;not the well off people but the ordinary people who smoke and take an odd drink&mdash;really feel that they would put up with extra taxation, if it could be of some benefit to the less fortunate.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose this Bill, but I hope that Senators, no matter on what side of the House they sit, will join with me in urging upon the Government that at the first available opportunity they should increase the benefits to the recipients of these social welfare benefits, to the people in receipt of unemployment benefit and contributory widows' and orphans' pensions. Through the Senators, I hope we will get a conscience in this country to agree that extra taxation to help these people would be willingly borne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in a spirit rather similar to that of Senator Murphy on this Bill.  I think it is obvious that we support the Bill&mdash;all of us&mdash;and the only criticism will be on the question of whether the Bill goes far enough or not.  I hold that it does not.  The Bill now before us is linked with the Bill we will be considering presently, and I think that in the other House reference to the two Bills was permitted, but this particular Bill deals with old age pensioners, a section of the unemployed and their dependents, wives and children, and blind pensioners and widows.</P>
      <P>Our only argument here really will turn upon the rates now offered.  It is also obvious that we cannot, in fact, do very much about it.  We, as a Seanad, might make a recommendation, but, in fact, realistically speaking, the most we can do is to talk as persuasively as we can and try to convince the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister and the Government that, if not now, then at some future date, not too far distant, something considerably more must be done for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to speak mainly about the old age pensioners, but what I say is in general terms, relevant to each <Col N="83" /> of the categories, the unemployed and their dependents, the blind pensioners and those drawing non-contributory widows' pensions.  We were told to-day and Deputies were told in the other House that the aim of this Bill and, indeed, of these two Bills is, in fact, to compensate for the effects of the removal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the other House said that the effect of the removal of these food subsidies would amount to approximately 1/1 per head of the population.  We are being asked in the case of the worst off in the whole community to give them not even 1/1.  In other words, those who are to be hardest hit are not even to get what would be necessary if an average compensation were to be given.  In giving 1/- instead of 1/1, we are, by removing the food subsidies, saving money at the expense of the poorest as well as at the expense of the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear that we could not afford, as he put it, to subsidise food further, to subsidise bread and butter, because, he said, with a certain logic, that it was not sound economics for the general taxpayer to subsidise the whole community in the buying of such things as bread and butter, to subsidise, as it were, the rich and the poor alike.  I think most of us would see something in that argument, and I think we would be satisfied enough with it if we felt that those who would be hardest hit by the removal of the food subsidies were to be effectively compensated.</P>
    <P>My criticism of this Bill is that it does not go nearly far enough effectively to compensate the poor, the blind pensioner, the old age pensioner and the unemployed, for what they are losing now.</P>
    <P>I should like to put two general queries, the first of which is related to what I have just said.  Is the compensation offered enough&mdash;does what we are giving in this Bill really compensate for what has been taken away under the Budget?</P>
    <P>The second question is: since these are proposed increases calculated upon <Col N="84" /> a given basic sum&mdash;the present basic sum for the old age pensioners being 24/- a week&mdash;is the Government satisfied that that basic rate was enough? One does not need a very long memory in this country, and in this House, to remember when the previous Minister for Social Welfare was before us asking us to increase similarly the rates for these people.  On that occasion, he was&mdash;I think I might even say&mdash;fiercely attacked by some of the Fianna Fáil Senators because he was not doing half enough, but now I suggest that the present Government is tacitly accepting as a fact that the basic 24/- which last year was &ldquo;not nearly enough,&rdquo; was in fact really enough then, and is enough now as a basic sum upon which to calculate any future increases.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would suggest, on the contrary, that if last year and in 1955, what the then Government was doing for the old age pensioners, the unemployed and the blind pensioners was, in the opinion of Fianna Fáil, grossly inadequate, then there is something wrong with Fianna Fáil when it is in power coming before us and saying that all we need to do in relation to these people is to compensate for any increases in the cost of living which have taken place since Fianna Fáil has come into office.  In other words, I deplore the apparent forgetrulness by the present Government of their harsh criticism of this basic rate when they were not in power, and when it was not within their power to introduce legislation to increase it.  I might, of course, say the same thing to members of the Labour Party and members of Fine Gael, for, after all, last year they could have raised these rates.  Many of them are indignant now that so little is being done, but I do not think we should forget that it was within their power, if they were not satisfied last year and in 1955, to do more, and I feel there is something slightly disingenuous, consequently, in some of the arguments of Opposition Senators.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy made the point which I would very strongly support that it is unfair in relation to the poorer members of our community to calculate the amount of money they are likely to need in order to cope with the increased cost of bread on an <Col N="85" /> average consumption based upon the whole country, because, as Senator Murphy pointed out, the poorer sections of the community rely to a far greater degree upon the main uncooked food&mdash;when I say &ldquo;uncooked,&rdquo; I mean ready cooked&mdash;the main food which comes to them ready prepared.</P>
    <P>One does not have to labour the point.  It is known to all of us that the poorer sections of our community both in rural Ireland and in urban Ireland rely to a far greater degree than the average upon bread in their daily diet.  Consequently, to compensate them, as this Bill does, on the basis of the average consumption of bread per head of the population is not to recognise the reality of the situation; in other words, it is grossly to under-compensate them, because a much bigger proportion of bread is consumed by the old age pensioners, the unemployed, their wives and children, blind pensioners and widows&mdash; the really poor.</P>
    <P>To pass for a moment from that first point I make, which is that this shilling does not in fact compensate these people for the increased outlay which they will have to make weekly, arising out of the removal by the Budget of the food subsidies&mdash;as to whether this compensation is adequate or not&mdash;I want to come to the point as to whether this increase, upon the 24/- and so on, is based upon a fair principle; in other words, was the basic amount sufficient, and if that basic amount was not sufficient, and if the Government Party were convinced right up to the eve of their taking office that that basic amount was not sufficient, as they said publicly at outdoor meetings, in the Seanad and in the Dáil again and again, why is it that they did not do more under this Bill than merely to attempt to compensate for the sum of money they are taking away from these people?  In other words is it not the bounden duty of the Government Party not merely to try to compensate, however inadequately, for what they are taking out of the pockets of these people, but also to compensate for the failure of previous Governments to give these people a basic minimum which would be sufficient?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> It is a fact that the old age pension was introduced in this country in 1909 &mdash;which brings us back quite a long way, and brings me back, in fact, to the year of my birth.  In 1909, the old age pension was 5/- a week, if I am correctly informed.  In those days, there were many workers in this city, employed male workers, trying to live on a wage of less than £1 a week, and some of the more privileged workers were not getting much more than 24/- or 25/- a week.  In those days, the old age pension was 5/- a week.  It does not sound very much now, but I would like to suggest that, since 1909, a great number of things have changed in relation to the cost of living, wage rates and so on.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has changed is that labour has become organised, and organised labour has defended its members, the urban and rural workers, and they have wrung from the community, if you like, by organised defence, a rate of wage which, while it may not be regarded as yet sufficient, is, proportionately speaking, far higher in purchasing power than then obtained.  But, and this is the point I am making by analogy, the old age pensioners, because they have not got the opportunity to organise their own defence in the same way as the employed worker, have failed to keep pace in relation to their old age pension with the increase in the cost of living to anything like the same extent as the organised wage earning worker.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think we here in this House and the members of the other House have a special duty to protect the interests of these people, in order that it be not said that we can afford to treat them shabbily because they cannot hit back; the blind pensioner, the worker living on unemployment assistance, his wife and his children, the old age pensioners cannot hit back in the way that the employed organised worker, through his trade union, can.  Let us not say, on that account, that we are going to treat them far more shabbily than we dare treat organised labour.</P>
    <P>We can look back to the days before the war when the old age pension was 10/- a week.  There was a time, indeed, when Cumann na nGaedheal reduced <Col N="87" /> it by 10 per cent. to 9/- a week, but it was raised again fairly quickly to 10/- a week.  The view of the present Government when it was in opposition in those days was that 10/- a week was not enough as a basic rate.  I want to establish that we ought now to compare with that the purchasing power of what we are giving to these people to-day under this Bill.  We are going to give them 25/- a week.  I suggest we ought to be prepared to compare that with what was considered by the present Government Party as grossly inadequate 20 or 25 years ago&mdash;the then 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>It is true, as I have indicated many times in this House, that there is essentially a Government view and an Opposition view.  Sometimes it seems to me that it does not really matter which Party is in power: they take &ldquo;the Government view&rdquo; and the other party, no matter what it is, take &ldquo;the Opposition view.&rdquo;  It seems to me that it is a pair of labels, and not a question of a difference of principle but a difference of personnel.  In fact, when I now hear some of the stronger speeches from the Opposition&mdash;much stronger than any I heard from them in the two and a half years when they were the Government and not the Opposition&mdash;I cannot help feeling that this country might be better governed if there were no Government and we were instead ruled entirely by Oppositions.  I find myself more in accordance with the views of Oppositions. Governments seem to lose all their drive in certain directions, once they have the power to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>Whatever the views of any of us here, or any of the Parties then in the 1930's, as to whether or not 10/- a week was enough for an old age pensioner, is there anybody here now who, looking back to 1935, thinks that 10/- a week was really sufficient then for an old age pensioner?  I should feel ashamed to think that, looking back now and setting aside any question of Party prestige or interest, any of us would be satisfied that, in 1935, say&mdash;taking an average <Col N="88" /> year before the war&mdash;10/- a week was enough for an old age pensioner.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in 1935 the old age pension should have been something nearer to 17/- or 18/- a week.  I think it is obvious that I am not exaggerating or suggesting an exorbitant sum. I suggest that, in 1935, 17/- or 18/- a week for an old age pensioner would have been barely sufficient.  Yet 10/- it was, and 10/- it long remained, though it could be said that it was frequently supplemented by assistance grants drawn from the local authority rates.  Ought it not give us pause to find that our old age pensioners have to be partly on the rates, have to be helped by the ratepayers?  The old age pension, by that significant fact, is effectively recognised as not being sufficient.  I regard it as highly significant that many of our old age pensioners have to apply for extra assistance.</P>
    <P>I hope we could agree then that, in 1935, the old age pension of 10/- a week was not sufficient.  However, it is true &mdash;as I may be reminded&mdash;that 10/- a week in those days had far more buying power than it has to-day.  It is true that if we wanted merely to bring the old age pension now to a purchasing value of what it was in 1935&mdash;I am disregarding the more recent increases in the cost of living and the figure I will quote relates to the cost of living, before this Government came into power, in February, 1957&mdash;if we wanted to give, in February, 1957, an old age pension equivalent to the pretty miserable 10/- a week of 1935, the sum required would be 27/9 a week to compensate for the fall in the purchasing power of the £ between 1935 and 1957.</P>
    <P>We should have had to increase the 1935 pension of 10/- a week to the sum of 27/9 a week to compensate for the rise in the cost of living as at February of this year, that is, before the subsidies were removed.  Yet we are being asked under this Bill to raise pensions not to 27/9 but to 25/&mdash;not as the cost of living was in February, 1957, but as it is now in June, 1957, when it is appreciably more; more according to the Minister's figures, by at least 4½ points.</P>
    <P>I do not want to waste time in recrimination <Col N="89" /> as to whose fault it was that, in February, 1957, the old age pension was not 27/9.  I suggest we ought to recognise now&mdash;and my hope is that the Government will recognise now&mdash;that the minimum basic figure on to which we should now be adding ought to be 27/9 a week, and that it is on to that figure that at least 1/- a week should be added to-day.  That, without any exaggeration or any exorbitant demand, leads me to suggest that the present Bill ought to be raising the old age pension rates to a minimum figure of 29/- a week.  That is based upon the purchasing power of the wretched 1935 10/- a week and compensates only for the rise in the cost of living since then.  However, instead of 29/- a week, we are asked under this Bill to raise it to 25/- a week.  I think we can do better than that.</P>
    <P>A couple of old age pensioners getting 29/-, multiplied by two, a week would get something like £150 a year between them to exist on.  Does anybody here think that £150 a year to keep two old age pensioners is too much?  I do not know if Senators would like to work out figures as to how they can exist&mdash;two people on £150 a year&mdash;but £150 a year is not what we are asking under this Bill. We are asking to give them £130 a year between the two of them&mdash;and that is at the age of 70, not at 65 as is possible in some countries.  In Denmark, such a couple at 65 would get £200 a year non-contributory.  In Iceland, where the pension is admittedly contributory, they get £227 a year.  In Finland, where it is contributory, but where there is no means test, they would get £287 a year&mdash;and each of these is at the age of 65.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied, therefore, that we are doing our best under this Bill for the extremely under-privileged sections of our community.  I do not believe the Parliamentary Secretary is out of sympathy with these people.  I am quite sure his sympathy for them is just as sincere as mine.  He is beset with the problem of finding the money. Where is the money to come from?  In the Dáil I think the Parliamentary Secretary gave the following figures in relation to this Bill.  The total expenditure <Col N="90" /> under this particular Bill was estimated at £642,000.  Of that, £432,000 was to be spent on old age pensioners.  That expenditure was on 166,000 people.  The proportion of this total amount going on unemployment assistance was £127,000.  That was to be allocated to 49,000 people, made up of roughly 25,700 individual claimants for the benefit, and of 23,300 dependents of those claimants.  For non-contributory widows' pensions, £83,000 was allocated to 31,600 such widows.</P>
    <P>I think those are significant figures. Most significant, I think, is the total figure, which I regard as quite insufficient.  When I say that this 1/- is not enough, it is quite obvious that I have to find an answer to the question: where are you going to find more?  One answer has been supplied by Senator Murphy and I would agree with him there, too.  What we have to find, in fact, is something more than the £642,000 which is being asked for under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In his Budget speech, the Minister said he thought it unfair for the taxpayer to subsidise rich and poor alike, but that, in fact, is what he has done under the next Bill we will be considering, for which £1,583,000 has been found.  It is not quite three times as much as the amount we are being asked to provide under this Bill, but it is not so very far off it.  It represents a portion only of very nearly £7,000,000 which are spent yearly on children's allowances in this country.  I see a disparity between those two figures for present increases.  The children's allowances do go to rich and poor alike.  They go to the children of the unemployed man, but they also go into every well-to-do home that cares to apply for them.</P>
    <P>The very principle which the Minister rejected when he decided to abolish the food subsidies&mdash;the principle of subsidising rich and poor alike&mdash;does in fact apply in relation to children's allowances.  I should be out of order if I were to go into the question of whether that is a good or bad thing, but it seems to me, if we take the two Bills side by side, that the sums of money involved ought to be reversed in order of magnitude.  We ought to <Col N="91" /> be able to find for the people concerned in the present Bill nearly three times as much as we have in fact found.  If we did find nearly three times as much, it would be possible for us to raise the amount to at least 27/- and perhaps a little more.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the Dáil&mdash;I think Deputy Corish made the point&mdash;that the increase for children's allowances represented approximately 5/- a week for five children.  That is at column 25 of Volume 162.  The children of rich and poor alike on the average get an extra shilling, excluding of course the first child, under the children's allowances scheme and the poorer children get a further shilling under the head of the present Bill.  I do not want to speak longer, but I want to say, in conclusion, that it ought to be possible and it ought to have been possible&mdash;I now regard it as too late under these two Bills&mdash;to make the differential greater, and to place more emphasis on the very poor and less emphasis upon the necessity to increase children's allowance for rich and poor alike.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I should like to put the plea to the Parliamentary Secretary and, through him, to the Government, that they very seriously consider, in the light of the sort of contentions I have been putting forward, introducing at a very early date a further amending Bill which, in my opinion, will give for the first time something like justice and something like a decent allowance to the poor, the blind, the unemployed, and the widows for whom this Bill is drawn up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the appeals voiced by several previous speakers.  Most of what I should like to say myself has already been said and I will not detain the House with unnecessary repetition.  I want to endorse the view expressed by at least one previous speaker that this matter should not be regarded as an opportunity for anything like political scoring between any of the Parties represented here.  I do not think it is fair for any member of the House to avail of an opportunity of this kind to lambast the present Government or <Col N="92" /> any previous Government for their handling of the matter.</P>
      <P>In practical terms, the question seems to have resolved itself into one of determining precisely what could or should be provided by the State in order to assist, let alone comfort, the most helpless section of the community, for whom the benefits of this Bill are intended.  Up to now, the only answer we have heard is that anything further we could do for them would have to be done at the cost of extra taxation in one form or another.  We have been told repeatedly that taxation seems to have reached the optimum limit in this country.  Many of us will agree with that.  Some of us hold taxation has already exceeded that limit.</P>
      <P>I do not suggest that additional taxation ought lightly to be imposed, even for the purpose of helping the people we want to help in this Bill.  I want to make the point, however, that it ought to be quite possible, within reason, for a Government to secure some economies in administration which would enable something practical to be done for the unfortunate people we are discussing.  In my candid view &mdash;and here I support Senator Murphy &mdash;even if that were not possible, I believe that the people of the country would willingly and gladly consent to carry even a little more taxation, if they could be assured that the proceeds of that additional taxation would be applied for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that, in my view, if there were an instance in which some additional imposts could or should be justified, we have that instance before us now.  Like previous speakers, I am sorry the Government have not taken the opportunity of utilising this Bill to put the position of those unfortunate people on a better level than they have been on for many years past.  Certainly, if we are to be honest, we must recognise that the increases inevitable in the cost of living now, following the removal of the food subsidies, will undoubtedly mean a terrible hardship for this helpless section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I earnestly add my voice to those who have appealed to the Government <Col N="93" /> to look seriously into the plight of those people and consider as soon as possible what can be done in some practical form to help them to meet that position.  I want to be taken as endorsing the appeal made by several speakers along those lines and add my voice to theirs in an appeal to the Government to see what can be done on behalf of this section as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of speaking on this Bill until I heard some of the remarks of the previous speakers. Everybody knows it is right and proper to do everything possible to improve the lot of the weakest sections of the community here, but we have always to bear in mind the general economic position in the country and must cut our cloth according to our measure. This is not a Bill to extend or expand the social services: it is designed merely to compensate the weaker sections for whatever adverse impact the withdrawal of the food subsidies may cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the alleged inconsistency of the Government in continuing the means test in regard to old age pensions <Col N="94" /> and widows' pensions and not having any means test in the case of children's allowances.  I submit there is no comparison between the two, and that in fact there is a fundamental difference.  Children's allowances are not designed merely to improve the economic position of the people concerned but also I take it to encourage and assist large families in the country, be those families rich or poor.  The Senator also did not bear in mind the fact that the well-to-do classes, people earning large incomes, get less allowances from the State in income-tax assessment and in that way they contribute their share indirectly and in an unseen way.  If children's allowances would have the effect of encouraging large families, as well as improving their economic position, I do not think anyone would cavil at that.</P>
    <P>The present Bill goes a long way, almost all the way, towards compensating the section of the community which should claim our attention most. Some of us are inclined to forget that the Government, before ever there was any question of the introduction of this measure, removed the special import levies.  To that extent, they have also come to the relief of all the sections of the community on whom the burden of the import levies fell.  Any fair-minded person should agree that a good deal is being done for the needy sections of the community through the medium of the social services.  After all, we are paying out here for those services something between one-quarter and one-fifth of the calculated expenditure of the State.  That is a large contribution to the needy sections.</P>
    <P>This is not a measure designed to expand the social services.  Its passage to-day in its limited form will not debar us later on, if the economic circumstances of the country justify it, from doing maybe more for this section of the community.  Financial and economic conditions must always be taken into account by those responsible for the guidance of the State.  It is very easy for other people, who have no responsibility for these things and who need not calculate the cost or be <Col N="95" /> concerned about the even and equitable distribution of those moneys, to advocate an increase here and an increase there.  As has been said here and elsewhere, it is one thing to advocate increases and another thing to point out where the money is to be got.</P>

      <P>A small farmer beside me was being congratulated on his potato crop.  He was asked why he did not rotate and he said: &ldquo;How the devil will I rotate when I have not the land to rotate?&rdquo; We would all like to give greater social services if we had the means of doing so.  Senator Murphy spoke about the more Christian approach in Britain and contrasted it with our approach in these matters.  He stopped there.  He did not give us the wages in England; he did not give us the cost of the insurance stamp in England, which is at least twice the cost of the insurance stamp here.  He did not give us the national income per head in England. If we are to go on these lines, we may throw our hats at it.  We are a small country of self-employed people, not organised like organised labour, who are only a minority; a country of small farmers, 74 per cent. of whom live on holdings with valuations of £20 or under and who have to bear the burden of all these social services.  Comparisons are completely wrong in this matter.  There is no compensation for these people when they have to sell their eggs at 1d. apiece, or no compensation for them when they lose the price of a calf when it drops to half, as it did in 1956.  Yet they have to bear the burden of taxation and the whole outcry here, for the past couple of years, was: &ldquo;We are not able to bear this burden of taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for people in the Dáil, or anywhere else, to advocate putting a <Col N="96" /> special tax on something so that we may give better old age pensions.  One does not need to be an economist to know that when one puts a special tax on something, say, cigarettes, their sale falls.  You may get more revenue, but you do not get in the proportionate revenue you expected when you put on the extra taxation.  Consequently, as Senator Kissane said, we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  We went to the cupboard to get a bone, but we found that there was no bone there and we have to make the best of things.  This is a compensatory measure to offset the increase in the cost of living.  It is a rough and ready measure and it is the best we can do in the economic circumstances in which we are placed.  We submitted it to the Seanad in that way.</P>
    <P>I must say that Senator Sheehy Skeffington's contribution was very helpful.  I wish we had, in matters of economics and social services, the approach that we would not compete with one another, but that we would face up to the realities of the situation and see what could be done.  It does not matter a tráinín who is conducting a Social Welfare Bill, or if the Government is changed every six months, if the shilling of the pound you are giving is to be devalued and its intrinsic worth smashed.  Then we are getting nowhere at all.  The advocacy of Senator Sheehy Skeffington, while we may not think exactly alike, is a contribution I appreciate.  He indicated that there should be a sane approach to these subjects and not one of &ldquo;How much will I give them and how much will you give them?&rdquo;&mdash;and when you give it to them, it becomes ashes in their hands and they are not able to purchase anything with it.</P>
    <P>The other points that were raised in this debate will be answered in this way.  On ordinary services, we spend £102,000,000 and we spend approximately £24,000,000 on social services, very nearly one-quarter.  I am not dealing now with health services at all; I am dealing with social services.  We would like to spend more and the only way we can get more is by better production and a better rate for what we do produce, more income, and in that <Col N="97" /> way tax the income to produce more social services.  We have spoken here about the increased cost of bread and butter and there was a deprecation of potatoes.  The potato is not to be deprecated. It is a very good staple form of diet and nobody realised that better than the British in the last war.  They began to realise the value of the potato, and potatoes were the staple form of diet for our people in the bad years.  Dieticians and modern scientists realise that potatoes contain nearly everything necessary to sustain life and that it is a very valuable food. In rural areas, it is part of the staple diet of the community.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which Senator Kissane referred is that the first thing we did when we took up office was to take off the levy on oranges which are used in very poor houses.  There was at least 2d. on every orange.  We took that levy off and that was helpful.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that this Bill is the best we can do in the circumstances. If economic circumstances improve, we will try to improve the lot of the most hard hit section of the community.  We were pioneers in social services in many ways in this country.  We had widow's and orphans' pensions here long before they had them in Britain.  We were abreast of the times in these things, and, judging by the standard of living now of the community, we have done fairly well.  We would like to do better; we have gone a certain way and by united effort, we will go much further.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first rate which is mentioned is 24/-, which is being increased by 1/- a week.  I think we have more or less accepted that the 1/- a week is not full compensation for the <Col N="98" /> change which has taken place.  I was very pleased at the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to the debate because he at least avoided the temptation of saying: &ldquo;And you too&rdquo;, the sort of reaction to &ldquo;What did you do when you sat on the other side of the House?&rdquo;  He indicated that there is to be a sympathetic approach to these benefits, as soon as circumstances permit.  I hope that that approach will be a very quick one and that circumstances will allow an early review of these benefits so that they can be substantially increased.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington, rather unfortunately I thought, somewhat criticised my approach to them.  I say this because the former rate is mentioned in Section 1.  The former rate was set in 1955 when it was increased from 21/6 per week to 24/- as the maximum benefit for the old age pensioner.  I did not think that 24/- per week was enough at that time. There is this essential difference between now and then, that at that time there was an improvement in the benefit, but on this occasion there is not full compensation for the effective cut that has been made in the pension by the removal of the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>I speak from memory in this regard, but I think that at that time my colleague, the former Senator Hickey, said he did not consider the 24/- as sufficient.  It was, however, an improvement. We are now dealing with something which is a cut in the standard of living of the old age pensioners and the other people, and I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has at least said that they will sympathetically approach the problem as soon as circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>There is just one point to which I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  This section deals with the means test for widows.  I think it was the recent Minister for Social Welfare who told us in this House that if you were to abolish the means test for old age pensioners and blind pensioners it would cost something like £2,500,000.  I quote from memory, but I think that was the figure he gave.  While agreeing that it would at present be difficult to do that, I should like to advert to the fact that if the cost of living goes up, then the level at which a means test is applied ought also to change.  In other words, if it is felt, under certain money values, that anybody with £104 15s. of an annual income should not qualify for a pension at all it is obvious that if the value of that £104 15s. drops appreciably in relation to the things it can buy then clearly that should no longer be the maximum amount an applicant could have.  That is to say, the level at which the means test in money terms is applied ought also be changed when it is recognised officially, as it is in this Bill, that the cost of living has gone up.  Therefore, I should have liked to see some modification of the levels at which the means test is applied.  I see on this table&mdash;I think I am right here&mdash;that there is no modification of the old table on which the <Col N="100" /> means test was applied&mdash;that is to say, the sums of money at which certain rates of pension can be drawn by these widows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I should like to point out that there were several revisions of the means test as to income, and it was raised.  The last time it was raised was the 1952 Act.  I do not know the Minister's mind in regard to this matter and I, therefore, cannot anticipate what his view is in this regard. I should like to point out that there is a tendency for the non-contributory widows' pensions to vanish altogether and to be replaced by contributory pensions.  Under the 1952 Act, there is nothing to prevent a wage-earner who goes out of the insurable class&mdash; and there are several of them who have done so&mdash;becoming voluntary contributors, so that, if his wife survives, she qualifies for a contributory pension.  It would be well if that were known better.  There are other social benefits accruing to them, too.</P>

      <P>As Senators are aware, there is a separate code of legislation in respect of children's allowances. That explains the necessity for this Bill which, by means of increases in those allowances, provides compensation to families of two or more children for the increase in prices which has resulted from the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of this Bill, an additional 4/6 per month with effect from the 1st June will be payable for the second and each subsequent child eligible for children's allowances.  For May, an additional payment of 2/6 for each such child will be made as an offset to the rise in prices in that month. The first payment of the increased allowances will be made on 2nd July on which date the arrears in respect of May and June will also be paid.</P>
      <P>These increases in children's allowances will benefit 225,000 families and will be paid in respect of 586,000 children. Total expenditure on children's allowances as from 2nd July next will be just under £7,000,000 per annum which is a large sum in relation to our total expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to cover all the ground we covered on the last Bill because, in effect, the purpose of this Bill is similar, namely, an attempt to give some compensation for the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  I do notice that the compensation which is being made here is fractionally less stingy than that in the previous Bill. Here we have an improvement of 4/6 a month, which amounts in my calculation to £2 14s. per annum, and, under the last Bill, we had 1/- a week, which amounts to £2 12s.  It may be said that these small amounts are a bit ridiculous, but they are not ridiculous to the people in receipt of them.  However, I welcome the fact that, as the food subsidies have been withdrawn in this instance, the compensation has been made to those in receipt of children's allowances.</P>

      <P>In replying to a point I made about children's <Col N="102" /> allowances on the previous Bill, Senator Kissane made the point that the main purpose of children's allowances was to encourage large families. I do not think that the £1,500,000 asked for under this Bill as opposed to the £600,000 asked for under the previous Bill has anything to do with the desire to increase the size of families.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us explicitly that the purpose of this Bill is to give compensation for the rise in the price of bread and butter to large families, and I should like to hear his view on my submission that we are voting from a given sum too much for this Bill and too little for the previous Bill&mdash;that we are overcompensating the children of all families, rich and poor alike, who come under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The number of children, I think, was calculated in the Dáil as over 500,000, and we are overcompensating these children, relatively speaking, and undercompensating the beneficiaries under the previous Bill.  To put it in the form of a question, would it not have been better to grant £1,500,000 to the old age pensioners, the unemployed and their dependents, and the blind pensioners, and £500,000 or £600,000, to the children of all classes, in these circumstances, since the object of this Bill is specifically to compensate children, rich and poor, for the rise in the price of bread and butter?</P>

      <P>It is a very debatable point that Senator Sheehy Skeffington has put before me and I would want to sleep for a few nights on it and give my views then.  What strikes me immediately is this: I would say that the consumption of food is greater where there are a lot of children than where there are old people, and the demand for allowances, and for liberality under <Col N="103" /> the social services, would be greater. Then, there is the second point which dovetails into that, that there is no discrimination between the children of the rich and the poor.  It is an avenue I do not like to travel up at the moment.  I will give it consideration, and if I am honoured to come before the Seanad again in connection with social welfare, I might have an answer for Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I do not want to be impolite to him.  He put me a six marker there and I am not able to answer it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the situation, but I do so under protest.  It is quite true that the Cathaoirleach ordered this matter for the Adjournment, but it is also true that he informed me that the Minister had agreed to be present.  I do understand, of course, that it might conceivably be that the Minister thought it would not come until 9.30 p.m., and thought he would not have to be present until then.  But we have just been told by Senator Kissane that the Minister will not be available at all to-day.  That does not seem to fit in with what had been my previous impression.  I am prepared, however, under protest, to raise this matter in the absence of the Minister.  I do not intend to be long, but I should prefer to raise this matter, even though nobody of ministerial rank is present, or no representative of the Government is present, in the hope that Senator Kissane or somebody sitting on the Government Benches might be prepared to offer a view on the matter.</P>
      <P>The matter I have asked permission, and have been granted permission, to raise is as follows: To draw the attention of the Minister for Education to the widespread public concern over the fact that the children attending the Church of Ireland National School at Fethard-on-Sea have been deprived of regular teaching in their school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, the case is quite an exceptional case.  That is a point I should like to make at the outset.  It is quite exceptional, but I think it is important, because an important issue is involved. I raise the matter because it is rare, and also because I want this kind of case to remain rare in this country.  I believe that the majority of our people, Protestant and Catholic alike, feel ashamed when this kind of boycott of a school takes place.  We have in this country, I am glad to say, a very stout tradition of good neighbourliness.  It applies not only in the big towns but throughout the countryside.  I am certain that it exists and exists strongly in County Wexford to-day, if it is allowed to show itself.  I think it <Col N="106" /> was an excellent example of this spirit of co-operation and friendliness on both sides which allowed, in the first place, a Catholic teacher to be the teacher in a Church of Ireland National School.</P>
    <P>The facts of the case have been in the Press for some weeks now.  I quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 3rd June this year under the heading: &ldquo;Villagers Feel the Pinch of Boycott. School still Without Teacher.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Church of Ireland National School closed on May 15th, when its Catholic teacher was advised by a number of Catholic women in the village not to give any more lessons.  The 11 children on the rolls have not been to school since, as the position had not been filled, although it has been advertised.&rdquo;  At the end of the account, a local person involved, Mr. Cloney, is quoted as &ldquo;adding that he did not believe that the local Protestant traders connived in any way&rdquo; at the circumstances which gave rise to this particular boycott.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with the commercial boycott, although I regard it in this case as equivalent to conviction and sentence without trial.  What concerns me is the matter I have asked leave to raise here; and I hope, even though he be absent, that it concerns the Minister also.  It is the simple fact that 11 small children are being deprived&mdash;I think I might use the word victimised&mdash;in relation to the educational facilities and the opportunities for education afforded to them at a most critical age, and at a most critical time of the year.  I say quite sincerely that I feel the Minister must be concerned about that.  I know that the public is concerned, and I want to ask the Minister, through the leader of the House, what action he has found it possible to take, what action he proposes, and what is his general view of the present situation in this school?</P>
    <P>Should the children walk to a distant school or, if they do not, will they be prosecuted under the School Attendance Act for failure to attend the school?  I should like the Minister's answer to that question.  That is one of the questions for which I should have appreciated his presence, so that he might tell us himself whether or not <Col N="107" /> the failure of these children to attend some distant national school, when their own school no longer offers them teaching, would be regarded as a reason for prosecuting them under the School Attendance Act?</P>
    <P>Linked with that question, I should like to ask does the Department intend, and will it take any steps, to supply transport for these children to enable them to get to some other school?  Has the Minister taken any other steps?  Does he envisage any other steps?  Has any approach been made by his inspectors or by his officials to any responsible and influential local people who might be capable of ending what appears to be a most unfortunate deadlock in relation to this small school?</P>
    <P>My information is that the teacher in question was not merely an exceptionally competent teacher, but one who was extremely well liked by her small class.  I regard the breaking up of this relationship, this happy relationship, on account of circumstances entirely beyond the responsibility or control of these children, as a most heartbreaking and lamentable thing.  I deplore it, and, in saying that, I am convinced that most Irish men and women deplore it also.</P>
    <P>Whatever the issues involved, in my submission, they are obviously entirely extraneous to the schooling of these young children.  I hope&mdash;and it is in that hope that I raise the matter&mdash;that these children will no longer be sacrificed in these circumstances, in relation to the education which I hold to be their due.  It is not my purpose to speak at length, nor is it my purpose to arouse animosity of any kind.  It is obvious that were I to go outside the terms in which I raise this matter, there might be big controversial issues which it might be well worth discussing elsewhere, but which it is not my purpose to raise now.</P>
    <P>My purpose in raising this matter in this House has been twofold: one, to voice what I believe to be a majority view in this country, the tolerant majority view, that schoolchildren <Col N="108" /> deprived of their schooling in this case are innocent victims who deserve a strong expression of public sympathy, and secondly to give the Minister an opportunity to state his views and his intentions with relation to this particular school which falls under his jurisdiction as Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>If I may, I should like to associate myself briefly with Senator Skeffington's remarks. First, I should like to protest as strongly as I can against a tendency, which I think is growing, to discourage the raising of certain kinds of questions on the Adjournment.  It is a most useful instrument, as we know &mdash;this privilege of raising a matter on the Adjournment.  In this House, we have not the right of asking questions of Ministers: the only way we can bring a Minister to the House speedily and sound his views is by putting down a matter for discussion on the Adjournment.  It is a weightier way of testing a Minister than a question in the Dáil.  That seems to be all the more reason why this instrument of good Government should not be blunted by ministerial or departmental abstentions&mdash;I am even inclined to say, evasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept that, Sir.  I would appeal to the House as a whole to watch and cherish motions on the Adjournment.  If we neglect them, we will lose prestige; civil liberties will suffer; and eventually harm will be done to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter before us is mainly a local one, but, as Senator Skeffington has pointed out, it does impinge on the policy of the central Government.  That is why we hoped to have the Minister here this evening.  It also is a matter which may do grave harm to the good name of the country at home and abroad.  In other words, it is the kind of matter to which the Upper House <Col N="109" /> of the Oireachtas needs to give the most careful attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, at the outset, that, in my opinion, the Department of Education has always shown an admirable example of even-handed justice&mdash; I would even say, of generosity&mdash;in its treatment of the religious minorities. That is not my own opinion merely: it is the opinion of many leaders of the religious minorities.  I had hoped to be able to say that to the Minister himself.  In his absence, I would urge on him that now he, a new occupant of the post, has an opportunity to show very clearly that the Department remains true to that policy of even-handed justice in every way and of going even further to help the religious minorities when they were in difficulties.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will do all in his power&mdash;and that the Department will do all in its power&mdash;to meet this emergency.  By acting wisely and justly in this matter, they will effectively mitigate the unpleasantness of the whole situation.  They will not have to make any pronouncement; they will not have to take up any major stand of policy in the matter; but by quietly coping with the emergency in a fair and generous way, they will implicitly remove much of the unpleasantness.  I should like to go further.  I hope that the members of this House and that Irish men and women of goodwill throughout the country will join in discouraging sectarian animosity of this kind.</P>

      <Col N="110" /> The notice which was given to raise this matter was very short and in fact, as you yourself will remember, Sir, it was proposed to raise the matter on the Adjournment of the Seanad tonight. I do not think any of us expected that the matter would come up for discussion so soon.  In any event, I think it was very unwise, if not impolite, on the part of Senator Stanford to say that there is any evasion of the issue here.  There is no evasion and, indeed, we are at a loss to know what the issue is.  That is the question.  There is no issue as far as we are concerned here.</P>
    <P>This is entirely a local matter, a local dispute which has arisen and which has aroused a certain amount of public attention.  I do not think it could be said that the policy of the Department of Education is involved in this matter at all.  It could not be. In the first place, the appointment and retention of a teacher in a school is a matter solely for the local manager. That is a well known and well established fact.  The question of religion, or so-called religious bigotry, does not enter into it, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>Here was a case of a one-teacher school with 11 pupils where the teacher herself decided to give up teaching.  There was nothing the Minister for Education could do about that.  He could not go down or get his representative to go down, and compel this teacher to stay in the school.  All that could be done in the case was for the local manager, or the acting manager, as he is, to do his best to get another teacher and the acting manager has been doing that.  As soon as he succeeds in getting a qualified, or even an unqualified, teacher to resume the teaching of these 11 pupils, that will be sanctioned by the Minister for Education.  When that is the position, I do not see how the policy of the Department comes into the matter at all, or what the Minister's functions in it are, except the overriding function that he has in all these cases, to make sure that the departmental regulations, regarding such things as the teaching of the appropriate subjects, are fulfilled. That is the one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question of alternative facilities for these children is one that can be considered, and of course any recommendations that the manager, or the acting manager, would put forward to the Minister for Education would be sympathetically considered. <Col N="112" /> That is all I have to say on the matter, a Chathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>Before the House adjourns, I want to say that, as far as the Chair is concerned, there is no question whatever of any attempt being made to curb the rights of Senators to raise any matters that fall within Standing Orders of the House and being of a kind that may properly be raised on the Adjournment.  I also want to remind the House that Standing Orders do not provide that a Minister must attend any time the Seanad calls on him.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.15 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
