      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm the Provisional Order set out in the Schedule, i.e., the Wicklow County (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1957, which was made by my predecessor on 13th February last and which proposes the inclusion in County Wicklow of 78 acres of land at present in County Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Bray Urban District Council intend to make an application to the Wicklow County Council to include this area in the Bray urban district. The estimated population of the transferred area is about 600 and the valuation about £1,850.  There are at present 130 houses belonging to the Bray Urban District Council and 12 private holdings in the area.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, i.e. Section 10 of the Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1936, an urban district council which is not a borough may at any time apply to the council of the county in which it is situate for an order under the section altering the boundary of the urban district in the manner specified in the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To enable the urban council to initiate their application to the Wicklow County Council, it is necessary first to bring the land in question into Wicklow County.  The step of transferring the land from the Wicklow <Col N="114" /> County Health District to the Bray Urban District Council under Section 10 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1936, will be a separate matter and will involve the usual procedure of discussion between the county council and the urban district council, advertisement, right of aggrieved parties to make their objections to me, and so on.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the present Provisional Order was fully discussed at a public inquiry.  Dublin County Council was represented at that inquiry and raised no objection other than matters relating to the ownership of water pipes and consequential financial adjustments.  The Provisional Order does not affect local authority property rights in the area and financial adjustments are outside the scope of the Order.  Those adjustments will be made subsequently under the provisions of the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, either by agreement or by arbitration.</P>
    <P>The Provisional Order contains the usual provisions in relation to the preparation of maps, the continuance in effect in the added area of resolutions, orders and notices of the Dublin County Council which are not inconsistent with the terms of the Provisional Order, arrangements regarding jurors, areas of jurisdiction of coroners, valuation lists, registration of electors and saving from disqualification of members of the Dublin County Council who, by reason of the transfer of the area, may cease to be local government electors for that county.</P>

      <P>I take it this Bill is merely a routine measure to which nobody can take exception, but there are some consequential facts arising from it about which I should like to have my mind clear.  The Minister has told us it will affect some 600 people who will be transformed overnight, I take it, from Dublin men into Wicklow men.  Apart from the public inquiry, I should like to know whether they have been consulted?  Has there been, as happens in the case of changing the name of a street, a plebiscite, or any direct consultation with the <Col N="115" /> 600 people?  Am I correct in assuming that, if under the Health Act, one of these people applies to the local health authority to be hospitalised, where as now he or she would have the right to be hospitalised in a Dublin hospital, henceforth he or she will have to go to a County Wicklow hospital, either in Wicklow town or Arklow?  That would seem to me to be a practical change which might involve a certain amount of hardship in certain circumstances.  In order to be satisfied on that point and satisfied that these people have been consulted in the full sense of the expression, I should like to put those questions to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The 600 people it is proposed to transfer are, of course, County Wicklow people.  They were transferred from Bray into this area of 78 acres that had been acquired for building purposes by Bray Urban District Council.  These houses were provided, I think, back in 1949-1950 and it was the intention of the Bray Urban District Council at the time to seek what is being sought now, but it was not possible to make any move in that direction because of the existing state of the law in relation to the public assistance districts.  Under the Local Government (Amendment) Act of 1955, permission was given to change these public assistance areas and after the passage of that Act it was possible to put in motion the machinery necessary to make the transfer of these 78 acres to Wicklow County Council, because that is the first step in the course of the transfer to the Bray Urban District Council area.</P>
      <P>I do not think the people are being affected adversely in any way.  As a matter of fact, their position in a certain way will be improved.  Those of them who may be in receipt of unemployment assistance will benefit as a result of being taken out of a rural area and put into an urban area.  It is not a very substantial matter, but whatever it is, the advantages are on their side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of hospitalisation, there were only 12 original holders in <Col N="116" /> the area who could be said to be Dublin people&mdash;I do not know if the position would be worsened from a medical, surgical or other point of view because of their being transferred into County Wicklow.  I would hardly think it would make much difference. It is not a point about which I am briefed, but, applying my own reason, I do not believe there will be any trouble.  I do not think there was any hostility to the making of the Order. Dublin County Council were represented at the inquiry and they were only concerned with a few trivial matters.  That was so because of the fact that originally it was known that it was intended to have the area transferred and indeed it would have been done long ago if it were not for the existing state of the law.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages to-day.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been urged by house builders for some time past that the statutory definition of market value contained in paragraph (a), Section 32 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, does not permit of an adequate market value being assessed for new houses, having regard to current costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Builders have contended that market value should include all such factors as profit, cost of developing the site, of constructing roads, footpaths and sewers, of providing watermains and public lighting, and of carrying out all additional works required from time to time by local authorities; all fees, expenses and overheads and the acquisition of the site on which the house is built or to be built.  It has further been contended that there <Col N="118" /> should be some form of appeal against the decision of a local authority in the assessment of market value.</P>
    <P>These representations were considered by the previous Government and on 24th December, 1956, local authorities were informed that legislation would be introduced to amend the definition of market value on the lines of the definition in Section 1 of the Bill.  Local authorities were requested to operate the Acts in accordance with the revised definition proposed and it was indicated that legislation would validate any action on these lines taken in anticipation of the enactment of this Bill.  The Bill does not propose any amendment of the law governing the proportion of market value which may be advanced.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill is designed to enable all the normal costs and charges falling on an individual building or buying a new house, including the value of his interest in the site, to be included by the local authority in its assessment of market value.</P>
    <P>The same section gives effect to the undertaking to validate any determinations of market value made since 24th December, 1956, on the revised basis.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that an appeal to the Commissioners of Valuation may be made by a person who contends that the local authority might properly have indicated a greater amount by way of market value.  The opinion of the commissioner on the market value of a house would not commit the local authority to making any advance or to making a particular amount of advance in any individual case.</P>
    <P>The person applying to the Commissioner of Valuation would pay a fee prescribed by regulations to be made by the Minister for Finance.  These regulations will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with sub-section (7) of Section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it proposes to make easier the granting of loans by local authorities and a quickening of the housing drive. We are all aware that, unfortunately, <Col N="119" /> there has been a lot of unemployment in the building trades and I hope this Bill, when enacted, will give some little help in dealing with that unemployment.</P>
      <P>I am puzzled, however, as to the purpose of Section 2.  I listened very carefully to the Minister and I am still not very clear as to the usefulness of that section.  It provides that where a person is dissatisfied as to the amount of loan which may be granted, he may appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, but we find that the decision of that commissioner in no way affects the discretion of the local authority in deciding what loan should be granted. When I saw that first, I thought it unusual that some outside body should determine what loan would be made by the local authority.  In fact, that is not the case because the discretion, as provided in the Bill and as the Minister said, is still left with the local authority.  I have no objection to that discretion being left with the local authority, but it still leaves me puzzled as to what the purpose of the section is.</P>
      <P>Another question on that is whether it will involve additional expenditure. If a person is dissatisfied with the assessment made by the local authority, he then appeals to the commissioners and the fee is to be prescribed. Will that fee cover all the costs involved in the making of that investigation or assessment?  If so, I suppose that is not too bad; but I do not see how the individual aggrieved is any better off.  He has to pay for the investigation and again the local authority is under no obligation to improve on its former decision as to what loan will be granted.  I hope the Minister in his reply will try to explain to me the reason for Section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister just one question.  Nobody could object to the Minister's statement. Possibly he may not be able to answer my question.  I noticed in the tables circulated with the Budget that an extra provision of £2,000,000 is being made for housing this year.  I should be interested to know how much <Col N="120" /> of it is for Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act housing.  If the Minister has not the figures with him, perhaps we might hear them some other day.  It has some bearing on this Bill.  I take it that the actual provisions of the Bill will not make a big difference, but I should like to know what part of the extra £2,000,000 for housing will come into the category of Small Dwelling (Acquisition) Act housing, that is to say, houses which will pay for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one section to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks, sub-section (2) of Section 1.  I am a new member of the House and I do not know if there is any precedent for a section like that which provides that the Government may send out a notice to a local authority saying: &ldquo;Do this and we will make it all right later on.&rdquo;  I should like to know if there is any precedent for such an Order and if the House approves of it.</P>
      <P>The only other question I should like to raise is in connection with sub-section (2) of Section 2 which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an amount has been indicated to a person by a local authority under paragraph (a) of Section 32 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, (No. 25 of 1950), as amended by Section 1 of this Act, and that person contends that a greater amount might properly have been indicated, that person may, on payment of the prescribed fee, submit his contention for consideration by the commissioner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Would it not be possible also to allow other people, apart from that person, to appeal?  For instance, supposing members of a county council thought that too much was being allowed&mdash;if they were able to find out &mdash;would you not allow them to appeal also and, to a certain extent, bring the matter more in public view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this Bill has been introduced because it will help those people building houses under the Small Dwellings Act to acquire homes of their own.  Considerable difficulty and hardship has been <Col N="121" /> caused by reason of the interpretation of the section which this Bill is attempting to clear up.  I notice from the Dáil Reports that some new arrangements have been made with regard to loans under the Small Dwellings Act.  I wonder would I be in order in inquiring from the Minister whether some of the restrictions which were imposed last year on local authorities have been raised?</P>
      <P>One of the restrictions was that only those entitled to supplementary grants from local authorities would be entitled to get loans under the Small Dwellings Act.  At that stage, the limit for the granting of supplementary grants from the local authority was £620.  I understand the position now to be that Small Dwellings Act grants will be available to people with incomes up to £830 approximately.  That would be an advantage to people in the category of £600 to £830, who were debarred up to now from obtaining Small Dwellings Act loans.</P>
      <P>There was, both in the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, a further restriction on the granting of loans under the Small Dwellings Act.  That was that the purchase price of the house must not exceed, I think, £2,000.  In a number of cases, houses have already been built which cost more than £2,000, and it would be a hardship, both on the builder and on the prospective buyer who wants to acquire that type of house, if they were unable to obtain a loan under the Small Dwellings Act.  I wonder if the Minister could say whether that restriction in the maximum price of houses has been or will be lifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This extension of the Small Dwellings Act code should commend itself to the Seanad.  It is important to remember that the code itself, enshrining as it does the principle of helping those people who want to help themselves, is a very important code. In that connection, the Minister deserves credit for his recent announcement in regard to valuations and incomes.  Loans are now available to farmers under £50 valuation and to income earners under £830 per year. Last year, in a time of financial <Col N="122" /> stringency, limits of £35 in regard to valuation and £620 in regard to income unfortunately had to be imposed. The result was a considerable curtailment in advances under the Small Dwellings Acts code, the reason being that people under those limits, particularly those under £630 a year, were people who would not be availing of Small Dwellings Act facilities in any event.  Local authorities also had the experience that many people who did apply under that £600 limit were people who would be, to put it bluntly, not a good risk.</P>
      <P>This recommended extension to £830 and £50 valuation brings in people who would be a good risk, so far as the local authority is concerned.  In that respect&mdash;this might not be the place to raise it&mdash;I would point out that local authorities, prior to the restrictions imposed last year, were actually making a good profit out of the loans advanced under this scheme.  Secondly, I think the Minister also deserves congratulations for falling in with the suggestion made by the master builders that the definition of market value be extended and made more flexible.  It is now also possible for a person to get credit for the interest he may have in the site on which the house my be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Senator Murphy is probably a good one.  In Section 2, we have this question of limiting the right of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuations, which, however, is not made mandatory on the local authority. In the Lower House, the Minister quite rightly said that, as the local authority was paying the bill, it should be entitled to have the final say on whatever loan would be advanced.  It seems to be fruitless that you should have provision for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation that will not be mandatory.  While I would agree with the Minister and with people who advocate that the local authority should have a say in what loan is being advanced, if that view is correct, I fail to see the reason for the section at all.  The matter may be approached in either of two logical ways.  On one hand, have an appeal which is mandatory or, on the other, <Col N="123" /> have no appeal at all.  I think the section as it stands will not be availed of. It is a dead section.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that the Minister has announced these extensions of the limits under which advances will be made.  That is an important thing and partly answers the point made by Senator O'Donovan as to what is going to be done with these moneys.  The very fact that the limits have been raised to £50 and £800 will ensure that the greater portion of the moneys devoted to housing will go to people seeking loans under this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome this Bill and the Minister is to be congratulated for changing the red light to the green light for local public bodies once more in order to solve the housing problem.  To my mind, however, this problem of valuations between the builder and the local authorities is a question that concerns Dublin City and suburban districts, and possibly to a certain extent Cork City and suburbs, whereas it will not affect the provincial towns such as the one I come from. I do suggest that the Minister will be well advised to tread warily in regard to this question of allowing building organisations to have such a strong voice in the question of valuations.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this matter under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, we have always treated the applicants fairly.  We never had any difficulties about the amount allowed, and if we did have a slight difference, we were always able to come to amicable arrangements between ourselves.  Why there should be so much question about this in the City of Dublin is beyond me. Our policy has been to take a district with so many acres of land on which to accommodate so many houses and we leave space at one side for houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  When we finish building, we advertise that site and invite tenants. We have been able so far to fill all those sites.  We are at present undertaking a similar scheme and our policy will be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the provincial towns such as Wexford, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, <Col N="124" /> Clonmel and other such towns were to act on that policy, it would be a great saving to the local authority and would obviate a good deal of arbitration about what is a fair valuation.  We give the site after it has been fully developed; we install services such as water, sewerage, gas, and so on; and we build roads.  We put a charge upon those developments and services.  We say to a purchaser: &ldquo;That is yours&rdquo;, and he selects a site and pays us or in cases where it is necessary, a charge is deducted from the loan so that it is not hard upon him in any way.  In so far as the provincial towns are concerned, I do not anticipate the slightest trouble in administration.  I again congratulate the Minister for getting us on the way once more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter mentioned by Senator Murphy was this question of the right of appeal.  I do see the point he has made and it was made also in the Dáil.  I think, too, that it has been sufficiently met there and the Senator in what he has said here admits the right of the local authority finally to determine matters of this nature.  It does appear, all the same, somewhat strange that in Section 1 we provide for the inclusion of a number of matters on which there was apparently some doubt when the local authorities are determining the valuation of the house.</P>
      <P>I am told that the need for Section 2 arises in this way.  It may arise in a number of ways but it serves a purpose in this way perhaps more than in any other.  A builder is developing a site on which to build 50 or 60 houses.  He has all his plans ready, but not a stone has been laid upon a stone.  He wants to get some idea of what these houses will be valued at, when erected.  He wants to be able to tell me, as a potential purchaser, what a house is likely to cost.  He gets a valuation in respect of a house and when the scheme is developed he may not be satisfied with that sample valuation. He can go back and appeal in the manner set out here in Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not anticipate wrangling between the builder and the local authority, but it would be useful in a case like that to have the right of <Col N="125" /> appeal to the Valuation Office in order to get what the builder might think was a more proper determination of the actual valuation of the house. While conceding that and making provision for it in Section 2, I still contend, and in fact so did the people interested in the amount proposed here, that the local authority should have the final say.  I do not think the local authority would be anxious to have any wrangling about these matters, but misunderstandings might arise in the manner I have described.</P>
    <P>Another point which was raised by Senator Cole was in regard to the right of others, as well as the builder, to appeal to the commissioners.  Such right is provided for.  The county manager, as far as I can understand, may appeal.  Any private citizen may appeal and there is no hindrance as to the type of interest that may appeal against undervaluation or overvaluation. Senator Cole also mentioned the point that we were providing here for legal coverage for a letter which issued as far back as November, 1956, indicating to local bodies that, while the law was not at the moment as we were proposing to make it, they could operate as if the law at the moment were actually what we were proposing and we would give coverage in that situation. It may not be the most desirable thing, but it is not an unusual thing.  I remember another occasion when on the expiration of a Housing Act on 31st March a new Bill had not been passed and the provisions of the expiring Act ran on until the following July or August.  In that case, even though the provisions of the new Bill might be somewhat different, nobody was allowed to suffer and nobody was penalised.  All those who were building houses got the benefit of any provisions contained in the Act which expired on 31st March up to the time the new Bill became law.  Such provisions were applicable in all cases.  There is, therefore, nothing unusual.  Indeed, not only does that apply in the case of housing, but it also applies in a number of other matters.  It may not be altogether desirable, but it is the practice that has been in operation.</P>
    <P>I was asked how much money was available out of the provision in the <Col N="126" /> Estimate for the Small Dwellings Acts.  Out of the £2,000,000 provided in the Estimate, only £200,000 would have been available for operations under the Small Dwellings Acts.  If we were to confine ourselves to that figure, we would not get very far in the provision of loans to those people all over the country who might wish to build or purchase houses.  As a result of a permission given to me by the Government recently, there is now no limit in that regard and moneys are available under the Small Dwellings Acts from the Local Loans Fund to the full extent of the public demand.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley referred to the price limits set by some local bodies.  I think that applied mostly in Dublin, where a price limit of £2,000 was set. Beyond that, no loan would be given. That decision caused a great deal of dislocation.  Not only did it cause dislocation, but it resulted in a great deal of injustice over the past 12 months or so.  It was clamped down upon the builders without notice or warning.  Some builders were building houses the sale price of which was £2,150, £2,200 or £2,300.  The houses were in course of erection when the decision to revise the price limit was taken.  In so far as builders were affected by that decision and in so far as prospective purchasers were affected, where they can be located, I have been trying to have this position met by the local authority concerned and ultimately there will not be many who will not be covered.  Whatever injustice was done as a result of that decision will, we hope, be rectified.</P>
    <P>We have not the right to say to a local authority what ceiling they will fix.  I understand there is no price ceiling in Dublin City.  There is a price ceiling in County Dublin and the matter has recently been discussed by the Dublin County Council.  I am informed that they have confirmed that price ceiling.  It is not for me to express an opinion as to whether or not that is wise.  They have the right to make the decision and they have the right to fix that ceiling, irrespective of whether or not it is wise, or whether or not I like it.  It has been done following consideration and discussion by that body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question and the Minister said it was not relevant to the Bill.  Of course, it is relevant.  The question is: What part of the extra £2,000,000 which is being made available in the coming year from the Local Loans Fund will be made available for Small Dwellings Act housing?  I said that if the Minister did not have the information offhand, that was all right.  The Minister replied that in the conditions which existed until this Bill was introduced, a sum of only £200,000 was available.  I cannot believe that the Minister understood the question since he answered it in that fashion.</P>
      <P>Last year, Dublin County Council alone got something in the region of £1,500,000 for Small Dwellings Act houses.  Therefore, the Minister's answer was not relevant to my question, whatever else it may have been relevant to.  The Government in the tables issued with the Budget indicated that they were making available an additional sum of £2,000,000 from the Local Loans Fund this year.  I was anxious to know how much of that would be available for Small Dwellings Act houses.  I was hoping that the greater part of it would be available. There is no use in saying that, until this Bill was introduced, something in the region of £200,000 was the sum available for such houses in the current financial year.  If the Minister has not the information, I have, as I say, no objection to his not being able to give it to me now.  I can get it another day.</P>

      <P>No.  This is a Bill dealing with Small Dwellings Act <Col N="128" /> housing.  I have no doubt the Minister has the fullest information.  The procedure is that the figures are made out in a certain way.  The Minister says that the &ldquo;lid is now off&rdquo;, so to speak.  It may well be that the whole £2,000,000 will go to Small Dwellings Act housing.  If that is so, so much the better, but that is an additional sum of £2,000,000.  It is not a sum like the £200,000, I hope, in either respect; that is to say, in either the amount that was going to be made available before these additional moneys were made available or the amount that is made available in addition now.  I sincerely hope the amount of money made available additionally will not be anything like the £200,000, any more than that small sum of £200,000 is the total sum until this Bill becomes law.  I do not believe either of those statements is, in fact, correct.</P>

      <P>Something in the region of £750,000 has been made available to Dublin County Council over the past nine or ten months.  I think it may be a little more, over the £1,000,000, but certainly £200,000 is a very small amount.  It is closer to £1,000,000.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the statement made by the Minister in regard to the ceiling, I think I understood from him that this ceiling would be maintained in regard to the two local authorities, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  My understanding of the position is that this ceiling was first imposed last year when there was a shortage of money for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and at that time the ceiling was introduced as a result of some conditions which were fixed either by the Minister for Local Government or by the Minister for Finance in making money available to the local authorities out of the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem that if the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Local Government&mdash;whoever is the appropriate authority in that regard&mdash;were to change these conditions, local authorities would be free to issue loans to people irrespective of the <Col N="129" /> price of the houses.  I would ask the Minister if that is not the position.  If it is the position, then he ought to use his powers to ensure that the ceiling at least will be raised from £2,000 to something nearer to what would be the ordinary cost of a three-bed-roomed house in or around the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no recollection of saying in reply to Senator O'Donovan that it was as a result of the introduction of this measure that new moneys were being made available to local bodies and private persons.  I made no such statement as that.  I simply said what I am going to repeat now, that my Estimate provided a sum of money for housing purposes and that when commitments already entered into in so far as operations under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts were concerned were met, the amount available to me and to my Department for the Twenty-Six Counties was £200,000.  I made the further statement, which had no relation to this Bill at all, and would not have been made by me if I had not been asked the question, that, as a result of the permission given to me by the Government, I was able to inform local authorities that access to the Local Loans Fund could be resorted to by them to whatever extent, within the limits prescribed, that is, the limits of valuation and earning capacity, the public demand warranted.  These statements, as I say, are statements of fact, as far as I know.  They have not been made to confuse anybody and would not have been made at all, if it had not been for the fact that I was asked for information on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just beating around the bush.  My question is a perfectly straightforward question. The Government produced a White Paper in connection with the Budget saying they were making £2,000,000 additional available.  I do not want to trap the Minister at all; I was just interested in knowing how much of that was money in respect of Small Dwellings Acquisition Act housing. Somebody made up the increases.  You <Col N="130" /> make them up by addition, by adding things together.</P>

      <P>It has nothing to do with anticipation.  You add certain figures, making loans to provide small amounts for building things like vocational schools and another small amount for dispensary houses for doctors, and so on.  I will answer the question myself, or make a shot at it. I would not guarantee that it will be the same answer as would come from the Minister.  The previous Government, despite the restriction on money, set no limitation whatsoever in relation to moneys made available for slum clearance housing.  Therefore, I take it that the slum clearance housing has been conducted to the maximum capacity of the building industry.  I take it that if the present Government continued that policy, the same amount of money as last year is made available this year, and if there is not very much increase, though there might be some, for the building of vocational schools &mdash;a few of them were held up last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am attempting to indicate that my own question was one that could have been answered quite easily, if the Minister wished to answer it.  If he said that he did not propose to answer it, I would not have minded too much, but he made two separate statements which had no relevance whatever to my question.  I take it that the Government, if they want to make these additional moneys available, are making them available for Small Dwelling Act housing, that is, the bulk of them.  That, I believe, is the position.  I think it is perfectly relevant to the Bill what amount of money the Government have in mind. Of course, they have a certain amount of money in mind.  We all know the way in which the Budget is prepared. I am quite satisfied that the bulk of the money is the extra £2,000,000, but I <Col N="131" /> just wanted that confirmed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had much experience of this House, but whatever experience I have had of it, I never felt that it was a place in which extravagant language was used.  I did not think that it was relevant to discuss local authority housing under this Bill, but if the Senator persists in asking me a further question, I want to say that since I came in here as Minister, I have sanctioned local authority proposals to the extent of £2,000,000 that were held up since last July&mdash; £1,500,000 for housing work that was lying in the Department and for which tenders had been invited and so on, and almost a similar amount for water and sewerage.</P>
      <P>There is no use in Senator O'Donovan, as I say, talking extravagantly here about these things.  It is not my business to regulate order, and I am sure that the Cathaoirleach is sympathetic to everybody, even when a little outside the bounds of order.  I did not expect that we were to have a discussion on the whole field of housing on this simple measure.  Even if I were asked what amount of money is likely to be necessary to meet the small dwellings operations in the coming year, I could not answer that, but what is the need for me to answer, seeing that I have been, by a Government decision, put in a position to say to local authorities that whatever the public demand indicates is necessary will be provided for them through the Local Loans Fund?  Is that not all I could be expected to say?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained to me the purpose of Section 2, and I got the impression that there were three individuals who could appeal under the section, namely, the purchaser of the house, the builder or the county manager.  I think we can cancel out the third person because, <Col N="132" /> of course, an appeal lies only where a person thinks the amount allowed for a loan should be higher or greater.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see that the builder would like to know what loan might be available on the house he plans to build so that he could hope for a purchaser.  I have not the original 1950 Act, but I wonder would the Minister say if the builder as such would be described as &ldquo;a person&rdquo;.  It says in sub-section (2) of the section: &ldquo;Where an amount has been indicated to a person...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&ldquo;In the case of a house occupied or to be occupied for the first time, the amount which, in the opinion of the local authority, represents the reasonable cost of building the house, including so much, if any, of the legal and other expenses incidental thereto or to the acquisition of the tenement upon which the house is built or to be built, as the local authority may consider proper, but not including any fine, premium or other consideration for the acquisition of the leasehold interest in such tenement.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are amending only Section 32, and it is necessary to refer to other sections for that.  Section 33, I am informed, provides that the builder may apply for an indication of the market value.  I was also asked <Col N="133" /> questions like that in the other House and they were really covered by other sections of the 1950 Act.  In this Bill we are amending only Section 32 which deals with the manner in which market value is to be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the term &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  I thought that term was now a bygone because Section 1, if I may refer to it, eliminates even the theme of market value.  To my mind, if one is to secure a valuation and keep within the terms of that section, one would need a quantity surveyor and a cost accountant.  Under the system usually applied up to now the valuer took such things as local amenities into consideration and he also had at the back of his mind how much the council for whom he was operating would lose if the house had to be sold on the open market as a result of the default of the borrower.</P>
      <P>Now, having this Bill&mdash;I should have said earlier that I welcome it&mdash;I gather that the system to be used in arriving at the value of the house is to get a quantity surveyor or a cost accountant rather than the ordinary valuer.  I suggest that the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; should not appear anywhere, or be referred to, in this Bill because no matter how the market fluctuates, when one considers the complete house, its value will still remain in keeping with the cost of the materials used to erect it.</P>
      <P>I noted that another Senator referred to the £2,000 maximum price of the house.  The Minister should not be blamed entirely for that, because in my county council, when we went in a deputation to his predecessor, we chose the £2,000 ceiling as a means to get the greater number on the list at that time.  We thought £2,000 was the normal value of a house that would ordinarily be built in the County Dublin and it is the County Dublin local authority of which I am a member. The Minister said earlier that the council decided not to go above £2,000. That is a fact, but the feeling of the council has changed since then and we hope to exceed the £2,000 in the future.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Health and Mental Treatment Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has two main purposes: to increase the maximum daily charge which may be imposed on certain classes of persons eligible for hospital services under the Health and Mental Treatment Acts, and to permit charges to be made on some of the eligible classes for the provision of out-patient specialist services under the Health Act of 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the increased charges for general hospital services I think that it might assist Senators if I recapitulated briefly <Col N="135" /> the provisions of Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, which Section 1 of this Bill proposes to amend.  Section 15 requires health authorities to make available institutional services for certain persons, and these fall within four categories: Persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952; Adult persons whose yearly means are less than £600; Farmers, the rateable valuation of whose farms is £50 or less; Persons who would be unable, without undue hardship, to provide institutional services for themselves or their dependents.</P>
    <P>Dependents of the persons in each of these groups are also eligible for the services.  These services are provided free of charge for another class of persons who are covered by Section 14 of the principal Act and who are defined as persons who are unable to provide, by their own industry or other lawful means, the medical care necessary for themselves and their dependents.  The services may also be made available free of charge for any of the other persons in the eligible classes.  The question of a charge arises only in the case of eligible persons, not in the lower income group, for whom the health authority has decided not to provide the services free.</P>
    <P>Except for some classes of cases at the upper fringe of those in the fourth group, those who would not be able, without undue hardship, to provide services for themselves and their families, the amount of charge is determined by the health authority, but under present legislation cannot exceed 6/- per day.  The charges to the upper fringe are specially fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In view of misconceptions which have arisen about this matter, I should like to emphasise that the present figure of 6/- per day is a maximum and that a charge at this rate need not be imposed in all cases.  The health authority may decide not to charge at all, or may fix the charge at any amount up to 6/-, except in the special class of hardship cases which I have just mentioned.  In point of fact, I understand that it is the exception <Col N="136" /> rather than the rule for the maximum charge to be made.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill now before the House to increase the maximum for the daily charge from 6/- to 10/-. I should like to make it quite clear that this applies only to general hospital services.  It does not affect the hospital services provided for persons suffering from tuberculosis or from a wide range of other infectious diseases.  It does not apply to mothers or infants or to schoolchildren in respect of defects discovered at school health examinations.  These are free of charge in all cases.  Furthermore, a person who at present would pay less than 6/- per day for hospital services need not be affected at all by the alteration.  It should be clear, therefore, that it would be wrong to suggest that all, or even the majority of those who are now getting hospital services under the Health Acts will have to pay higher charges for them.</P>
    <P>As a corollary to the increase in the maximum charge for institutional services, changes are also being made in payments made under Section 25 of the 1953 Act.  Under that section, when a person elects, instead of taking the services offered by the health authority, to go to the hospital of his choice, the health authority pays to that hospital the sum which they would normally pay for a patient sent by them to a public ward in a similar hospital, less a sum of 6/- per day. The 6/- a day is equated to what the health authority might charge, if the patient had taken their services.  This limit of charge is being increased to 10/- a day and it now becomes necessary to provide that the deduction made in calculating the payments under Section 25 will be similarly adjusted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the out-patient specialist services, the pattern here is the same as in regard to hospital in-patient services.  Services, including X-rays, will continue to be free for all in respect of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases and free for all the present eligible classes in respect of maternity and for infants.  They will also be free for national school children in respect of defects discovered at <Col N="137" /> school health examinations.  None of these services is affected in any way.</P>
    <P>For other out-patient specialist services the Bill proposes charges for those who are regarded as being able to afford them.  As regards in-patient services there will be no charge for those who are not able to provide by their own industry for medical attention for themselves and their dependents, but the charges for out-patient specialist services which may be made are limited by the provisions of this Bill to a maximum of 7/6 for X-ray examinations and 3/- in other cases.  I do not think that for persons in the middle income group these charges can be regarded as heavy.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for increases in the charges for services provided under the Mental Treatment Act of 1953.  The existing law regulating charges for those services is similar to that which regulates charges for general institutional services and the effect of the Bill in this case will also be to increase the maximum charge of 6/- a day under present legislation to a possible maximum of 10/- per day. Again, I should like to make it quite clear that in this case, as in the case of general institutional treatment, the mental hospital authority will have discretion to give the services entirely free of charge or at a charge less than 10/- a day.  In deciding the daily charge which any patient may be called upon to pay, I have not any doubt that the health authority will have regard, among other things, to the length of the illness.</P>
    <P>I think I can assure Senators that the numbers who will be affected by this change in the maximum charge for mental patients are not likely to be unduly high.  I want again to emphasise that the charges proposed by this Bill will not affect the majority of the people entitled to the services under the health and mental treatment codes.  They will extend only to persons considered able to pay them in respect of a limited range of services. I think it will be agreed that the charges are moderate and that the payment should not cause hardship. The savings which will be effected by this Bill are estimated at £90,000 for <Col N="138" /> the Exchequer and a corresponding amount in local authority expenditure. It may not appear to be a large amount in relation to the total of public expenditure, but I think I can say that the measure is a necessary one because it is quite clear that the present burden of public expenditure must be lessened and that the Government is bound to do everything which it legitimately can to secure that essential reduction.  Otherwise, it will be quite impossible for us to look forward to a continuation of our public services or indeed of our whole economy, even on its present standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill.  The Minister spent the larger part of his speech underlining the fact that it was the maximum charges were being increased.  He also told us that it was the practice, as far as he knew, not to charge these maximum charges laid down in the 1953 Act.  Just before he sat down, he told us that this Bill would mean a saving of £90,000 per annum to the Central Fund and the same amount to local authorities.  I wondered indeed was he serious in stressing so much the maximum charges and the fact that they had not been imposed and supposedly would not be imposed.  It seems to me that there is a contradiction right away between those two parts of the Minister's statement.</P>
      <P>If it is not the practice of the local authorities at present to charge the maximum laid down of 6/- per day, then we can surely assume in these hard times that the same local authorities would not increase the charge and that the 10/- maximum is just a figure. In fact, of course, we know it is the general practice of local authorities to charge the 6/- per day and, unfortunately, we can come to expect that, with the authority which will be given to local authorities when this Bill goes through&mdash;as unfortunately it will, I suppose&mdash;they will charge 10/- per day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to quarrel with the Minister in his point that the people affected by this measure are people able to afford the increase.  He said in the Dáil, at column 29 of Volume 162, and <Col N="139" /> he said more or less the same now, that the Government has decided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that certain beneficiaries of the health services, who may be presumed to be in a position to do so, should make some contribution&mdash;a very modest contribution indeed&mdash; towards the reduction in charges which was required to ensure a balanced Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was probably poking a little fun in that statement. The people mainly affected by this, the people on whose behalf I want to protest now, are the insured workers.  I can assure the Minister that these people cannot afford this increase and also that the increase is not a very modest one.</P>
    <P>The insured workers got a very raw deal under the 1953 Act and this Bill gives them an even rawer deal again. Prior to the 1953 Act, they were given free treatment, because they were insured, in the general approved hospitals.  A contribution of 15/- a day was made for their maintenance in private approved hospitals.  Under the 1953 Act, instead of having free treatment in the general approved hospitals, they came to be charged 6/- per day. That increase was held off for a long time, but it eventually came into operation in April last year.  That 6/- charge was fixed only some 14 months ago and they are now to have the &ldquo;modest increase&rdquo; of 66? per cent. to 10/- per day.  I hope the Minister will understand that I am being sarcastic when I mention the &ldquo;modest increase&rdquo; of 66? per cent.  To rub it in a bit better, they will now be charged for specialist services certain fees to be fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>These insured workers cannot afford to pay any such increase.  They are paying into insurance, as I said. Unfortunately, they are not insured for medical services.  I understand that a certain proportion of the social welfare stamp they pay each week is allocated for health purposes.  I may be mistaken in this.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will tell me if, in fact, there is any proportion of that amount allocated for health and for hospital treatment?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> When they are out sick, these insured workers are paid a disability benefit. I will take the best example.  I want to be generous to the Minister.  The maximum disability benefit is 61/- per week for a married man with a family. Up to the present, out of that 61/- per week, the insured worker could be charged, and I say was charged, 42/- a week for hospital treatment.  That left him 19/-.  Now, out of the 61/- per week, he will be charged 70/- for the same hospital treatment, plus specialist charges.</P>
    <P>I think it is disgraceful that, in 1957, in attempting to balance the Budget, the Minister should turn on this weakest section of our community to make a saving.  If he is in earnest in saying there is no hardship involved and that these are maximum charges at the discretion of the health authority, then, in fact, he is not making any saving; but I say that, in fact and in practice, this maximum charge will come to be applied and it is because of that that the Minister is expecting to make a saving at the expense of the section of our people who cannot afford to pay these increased charges.  If I am wrong and if in fact the 10/- will not be applied, the Minister can give the lie to me quite easily.</P>
    <P>I should like him to say, in replying, that he does not want the health authorities to apply the 10/- maximum charge to the insured workers.  I would like him to say that he recognises that they cannot afford to pay this maximum charge of 10/- per day and that he would not wish the health authorities to seek it from them; that because their disability benefit has not been increased, he would not wish the health authorities to charge them any more than they are charged at present. If the Minister can cut the feet from under me by saying that, I will be very content indeed.</P>
    <P>I must say, however, that unfortunately I have to expect that this measure will be a further serious burden on the sick, and especially on the insured workers, and that it will mean a further reduction in their standard of living.  Because of that, I have to oppose it.  The Minister made a point about the discretionary power of the <Col N="141" /> health authorities in deciding whether or not to charge the maximum of 6/-, as it has been, or 10/- a day as now proposed.  I wonder would he tell me whether the health authorities have a parallel discretion dealing with patients who go to hospital of their own choice.  He explained that they have a discretion in these new charges to make a higher subvention so that the person who went to that hospital will not be charged something that he cannot afford to pay.</P>

      <P>I can be very brief about this because I think this issue is very simple and I am going to support the Minister.  I regard this Bill as an indication that the State is now having second thoughts about the imposition on the people of the cost of this health legislation.  Those of us who are engaged in local authority services have agreed that the burden has become unbearable and certainly the result has been chaotic.  I support the Bill because I think it is a step in the right direction and indicates that we are facing the fact that we cannot provide these services which cost, as far as I can remember, something like 30/- per day.  We must come a bit nearer to what the costs are and we have cut the cloth far too lavishly for the suit we are going to wear.  I think the Government are right and I think that this House should support the Bill.</P>

      <P>In opposing this Bill, I must say that it is a most regrettable thing that, simultaneously with the cutting of food subsidies, we now proceed to raise the cost of hospital treatment and raise it for a section of our people who must depend on assistance in health matters.  The raising of hospital charges is more to be deplored when we realise that the maintenance of the health of any nation is a matter of paramount importance. When we can find money to pay such interests as flour millers and racing boards, it is very bad indeed that we turn to the poorer sections of the community for money with which to balance Budgets.  It has not been our experience that the 6/- charge is a maximum charge.  The general feeling <Col N="142" /> is that the new 10/- charge will be imposed in all cases, with the result that fewer people will seek medical attention and there will be, in consequence, a falling off in the standard of the health of our people. This will eventually cost some future Government a great deal more than the savings we are now making in the sacred cause of balancing the Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOBrien" hpid="Mrs. Connolly O'Brien Mrs. Connolly O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Connolly O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider a section of the Bill with a view to its deletion, because it appears to me that it must fail in its purpose, which is the saving of public moneys.  I am referring specifically to the section which deals with hospital charges for the middle-income group.  The term &ldquo;middle income group&rdquo; sounds very fine.  It suggests an income above a worker's income and just below the higher income levels whereas, in the main, it is a worker's group.  It is composed mainly of tradesmen and, as such, it affects the bulk of the workers.</P>
      <P>I live in a working class district and I am in almost daily contact with the wives of tradesmen.  I meet them in the butcher's shop, the baker's shop and the grocer's shop and I talk to them and listen to them.  The one comment which I hear most often is that it is almost impossible to bring up a family on one man's wages, prices being what they are.  I learn from them that there is no margin in a weekly wage for saving and that the most they can manage is to pay into a holiday club or a Christmas club.  I learn that when one child in the family needs his shoes repaired in the same week as another child requires new shoes, the wife faces a financial crisis which keeps her almost breathless waiting for the next week's wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can then imagine how great is the financial crisis created for such a family when the wage earner falls sick and must go to hospital and there is no prospect of the next week's wages in the offing.  When that happens, the only prospect of an income in that family is the sickness benefit.  It is neither the custom nor the practice with our employers to pay a sick <Col N="143" /> employee's wages.  A few of them do, but very few of them.  Most of our employers consider that they do a most commendable and praiseworthy act if they keep a sick worker's job open for him&mdash;always provided that he does not remain sick for too long.  When that happens in a family, it must turn to the sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>I understand that the sickness benefit averages out at approximately £2 10s. per week.  This section proposes to fix the hospital charges at £3 10s. per week.  We know that institutions have a way of insisting upon getting all to which they are legally entitled. It has been mentioned that this charge will be a maximum charge and that less than this 10/- could and may be charged; but it has been our experience over the years that, when a maximum charge is fixed, it invariably becomes the minimum charge.</P>
    <P>When a worker falls sick, his income falls to approximately £2 10s. per week. Hospitals will insist on the deficit between £2 10s. and £3 10s. being made good and that deficit can be made good only out of public funds.  To my way of thinking, that means an increase in public expenditure of at least £1 per head per week for every sick person within this category instead of a saving of 4/- per day.</P>
    <P>There are, too, such items as rent, light and food for the sick worker's family.  We are a Christian community and our Constitution assures us that a family is the most important unit in the State.  We cannot, therefore, let the sick worker's family be evicted. Neither can we let them starve.  Some provision must be made to meet these commitments and that provision will have to come from public funds, which proves to me that this section of the Bill is useless, both in its purpose and in its intention.</P>
    <P>I am not looking at this matter from the point of view of an expert in accountancy.  I am not at all clever at figures.  I am looking at it from the point of view of its effect on a sick tradesman's wife.  From that point of view, I can see no value or purpose in this section, save to add mental worry to a sick worker's physical pain and <Col N="144" /> the subjection of his wife to all the misery and humiliation of an appeal for assistance from public funds, and that compels me to believe that wife when she says that things were better for her when her husband was entitled to get six weeks' free hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can show me that I am wrong in contending that this section must mean an all-round increase in public expenditure, instead of a saving.  Perhaps, with his great skill and experience in financial matters, he will show how it is possible for a family whose income has fallen to £2 10s. a week to meet hospital charges of £3 10s. per week and maintain the family, even at a bare subsistence level.  If he will do that, I can assure the Minister that there is not a worker's wife who will not rise up and call him blessed or fail to remember him night and morning in her prayers.</P>

      <P>National health is a magnificent thing and so, of course, is national solvency.  The predicament we all find ourselves in with this type of legislation is trying to do everything we can for our people and, at the same time, trying to ensure that what is done is done in a reasonable and proper way.  I was moved, as were all Senators, by Senator Connolly O'Brien's account of the sufferings of the family.  I saw some of these myself when, as a medical student, I used periodically lose my way in the town in which I was born and find myself in mean streets and poverty-stricken surroundings.  We can all appreciate what sickness and disease must cost these people directly and indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can be done about it?  One trouble is our method of classifying people into these different income groups.  That is not yet a really satisfactory method.  We have arranged the same kind of classification in relation to the suffering families so graphically described to us for the purpose of benefiting under this Bill as we have for other income groups; but there is the well-to-do middle income group whose children are not always a burden on their mothers and fathers. They grow up and become wage <Col N="145" /> earners.  We all know families where very substantial incomes are coming in through the children being in employment. There is nothing fundamentally wrong in that.  They are only repaying some of the services they received.  If we could divide people into the group that cannot save, the group that can save and very often does not, and the group that cannot help saving, we shall really get a more professional approach.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one question.  This is a matter to which the Minister did not refer either in the other House or in his statement on the Bill here to-day. This Bill increases a charge already there.  Whether that charge should or should not be there is a subject too wide for discussion on this Bill, since it brings us back immediately into the means test and all its implications.  We are only concerned here with an increase in an existing charge.  I have not yet found out why the Minister wants to increase this maximum charge for hospital services from 6/- per day to 10/- per day.  How has that been calculated?</P>
    <P>We have had the most astounding and alarming information that the expenses of these institutions have risen by something like £4,000,000 in the past four years.  Why this rise? Why have these things become so much more expensive?  Is it because the nation is becoming more and more sickly and more and more people are going into these institutions?  Is it because people are becoming aware that here is something for very little and are, therefore, trying to avail more of it, or is it because&mdash;and I think this is probably the explanation &mdash;all these things are becoming so much more expensive to operate?</P>
    <P>I know a little bit about the cost of medical appliances and things like that.  I know a little bit about the increase in the price of apparatus, chemicals and medical preparations. The increase is appalling.  The Minister would be wise to look ahead and consider what is likely to happen in the next four or five years, at the end of which period he may be coming back to have this 10/- increased to 15/-, or something like that.  I should like <Col N="146" /> to be satisfied in my mind that the Minister has gone thoroughly into the question of increased costs and found out to what extent this increase is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>We are happy in having a Minister who has had considerable experience and a great reputation as an expert on finance.  He comes before us now charged with the care of the finances of the body as well as the finances of the activities of the body, namely, health.  I should like to think that he really has looked into this question of costing and decided that this increase was unavoidable, whether it is likely to increase still further and if so, make provision for that.</P>
    <P>On this question of maximum charge, as long as the authority does not impose the maximum charge, then the deficit will have to be made up by the ratepayers.  Is there any check on this charge?  Is it left entirely to the good nature and tender heart of the authority?  Is a certain tradition followed?  Does anyone keep a check on the authority and find out if certain authorities lean towards the application of the maximum charge in all cases, while others are a little more humane in its application?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the only way to meet the terrible challenge put out by Senator Connolly O'Brien regarding the poorer families is not by reducing the standards of the wage earning groups but by going into this question of the maximum charge a little more carefully and seeing how much discretion is left to the authority and how far it is exercised.  The point that really arises is how far the Minister has gone into the question of the £4,000,000&mdash;how much of it is absolutely necessary and how much it is likely to increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what has been said by Senators Murphy, Davidson and Connolly O'Brien.  I would feel myself to be very much opposed to this Bill. I was hoping, after Senator Murphy's speech, that we might perhaps take an effective vote on the Bill and perhaps even defeat it in this House, but <Col N="147" /> my hopes were dashed by the speeches of some of the Fine Gael Senators, who made it fairly clear that they stand foursquare with the Government on this issue, a point which I regret.  I may be wrong in assuming that the entire Fine Gael Party supports the Government on this issue, but, as I have heard them speak so far, that would seem to be indicated.  If I am wrong, I hope some spokesman for Fine Gael will show that this is not a question of Party policy.</P>
      <P>Enshrined in this Bill, which asks for the raising of this charge from 6/- a day to 10/- a day in certain cases, the implication of the means test is very much there.  The Minister himself has told us, and has been at pains to tell us, that this 10/- is merely &ldquo;a maximum&rdquo;, that there might be all kinds of different levels of charge between 6/- and 10/- according to means, and in accordance with the use of the discretionary powers of the local authorities.  In my opinion, more than 50 per cent. of the complications of our health services are due to this passion we have for applying a means test whenever we can.  Six out of ten of the questions on any form a patient has to fill in concern not his illness but his capacity to pay.  Here we are concerned with partial payments, not asking these people to pay the full costs but trying to assess what proportion of a portion of the full cost they are able to pay.  To me that seems a nonsensical complication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself has indicated a large number of groups of people who are not affected at all by this Bill, because we do not apply means tests, as he mentioned, in the case of infectious diseases, fevers and so on.  He seemed, if I heard him aright, to be rather proud of the fact that this Bill does not apply to all those groups of people.  I feel that there is a psychological contradiction there, because would not the Minister feel even more proud in that case if he was not introducing this Bill at all?  He is very proud to mention what kind of people it does not apply to, but I feel that he would be doing better work by not applying it to anybody.  It would be <Col N="148" /> far better if we were to wipe out all this form-filling, which is such an incubus on our health services, and whose sole purpose is to find out in a very niggling way what proportion of money can be paid by an individual sick person.</P>
    <P>The scheme in Britain has been referred to, and the scheme in the Six Counties, where no charge is made. The Irish avail themselves very widely of it, without any scruple of conscience, as far as I am aware, either religious or patriotic.  Since it works so well for Irish men and women abroad, I see no reason why it would not work equally well for them here.  I remember being assured in this House&mdash;and I would be curious to know whether the present Minister would agree with his predecessor&mdash;that it would be &ldquo;un-Irish&rdquo; for us in this country to have an overall free service.  The phrase &ldquo;un-Irish&rdquo; was used by the previous Minister.  I do not see that.  To me, it seems that it would be more humane, more sensible and more efficient, and I see no reason why such qualities should be regarded as un-Irish.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister on what principle he would base his apparent approval of the fact that we apply a different principle to people suffering from different kinds of maladies.  Why does the principle of collecting money from the patient, or of collecting partial payments, of applying means tests, change according to the particular kind of disease you may have?  If, in the one place, it is morally right, why does it become morally unnecessary in the other?  I personally fail to see any difference of principle.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the Dáil, and I refer to Volume 162, columns 28 and 29, that a major consideration in the preparation of this Bill, though not the sole consideration, was the desire to &ldquo;balance the Budget for the coming year&rdquo;.  Other Senators have referred to the fact, as did many members of the Dáil, that this seems to be a lamentable way in which to seek supplementary moneys&mdash;to go to the sick, who are increasingly burdened by an increasing cost of living, and who by reason of their illness have an extra <Col N="149" /> burden again, and to say: &ldquo;There are certain of them in the middle income groups and we are going to squeeze out of them a further £180,000 a year and divide that up&mdash;£90,000 to balance the Budget and £90,000 for the rates.&rdquo; I think that is mean, that is unwarranted, and the sum itself, in relation to the Budget, is so small as not to warrant the introduction of this Bill and of the complication, calculation and &ldquo;discretionary power&rdquo; that come with it.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question of the sum of money&mdash;£180,000 I think was mentioned&mdash;I should like to ask the Minister upon what considerations was that estimate of his calculated, though I realise that it could only be a rough estimate?  I would like the answer to that, and to know how he thinks that the 17,000 people affected &mdash;because he gave an estimate also as to the number of people likely to be affected by this measure&mdash;are thought likely to be paying, in an average year, an extra £180,000 by reason of the increases under this Bill.  I should like to ask him at what rate did he make the calculation.  Having decided that the Bill would affect roughly 17,000 people, was he thinking of them as paying at the rate of an extra 4/- a day, or was he thinking of them as paying an extra 1/- a day or 2/- a day?  The Minister has made a lot of the point that this is a &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; permitted extra charge and I hope, therefore, that he has not been calculating that those 17,000 people will, in fact, all be paying the maximum. I hope he can assure the House that he has calculated as if they would be paying on an average, not 10/- a day, but 8/- a day.  However that may be, I should like to know upon just what basis did he reach that figure?</P>
    <P>The total saving, as the Minister has mentioned and as I have just stated, is to be £180,000, and it is to be collected at the expense of the sick and mentally afflicted, from what is called the &ldquo;middle income group,&rdquo; but what is really very much the lower income group, because it is the lower section of the middle income group that will be hit.  At the expense of the sick and mentally afflicted we are <Col N="150" /> hoping, by the terms of this Bill, to collect £90,000 for the Exchequer and £90,000 for the ratepayers, making a total of £180,000 which seems small to me when one thinks that £150,000 was recently lightly tossed away for the purpose of transforming Irish wheat into pig food.  I feel that the Minister is going to a great deal of trouble and, perhaps, incurring more odium than is his due, by introducing a Bill of this kind to produce what in relation to the Exchequer is a paltry sum, but which in relation to the sick and mentally afflicted may be a very big sum indeed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I note that the Minister quoted figures in the Dáil and said that the costs of this institutional treatment have gone up since the year 1952-1953 up to the current year, the last year for which we had figures&mdash; last year, I think&mdash;by 54 per cent.  He indicated that costs had risen from something like £7,000,000 to £11,000,000 or by an average of about 54 per cent. I think I am not doing the Minister an injustice in saying that he quoted that figure in terms of horror, but he is raising the charge to the sick and mentally afflicted people by 66? per cent.  I wonder how the Minister justifies a rise from 6/- to 10/- which is out of all proportion even to the spectacular rise in costs that has taken place since 1952-1953?  The Minister, in other words, is jumping far ahead of what is necessary, even on his own figures, and even forgetting the fact that of course a certain big increase was to be expected under the terms of the new Health Act of which, with all its limitations, I certainly approve.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister in asking for an increase in these charges to these wretched patients of 66? per cent. justifying it by increased costs of 54 per cent?  But this increase in cost is calculated since 1952-1953 whereas it is less than a year since the charge of 6/- was first introduced.  I do not remember, when it was introduced, that any protest was made by the Minister or by his Party to the effect that 6/-, less than a year ago, was not enough.  To compensate for a 54 per cent. increase over four or five years we are suddenly asked to increase last <Col N="151" /> year's figure by 66? per cent., and we are putting that as an extra charge upon the lower middle income group, on the sick and mentally afflicted members of that class.</P>
    <P>When the Government decided that, in order to meet the rising cost of living, if I may quote an analogy, it was necessary to raise old age pensions, I did not see any suggestion that they should be raised by 66? per cent.  One shilling in 24/- was considered enough.  Here we are putting 4/- on to 6/-, and I feel that the Minister and the Government in this way are not dealing out evenhanded justice to the community in that section.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the Minister's contention&mdash;which he was very strong about in the Dáil and which he repeated to us here&mdash;that this 10/- which he asks for is &ldquo;a maximum charge&rdquo;.  If I might quote column 29 of Volume 162 again, the Minister said&mdash;and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Health authorities have considerable power in this regard.  They have power to decide that, in addition to those in the lower income group, hospital services can be given free of charge to persons in the middle income group if their circumstances so warrant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on a few lines later:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further, the charge of 10/- a day will be a maximum charge&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and he adds in parenthesis</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;it is important that we should be clear about that&mdash;and it is open to health authorities to charge less in any particular case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is very strong about that.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have suggested that in practice these discretionary powers about which there is a good deal of talk, are not used, and I notice that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, says in the same debate at column 36&mdash;referring to the section which gives these discretionary powers of which the Minister makes to much, says&mdash;and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is a section which does not operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> There is a contradiction there.  The Minister and his predecessor cannot both be right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Both cannot be true, that these discretionary powers are widely used as the Minister is quite certain they are and that they are not as his predecessor holds. He repeats that he is right, and I am sure he sincerely believes it.  Public opinion perhaps might give us the final answer on that point.  It cannot, however, be true both that he is right in this respect that these discretionary powers are widely used and also that, as his predecessor says, the section does not operate.  I would not profess to judge between them, but I am simply stating that both cannot be right.  The Minister has assured me he is right, but I have a feeling that if his predecessor were here he would speak with equal assurance as to his being right.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to deal with that in his reply and to be rather specific and give us his opinion, at any rate, as to how this power is exercised in practice, the power of the health authorities to decide not to charge this maximum of 6/- as it is at present. How much has this power been used? How many times on the average?  I am seeking information, because I am not informed on that point and I would like to know how this power is used in practice, and not just in theory.</P>
      <P>Another point the Minister made in the Dáil&mdash;and the figure was quoted by other Senators to-day and I think the Minister himself quoted it also&mdash; that these people are &ldquo;only&rdquo; being asked to pay 10/- a day out of an average daily bed cost of 31/5.  That is quoted from column 32 of the Dáil Report and it is based upon the average over nine Dublin general hospitals.  The Minister made the point, in quoting that figure, that the maximum these people were being asked to pay was less than a third of what the average cost was.  He says at column 32:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The simple arithmetic average of the daily average costs in 1955&mdash;the <Col N="153" /> last year for which figures are available&mdash;in the nine Dublin general hospitals works out at 31/5, so that persons paying 10/- a day will be paying less than a third of what the service for them is costing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question on that.  Is it not a fact that this average figure of 31/5 is a faulty figure?  Does it not in fact claim to represent the cost of the services to the in-patient but include, in some if not all of these hospitals, the entire cost of all out-patient services?  Is it not simply an average figure, assuming for the purposes of the calculation that none of these hospitals have any out-patients? In adding the cost of the treatment, the services and the drugs given to out-patients to the &ldquo;average cost&rdquo; for the in-patients, when you take that &ldquo;average&rdquo; figure as representing &ldquo;the cost&rdquo; of the services to an in-patient, are you not taking a grossly inflated figure?  That is, if my contention is right.  I am prepared to be corrected on that point, but I think that that average figure, representing the total cost in all these hospitals, is an average figure which includes all the out-patient costs and is, therefore, a faulty figure upon which to base the in-patient costs.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is less than just in saying that the 10/- these people will be paying is &ldquo;less than one-third of what the services cost.&rdquo;  If the Minister knows what is really the average cost for in-patients in these hospitals I should be glad to hear it. I doubt very much, however, if it is the 31/5 he quoted in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, then, that the whole principle upon which this Bill is based, and for which it was framed, is a bad one.  That principle was the desire to &ldquo;balance the Budget&rdquo; at the expense of these greatly underprivileged people.  It is a bad principle. It adds a further complication, by bringing more into operation the &ldquo;discretionary powers&rdquo; of the local authorities to apply a means test.  It adds a further complication to our health services in practice.  The amount asked for by the Minister, the amount of the increase, is far too much in the case of the vast majority <Col N="154" /> of these people, people with less than £600 a year family income and farmers with less than £50 valuation.</P>
    <P>I stress the point that it is a family income, and I am sure the Minister will agree with me there.  The figure of £600 is not counted at the income of the breadwinner but includes the income of his wife, if she has an income, and of any unmarried sons and daughters living at home.  It is a total family income of less than £600 a year, and, as has been pointed out by two Senators before me, the average income of this section of our people is very much below that figure.  Such people if they have big families are already incurring a loss of income by reason of the increased cost of living. If ill, they are already incurring additional expense by reason of their illnesses, and now the amount they would previously have had to pay for hospitalisation of 42/- per week, by the terms of this Bill is to be raised to a possible maximum of 70/- per week, a rise from two guineas to £3 10s.  That is to be met out of a joint family income of roughly £11 10s., the absolute maximum, and it is frequently far less.  If there are five or six weeks' illness at that rate it will financially cripple many of the middle income group families for months to come after an illness, and this is for mere hospitalisation arising out of a common malady.  What about mental illnesses, where hospitalisation might be considerably longer?  The Minister has said that in cases like this the circumstances would be taken into account, and so on, but in point of fact the second section here is asking for the replacement of the 6/- charge per day by a charge of 10/- per day, under Section 71, I think, in the Health Act of 1953.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy put the question as to whether there is any discretionary power involved there.  I would like to ask that too, and also how often is it in effect used?  It is quite clear that if one member of the family, not necessarily the wage earner, but it is worse if it is the wage earner, is mentally afflicted and has to be in a mental home for six months or more, the rate of £3 10s. a week asked from some <Col N="155" /> people of such incomes by this Bill will be utterly crippling to such a family or to such a farmer with a small farm. Therefore, I would conclude by saying that this Bill stems from a bad initial principle which is made worse by the quite unjustifiable, arbitrary and exorbitant increased charge that can be placed on people in the already hard hit middle income group, and in particular the lower sections of that group.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill upon which I should like to see a Seanad vote, in the hope that the Minister might be prevailed upon to reconsider whether or not the amount of money he is going to get out of these people is worth it.  I very much doubt if he can consider that sum a big one, from the point of view of the Exchequer, but in any event I would urge him to reconsider the whole Bill, or else I would urge the Seanad to reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, the Seanad, in considering this Bill, should consider the context in which it was prepared and brought before the House.  That context is the financial position of the country and the responsibility with which the Government of the country is charged for the next five years.  The financial position and the responsibility of the Government both require that more jobs be provided for our people at home over the next five years.  That was a factor in this debate and I was disappointed that the labour vocational interests here in the Seanad failed to refer to it in any way.</P>
      <P>The provision of more jobs in this country over the next five years depends on two important factors.  It depends on an increase in public investment and an increase in private investment. That can be achieved only if the State brings in scrupulously balanced Budgets in dealing with current services, so that all the borrowed funds available to the State may be invested in capital works which provide employment and so that, secondly, there is the minimum possible rate of taxation on private enterprise so as to enable it to expand and thereby provide more work for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> That is the net problem facing this Government at the moment, charged with the responsibility of seeing more people employed over the next five years.  This Bill should be considered in the context of that problem and, in the context of that problem, this is a justifiable Bill.  We cannot enter into any doctrinaire argument as to the rights and wrongs of a means test and the rights and wrongs of social welfare services.  The criterion to be applied is how much this country can afford. In applying that criterion, the point to be borne in mind is that State taxation should bear as lightly as possible on private enterprise and that all State borrowed funds should be devoted as far as possible to capital works which can raise the productive capacity of our country and give more employment.  It is in that context that the labour vocational interests here have failed to come up to the challenge.  It is in that context that this Bill should be considered.</P>
    <P>If a Minister for Health in this year of 1957 is faced with that problem and the problem of curtailing current State expenditure, what does he do?  He says to himself: &ldquo;I will curtail expenditure on health services where it afflicts least the most needy people in the community.&rdquo; In facing up to the problem, the Minister for Health has adopted that criterion.  He has curtailed State and local expenditure over the next year and, so far as this Bill is concerned, for so long as it is law.  He has curtailed it principally by increasing the charge in respect of the middle income group for hospital services from 6/- to 10/- per day.</P>
    <P>To meet that problem of curtailing current expenditure, was that not the fairest, the wisest and most equitable thing for a Minister for Health to have done?  The middle income group people, who could afford to pay an extra 4/- a day, are being asked to do it in order that the lower income group people can have the full medical, specialist and maternity services to which they are entitled, and that these people will be able to avail of the funds provided by the State and local authorities for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone even further <Col N="157" /> than that.  He has excepted the maternity cases in the middle income group from this additional charge and he has excepted also the people entitled to allowances under the Infectious Diseases Act.  He has imposed the least possible hardship on the people most able to bear it in order that all the funds for medical assistance may be available to the people in the lower income group, and the infectious diseases people and the maternity people in the middle income group.  That is a very practical way of facing up to the problem in 1957 of balancing the Budget on current expenditure, and that is merely what the Minister has done.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am disappointed that the labour vocational interests in particular failed to refer at all to the general financial context in which this Bill was introduced.  I do not know whether Senator Sheehy Skeffington or some of the other speakers here would like to see a welfare State here in which we would have full facilities for the aged and the young and nobody to work at all.  Maybe they want some idyllic workhouse State like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was disappointed that the Labour people and Senator Sheehy Skeffington failed to refer to that main objective and declared aim of the present Government. Viewed in that context, the Seanad should have no alternative but to vote for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the statement made by the Senator who has just spoken, that this nation is to be saved by the local authorities increasing hospital charges from 6/- to 10/- I am a member of Wexford <Col N="158" /> County Council and all parties represented there, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, agreed to the charge of 6/-. Now, the present Minister says we must charge 10/- Today, the revenue collected in St. John's Hospital there amounts to over £7,000 per year.  The Senator who spoke is a young man. Perhaps he does not belong to a local authority.  Perhaps, unlike members of the Labour Party, he does not live amongst the poor and workers who have to depend on national health insurance and home assistance.  Perhaps he does not know what we have to suffer.</P>
      <P>So far as the Minister is concerned, the right man was put in the right place to introduce this Bill.  This Health Act has caused confusion to the local authorities and the ratepayers and now it is to cause confusion to the poor, sick people.  I was surprised at Senator Barry from Cork making the statements he made.  We want to see justice done to the needy people and the sick.  We all know the cost of hospital bills and doctors' bills.  We are all in confusion.  We are told the limits are £600 and £50 valuation.  Go to the county manager and see how many people are getting that treatment. The same thing applies in the case of the disability benefit.  It is decided, not by the Minister or the local authority, but by the county manager and the home assistance officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard all about the benefits of the Health Act, but the first people to pay were the ratepayers, not the Government.  Now the sick man is being called upon to pay 10/-.  I am surprised at the Minister asking local authorities to impose that charge.  Is there any member of a local authority who will vote for it here?  We in the Labour Party will oppose every section of this Bill.  I have been in hospital myself.  When I became a member of the Dáil, I met with an accident and I know the fees that have to be paid.  The same thing applied when I was a flour mill worker and insured under the National Health, and then I listen to Senators standing up and saying that it is not too much to charge, that it not too much to raise <Col N="159" /> the charge from 6/- to 10/- I ask the Seanad to reject this Bill because there is not a Senator here who would get a vote, if it were thought he intended to support the increased charge of 10/-.</P>

That is a pity and I think it is a reflection on the members of the Labour Party who cannot think about any section of the community, apart from those known as insured workers.  In the course of his speech, Senator Fearon said that national health was a magnificent thing.  It is a magnificent thing, but may I add that individual health is also a magnificent thing and it is so magnificient that people should, and normal people do, make some effort to maintain good health. If they are in bad health, they should, and do, make some sacrifices to regain good health.  Because that is so, this measure is asking people who are able, without hardship, to pay and to make some sacrifice to regain good health.</P>

Surely the farmer with a small valuation, the self-employed small shopkeeper, the self-employed tradesman and such people are also affected. While those people seek less assistance from the county council and from the State, they pay more towards our health services than insured workers. I am not prepared to agree that a small farmer under £20 poor law valuation, or under £30, is better off than an insured worker earning £9, £10 or £11 a week.  Neither am I prepared to agree that it is a severe hardship to ask an insured worker, earning £7, £8 or £9 a week, to pay 10/- a day towards the maintenance of a member of his family who is ill for a short time.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to argue that this measure is going to be administered judiciously.  From the speeches made against it, one would think that in every case the 10/- a day charge will be charged.  I would remind members of the House that this measure will be operated, not by the Minister for Health or by the Department of Health, but by the local health authorities, the county councils, the county borough councils and the mental hospital authorities.  I have been a member of a mental hospital authority and I know that in dealing with these matters the county councils, if they err at all, err on the side of generosity.  Why is the case being made that now, for the first time, our county councillors will use this measure against the poor?</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in the administration of our health legislation the county council and the health authorities deal with each individual case where there is an executive decision to be made?  It is my experience that the staff officers dealing with health and assistance affairs are generous and fair, and I am not aware that we have health officers dealing with health and assistance who take a very stiff administrative view and just read the Acts as they find them, having no regard to the hardships that may be inflicted if the Acts are not administered with a certain amount of humanity.</P>
      <P>This measure will be administered in a Christian way and there will be no attempt made to inflict undue hardship on the people of the middle income group.  Obviously, the Bill does not cover people of the lower income group who cannot, by their own lawful means and industry, provide these services for themselves.  I suggest to Senator O'Leary that exaggeration always destroys a case, even if he had a case, in the first place.  I suggest to him that there are farmers of £49 poor law valuation in Wexford&mdash;and I do not know much about that county; it is one of the few I have not been in&mdash;and it would be no hardship to ask the majority of them to pay this 10/-, although there might be the one isolated case, towards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the maintenance of a member of their family in a mental hospital.  Obviously, this measure will deal mostly with short term illness and where a member of a family of an insured worker enters a hospital for a short period of treatment there is no great hardship in asking the head of the family, or a member of the family, to pay an increased contribution, if the income of the family so warrants.  After all, the decision will be taken by the officers of the health authority.  It is my experience that when an administrative mistake is made in any local authority, immediately two or three representatives are approached and they go to the county manager to make a case against the infliction of hardship. That is as it should be.  That is what local representatives are for&mdash;to ensure, amongst other things, that a mistake is not made in administration, particularly a mistake against the poorer sections of the community.  The statements that have been made about this measure are, I believe, intended to confuse the public mind and to suggest that the passing of this Bill will inflict a hardship where no real hardship will be inflicted at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I view this Bill in a somewhat different way from that in which Senator Lenihan viewed it.  The context in which I see this Bill is that it is just another blow at the middle income group.  If one looks at the legislation over the past few years, one will find that there is one section of the community more than any other which has been either penalised or neglected.  In this Bill, the middle income group is singled out for special treatment, in addition to the hardship they will have to share with other sections of the community under the provisions of the Finance Bill which will come before this House at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not alone in my view that the middle income group has been badly treated.  In 1952, the Taoiseach was defending the Budget of that year.  He felt that because of the taxes imposed <Col N="162" /> and the abolition of certain food subsidies, some compensation should be made to different sections of the community. Compensation was made to the lower income groups in much the same way as compensations have been given in the current Budget in relation to children's allowances and benefits under the Social Welfare Act.  In the 1952 Budget, the increases affecting the middle income group were offset by changes in taxation under the income-tax code.  In the present instance, while the middle income group will have to suffer all the impositions of the Budget, so far there is no proposed relief under the income-tax code.  In addition to that, they will be penalised still further under this Bill.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, I shall deal with the general principle that every man who requires something must pay for it in proportion to his means.  At the moment, I shall confine my remarks to the treatment meted out to this section of the community.  I do not think I could describe the position of this class and the manner in which they have been treated better than to quote from the Official Report the indication given by the Taoiseach at that time that his Government had directed their minds especially to the plight of this class.  The Taoiseach, having referred to the charge that had been made that the Budget was a rich man's Budget, dealt with what had been done for the middle income group.  At columns 224 and 225 of Volume 131, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is one class in the community that has been ground between the upper and the nether millstone for a long time, that is, those people who would be regarded as having moderate incomes now.  They are called upon to pay to the full for everything they get.  They are supposed to get no benefits from the State, except those that are universal, and they are supposed to pay fully as private families for whatever they have to get.  The charges that fall on every member of the community have to be met by them. We felt that the reduction of the bread subsidy would be a matter of considerable importance for them <Col N="163" /> and we tried to come to their aid by reliefs in income-tax.  No single person who has at present a salary of less than about £900 will have to pay anything more than he was paying before.  Many such persons will be paying much less, but no single person with a salary under £900 will be charged any more as a result of the new rates.  That is obviously a relief, not for the rich but for that section of the community that has been ground down between the upper and nether millstones by State action for a considerable number of years past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the section of the community which, having been ground down by State action, is to be further imposed upon under this Bill.  I speak now subject to correction, but I think it is remarkable that this is the only section of the community for which special treatment and special measures are introduced following on the Budget.</P>
    <P>The time is not opportune for the introduction of this measure.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Act was passed early this year and in February the board was established under that Act.  The existence of that board and its effect upon the fortunes of the middle income group does not seem to have exercised the mind of the Minister in introducing this measure to any great extent because, in reply to a question in the Dáil, he indicated that he did not know what the board was doing in relation to the basic scheme it was intended they should provide under Section 4 of the Act.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that pending the implementation of that Act, an Act which will enable people to seek shelter from the misfortunes of ill-health, the Minister might have held his hand because a number of people who will undoubtedly be charged the increased charges under this Act will become voluntary contributors under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act. On the ground of time alone, the Minister was ill-advised in introducing this Bill.  If he had stayed his hand until such time as the basic scheme provided under that Act was in operation, those affected by the present increased <Col N="164" /> charges would be forthcoming as voluntary contributors.  In the absence of that scheme, it was a mistake to introduce this Bill at this stage.</P>
    <P>Another criticism of the Bill is that, if it was the desire to save the Exchequer £90,000 in one year, then the Minister has certainly not gone about saving that in the most equitable way.  The persons entitled to free specialist and hospital services under the Health Act, apart from the public assistance classes or the classes who are entitled to dispensary services, are those who have a family income of £600 per annum or persons having an income in excess of that figure who are insured as voluntary contributors under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  It seems to me illogical to say that a family with an income of say £700 or £800 per annum and in which there are eight, nine or ten children&mdash;and thanks be to God it is still the position in this country that there are many such families&mdash;can be excluded from hospital and specialist services, except on grounds of hardship, and that a single man with £599 per annum can get specialist services, subject to the payments prescribed in Section 15 of the Act and the additional payments prescribed in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Before the Adjournment, I was talking about the provisions of the Bill which do not differentiate between single people and married people.  I was indicating that the Bill would be better and the burden more equitably distributed, if there were some provision differentiating between single men and women, on the one hand, and married people, on the other.  I pointed out that a single man with a yearly income of £599 is in a much better position to bear the cost of ill-health than a married man with several children who has even £700 or £800 and who is a voluntary contributor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would be in a position to indicate how many of the 17,000 people affected by the Bill would fall into the category of single <Col N="165" /> men and women and the proportion of the £90,000 which they would be contributing to the Exchequer by reason of the increased charges.</P>
    <P>Having made these observations, I think it proper to say that the Bill is not without merits.  I think that one effect of the Bill will be that it will bring a number of people who might otherwise have remained out of the voluntary health insurance scheme into that scheme.  The more that scheme and similar schemes develop in this country, the better it will be.</P>
    <P>In general, I think it proper to say that I certainly commend the provisions of the Health Act and, indeed, of this amendment in so far as it is making people who can do so pay for their health services.  I see nothing whatever wrong with a means test.  On the contrary, I think a means test is a very proper thing.  Too many free services of one kind or another is one of the factors that have resulted in the fall in savings.  If people feel that, when misfortune overtakes them, there will be some State scheme to come to their assistance, there is no incentive to save.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a proper criticism of the Bill to say that this is a tax on people who are ill.  Prudence demands that people should provide for contingencies such as ill-health, not when they are sick, but long before that. Health services are in the category of needs for which persons must cater. We are bound to look after our own health.  The head of a family is bound to look after the health of that family. The rights and the responsibilities in the matter are specifically provided for in the Constitution.  I am in entire agreement with the Minister's statement during the Dáil debate, as reported at column 74 of Volume 162 of the Official Reports, when he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Broadly speaking, I do not think anybody who does not require it should be given anything for nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that more and more emphasis should be placed on that point.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the various Senators who have criticised the measure and I think a lot of what <Col N="166" /> they said was unjustified and exaggerated. First of all, I would point out that, for the purpose of the Health Act, the population of this country can be divided into three groups or sections&mdash;the lower income group, the middle income group and the higher income group.  Senators to-day worried about the poorer sections; they alleged they would suffer as a result of this Bill.  There was, however, one important fact which is not mentioned, that is, the big percentage of our people in the lower income group who will now have free treatment. The treatment will be free in every sense of the word.  The people who will thus benefit are really the weakest and the poorest sections.  I could not give an accurate percentage of those who will benefit in that class, but I would put it in the region of 40 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As reasonable people, we must all admit that this is a big percentage in a small country like this who will get free treatment in hospitals. This treatment will be the very best that can be provided.  Is that not a wonderful achievement?  I am a member of a public body and of the health authority in my own county.  As such, I am conversant with the work done in our county hospital.  This work is second to none.  I visit the institution frequently and in speaking to patients, some of whom I am acquainted with and others whom I do not know, never have I received a complaint about the charges being made for treatment received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill, it is proposed to increase these charges from 6/- to 10/- per day.  I want to know how that affects the lower income group, the people about whom some of the Senators who have spoken worry so much.  There is no charge whatever for the treatment they receive.  Even in respect of the middle income group, the charge may not be increased to the full extent; in one case, the charge may be increased to 7/- per day, in another to 8/-, in another to 9/- and in another to the full amount of 10/- per day.  The members of public bodies who have the <Col N="167" /> responsibility of running such institutions will know whether 10/- per day is an unreasonable charge for some patients to pay.  Surely 10/- per day is not unreasonable to ask of a person in reasonable security, a person earning up to £600 a year or a farmer with a valuation of £50.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill will create hardship in any instance.  I do not think many people will complain of the new charge.  If this Bill were to affect the poorer sections of the community, I would be the first man to protest.  However, I am quite satisfied it will not affect them.  Reference has been made to national health insurance cases and I should like to ask how many of these cases are obliged to pay even the 6/-. As far as I know, the expenses of those people are paid out of the National Health Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, this Bill will not impose hardship on those people.</P>
    <P>With regard to mental hospital patients, as a member of a joint mental hospital committee, I know that the great majority of the patients in such hospitals get free treatment.  In 20 years' experience of such a hospital, I can say that I have not found a single case of hardship.  In the old days, the county councils had the responsibility of fixing the rates patients were to be charged.  That is now the responsibility of the county managers and I defy contradiction when I state that suggestions that this Bill will impose hardship on patients in such institutions are exaggerated and not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the previous speaker began, I thought he was going to be fairly reasonable.  On the whole, I do not disagree with a great deal of what he said.  He said there would be no hardship at all imposed by this Bill. I consider that gross exaggeration. There are bound to be some hardships. Senator O'Reilly was very careful when he said the Bill would not inflict undue hardship.  He also said that most of those affected would be cases of short term illness.  That is the case I should like to make.  During the years there have been certain types of illness that <Col N="168" /> we have neglected in our concern about other types which have been obvious and which have been fairly dealt with.</P>
      <P>The cases I have in mind deal with mental illness.  The ill-health of patients in mental institutions may last for a considerable number of years and even in the case of the middle income group, the charge can be a very serious infliction on the family.  Moreover, the mental institutions have not yet, perhaps, been attended to in the same manner as other health institutions have been.  If the Bill has a defect, I think it is due to the fact that it has been drafted too broadly.  Many of the patients in mental hospitals are people of whom use has been made in the working of the institution farms.  I saw recently where the farm of a mental hospital in the country made a very large profit.  These institutions become the ordinary place of habitation of the patients who are taken on excursions when they are not of a homicidal nature.  Generally speaking, they give considerable help in the institutions. In the case of long term illnesses of that kind, it would be desirable that some credit would be given to patients or their families for work done by them in the institution.</P>
      <P>Senator Connolly O'Brien in her very fair statement on the Bill referred to the fact that she was not very skilled or experienced in financial matters.  If one examines this Bill from the point of view of the amount of money that will be saved this year, it is £80,000 out of a Vote for the Department of Health of £8,000,000.  That is 1 per cent. of the Vote.  If you examine it from the point of view referred to by the Minister at the end of his speech as being two-thirds of one-tenth of 1 per cent., I do not think two-thirds of one-tenth of 1 per cent. is the kind of calculation that anybody can make in a matter of this sort, even though the Minister on another occasion supported the Health Act of 1953.  During the period it was going through the House&mdash;he was Minister for Finance&mdash; the expenditure on the Supply Services went up from £75,000,000 to £105,000,000 a year at which figure they have stayed except for the operation of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> I think the record of this Party&mdash;the Fine Gael Party&mdash;in this matter is fair and straight.  The Health Act of 1953 was opposed by the Fine Gael Party. When they joined the Government in 1954, they put it into operation since it had been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was implemented, despite a good deal of criticism, in a very fair way.  The Minister put it gradually into operation according as the facilities were available to him.  That is the reason why the Supply Services expenditure went up from £105,000,000 to £109,000,000.  No other aspect of Supply Services expenditure went up in the past three years, despite the increases in salaries and wages, in imported raw materials and so forth.  In fact, there was a considerable economy during the past three years, although this Act which was passed by the present Government was put into operation by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says that this kind of saving is necessary, he cannot very well be speaking of it as a physical saving.  He must be thinking of it as a good example or something like that.  We need not worry unduly about the good example since the good example has been given already.  The previous Government allowed no increase in Supply Services expenditure during the period of three years, with the exception of the Health Act.</P>
    <P>In defence of this Bill, Senator Lenihan referred to the circumstances in which it is introduced, the financial position, the provision of more jobs for all people.  Finally, the particular matter that caught my mind was the reference to the public works that would raise the production of our country.  I am afraid that there was a sad experience last year of public works, in the sense that £4,000,000 had to be written off the assets side of the national debt, the £4,000,000 out of the £6,000,000 of the assets in the National Development Fund set up with a great flourish of trumpets in this country a few years ago.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Health had not in the past been concerned with supporting the Health Act of 1953 and with the circumstances in which Supply Services expenditure went up from <Col N="170" /> £75,000,000 to £105,000,000, I could sympathise with him a great deal in connection with this Bill, but the Bill coming in these circumstances looks very like a Tory Bill.  As a matter of fact, it looks like an extremely right wing Tory Bill to me.  I do not think it is possible to make worthwhile savings or do anything worth while for the economy by making this kind of a saving&mdash;a saving which on the Minister's own Vote is only 1 per cent. of his expenditure.  The Government in regard to the Estimates as a whole are looking for a saving of about 3 per cent. and there is a lot of Estimates they do not make any saving on.  I do not think the Bill is a reasonable approach to this matter, particularly in the case of long term illnesses.</P>
    <P>A good many for the defence say that the Bill is concerned with short term illnesses or that there will not be too much hardship.  I am quite certain that there will be no hardship at all in some cases.  Let us take the case of a man in the middle income group. I think one of the Senators who is reputed to have rather extreme welfare State views referred to these &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; people.  I think it was a gross exaggeration to refer to people with an income of from £450 to £600 as wretched people.  There are circumstances in which people with such an income are wretched, but I do not think they are wretched in the sense the Senator referred to.  Where you have a married man having an income of £600, with no children, there is no reason why he should not pay a sum of £10 or £15 for his upkeep in hospital for one month.  It might be well perhaps if the House would consider before the next stage an amendment dealing with the case of long term mental illnesses.  If it is to apply to long term mental illnesses, it might also apply to other long term illnesses not covered by existing legislation by way of free services.  While I still feel there will be cases of considerable hardship under the Bill, at least cases of long continued hardship would be covered, if such cases were taken out of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of the new members in this House.  I was very <Col N="171" /> much surprised at the manner in which the old war cry of the poor and afflicted was bandied around this House.  Reference was made to mental hospital patients being used or attempted to be used as little horses for the benefit of the mental hospitals. I know one mental hospital where there are 2,400 patients.  Twelve months ago I was informed that, of the 2,400 patients, only 300 paid fully or in part in the hospital.  What would Senators say to that mental hospital board? Would they say it was inflicting a hardship on anybody?</P>
      <P>I could also say that many of the patients in mental hospitals at the present moment are old persons whose people refused to keep them or ran away from their moral responsibilities in keeping them at home.  There are old persons put into mental hospitals even in Cork&mdash;I make no secret of it &mdash;by people who refuse to keep them. Are the ratepayers and taxpayers expected to keep all of them?</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; was used in the discussion here and I should like to dwell on that for a moment.  Never in my experience of local boards have I found that the officials were in any way harsh in dealing with patients. The officials are quite willing at any time to help any patient.  The question of the 10/- never arose.  It is a question of whether or not they are in a position to pay and, if they are not and if you can put up a case, it will be investigated.</P>
      <P>I might say, with regard to some Senators who have spoken, that officials of their unions are some of the people investigating cases&mdash;one in particular. Every case has been examined carefully and I have never known them to give a harsh decision.  My experience of the hospitals is that they have always been decent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will find that during the past 12 months some hospitals attempted to halt the Health Act.  I remember a case concerning a person in East Cork with a £28 valuation.  I do not know why a certain thing happened, but it is being investigated and, at any rate, it is an exceptional case.  A case <Col N="172" /> came before me yesterday and I contacted a hospital and had no bother.</P>
    <P>The one thing which has been harped on all during this debate is the increase to 10/- a day.  I am glad of that increase.  It is about time we realised we have some responsibility to ourselves.  If you have, say, from £500 to £600 a year, is it not your responsibility at least to look after your own family?  The point I want to stress is that some people are looking for a great deal and that we have not the money to pay for it.  The farmers and the ratepayers cannot afford to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister has been very fair and that the investigating officers are fair.  Any matters that arise and any exceptional cases will be investigated. At times, however, we may find that the medical profession may not be too fair.  Some doctors who have been paid under the Health Act may also look for their fees afterwards from the patients. That is another point that must be investigated. I think the principle of the Bill is worthy of support.  With regard to other matters that arise at times, I would say it is up to us to investigate them and find where the fault lies.</P>
    <P>Many patients work on the farms of the mental hospitals.  The doctors find that it is far better for the patients to be out than to be locked up.  If people complain that they have been kept there, I would ask why do their people not come and take them out?  We have lost our national pride.  That would not have occurred years ago.  One of the traditions handed down to us is that, whether in respect of senile decay or anything else, we should keep such people at home and look after them. Too much pampering is the cause of the whole trouble.</P>
    <P>I wish to support the Bill.  I do not want to take up the time of the House, but I would stress the point about moral obligation.  I would also stress that the hardship cases have nothing whatsoever to do with the increase, because, if there is any case of hardship, the officials will deal with it justly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should feel rather uncomfortable were I to sit here and not <Col N="173" /> express some view on this Bill.  When legislation was going through this House originally, I did my utmost to point out to the Minister of the day the defects in the legislation he was attempting to put through but I did not succeed.  If the present Minister will read column 860 of the Official Report of Seanad Eireann of the 30th September, 1953, he will see an amendment in my name which was out-voted by his supporters but which, had it been implemented, would have brought about a different texture in the legislation compared with that of to-day.</P>
      <P>The last speaker is new to the House but I welcome some of his refreshing remarks.  He said it is about time we realised that we have responsibilities. It is.  Had that been realised years ago it is certain that the whole attitude towards health legislation in this country would be different.  It is perhaps very unfortunate that our approach to this problem has been bedevilled by the behaviour of certain individuals which has not done us great credit.  The position is that the present Minister has now to come here to mend the hand of his colleague. I would have expected a more fundamental reason in relation to the whole problem of the well-being of our society than the mere excuse by the Minister of trying to keep a balance in our finances.  It is true that as a result of the impositions in the recent Budget, costs in all our hospitals have risen.  At the last meeting of the mental hospital for Cavan and Monaghan there was a demand for more than £2,000 extra as a result of the Budget proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to this point and it is a point on which I would stand in regard to this legislation.  I put this question to any member of the House.  Have the members of our society any responsibility to provide against sickness or ill-health?  Have any of us that responsibility? Obviously, the incomes of all the members of this House are not equal.  The members of our society as a whole have incomes&mdash;not so many have very high incomes and many have low incomes.  Some are able to pay and bear burdens that the majority of our people cannot carry.  For those <Col N="174" /> who are able to bear the responsibility of making provision for their own needs, in whatever form these needs have to be supplied, can we expect that society ought to do that for them when obviously the moral responsibility must be upon themselves?</P>
    <P>In my judgment, no society can hold together where the people who have the competence and the ability refuse to accept their obligations and burdens and want to pass them on to others. That is fundamental to the strength of our society.  It does not matter how we may try to argue around that point. We cannot get away from the fact that &mdash;whether we be farmers, business men, university men, or others&mdash;unless we are all ready to put all our goods into the common pool and have a completely socialist society, or something much more to the left, some individuals within our society will have to be ready to bear burdens greater than other members of the society.  That is a fact which we should recognise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, it is a matter of a difference between 6/- and 10/-.  There are some who join issue on the whole question of a means test, but for those who will not challenge the legitimacy or morality of a means test it is a question of charging 6/- or 10/-.  I can speak with some experience of hospital charges and the cost of hospitalisation at least in my own county.  I know the cost of maintaining a patient in any of the hospitals in my county is 30/- per day.  Last year the health services in our county had to provide about £46,000 as the cost of maintaining patients in extern institutions, where the year before it cost us only £22,000.  That is what the ratepayers of Cavan have got out of health legislation.</P>
    <P>I have not the figures for the extra costs in our own hospitals.  If people can make a contribution to the charges, because of the means they possess, and if up to date they are asked to pay only 6/- where the cost is 30/-, I think in the circumstances and times in which we live it is equitable that the local authority should have the liberty to impose a higher charge.  As far as our local authority is concerned, I can say with truth that I do not think any person <Col N="175" /> going into any of our hospitals will have to pay unless the local authority is satisfied he is able to pay and that the payment will not impose an undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Despite all the efforts to demoralise our people from the first imposition of the dole, for the past 20 or 25 years, there are still people in our society who want to honour their obligations to themselves, to their own decent instincts and pay their way.  We ought to do our utmost, for the sake of our society, to encourage that attitude of mind.  In my judgment, it is a legitimate thing, now that costs in our hospitals have risen&mdash;and risen quite recently because of the operations of the Budget, and they are going to rise more&mdash;that the people enjoying those services should make a larger contribution than they made in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to discuss the cost of mental treatment.  This section is permissive.  Any member of any local authority can tell quite well what happens when a patient, after leaving a hospital, has a demand made upon him in the shape of a bill.  If he thinks it is too high, he does not march off next day to pay, but will do his utmost to make representations about his circumstances, to persuade the county manager and members of the local authority that the demand is harsh, that it will impose a burden which is difficult for him to carry and that that in itself can impair his health.  It is not very frequently that those representations are made to me, but I know that they are made to other members.  I have always tried to take a reasonable line in this House or as a member of a local authority, that people should pay what they can.  Individuals are free, they are born with free wills.  They have obligations to themselves first and to their family and to society.</P>
    <P>If we are to cultivate and develop the type of mind amongst our citizens which will make the great mass of them feel their burdens can be carried for them by the State or someone else, we are destroying initiative amongst our people, reducing them below the level of spirit and attitude essential in pioneers in nation building.  We have <Col N="176" /> had a great deal of demoralisation up to the present and every voice raised to encourage people to think others will bear their burdens, will weaken them in mind and spirit.  If you want to break the spirit, that is the right way to go about it; and sometimes I think there are people going about that task in this country with that attitude of mind.</P>
    <P>I shall not support that attitude.  I have preached the contrary point of view, I have voted for it in this House and in the local authority; and will do the same thing to-morrow if I am challenged about it.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the balderdash we heard here from people who apparently did not know what the Bill was about, it was refreshing to listen to Senator Baxter's remarks.  It was refreshing to find Senator Baxter bring an air of reality to the debate in progress here for the last few hours and which I can only describe as dreamland on the part of some Senators who presume to be experts in various branches of national economics. Undoubtedly, due to the activities of successive Governments here over the past 35 years, and due to the propaganda of which Senator Baxter spoke by certain people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the morale of our people in regard to work and to payment is being undermined.  They have been led to believe that the national Exchequer and the local rates are a broad board from which all they have to do is to draw.  They have been led to believe that the State can provide for everything, that it is not necessary any more that they should provide for themselves out of their earnings.  This mentality has led to the belief that the State can provide from the cradle to the grave, without inflicting taxation or hardship on those who are to benefit.  Where the finance to provide these services is to be got no one has explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was vastly amused to hear Senator O'Donovan a few minutes ago.  I understand he was the economic expert of <Col N="177" /> the Coalition Government.  He told us this Bill was too loosely drafted, that the paltry saving of £80,000 a year was not worth while talking about, that if the Minister thinks he can do anything substantial by saving this amount of money he is living in a fool's paradise. It never seems to have dawned on him or on any of the other Senators who spoke in that strain, that this country is in a very serious position, that when the general election was held some months ago the country had found itself in a very serious financial position, as the Budget statement proved.  It never seems to have dawned on them that, if we were to balance the Budget and get out of the financial mess, it was necessary not alone for the national taxpayers to make sacrifices, for the cigarette smokers and the drinkers to make sacrifices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was necessary that we should get into our minds the motto to which Senator Baxter referred, the need for everyone to recognise that the State is not a miracle worker and that people must try to do things for themselves. It was necessary to create again the mentality that those who have should help those who have not. It is a good Christian principle and it is also common sense.</P>

      <P>If Senator O'Leary will cease interrupting I shall come to the point I want to make.  It is not alone good Christianity but it is common sense.  It is common sense in this respect, that those who are earning and those who are in receipt of wages and who can pay a little should be asked to pay a little in order to assist the State to help those who are less fortunate and to provide services which otherwise could not be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan sneers at the <Col N="178" /> paltry saving which will be effected by this Bill lead me to remark that he must have been asleep for the last few months if he did not see that in the Dáil during the Budget debate, and ever since, every speaker who spoke on the economic situation, every newspaper which referred to it has insisted that there must be economy, that there must be savings, that the burden of taxation has reached such a height that the people are now unable to bear it, and that the burden of local rates has also reached a height at which it is inflicting undue and severe hardship on the people.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government which was returned by the majority of the people and was given authority to administer the affairs of this State for the next five years determined that the first step towards economic recovery was to present a balanced Budget.  In order to do that savings were necessary and, although this £180,000, divided between the local authorities and the Department of Health, £90,000 each, which it is hoped to recover may seem a small thing to Senator O'Donovan, it is only one of the efforts which the Government is making in every single Department of State to try to ease the load of taxation and costs which are bearing so heavily on the whole community.</P>
    <P>The Government's aim is to save money and this is one way in which every Department can help.  If every Department plays its part in the savings drive and if the other economies which were announced in the Budget are made effective, then the aim which we have in mind will certainly be achieved.</P>
    <P>While we are on this point it would be well to bring Senators who spoke down to reality on the question of hospital services costs.  It might be well to remind them that under the Health and Mental Treatment Act the current cost to the Exchequer of hospital services is almost £11,500,000 this year. That is a pretty tidy sum and it should give Senators seriously to think when they criticise a Bill which amends in a minor way an Act involving a permitted increase of 4/- in the maximum <Col N="179" /> daily charge for certain hospital services.</P>
    <P>It has been remarked here, without contradiction, that this total cost which patients may have to pay of 10/- a day is less than a third of the total cost of the services which they receive. Senators spoke here as if this increased charge were compulsory and mandatory and as if the local health authorities would press like Shylock for their pound of flesh.  It has been completely misrepresented; it should be understood that this Act is permissive, not mandatory.  The health authorities may charge 10/-.  They may charge less if they so desire.  There is no question of their having to make a charge of 10/- per day.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington made one point which has been reiterated by other Senators, and it would be well that it should be cleared up.  The illusion seems to have been created by certain statements that the maximum charge will always be demanded.  That is one of the objections which Senators made to the Bill.  It may interest Senators to know that a recent Dublin Corporation investigation showed that out of every 100 eligible persons, 75 were not charged anything, 11 were asked to pay less than the 6/- which is now the current maximum, and 14 were asked to pay the 6/-.  Therefore, what Senator Hogan and Senator O'Reilly said here is quite correct.  The local health authorities will interpret and operate this Act in the humane manner in which they have operated all the health legislation on the Statute Books of this State.</P>
    <P>I was highly amused also at the line adopted by Senator Murphy and Senator Miss Davidson.  The weakest section of our community are made to do the saving, according to Senator Murphy; we were raising the cost of living on the people who had most need for assistance in health matters, according to Senator Miss Davidson. As I said, and as was pointed out here by Senator Baxter, if a person is able to pay, there is no reasonable objection to his being asked to pay.  If the middle income group is able to pay the amount requested there is no reason why they <Col N="180" /> should be exempt.  There is no reason why they should not play their part if they are able to do so.  If they are not able to do it, nobody will force them; nobody will rob them or crucify them. These tactics of using the middle income group now in the same way as the lower income group was used by the same Parties in the Dáil for pure propaganda purposes will get us nowhere.</P>

      <P>The Senator is not at the crossroads now.  Senator O'Donovan amused me greatly by talking about assets that were written off. When he was talking about national development by us and the assets that were written off, I could not help wondering if he ever heard of the assets which his Coalition Government wrote off, such as the transatlantic airline and the chassis factory in Inchicore. I was wondering whether all this talk from Senators about inflicting hardship on the sick did not remind some of them that it was the Coalition Government which interfered with the B.C.G. vaccine service and which inflicted the total cost of it on the rates.  It was also the Coalition Government which only 12 or 14 months ago put a very heavy burden on the ratepayers, and I do not remember hearing either Senator O'Donovan, Senator Murphy or any of these other new prophets of disaster creating very much of a fuss at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill which affects the public assistance patients about whom we heard here.  Senator O'Quigley, I think, referred to the amendment of the principal Acts.  The principal Acts do not discriminate, and there are no new principles being introduced in this Bill.  It is a simple Bill with a simple objective, and it <Col N="181" /> surprises me that Senators should take up so much time trying to magnify it into a major disaster for the sick, when it is quite obvious that its intention is to ensure that those who can contribute to their hospital treatment and to certain specialist services will be asked to do so, so that the State will be able to help those who are not in a position to do it for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make in conclusion, and that is to stress again the fact that we in this country, through the activities of Government and local authorities over the past 30 years, have created this impression that our people need not save for themselves, need not help themselves.  Although Governments have now done their best to induce the savings mentality in the people, the other idea, fostered particularly by some of the political Parties here, that it is not necessary, that the State will give everything free for all, needs to be dispelled.  If this Bill which inflicts no hardship on the sick or on the middle income group by the modest permissive charges it now enables local authorities to ask, is passed by the Seanad, then the Seanad will be doing something useful to help the less well off sections of the community about whom so many crocodile tears are shed when anything is done by the Government affecting either them or their representatives here.</P>

      <P>I feel that I would be lacking in my duty as a member of a mental hospital visiting committee and also a member of the health committee of my county were I to allow all of this hostile criticism to the Bill, particularly by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, Senator O'Donovan, Senator Murphy and Senator O'Quigley, to go without reply. One thing that it makes clear to my mind is that none of these Senators has any practical experience of the administration of a mental hospital or attendance at meetings of health committees. I can assure this House, as a member of a mental hospital visiting committee, that there are no such things as hardships inflicted upon the families of any patient in any of those hospitals that I am associated with.  It <Col N="182" /> is beyond me that Senators of such standing should get up here and offer unfounded criticism, when all that is necessary is for those people to acquaint themselves with the administration of mental hospital committees.</P>
      <P>I believe that alteration in the charges of mental hospitals is overdue. It is about time that some assistance came to the ratepayers so that not all the cost goes on them, which would be the case were it not for this Bill.  It is when we sit down at the annual estimates meetings that we know the problems we have to face.  I am not going to delay the House any longer, but I want to register my protest against the statements that have been made.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this Bill, and I do so because I think it is necessary in the financial emergency which faces the country at the moment.  I do not believe that it will be administered without causing hardship to some people.  It is likely that it will cause a certain amount of hardship to a certain number of people, and I very much regret that that will take place. I am supporting the Bill only because I think it is absolutely necessary to make certain cuts in national expenditure at the present moment.  Unless the hardships which may occur because of this Bill are faced up to, we would have to face up to hardships probably far worse in some other directions at present and certainly in the future.</P>

I believe and hope that in the future, far from cutting down on or going back from the benefits which were conferred by the 1953 Health Act, we will be able to extend that Act and give further benefits to the people who are benefiting under it; but the principles of that Act, and the whole principle of giving benefits to the poorer and weaker sections of the community, presuppose a prosperous economy, a country which is thriving and which can afford to give those benefits.  Until the present national emergency which faces us is dealt with, and until such time as the country is put on its feet again, I do not think we can go any <Col N="183" /> further in conferring these benefits such as were given under the 1953 Health Act.  It is necessary to pause for a moment so that the national economy can be built up again.  When that is done, then we can certainly offer further benefits, and I certainly look forward to that day.  In the meantime, I believe this Bill is necessary and I am going to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat what Senator Mullins has said, and to stress that this Bill is permissive.  It empowers a local authority, if, in its opinion, the circumstances of the individual concerned warrant it, to make a charge up to the definite limit of 10/- per day.  As Senator Mullins has pointed out, it does not make it mandatory on the local authority to charge 10/- per day in every case.  That is the basis of the criticism which has been levelled against this Bill, that it does make it mandatory to charge 10/- a day.</P>
      <P>It is inconceivable to me how any responsible Senator reading the relevant sections of the principal Act and the provisions of this Bill could possibly make himself responsible for the statements which I have heard here from Senator Murphy and Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  Those statements have been made, not with the desire to debate this Bill in a rational and reasonable way, but merely with the desire to confuse the issue, to make political capital by misrepresentation. No proposal that comes before any legislative assembly can be immune from criticism, but at least when measures are before this House where we are supposed to live in a higher and more rarefied atmosphere than exists in the other House, let us refrain from the lower political tricks.  Let us keep away, if we can, from the hustings, and let us, when submitting arguments to the House, base them upon the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discretion of local authorities in this matter of the charge which they may make to individuals in relation to hospital treatment is wide and open and I do not propose, in reply to the question which was put to me by Senator Murphy, to fetter or to limit <Col N="184" /> that discretion in any way.  The responsibility for administering the Health Acts has been placed on the local authorities because they are better placed than the central administration to determine the circumstances of the individuals who come before them asking for free treatment or treatment in hospitals at reduced rates; and the health authorities have to determine these matters with full advertence to their responsibility to provide health services for all those within their jurisdiction who require them at a cost to the patient which will be within his capacity to pay.  That was the principle of Section 15 of the principal Act and it is not being departed from in any way in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been asserted by those who are critical of the Bill that the maximum charge is the general, or almost invariable, charge which local authorities impose for hospital treatment. That allegation is far from the truth. I must refer to Senator Murphy frequently, perhaps, in the course of this brief reply to his statement, because it opened the case against the Bill and everything he said in criticism of the Bill was repeated, perhaps at greater length, by those who supported him in those criticisms.  He wondered if I were serious when I stressed that the maximum charge was seldom applied. I should like to assure the Seanad that I was perfectly serious and quite truthful.</P>
    <P>It is time to come down from the stratosphere of the fanciful criticisms of Senators Sheehy Skeffington and Murphy to the solid ground of hard facts.  It has not been possible for me to investigate the position under every health authority, but a rapid examination has been made of the position in the City of Dublin and I think it is well I should repeat what has already been said, in order that the general body of the Seanad should be aware that there is no justification for the statement which has been so frequently repeated here, that this Bill will in future require every in-patient in a hospital who comes within the provisions of Section 15 of the Act of 1953 to pay 10/- a day so long as he is in that institution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> It has been pointed out&mdash;and I want to stress it again; the figures are easily remembered&mdash;that out of every 100 eligible persons, that is, persons who qualify for benefits under Section 15 of the Act, 75 in the City of Dublin are not charged anything.  That is 75 per cent. of the total.  Eleven are asked to pay less than 6/- per day and 14 per cent., taking the general average, are asked to pay 6/- a day.  When this Bill passes, I am reasonably certain that, having regard to the humanitarian spirit in which the Act is administered in the City of Dublin and elsewhere, it will be found that the number of persons called upon to pay up to 10/- per day will be very much less than 14 per cent.  Of course, the charges which will be made in relation to some small fraction of the total will range from 6/- to 10/- per day, but 10/- per day is the maximum that may be charged, except in relation to what are known as the hardship cases under Section 15 of the Bill.  They are, in fact, people who would normally be regarded as being better off than those who are included in what we know, in the parlance of the health code, as the middle income group.</P>
    <P>These are the facts.  I would ask Senators to consider them and I submit that it cannot be seriously contended, in the light of them, that there is any justification for the statement for which Senator Murphy made himself responsible.  Yet, I fear we shall hear that statement repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> and that perhaps he will be echoed by Senators Davidson and Sheehy Skeffington.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy was again incorrect when he said that the people who will be mainly affected by the Bill are the insured workers.  I think it will be agreed that the figures I have given are not consistent with that statement. Perhaps some of the insured workers may be affected, but they cannot be more than a fraction of the whole anywhere, nor are they likely, in fact, to be the greater part anywhere.</P>
    <P>Moreover it is not correct to say, as Senator Murphy did, that the insured persons got a very raw deal under the 1953 Act.  I do not want to enter into a discussion on the merits or defects <Col N="186" /> of the 1953 Act.  I have no intention of doing so.  It has been accepted by the Oireachtas and the principles which it embodies in general are acceptable to the people.  The question as to whether the cost of giving effect to those principles is justifiable, having regard to our existing circumstances, is another matter.  As I have said, I do not want to enter into a discussion on the merits and defects of the 1953 Act, any more than I want to enter into a controversy as to the morality or immorality of the means test in relation to this Bill.  All these questions have been settled.  They are in principle the basis of the original Act.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill which amends the original Act except in relation to a very minor matter.  It does not alter the principles on which the Act is based, in any way which would warrant a discussion such as Senator Murphy and Senator Sheehy Skeffington want me to embark upon.  Neither do I want to enter into a discussion as to the merits of the additional benefits which were conferred on the insured workers when I happened to be Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Prior to that, may I say in regard to the Senator who has alleged that this is a Tory measure, that I as Minister was responsible for the enlargement of the benefits which insured persons might derive under the national health insurance code?  It was, I think, owing to the fact that I happened to be Minister at the time that the insured workers were allowed even the modicum of the free hospitalisation enjoyed before the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>In view of what Senator Murphy has said, I must give the Seanad the facts in relation to insured persons before Section 15 of the Act was brought into operation by my predecessor.  Senator Murphy has stated that before that time insured persons were entitled to institutional treatment free of charge.  Apparently the Senator did not know that, in the case of insured persons, treatment in hospitals free of charge was for a strictly limited period.  It is regrettable that the Senator should have been unaware of this when he spoke; otherwise I do <Col N="187" /> not think he would have made the statement to which I am referring.</P>
    <P>The period to which insured persons were entitled to treatment free of charge was limited to six weeks.  The position now is that there is no limitation on the period.  In addition, not only was the hospital benefit limited to a period of six weeks, but it was confined to the insured person himself. Under the 1953 Act, not only the insured person but his dependents were entitled to hospital treatment under Section 15 of the Act.  Whether an insured person was better off prior to that than since depends on the view we take of the proper relationship between an insured person and his dependents.</P>
    <P>If we take the view that as long as I, an insured person, am all right and can take this six weeks' free treatment and it does not matter a damn about my wife and children, we can say with conviction that the insured person was better off previously than he is now under the 1953 Act.  On the other hand, if we say the family is to be accepted as a unit, to be safeguarded as is provided under the Constitution, so that a man and his wife and children should all be on the same plane in relation to the health services, then I think we would be prepared to say that the position of the insured person and of his wife and children is much better than it was prior to the bringing into operation of Section 15 of the Act by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this. Under the social welfare national health insurance code not only was the hospital benefit limited to the insured person himself, not only was it limited to a period of six weeks, but he also had to have 156 contributions on his card, of which I think 26 contributions had to be paid or excused in the relevant year.  That limitation does not apply under the 1953 Act, so that I think we can say that as far as the insured person is concerned, taking it by and large, weighing up the advantages and disadvantages, we can all be reasonably assured that there has been an improvement, a very appreciable and substantial improvement, in <Col N="188" /> his position since Section 15 of the Act was brought into operation.</P>
    <P>A great deal of play was made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington about how we were going to reduce the burden on the rates and on the Exchequer to the extent of £180,000 a year, if there were only 17,000 persons who were affected by the Bill.  In that connection, the Senator quoted from a speech which I made in introducing the Bill, but&mdash;it was not an act of deliberate omission&mdash; he failed to grasp that, when I mentioned that figure of 17,000 people, I was referring only to those patients who would be affected in general hospitals and other hospital institutions, other than mental hospitals, who would be affected by the permission given to local authorities to increase the maximum daily charge from 6/- to 10/-.  If he had referred to my closing speech on the Fifth Stage of the Bill, he would have seen there would be 14,000 other in-patients in mental hospitals. That is a total of 31,000 people, not 17,000 as Senator Sheehy Skeffington assumed was the total, when he was considering the matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there are other people who are going to be affected. There is the number of people who are going to avail themselves of the outpatient specialist services for which very modest charges are to be made and it is over this rather wide congregation that that burden of £180,000 will be imposed, a burden of contributing towards the cost of their treatment.  Perhaps it is not proper to use the word &ldquo;burden&rdquo; in that connection, but rather to say the moral obligation of contributing towards the cost of keeping themselves in good health and of restoring themselves to good health, if they should happen to be ill.</P>
    <P>If we consider these circumstances, we see there is nothing in the sort of speech Senator O'Donovan made.  He may gibe and jeer and make light of the fact that we are saving and that we are relieving the community as a whole. Mark you, the community as a whole is just as important in one sense as every individual in it.  We are relieving the community as a whole of the obligation of finding this £180,000 in <Col N="189" /> order to give cheaper services to people who cannot afford to contribute something more towards the cost of them.</P>
    <P>Those who are concerned about the social effects, from the economic point of view, of this legislation should consider this.  If we do not get it from those who can afford to give it, that £180,000 will have to be found, in the main, by the less well-off elements in the community.  The small farmers, the ratepayers, the self-employed persons, small shopkeepers and others who do not share all the benefits of our social welfare legislation are the people who will have to find that £180,000.  I for one am convinced that, so far as the principles of social justice are concerned, it is better, fairer and more justifiable to ask the people who can contribute something towards the cost of hospital treatment and specialist services to do so rather than that we should ask those who are not so well off to bear part of that burden.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon asked me some questions as to how I should account for the very substantial increase which has taken place over the past four years in the cost of our general hospital services.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington put a similar question to me.  I do not think that these questions properly arise on this comparatively minor measure.  Perhaps on another occasion, if I am in the Seanad and if I have some notice of such questions, I will have the archives and the accounts examined and may be able to give a specific answer to them, in so far as such an answer could be specific.</P>
    <P>A number of other things were said. I heard from one Senator an interjected remark about racing.  All I can say is this.  One of the reasons for our present precarious position is that we are not exporting enough.  The horse-breeding industry has become one of our main industries; not only that, but <Col N="190" /> it is an expanding industry.  The only place in which we can display these horses to prospective buyers and the only place they can be seen in action is on our race courses.  As far as I am concerned, having regard to the fact that we must increase our exports, I certainly would not be prepared to apologise to anyone for the fact that, instead of trying to kill the horse-breeding industry in this country, we are endeavouring to encourage it.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked would it not have been better to have raised this £180,000 in some other way &mdash;for instance, instead of spending £150,000&mdash;I do not remember the exact figure he mentioned&mdash;in converting Irish wheat into pig feed.  That is a very nice debating point.  It could be answered by asking: Does the Senator want the Irish people to eat wheat which is only fit for conversion into pig food?</P>
