      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to consolidate <Col N="670" /> in one Act our existing legal powers, which originated the best part of a century ago in an Act of 1877 and have been extended since by Acts of 1907, 1929 and 1954, for the enforcement of measures to prevent the introduction and spread in this country of plant diseases and pests.</P>
      <P>The powers contained in the Acts are principally exercised to control the importation of plants, bulbs and similar produce which might be the means of bringing pests and diseases into the country; and of course to prevent the spread of pests or diseases within the country.</P>
      <P>The successive extensions of the scope of the original Act arose from the growing knowledge of the possible effects of insects, pests, etc., on crops. The first Act, of 1877, was designed to deal only with the Colorado beetle, following the rapid spread of that pest in the United States and the havoc it caused to the potato crop there.  The Act of 1907 added any insect, fungus or other pest destructive to agricultural and horticultural crops, trees and bushes, and the Act of 1929 any agents, bacteria, or other vegetables or animal organisms, causative of a transmissible crop disease.  Finally, by the 1954 Act, insects which might be brought into the country for the biological control of plant pests, namely predators, parasites and micro-organisms, were also included.  This Act also removed certain anomalies in the previous Acts regarding payment of compensation for crops destroyed compulsorily, by placing the entire responsibility for such payments on the Department of Agriculture.  Up to then compensation was payable either by local authorities under the 1877 and 1907 Acts or by the Department under the 1929 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a question with regard to the propriety of proceeding with this motion to-day. I am not raising the question of order, but it is true that a number of members of the House, myself included, received our agenda only to-day and I am conscious of the fact that at least one member of the House has not yet received his agenda and accordingly had not notice of the fact specifically that this motion would be moved in the House this evening as practically the first business.  I want to suggest to the Minister that a motion of such importance as this, novel in its way&mdash; it is my first experience of such a motion since I entered the other House in 1923&mdash;ought not to be moved in haste, that the members of the House ought to have an opportunity of examining the proposal and trying to understand its implications and what exactly it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will not lose anything if he will meet the House by putting down the motion for, say, this day week.  In all the circumstances, that would be most satisfactory to everyone concerned.  The Minister is a man of common sense.  I do not know if there is any member of the solicitors' profession in the House, at least a practising member, and in all the circumstances, so that we all should be fully conscious of what we are <Col N="672" /> doing, the Minister would do a service to the country by agreeing that the motion should be put down for a later date.  We are ready to meet the Minister any day next week that he suggests.  Otherwise, I can only feel he will not be doing justice to the House and will not be giving it a fair opportunity to consider the implications of this motion and we must ask why it is necessary at this stage to rush the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that I cannot get any of the people who could interpret clearly for me whether the laying of this Order on the Table of the House on 14th ultimo does not imply that the month will have concluded on the 14th, that is, to-morrow.  In view of the fact that I cannot get any definite advice on that aspect of the matter and in view of the fact that the ordinary, normal notice was given&mdash;the full statutory period for putting down motions was given&mdash;I must presume that if that is the period allowed for the moving of motions, it must have been regarded as sufficient to meet a case of that kind.</P>
      <P>I cannot say, on my own, that I am going to agree with Senator Baxter that I should be doing either a favour to the House or an injustice to somebody by not agreeing to his proposition. I am in the difficult position that if I were to agree here and now to postpone this to a later date, I might be putting myself and the Government in the position in which we could not move the motion and from that point of view I am afraid I will have to insist on having it discussed to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister, if the position is as he has stated it to be, did it not occur to him that he should have put the motion down in the Dáil for last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that it was still under discussion last week and we were not in a position to put it down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say, in reply to that, that if the Government takes a month to make up its mind about this matter they might give the House at least a few days to do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that if we are to observe the common courtesies to each other and if the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland seeks an interview with the representatives of the Government, the Taoiseach and myself, and if we meet them and discuss questions with them, that should not be put up as the reason why we should have done something a month ago.</P>
      <P>We met the representatives of the Incorporated Law Society and had what I deem now to be a very friendly discussion with them.  The Taoiseach on that occasion made it reasonably clear to the deputation that, while he was listening to their case and was prepared to deal with it as sympathetically as possible, he could not give any undertaking on behalf of the Government.  He said that the matter would have to be brought before the Government and discussed by them and the decision would be the Government's decision.  That is exactly what took place.  Following the interview, the matter had to be brought before the Government again to see if the Government were prepared to change their decision, but having heard the Taoiseach and myself in regard to the interview, they decided they would not alter their previous decision and that is why this motion was not put down last week or brought in at an even earlier date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said that the Incorporated Law Society was concerned, but they did not make this instrument.  I am not suggesting that the Minister has not been courteous&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the instrument it is proposed to rescind was made by a certain body and the Minister tells me: &ldquo;We took up time discussing the matter with a third body&rdquo;. I am not sure it is reasonable that a matter which concerns a body consisting of the Chief Justice, the three senior judges of the courts and the President of the Incorporated Law Society should be brought into this House at very short notice on the <Col N="674" /> excuse, or on the plea&mdash;we shall be very fair to the Minister and agree that he has been working on this; we shall not take him short on that argument &mdash;that the Minister had to be courteous, but the Minister has so tied things up that it is at the last moment we are dealing with this.  I am not suggesting that the Minister was discourteous to anybody, but there is the question of taking this House short.  I understand that the meeting between the Minister and the Incorporated Law Society took place on October 23rd.</P>

      <P>This matter has been properly ordered for to-day.  The Minister has expressed a desire that the motion be taken now and the motion is now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before saying anything about the Order which is before the House, I think it would be well to say a few words about the manner in which the remuneration of solicitors is fixed. For what is called &ldquo;contentious work&rdquo;, meaning, broadly speaking, work in connection with cases in court, the remuneration is fixed by Rules of Court made by rule-making committees consisting of representatives of the Bench, Bar and solicitors, but the concurrence of the Minister for Justice is required before these Rules of Court become law.  The remuneration of solicitors for non-contentious work is fixed by a committee established by the Solicitors' Remuneration Act, 1881, which consists at present of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  An Order made under the Act does not become law until it has been laid before each House for a month, and if either House or both Houses resolve within the month that it be disallowed in whole or in part the Government may so disallow it. Parliament did not hand over to the committee the right to regulate costs, but reserved to itself the final say in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act, the remuneration of <Col N="675" /> solicitors has been regulated by Order since 1884.  The work covered has been divided into two categories and the remuneration for these was fixed under Schedules I and II respectively to the Order of 1884.  Schedule I provided scales of fees based on the amount of the consideration for sales, purchases, mortgages, leases, agreements for leases, and similar transactions.  Schedule II covered other business of a non-contentious kind and instead of fixing scales based on the amount of the consideration as in Schedule I, it continued the system then in force of charging for the work done by reference to a priced list of items.</P>
    <P>The Order has been amended from time to time, and the rates have been increased.  Since 1920, it has been permissible for a solicitor, instead of furnishing a detailed bill in which each item is priced, to furnish a bill for a gross sum, at the same time informing his client that he may insist on having a detailed bill, and have this bill taxed.</P>
    <P>Bills of costs are taxed by two Taxing Masters of the High Court who are themselves solicitors.</P>
    <P>The new Order abolishes altogether the detailed priced list in respect of the work covered by Schedule II, while it does not abolish the scales fixed by Schedule I for sales, purchases, leases, etc.  A solicitor is in future to charge a gross sum which is to be fair and reasonable, regard being had to all relevant circumstances.</P>
    <P>No one would attempt to deny that a solicitor should be paid for his work whatever is fair and reasonable, but in the view of the Government the Order affords inadequate protection to the client.  There will now be no list of charges to which reference may be made in order to decide what is fair and reasonable.  The Taxing Masters have expressed the view that their work in taxing bills under the new Order would be made very difficult. Furthermore the client has no right to obtain at any stage details of the work which the solicitor claims to have done so as to enable him to decide for himself whether the charge is reasonable or not.  He may possibly get such <Col N="676" /> details by asking to have the bill taxed but by so doing he incurs the cost of taxation in addition to the amount of the bill itself, and even by doing this he cannot be sure that he will get the details he needs.  This is to be contrasted with the existing system under which the client may demand an item-ised bill and when he gets it he may possibly see that the bill is reasonable and agree to pay it without taxation, or if he wishes he may have it taxed.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the new Order safeguards the client by entitling him to ask for a certificate of the Incorporated Law Society that the charge is fair and reasonable, but there is a similar Order in England and the court there has pointed out a defect in this procedure inasmuch as the client has no means of seeing what information the solicitor furnishes to the law society or of questioning its accuracy.</P>
    <P>Another objection to the new Order is that&mdash;unlike its English counterpart &mdash;it applies to work already completed if a bill of costs has not yet been furnished. The reason for this is difficult to see.</P>
    <P>It must not be thought that the Government is totally opposed to any alteration of the existing Orders.  On the contrary, it recognises that a case can be made for some alterations. Unfortunately, the law at present does not enable the Oireachtas to amend the Order made by the committee. The Order may be allowed to stand or disallowed in whole or in part.  By disallowing the Order, the existing arrangements will be continued, but the way will be left open to the Incorporated Law Society, who proposed to the committee the making of the present Order, to come forward with other proposals which may be acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the pulse of the House is generally on this question, but it seems to me the decision of the Government is one of the most disquieting that members of the Oireachtas have ever experienced, if they appreciate fully the implications of this decision.  I feel this is not a matter on which the House should be divided.  We are&mdash;in the words of Mark <Col N="677" /> Antony&mdash;just plain men, not distinguished lawyers, not members of the particular profession which the Minister seems to indict in his efforts to amend the Order and we can only make the approach to the Minister's proposals that ordinary common-sense men would be competent to make.</P>
      <P>Briefly, what are the facts?  The Order does not apply to solicitors' costs generally.  The bulk of these are decided already by a procedure which is accepted and well-established.  The Order refers specifically to the costs incurred when I, as a countryman, go to my solicitor with a problem which I want him to resolve and it proposes to deal with the question of the costs due to him for that particular service. That is a close, intimate service; none is concerned but the client and his adviser.  The procedure has been that under the Act of 1881 the committee which is authorised to determine the method by which these costs are decided, has come to a decision and made an Order.  The committee is composed of the most distinguished men in the land&mdash;the Chief Justice, two judges of the High Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society.  Obviously they are not a partisan body.  That cannot be alleged.</P>
      <P>The President of the Supreme Court is a nominee of the present Government and I think all those who compose the committee hold office on the nomination of the present Government. They were invited to make an Order. Would anybody suggest that a group of distinguished citizens got together and without thought or examination made an Order which has been laid on the Table of the House and which we are expected either to accept or reject according to the line of reasoning pursued on this matter to-day?  I think it must be unexampled in the history of this State that men of such distinction in the legal profession would make an Order on a trifling matter like this &mdash;that is what it is in fact&mdash;and that the Government would interpose itself in this way and move to upset or amend the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people in this House and in the other House have experience of the allegations that have been <Col N="678" /> made against the Executive in many countries throughout the world.  It is one of the things the common people and ordinary parliamentarians are being continually warned against&mdash;this effort on the part of the Executive to reject the advice of the best authorities and to use the simple parliamentarians to carry their point of view.  All I can say is that it is a very bad example.  I do not know whether one can use words like &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; or not.  In a matter like this, when the Executive are rejecting the advice of people who occupy the most important posts in the judiciary, many of the common citizens must ask: &ldquo;Where are we going?  Who is leading us?&rdquo; The decision is extraordinary and unwise and sets a very bad example.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say a great deal on this because in many ways it is a professional matter, but I will have to ask what offence have the solicitors of this country committed that they must be indicted in this way?  I can go to a doctor and invite him into my home; I can go to my accountant and seek his advice as to whether I am liable to pay so much income-tax or not; I can go to engineers and members of other professions. It never seems to occur to the Government that they have any responsibility to protect me against the members of these other professions. It arises only in the case of solicitors.</P>
    <P>The solicitors' profession is a very highly respected one.  It has within its ranks many of our finest citizens.  We have been urging the establishment and operation of functional and vocational bodies.  We have taken the line in various statutes passing through the House of authorising these functional bodies to regulate their own affairs. We have done that in all cases except one&mdash;the solicitors' profession.  I do not know why.  There must be some reason and I should like to have it.</P>
    <P>When a person goes to an accountant about his income-tax, he is concerned with something very personal and intimate, just as intimate as anything that would take him to a solicitor.  As far as the Government are concerned, I have no protection in regard to any charge that may be imposed on me in <Col N="679" /> such a case.  In the same way, when the doctor comes into my home, it is a matter just as intimate, but no more intimate.  Yet none of these people is singled out in the way solicitors are singled out.</P>
    <P>From the information at my disposal &mdash;and the Minister has corroborated it &mdash;the solicitors' profession sought an interview with the Taoiseach and the Minister when they realised that the Order, which had been shaped by the committee agitating on the question of costs, was being challenged by the Government.  I do not think they came brandishing swords or with atomic weapons.  They came as reasonable people believing they had an argument to which reasonable people would listen.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I take it that this Order of the committee was made after hearing both sides of the case.  I cannot imagine how anybody could impose any sort of story on such people as the Chief Justice and get them to arrive at conclusions to be implemented in an Order, unless there was a very good reason for doing so.  As I say, an interview was sought with the Minister and the Taoiseach.  The Minister indicates that the discussions were agreeable, and while the Taoiseach indicated that they were not to go away with the impression that anything would be done, at least they were not turned away with a frown.</P>
    <P>Certain suggestions were made to the Taoiseach and the Minister.  These suggestions were put on paper and were in the nature of what the representatives of the Incorporated Law Society would speak of as &ldquo;additional safeguards&rdquo;.  This, I understand, is what they advised the Minister they were prepared to do:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We, the representatives of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, having full power from the council, which is the governing body of the solicitors' profession, to bind the council in any matters relating to the above Order, hereby undertake with the Government through you as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> 1.  If, at any time after the expiration of a period of 12 months from the date of the Order, there appears to be injustice to the public under its operation, the council will of their own motion or at the request of the Attorney-General refer the matter to the statutory body to make such amendments, if any, to the Order as may, after inquiry, appear proper to it or, if need be, to revoke the Order.</P>
    <P>2.  To make a disciplinary regulation under the Solicitors Act, 1954, providing that a bill of costs furnished under the Order shall contain a notification of the right of the client (a) to obtain free of charge from the council a certificate of the reasonableness or otherwise of the charge and/or (b) to have the bill taxed by the Taxing Master.</P>
    <P>Signed, Seán Ó hUadhaigh, A. Cox, G.G. Overend, Ralph Walker and Eric A. Plunkett, Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That sounds a fair and reasonable attitude on the part of the Incorporated Law Society.  Somebody is unreasonable, but it is not the Incorporated Law Society.  The people who are unreasonable in this matter are creating a dangerous precedent.  If they can do this with the members of one profession, they can do it with the members of another.  Where does it all end?  Is it the Civil Service which is trying to inject itself into the minds of the Executive in order to commit the country to a new policy of interference between the citizens and the members of the professions, a policy of which the country has had no experience in the past?</P>
    <P>Some people may think there is a necessity to protect the ordinary client from the risks he will run when he gets into the toils of a member of the solicitors' profession.  Who are the simple people of this country?  I do not think there is any countryman to-day who will go into a solicitor's office and, when he is asked to pay his bill, will not be competent to make up his mind whether the bill is high or low and, if he thinks the bill is too high, the countryman is quite competent in his <Col N="681" /> own way to find that out.  He will not be very long making such investigations as will enlighten him and enable him to see a way whereby that solicitor will be reproved.</P>
    <P>We are trying to protect people from themselves in such a way as is unworthy of the individual.  The individual is better able to mind his own business than the Government is in its domain in many respects, and you cannot save the people from everything all the time.  Give the people a chance. This is an effort of the Minister on a small matter.  I would suggest that the costs which will fall due under this particular clause of the Order are the least of the costs that a solicitor will collect.  I cannot understand why the Minister is introducing an amendment to this Order and I would hope that those Senators, who, like myself, have no training as lawyers and cannot be described as having to speak for members of the legal profession, would voice their opinion on this issue as I have voiced mine.  I think it is very unwise for the Minister to proceed with the amendment but, above all, I think he should have given us a better chance to investigate all the implications behind this Order before asking us to take it to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order before the House to-day is an extremely important Order which affects a great many people in this country.  I agree with Senator Baxter that the revocation of this Order is not a matter to be undertaken without the fullest consideration. It affects the prosperity of one branch of the legal profession.  It affects the costs of litigation, or rather of professional consultations.  It affects the relationship between solicitor and client, and above all, it affects the status of the independent statutory body, set up by statute, to investigate cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a lengthy investigation, in which all sides were heard, certain recommendations were made.  With only two days' notice, before members of the Seanad had time to gather their material together, they were informed that the Government had decided to ignore and reject this recommendation <Col N="682" /> which I certainly regard as having the same status and the same claim to consideration as at least a judgment of the High Court.  Three eminent judges have expressed their opinions on what is a legal matter.  The Seanad is now asked, without any convincing reasons I fear being advanced so far by anybody, to reject this finding of the tribunal and to throw this whole question of solicitor and client relations into a confusing position again.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for taking up a little time on this matter because I think a very important duty of the Seanad is to try to protect the liberty of the citizens in this country.  One of the most valuable functions which Seanad Éireann has performed was the setting up of the Statutory Orders Committee which has acted as a watchdog on the Executive.  Since that committee was set up, the various Departments of State have been anxiously concerned not to do anything not within their powers.  I do not suggest in this case that the Minister has done anything to exceed his statutory powers. He is entirely within them but I think the Seanad is entitled to be told all the issues involved in this matter.  I do not think the Seanad has been told all the issue involved, by the Minister in his opening statement to-day.</P>
    <P>If I had come here to-day without any professional information on this subject, I do not feel I would be very much convinced by what I heard on the part of the Minister, that this eminent body should be capriciously set aside by the Seanad at two days' notice.  Most of the members of the Seanad had no time to study the issues involved and I feel I am doing a public duty in putting forward the history of this matter in so far as I know it.</P>
    <P>In February of this year the Incorporated Law Society, acting under the Solicitors' Remuneration Act, put an application before the statutory body set up to hear applications of this kind. The solicitors' profession is unique in that alone amongst all others must its practitioners charge for their services to clients by submitting very lengthy and detailed bills of costs in which every item is set out fully.  This method <Col N="683" /> of presenting costs dates back to the days when solicitors were very little removed from scriveners.  In later days this method of presenting costs has become antiquated in the light of modern conditions.</P>
    <P>The Order we are discussing refers only to a very small part of solicitors' costs.  Costs of conveyancing are fixed on a scale based on the amount of the purchase money.  Where there is actual litigation costs are subject to taxation. What this Order refers to is known as solicitor and client costs covering advice.  This embraces such matters as administration of estates, wills, the formation of companies and legal advice on a great number of matters. This Order covers only a very small part of solicitors' work as a whole.</P>
    <P>This application was made in February and I am not going to weary the Seanad by a summary of the case which was made by the solicitors' profession before the statutory body. Some of the issues are slightly technical and perhaps I might not explain them very clearly.  This application was heard by this statutory body which is a body of quite unusual prestige.  I am in contact with other bodies of this kind, visitors to universities and professional bodies of that nature, but I do not think there is any professional body in Ireland which has a greater prestige than that composed of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Senior Judge of the High Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that a body of this kind would make a suitable recommendation.  One would have thought that a body of three eminent judges, drawn from the other branch of the legal profession, with no trade union or professional feeling, together with the President of the Incorporated Law Society, would have been at least as competent to judge the correct relationship between solicitor and client as, with all respects to him, the Minister for Justice.  Having considered this matter, with we must assume all parties having been heard, an Order was made in the terms <Col N="684" /> which we have before us in the Seanad and a copy of the Order was sent by the statutory body to the Department of Justice in July, 1957.</P>
    <P>This is November.  The Department of Justice has had the whole of summer and autumn to consider this matter. Two days ago, there suddenly appeared on the Order Paper of this House&mdash; the Dáil not sitting this week&mdash;the surprise item which we are now debating.</P>
    <P>If the Minister urges that the reason for pushing this through with great haste is that only two days are left in which it can legally be done, I suggest the blame lies with the Department of Justice, which had months and months in which the matter could have been brought before the Dáil.  The Seanad has not been sitting since the summer, but the Dáil has.  There were ample opportunities of parliamentary debate before the middle of November.</P>
    <P>It was intimated that the statutory body proposed to sign the Order on 9th October.  It will be within the knowledge of Senators that, in July last, we received an anonymous communication on this matter from what we all know to have been interested parties.  On learning of that communication, the Incorporated Law Society sent an explanation&mdash;it is printed in their society's <i>Gazette</i>&mdash; which has been circulated, and which is in the possession of every member of the House.</P>
    <P>In September, the Incorporated Law Society sought to be received by the Department of Justice.  The Minister for Justice abruptly refused to receive them.  This highly important matter could, I take it, have been under consideration. There was plenty of time to consider it; there were all the empty summer months during which the Dáil and the Seanad were not sitting. However, in spite of its importance, the Minister for Justice could not find time to receive the Incorporated Law Society in the middle of the long vacation to discuss this highly important matter.</P>
    <P>I am not free to refer to certain communications which we know passed <Col N="685" /> between the Minister for Justice and the statutory body.  These are privileged documents.  We know that the correspondence took place.  One of the things I am doing this afternoon is pressing the Minister to produce these communications.  According to the information in my possession&mdash;if I am incorrect, the Minister can correct or contradict me, but, until I am corrected or contradicted, my information will be accepted by the Seanad&mdash;this eminently strong and reputable statutory body administered, through this correspondence to the Minister for Justice something in the nature of a snub. That may not be so.  If it is not, the rumour can be scotched by the production of the correspondence.</P>
    <P>The next stage in this extraordinary procedure was that, at the end of October, the Taoiseach received a deputation from the Incorporated Law Society.  At that interview, the Incorporated Law Society pointed out, amongst other things, that the Order had been made by the judges after the fullest consideration; that the same judges always have the power to alter or revoke it; that the Order refers only to non-contentious solicitor and client business; that it enables solicitors to effect economies in preparing bills of costs and puts them in the same position <i>vis-á-vis</i> their clients as accountants, barristers or other professional men; that the Order does not&mdash;and this is an important point&mdash; abolish taxation of costs; that clients will still, if this Order is passed, have the fullest right to taxation, as they have to-day.  In addition, they have the right to have a bill of costs presented under this Order examined by the Incorporated Law Society.  If the Incorporated Law Society comes to the conclusion that there is anything in the nature of gross overcharging, the solicitor is submitted to disciplinary inquiry as a result of which he can be very severely punished by his own professional body.</P>
    <P>This method, which is regarded as so reprehensible by the Minister and his Department, has operated quite successfully in England since 1953.  It has partially operated in Northern Ireland since 1955.  If any person in <Col N="686" /> this House or if the Minister has reason to believe that the operation of this system in England and in Northern Ireland has caused hardship to clients, he could, perhaps, give some evidence of it in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>My information is that people in England have been very pleased with the operation of this new system and that the cost of legal advice, far from being greater, is probably reduced. The Taoiseach stated that the Government was unwilling to accept the recommendations of the statutory body.  As has already been stated, certain undertakings were given to the Taoiseach by the Incorporated Law Society on behalf of the society&mdash; undertakings which one would have thought would advance the matter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, apparently, as far as one can gather, discussed the matter&mdash; argued the various matters involved&mdash; and the Incorporated Law Society made certain proposals which I need not read in detail as they have already been read.  The Taoiseach then suggested that these might be amended in some minor particulars.  The second communication from the Incorporated Law Society accepted these amendments.</P>
    <P>One would have thought, as there was no further communication from the Taoiseach, from the Minister for Justice or from any other Government Department, that, when the Taoiseach suggested amendments to the Incorporated Law Society's proposals, the Taoiseach was satisfied regarding his objections to the Order.  But no. Another period of silence prevailed. The profession was left in complete ignorance of its fate until two days ago when, greatly to my surprise and that of other members of this House, we received&mdash;after the provisional Order Paper had been circulated late last week&mdash;by post on Monday morning a supplementary motion which is now being discussed, at two days' notice, that the Seanad should be called on to reverse the findings of this eminent body of judges and capriciously throw all their work on the scrapheap.  No reason was given in the notice of motion&mdash;and to me, at least, no very convincing reason was given <Col N="687" /> in the Minister's speech.  That is the state of affairs to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to make one or two points for the benefit of those Senators who, through no fault of their own, have not had sufficient time to study this matter.  The literature in regard to it was circulated to Dublin Senators only in the last couple of days.  I consider it but fair to the House that one or two of the issues involved should explicitly be studied.  As I have said, in the first place, the right to taxation of costs is not abolished.  Every person will still have the right to have his costs taxed.  The safeguards in this proposed Order are fully set out in the communication of the Incorporated Law Society which was issued in response to the anonymous communication which was circulted to Senators on behalf of the interested parties in July.</P>

      <P>The Senator will arrange to leave the document in the Library&mdash;the document from which he is quoting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This document is probably in the Library.  It is the <i>Gazette</i> of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  In paragraph 5 of this communication the Incorporated Law Society states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the present system if a client feels that he has been overcharged his only redress is to have the bill taxed.  This will involve him in expense if less than one-sixth is taxed off, as he will then be liable for the costs of taxation.  The Order contains the following provisions for the protection of clients:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The client will have the right to apply to the Incorporated Law Society for a certificate, which must be given free of charge stating whether the amount of any bill is or is not fair and reasonable, and, if too high, what substituted sum would be a fair and reasonable charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The client will still have the right to have the bill of costs taxed by application direct to the Taxing Master of the High Court whether <Col N="688" /> or not he has already obtained a certificate from the Law Society. The Taxing Master on such a reference will deal with the matter independently.</P>
    <P>(c)  On any taxation of a bill it will be the duty of the solicitor to satisfy the Taxing Master as to the fairness and reasonableness of his charge.</P>
    <P>(d)  If the Taxing Master allows less than one-half of the amount charged he must bring the facts of the case to the attention of the Incorporated Law Society which may result in disciplinary action against the solicitor.</P>
    <P>(e)  The right of appeal from the Taxing Master to the court will remain.</P>
    <P>A solicitor furnishing a bill of costs will know that it is subject to these tests.  The Law Society on reference to them and the Taxing Master on taxation will be entitled to all necessary information including the solicitor's files and documents to enable them to judge the reasonableness of the charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were agreed by the Incorporated Law Society in October in deference to the Taoiseach's expression of opinion, further safeguards for the protection of clients.  These are contained in a letter dated 29th October, in which the following undertakings were made:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If at any time after the expiration of a period of 12 months from the date of the Order, there appears to be injustice to the public under its operation the council will of their own motion or at the request of the Attorney-General refer the matter to the statutory body to make such amendments, if any, to the Order as may, after inquiry, appear proper to it or, if need be, to revoke the Order.</P>
    <P>To make a disciplinary regulation under the Solicitors Act, 1954, providing that a bill of costs furnished under the Order shall contain a notification of the right of the client (a) to obtain free of charge from the council a certificate of the reasonableness or otherwise of the charge <Col N="689" /> and/or (b) to have the bill taxed by the Taxing Master.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I really feel, as a member of the public, as a person who has to consult solicitors occasionally professionally, that the interests of the clients are fully protected by these arrangements. You must remember that the statutory body consists of three members of the Bar&mdash;three judges&mdash;and only one solicitor. The suggestion that this Order is making the solicitors judges in their own cause is completely without foundation. The Incorporated Law Society has appeared before this tribunal which contains only one member of the solicitors' profession as against three members of the Bar.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say any more.  I think I have said enough to indicate to impartial Senators, who have not perhaps the same knowledge of the legal profession that I happen to have, that this Order is eminently reasonable and that, if the Seanad is now, without full debate and without convincing reasons being offered, to reverse the judgment of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the senior judge, they really are doing something which, in my opinion, will do much to undermine faith and confidence in the position of the judges and in the impartiality of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak as an Independent on this motion and look at it as such without any prejudice in the matter.  It seems to me that the Seanad has two clear duties to perform in this very crucial decision which it has to make this afternoon.  Their duty as Senators, as it seems to me, is to ask whether this Order will do any injustice to the public at large and, secondly, if it will victimise any special group of citizens. If either of those charges can be proved it is the duty of Senators to reject the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No case of any strength has been made purporting to show that either of those possible injustices will be performed.  The Minister did say&mdash;and this is really the only argument which has been put before the House in <Col N="690" /> favour of the motion&mdash;that the Order will give inadequate protection to the client.  I have tried to view this as calmly and impartially as I can.  I cannot see how any reasonable man, who has read through the Order, together with the undertakings given by representatives of the solicitors' profession, can say there is not adequate protection for the client. There is, in my opinion, very clear and adequate protection.</P>
    <P>There was one thing the Minister said that leaves me with a trace of disquiet. He said the client cannot get information about what precise items are supplied to the Incorporated Society by the solicitor.  I see one slight danger there, but I do not think any Order could be drafted which would be entirely perfect and to reject the Order on that small point I think would be foolhardy and rash.</P>
    <P>There are three very good reasons why we should accept this Order and three very good reasons why we should not reject it.  As a layman considering the position&mdash;and most of us are in the position of being laymen&mdash;I can see three points emerging in favour of the Order.  What appeals to me first of all is that there appears to be a movement in it towards simplification and modernisation of method in this very complicated and troublesome world.  It is particularly hard on any profession in these complicated times to have to produce long lists, items and charges, particularly at a time when, as a memorandum has said, in most solicitors' offices overhead charges are particularly heavy.  As citizens of the country, in a time involving the pressure of modern complications of business, when we see a chance of simplification and modernisation and of relieving any body of citizens of an unnecessary burden of detail, I think we should, <i>ipso facto</i>, be in favour of it.  I think this Order is in this way a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The second reason is this: why should we tie the hands or, if you like, continue to keep the hands tied, of one particular profession in the country when every other profession, as far as we know, is entirely free in <Col N="691" /> this matter?  Senator O'Brien told us that the reason is an historical one.  It appears that at one time the solicitors' profession was not one which could be entirely trusted.  In my view that reason has been completely removed. At the moment very severe tests and very high qualifications are demanded before a man can become a solicitor. Why should we treat them as if they were petty clerks, in the year 1957? That is really what it amounts to.  It is a matter of untying hands that have been tied for 100 years for historic reasons now obsolete.  Why should solicitors not have complete equality? I can see no reasonable answer to that unless someone says it means that the public are going to be fleeced.  I see no indication of that.</P>
    <P>A third reason in favour of this Order, as Senator Professor O'Brien has pointed out, is there has been legislation of exactly the same kind in England within the last few years.  In 1953 legislation of this kind was introduced, and since 1953 there have been approximately only 130 objections, I am informed, to bills supplied by some 20,000 solicitors in Great Britain&mdash;in the last three or four years 130 objections to the bills of this kind supplied by solicitors amounting to 20,000.  In this country I believe there are something like 1,100 to 1,200 solicitors and if there are to be objections in the same proportion the amount would be infinitesimally small.  Those are the three reasons, and I think they are strong ones, why I think we should accept the Order&mdash;the improvement in simplification and modernisation, the granting of equal rights to an honourable profession and our keeping up with enlightened legislation in a neighbouring country.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that equally strong reasons against accepting the motion, that is against refusing to accept this Order, can be advanced.  Senator Professor O'Brien has mentioned one point and I will mention it again.  In my opinion it is a matter of the greatest gravity.  The stability of our State depends partly on the job we are doing in the Legislature, it depends partly on the prestige and confidence of the judicature, <Col N="692" /> and partly on the civil servants and the Executive.  If one of those four cardinal supporting columns, supporting the stability of the body politic, is shaken by direct action of the Government, it undermines the stability of the State.  I am quite certain about that. There is the need for the greatest respect, greatest delicacy and negotiation between the people who constitute those main columns that support the body politic.</P>
    <P>If this Order is rejected it will amount to a rebuff&mdash;I will not say insult, I think that would be too strong a term&mdash;to the judicature in a matter that will subtly but effectively do a good deal of harm.  We must maintain the prestige of the courts, as we must maintain the prestige of the Legislature. I do not think this will help to maintain the prestige of the courts. Secondly, if we reject the Order it will be a slur on an honourable profession. There is no point in disguising the fact that the only ultimate reason why one should reject this Order is fear that the solicitors will exploit it to fleece the public.  I can see no other practical reason for rejecting this Order.  I am quite sure that springs from a very ancient prejudice against lawyers, which I am quite sure is unfounded. But there will be people throughout the country who will rub their hands and say: &ldquo;There is a knock for the fleecing solicitors&rdquo; if this Order does not go through.  I think that would be a very great pity.  It would be another step in undermining the prestige of the law which is so important at this very moment in this country.  That is the second reason why I do not think this Order should be rejected.</P>
    <P>Thirdly&mdash;and this concerns us particularly in this body&mdash;if the Seanad, inadequately briefed as it has to be in this case, not having had sufficient time to think the matter over and consider the implications and discuss it with the people involved, makes up its mind against the considered opinion of the judges and solicitors, I can only say we are open to the gravest charges of acting injudiciously and hastily.  I agree with Senator Baxter that this matter should have been adjourned. With such short notice and with such <Col N="693" /> insufficient time we cannot accept the view of an inexpert body, which the Government is in this case, against the expert body which the judges are.  If we must make our decision now it must be on the side of the judges; otherwise I do think we will be accused of rash and inadequately briefed action.</P>
    <P>A final point which I would like to make is in regard to the speed with which this motion is brought before the House and the fact that we have had insufficient time to gather information about it.  I should like to ask the Minister if he will accept the request from Senator Professor O'Brien, to which I add my own voice, to produce the correspondence between the judges concerned and the Ministry in this matter.  It is just another example of how inadequately we have been informed. We wish to see that correspondence and we feel we cannot make up our minds until we are properly informed. If it is possible I think we should even adjourn now until we hear that correspondence from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent to anybody who is used to seeing the Seanad in session that this motion, under the name of Senator Kissane, has rather shocked the House in an unusual manner.  I might say that the Seanad by now should be used to being shocked and abused but I am afraid that this is really an all-time high.  It is becoming increasingly apparent as this debate, which is so one-sided, goes on.  Not only is it due to the public that they should know what the Order means but it is due to the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland that it should be revealed what they are doing is quite in order and quite right.  I think the public should be quite satisfied, as I feel the Government should be satisfied when it has the imprimatur of the judiciary itself, when you have the Chief Justice and the other judges having given their sanction to this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> I am afraid that the Minister, first of all, has not given us very much information on the motion.  He has not, in fact, brought it here to give us food for debate.  In fact, this motion was thrown on the Table and the House was asked to pass it.  What is most frightening about the matter is that it will probably be passed by the Minister's Party which is in the majority.  That is the machinery under which we work nowadays and which leaves very little room for individual thinking.</P>
    <P>I think it a tragedy that this motion should be passed to-day merely on the strength of governmental support in the House.  It is a fact that in the debate up to now not one single speaker from the Government side of the House opened his mouth.  In other words, Senators are being treated merely as ciphers.  It gives me and the people outside the impression that the case is not a good one and that there is something to be hidden.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House and independent Senators have complained that we have no information on this subject and I do not know if the people on the Government side of the House have any information.  This is rather a minor matter, but it carries major implications.  The charges imposed in connection with this particular case are comparatively minor ones and relate only to charges between willing clients who may choose selected solicitors to act for them.  If I go to a surgeon in Merrion Square I may be prepared to pay 25 guineas, whereas I may pay another man only ten guineas. This allows for a certain discretion in regard to quality.  It also gives clients the choice to avail of a solicitor who may be better than another.</P>
    <P>I think it is a fault in the solicitors' profession&mdash;it does not exist in any other profession&mdash;that, no matter how good a solicitor is, he is entitled to get only the same fees as the worst man in the profession.  The case against the proposal before the House has been very well made by those who have spoken already.  I do not want to cover the ground upon which they have trodden but I feel there are three points I should like to stress and which <Col N="695" /> struck me in this particular case.  The points I make are in addition to those which have already been made by other speakers.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling it was thought that the Seanad was an easy place to get this motion through.  Why did it not come before Dáil Éireann last week when there was plenty of time to have the matter examined and properly presented?  It is brought into the Seanad in a hurry to-day.  We have had many things brought in by Ministers and by all Governments in such a manner before.  The matter under consideration has been given very little examination and I cannot help feeling that it was thought an easy way to get this thing through to-day.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;contemptible&rdquo; to describe the action of the Minister but it is a casual way of treating the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage we are entitled to ask the Minister for a lot more information. If we have any brains at all or any sense of dignity, we are entitled to be given more information and we should be given more facts than we have already received in order to give our decision.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien has already referred to very important correspondence that apparently passed between the Department of Justice and the judicial body which approved of this Order.  That correspondence is very vital because I gather that in that correspondence of the statutory body appears the answer to the objections made by the Government.  Surely such correspondence is most relevant since it contains all the factors upon which decisions were made.  We have not been told those.  We are merely asked to take the word of the Minister.  He knows quite well that at any given moment he need not answer us and his action will be supported by the votes of the people supporting the Government.  I think that is a pity.</P>
    <P>When I was on the other side of the House I voted for many things introduced by the Government with which I did not always agree.  The case at issue is one where everybody is competent to judge the rights and wrongs <Col N="696" /> of the case, given a proper picture of what he is asked to do.  I protest against the way in which this thing has been brought hurriedly before the Seanad.  We have been given very little information the whole day.  There has been hurry and scurry in regard to the matter and if the Seanad has not been treated in an underhand way it has certainly been treated in a cursory way.</P>
    <P>My other point concerns the question of the treatment of vocational bodies. For many years, both here and outside, I have fought for the recognition in a democratic country of the rights of vocational bodies.  Having regard to our particular philosophy, I believe that a very high degree of vocational organisation is a very good idea and a very beneficial one for a community such as ours.  Vocational bodies of all sorts have been growing up in this country, including farmers' associations, business associations and professional associations of every kind.  It is most important that Governments should take notice of such bodies and rely upon them to a great degree for information, guidance and help in the government of the country.  Ministers cannot be experts on farming, business, banking, the law or on the numerous other matters which are catered for by the many vocations that exist in the country.</P>
    <P>It is very important that vocational bodies should be properly regarded and treated.  The Incorporated Law Society of Ireland is surely a premier vocational body which in this case is doing something that has the acquiescence and support of the Chief Justice of the country and two other judges.  I think it is a most extraordinary state of affairs that the Government, in a hurried sort of way and without giving us any real reason for doing so, have completely ignored this body and is treating it in a most flagrant manner. That is a very important point for if such a vocational body is treated in such a way as that, what chance will less highly respected and less highly thought of bodies in the country have of getting a fair deal?  It is wrong that the Incorporated Law Society <Col N="697" /> should find itself treated in this manner.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to reiterate the point I made about the treatment of a judicial body in the way I mentioned. Over a period of years the tendency for the Executive&mdash;the Civil Service is also involved&mdash;is to have powers over the citizens and the lives of the citizens, to deny them the right of the protection of the courts.  We had many Orders under the Emergency Powers Act and so on and there is an increasing tendency to ignore the courts and the judiciary.  I think that is a very dangerous thing.  I had hoped it was on the way out with the removal of the Emergency Powers Act but that mentality still lingers on and it breaks out in very many cases which come before us in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Although this is only an indirect example of that kind of thing, by ignoring what the Chief Justice and other eminent judges do and ignoring the imprimatur which they have put on this Order, the Government is weakening the respect that is due to the judiciary&mdash;not only weakening the respect but also weakening the powers.  For these reasons, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this motion.  Even on the ground of affording people a better opportunity of having the whole position properly explained to them thereby enabling them to a better understanding of it, I think the Minister ought to withdraw or postpone this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am another of those who, unfortunately, got no notice of this motion being on the Agenda to-day.  I did not get the Order Paper for to-day at my usual address.  I had only the provisional Order Paper and, on that, this motion was not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complicated matter and one upon which it would take Senators some time to make up their minds. Apart from the very full statement of Senator O'Brien I had very little idea of what this proposal referred to because I had no time in which to make inquiry or to consider the matter.  I am surprised that the Minister did not see his way either to adjourn or postpone this matter for a day or two to enable Senators to consider it.  The <Col N="698" /> Minister's statement was not a very full one.  If he could even intervene now and explain to us that he had certain correspondence with the statutory body and that the Government disagreed on certain points and was determined to hold to its view, that would be of some help to Senators because they would know exactly the points at which disagreement arose.</P>
    <P>Apparently the gist of the Order is that solicitors charge a lump sum or present a detailed account.  Equally apparently, the Government wants a detailed account.  I know from experience that most country solicitors have, at the outset of a case, to give the client a lump sum figure.  Country clients come in and ask how much will prospective litigation cost and the cuter ones will go to other solicitors in the town and ask them how much such litigation will cost.  Perhaps the Government thinks that there are still clients who can be fooled.  I would like to take this opportunity of assuring the Government that there are not very many such left.</P>
    <P>I know for a fact that the solicitors' profession has gone to a great deal of trouble recently to improve the standard of the profession on their own behalf and on behalf of the public generally.  I regard this proposal as rather an insult to them.  The Order in question came before that very eminent body and the main points incorporated in it were suggested by solicitors.  It is, to say the least of it, a denigration of that body to reject the Order offhand, especially when one considers the way in which it has been brought before this House.  I hope that the Minister will tell us in detail where he and the Government disagree with this Order.  That is what we are waiting for from him.  I cannot see why the Government could not allow this Order to stand and amend it, if necessary, at a later date having discussed the entire matter with the statutory body.</P>

      <P>Speakers so far have, unfortunately, been beating the air. They have been indulging in shadow boxing since Senators do not really know what the Minister's objections are to the proposed Order.  If we did know we would be in a better position <Col N="699" /> to come to grips with the matter.  The Minister's opening statement was brief and prepared apparently with the same haste governing the appearance of this motion on the Order Paper to-day. The Minister in his opening statement might have referred to the statutory basis upon which Orders of this kind are made.  In that connection, it might be well that members should know, since there have been so many references to the Incorporated Law Society, how and in what manner the Incorporated Law Society comes into this.</P>
      <P>Solicitors' remuneration is governed by the Solicitors' Remuneration Act of 1881.  That Act authorises certain named members of the judiciary to make general Orders governing the regulation of fees in relation to the type of business mentioned in the Minister's statement.  In the Act the people designated are the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls.  In our modern circumstances these have been replaced by the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Senior Judge of the High Court.  Under the Act, which authorises these three judges, together with the President of the Incorporated Law Society, to make general Orders regulating the remunertion of solicitors, provision is made, and it is important that this should be borne in mind, whereby at least a month before the contemplated Order is made the Incorporated Law Society must be consulted, and that body is given liberty under the Act to make any suggestions which they think proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vitally important that the House should realise that the original statute, upon which the Minister is relying now for revocation of the Order, contemplates that the views of the Incorporated Law Society, the people whose livelihood is affected and the status of whose profession is likewise affected, should be obtained and borne in mind.  It is very regrettable, if not deplorable, that the Minister did not in July of this year see fit to meet the representatives of the Incorporated Law Society.  Apparently he got the views of the society in some way but, <Col N="700" /> as everybody knows, it is very difficult to express views cogently and coherently in a hasty memorandum as against full and free discussion.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that a body constituted under charter, and representing a very important arm of the legal profession, was not afforded an opportunity of meeting the Minister to discuss these matters.  Had that been done, some compromise acceptable to the society and to the Government could have been worked out.  At a later stage the Taoiseach met the representatives of the solicitors' profession and agreement was reached on certain points, but it was then too late to go back on the decision that had already been taken.</P>
    <P>The common-sense view has been expressed by a number of Senators who preceded me that there is no reason in principle why the solicitors' profession, any more than any other body of professional men or group of skilled craftsmen, should have to have their fees regulated.  Senator Cole has very properly remarked that what happens in many of these cases is that people go around to solicitors and find out what conveyancing, and so on, will cost them.  The public are not as gullible as it would seem to be suggested, that solicitors can charge them pretty well what they like and that people will pay up.  Therefore, having regard to the fact that the solicitors' profession is an honourable profession and that all solicitors are officers of the Supreme Court of Justice and are liable to disciplinary action as officers of that court, it is highly improper that they should be subjected to the kind of treatment that is perhaps proper to people who have not the same ethical standard that they possess.</P>
    <P>The difference between the procedure in operation up to the present time and what is proposed is merely to substitute a detailed means of computing costs in these non-contentious legal matters for the system of taxed costs as has been in vogue up to the present time.  I think that members of the public would much prefer to get a bill charging them £20, £30, or whatever was the proper charge for the amount of the work involved, than to get what <Col N="701" /> the Minister is insisting on, a long bill containing several pages itemising everything, which, to my mind, always leaves the impression on the person who has got the solicitor's services, that the solicitor is inflating his bill.  I think that in both cases the bill would come to the same amount but that the client would be much happier and feel that he was not being dunned for every single item when a bulk sum is agreed upon.  In that respect this Order is an improvement upon the existing position.</P>
    <P>It is a notorious fact&mdash;I think members of the House will agree with me&mdash;that where there are scales of charges fixed as the maximum charges, those maximum charges inevitably become the minimum charges.  It is the more so in the case of the solicitor's bill of costs because the amount of time involved in taking out each item and having these matters set down in such a way that they can stand up to examination before the taxing masters costs so much to solicitors that it inevitably increases the cost for the work done by him in a particular matter.  I submit to the House that, if a solicitor, having experience of what it costs to investigate the title in the sale of a particular property, suggests a round figure to his client, that is much more satisfactory than if he has to go through each item.  Very often it involves sending the matter to outsiders to draw up the bill and if that has to be done it increases the total cost.  If a solicitor can arrive at a lump sum and present that to his client, he will not have the extra cost involved in preparing the bill for taxation. In that way costs will actually be reduced for clients rather than increased as has been suggested in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>There is then the further question of competition between solicitors.  There is competition in every profession, just as there is in business.  In to-day's papers we have the Minister for Lands reported as talking about the importance of all-pervading competition in keeping down costs in business.  That all-pervading competition in this profession, the members of which have increased in numbers in recent years in <Col N="702" /> this country, will be very keen indeed and that competition will, I suggest, produce the effect that competition always produces in the matter of costs and prices&mdash;of keeping them down. That in itself is an adequate safeguard for members of the public.</P>
    <P>As regards the point raised by the Minister in his speech, that there would be difficulty afterwards in taxing costs if a member of the public were dissatisfied with the bill from a solicitor because he had only got a bill for a lump sum, I do not quite follow what the Minister has in mind.  It seems to me that if a member of the public has always a right to have his bill taxed, then the solicitor must always be in a position to produce these figures and must keep the records if he is to substantiate the bill which he submits to his client.  Therefore, I cannot see any difficulty in having the costs taxed.  However, in so far as the question of a lump sum is concerned, it is proper to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this is not the first time that there has been a departure from itemised costs.</P>
    <P>My understanding of the position is that the instructions fee in the bill of costs, where these costs arise out of court proceedings, is now a bulk sum, and that was heretofore calculated on the basis of a schedule item by item. That has worked quite satisfactorily and has not given any difficulty to the profession or created any undue hardship for the public, and this is an extension of that same principle.</P>
    <P>It has already been mentioned that the system proposed under the new Order is working satisfactorily in England and in Northern Ireland.  I cannot see any great difficulty being presented to the taxing masters in this matter, particularly in view of the fact that there has been a decrease in the number of bills submitted to the taxing masters for taxation.  In 1937 the number of bills certified by the master of taxation was 2,367 and in 1957 it is about half that number, 1,302.  If the number of bills coming before the taxing masters for examination is reduced they will have the time and opportunity for dealing with them if there is slightly more work involved. <Col N="703" /> Therefore, it does not seem to me that the Minister's argument is valid.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter wondered what was the real motive for putting down this motion and wondered whether it was due to particular influences.  I must confess that I cannot rid my own mind of the feeling that there is in the Government a certain prejudice against the legal profession and I feel that that has, to some extent, at any rate, coloured the action of the Government in relation to this motion.  I think it is extremely regrettable that prejudices of that kind, which are quite unfounded, should find their way into this House in the form of a motion which, as a number of people have suggested, is a disparagement, to say the least of it, of the people who made it.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the Constitution of this country provides for three arms of Government&mdash;the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.  The Judiciary is constituted with the primary function of safeguarding the rights of the people and they will safeguard those rights, whether it is between man and man, between citizen and citizen, between the Government and the governed, or otherwise.  The members of the Judiciary have wide experience in the matter of costs in litigation and the costs involved in legal processes generally.  This House should be very slow to set its opinion, based upon necessarily scanty consideration of the issues involved in this matter, against the weight of authority of leading members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>I cannot but feel, too, that the Minister in his opening remarks gave a hint of another possible reason behind this motion.  He examined the position with regard to costs in cases of litigation and he said that these costs were settled on a scale drawn up by a committee comprising members of the Judiciary, of the Bar and of the solicitors' profession.  This is, I think, the crucial matter: he added&mdash;and it is the fact&mdash;that these rules were subject to the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.  I feel that the Minister <Col N="704" /> has in some way taken umbrage at the fact that there is now, or there has been in existence since 1881, an Act which has remained unamended, which enables a body, independently of himself and his Department, to draft rules regulating solicitors' remuneration.</P>
    <P>I should be certainly much more convinced of the desire on the part of the Government to safeguard the rights of the public in what must necessarily be always a very small matter if the Government, after a period of nearly 20 years, had introduced a short amending Bill which would be necessary to give effect to one of the fundamental provisions of the 1937 Constitution.  Members of this House may not be aware that the 1937 Constitution set up courts, that these courts have not yet been brought into being under the 1937 Constitution and that we are still operating with the courts which were established under the Saorstát Éireann Constitution. That being the fact&mdash;and coupled with it the manner and mode of putting down this motion&mdash;it seems to me that there is somewhere a lurking feeling&mdash; it is very difficult to describe what the feeling is&mdash;against the Judiciary and the legal processes.  I think that is a most regrettable thing, particularly, as Senator Stanford remarked, at a time when it is necessary that there should be in this country the highest respect for our constitutional institutions and the various organs created by the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that there are two quite independent things before us this afternoon and it is rather difficult to keep them from being mixed up, because inevitably they are associated.  First of all, there is this question of the substance of the Order and the objections which the Legislature has to it, and which I do not think have been very clearly brought out.  This Order is to us as members of the Seanad a very interesting one.  It is an Order which I, for one, should like to have heard properly and symmetrically debated here and not treated, as it is at present, as if one were playing a game of chess with oneself.  I am sure there are many <Col N="705" /> things to be said on various aspects of it and that it has various implications, but we have not heard very much about it, because we have had so little time to get the information properly in line.  We have got information, but I am rather slow in assimilating and slow in digesting it.  We might have had a very pleasant week or two discussing this properly and learning something about it.  I hope the Minister will see his way for that to happen.</P>
      <P>The other point is the question of the responsibility of the Seanad in this type of situation.  I have been associated with this body for 14 years and it is a body I have become very fond of.  It is a body with its own characteristic climate, its own characteristic hopes, its own characteristic tradition and, I think, its own characteristic service to the State.  In many cases we work on what comes to us from the other House and we have had time to think things over.  There has been no general sense of danger, urgency or fire in the House when we are debating such matters.  On such occasions when things come up before us, we have a reasonable time to consider them.  Here, however, we have this motion coming very abruptly and suddenly and I am not at all clear as to the nature of the urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, we have protested against legislation in haste.  Very often it is necessary&mdash;there may be an invasion&mdash;and one just has to hasten the legislation, and perhaps it becomes legislation by panic.  I do not see any occasion for a motion in haste in connection with this matter.  I feel that the responsibility of the Seanad is really becoming involved in this and I hope Senators will stand up and say: &ldquo;Please give us some more time to consider this motion.&rdquo;  That point might be fairly put in regard to any hasty legislation.  This motion comes to us, however, with some august names attached to it and I should be very reluctant, indeed, to appear to be giving a judgment on a judgment, if I seem to be one of a body in accepting this motion and disallowing a general Order which comes to us with such very high credentials.  I do not <Col N="706" /> feel competent to oppose an Order like that and I hope the Minister will not put me and the Seanad in the position of having to accept that responsibility at short notice.  That is what I have the greater apprehension about, in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been waiting, as I suppose many Senators have, to hear the Government point of view put by some supporters of the Government in this House.  There have been now some seven speakers and nobody has put in a single word in favour of the Government.  I find it a bit disturbing to think that there is perhaps in this Seanad a majority of Senators who are prepared to say: &ldquo;We intend to vote for this because the Minister tells us to do so, through the Party Whips, though we do not really see anything that can be said in favour of it.&rdquo;  I say that is disturbing and I am very much afraid that is what will happen.  This will be steamrolled through in the face of the almost unanimous opposition of all who have spoken.  All the speeches so far have been critical, if not directly opposed: the only speeches have been in opposition. Yet a majority vote, with the Whips put on, will apparently be brought into play in support of the Minister, using Senators who have not been able to find anything to be said in favour of the Minister's point of view.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that this motion comes before this House alone.  It will not go to the Dáil.  It will not be debated in the Dáil.  It does not have to be, because of this method of meeting the situation by bringing this motion, very much at the last moment, before the Seanad, getting it over and done with before the Dáil can meet. It will not even be possible to put a question down in the Dáil and get an answer to that question, arising out of this matter, before the motion is passed and dealt with and the whole thing finished and done with.  I do not know whether even the Government supporters in the Seanad can feel too happy about such a situation as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not regard the issue as being <Col N="707" /> a very major one.  I think the phrase used by Senator McGuire was a good one.  It is a minor issue in one sense. The matter can be set right again, even if we pass this motion.  It is a minor issue but with major implications. The Minister is the only one on the Government side who has the power to change his mind here.  The Government supporters have not got that power, because of the presence of the Whips in this House, which is supposed to be a purely vocational body.  I would ask the Minister to think very seriously before he belittles the Legislature by putting on the Whips for a motion which is being debated in this way.</P>
    <P>It is the practice under our legislation, as a rule, when a statutory Order is to be made under some statute, to have a regulation made, or even to have incorporated in the statute a section which says that if the Order is not revoked by a resolution in either House within 21 sitting days&mdash;I think that is the usual term&mdash; then the Order shall stand.</P>
    <P>I was a little bit surprised when I read the motion, which came to us so belatedly, to notice that this was not a motion to revoke an Order but a motion requesting &ldquo;an opinion&rdquo; from the Seanad&mdash;&ldquo;that Seanad Éireann is of opinion that the Solicitors' Remuneration General Order, 1957, should be disallowed.&rdquo;  We are not asked to revoke it.  We are asked to express an opinion and we are asked &ldquo;to request the Government to disallow.&rdquo;  The Minister is asking the Seanad for its opinion and he has got it from seven speakers so far.  The opinion is that we in the Seanad are opposed to this motion.</P>
    <P>Why is the motion couched in these terms?  Why are we not asked just to revoke it?  The answer is, of course, that this is under a British Act&mdash;the Solicitors' Remuneration Act, 1881. Section 6 of that Act contains two subsections, one which says that such an Order when it is made must be laid before each House for a period of one month, and a second sub-section which says: &ldquo;If within that month an <Col N="708" /> address is presented to the Queen by either House seeking the disallowance of the Order&rdquo;&mdash;you see where the word &ldquo;disallowed&rdquo; came from&mdash;&ldquo;or part thereof, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by Order in Council, to disallow the Order&rdquo;, and so on.  That is the section under which we are talking here to-day.  That is why the Minister has only a month, and not 21 sitting days.  That is why the word &ldquo;disallowed&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;revoked&rdquo;.  This fact has not been adverted to so far.  Perhaps it is regarded as an awkward fact, but I feel that it should be mentioned when we are debating a motion in these terms.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour points that have already been excellently made, such as the fact that this Order was approved and made by the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society but it is worth stating that these three senior and very eminent judges, two of the Supreme Court and one of the High Court, plus the President of the Incorporated Law Society, have unanimously made a recommendation which we in this House are now being asked to set aside because the Minister asks us to do so, upon advice which so far he has not disclosed.  In other words, the Minister comes before us and says: &ldquo;I feel that these eminent judges are wrong and I am asking you, for not very clearly stated reasons, to set at naught their judgment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe that judges are infallible; I am not ready to say they should never be criticised, and I do certainly grant the Government the right in certain circumstances to differ from the findings of judges, but I am very impressed by both the persons and the unanimity of these eminent people on this issue; and I feel, as other Senators have felt, that the legal profession, much as we may like to abuse it and to make fun of it, is entitled to as much respect and as much consideration as the other professions.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that a doctor, a <Col N="709" /> dentist, an accountant or an architect has not got any statutory obligation to furnish his patient or his client with an itemised account for the fee which he charges for his professional services.  We may get operated on for appendicitis, but we do not ask the doctor to give us an exact account of the number of scalpels he used, and the size and the number of sponges.  We do not say: &ldquo;You charged me for six. I do not believe there were more than five used.  I should like to see an affidavit from the senior nurse present at the operation to make quite sure that six were used and not five&rdquo;.  That would be absurd.  Are we not, in fact, asking an equivalent absurdity of the legal profession, when we ask a solicitor to itemise every little action that he does on behalf of a client in a law case?  I think we are being absurd in just precisely that way.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I do not believe that were you to introduce legislation which would make it compulsory for doctors to itemise their every action at an operation, and so on, it would give any increased protection whatsoever to the patient.  All it would do would be to consume considerably more of the doctor's time, make him employ people to copy these things out and would, in fact, put increased expense upon the patient.  I believe that one of the effects of this Order which has now been made, and which we are asked to request the Government to disallow, would be to make things cheaper for a client.</P>
    <P>I speak on the subject as a layman, of course.  I am impressed by the fact that this has been working well, apparently, in England since 1953, without there being a major outcry against it, and without, apparently, the Minister being able to quote any considerable body of reputable opinion that feels that it has not been a good thing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has documentary evidence that this has not been working well for the client in England, he should not withhold it from the Seanad.  If he has not got such evidence, then I feel the Order is supported by that very lack of evidence of general disapproval in England.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> Now, it is quite obvious that under this Order the client has two very clear remedies if he is not satisfied with the solicitor's bill.  Under this Order he has two remedies: (1) he can appeal&mdash; and the solicitor knows that when he is sending out the account&mdash;to the Council of the Law Society; and the solicitor has to justify his bill to that council.  I am quite sure the Minister will not suggest that the Council of the Law Society would be so crooked in their dealings with the laity, as it were, as to tolerate the faking of professional accounts by a solicitor in order to swindle a client.  I do not believe that.  I believe that this in itself constitutes a sufficient remedy&mdash;the fact that every solicitor knows that the client can appeal and can appeal free, at no cost.  The second remedy is that he can appeal, this time with a charge in the event of his not being justified, to a taxing master and have the costs taxed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Incorporated Law Society has offered&mdash;that is one of the concessions they made willingly to the Government who objected to the original form and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;to make a disciplinary regulation under the Solicitors Act of 1954 providing that a bill of costs furnished under the Order shall contain a notification of the right of the client (a) to obtain free of charge from the council a certificate of the reasonableness or otherwise of the charge, and/or (b) to have the bill taxed by a taxing master.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the client will have two remedies, and every solicitor will have an obligation under the Order to attach to his bill an explanation of the two remedies that the client has, in the event of his not being satisfied with the amount he is being charged. I feel that that is eminently reasonable. If the new Order is open to objection and if it happens that certain defects are discovered in practice, I think the way to discover such defects is to allow the Order to be implemented and see how it works out in practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that under the Order the client &ldquo;cannot get the details&rdquo; of his account.  I do not feel that that is common sense at all.  I <Col N="711" /> find myself very much in sympathy with Senators who have suggested that the ordinary client, if he is not satisfied he is being charged a fair amount, will demand details and will, in fact, get them, just as easily as he will get them in connection with his grocery account, without any statutory regulation. Who wants to itemise every bill? That will be the position if we fail to let this Order go through.  I feel such a statutory obligation is an enormous, cumbersome mechanism in our legal system, and I feel this Order by abolishing it for certain costs is improving the position for the client.</P>
    <P>The other undertaking that the Council of the Incorporated Law Society gave&mdash;I think it has already been mentioned and I shall not read it in full&mdash;is that if within 12 months of the date of this Order it transpired that injustice is being done to the public they take it upon themselves to refer the matter to the statutory body with a view to having the Order amended.  I think that that is a very fair offer, and I feel that if in practice there is any demonstrable injustice, it can easily be righted in that way. These are honourable men, and they give this honourable undertaking.</P>
    <P>Apparently that is being set aside by the Minister, and the statutory body, it has been suggested, has written, apparently, a confidential letter to the Minister on all this matter.  Is the Minister really asking us here to decide on this issue while concealing from us the contents of this letter, which, in my opinion, has no right to be considered as being confidential? Why should we be prevented from knowing the terms of this letter?  I can only guess that, perhaps, its terms make it quite obvious that the Minister, in trying to squash this Order, is acting in a most injudicious and ill-advised way and therefore he will not give the House the contents of the letter which have already been asked for by several Senators.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point, or some justification from him of this treatment of such a letter as being confidential and incapable of being revealed to this House when we are <Col N="712" /> being asked to make a request to the Government.</P>
    <P>I feel some puzzlement as to where the opposition to this Order has come from.  Why, when certain amendments were suggested by the Taoiseach and the Government and met apparently by the statutory body, is there suddenly this last-minute opposition?  Who is it who could really believe that a statutory obligation placed upon a solicitor to fill in long detailed lists in an itemised account would save anybody money?  I believe that such a belief could only reside in the innocent heart of a civil servant.  I do not think anybody outside the Civil Service could really believe that an obligation on a solicitor to send in perhaps ten foolscap pages of itemised detail such as: &ldquo;To attendance on client by telephone, 6/8; to taking up pen in left hand, 6/8, to transferring it from left hand to right hand, 6/8; to appending signature with right hand, 6/8,&rdquo; would save money.</P>
    <P>I think that that kind of an itemised account frightens a client and gives a false impression of the work of the solicitor.  Who can say that ten foolscap pages of that kind of thing will save time or money either for the legal profession or for the client?  That sort of view, that if you can force people to fill in long lists you will save money in some way, can only he held by the innocent hearts of civil servants.</P>
    <P>I have a great respect for civil servants and particularly for those with innocent hearts, but I feel in this case they are mistaken, and so far from money being saved by such a statutory obligation it will be wasted. I have seen some of these long bills of costs&mdash;not, I am glad to say, in a personal capacity, but as a member of various boards&mdash;and I have been staggered at the wealth of detail the solicitors put into them.  It is a needless waste of everybody's time; it does not impress anybody.  In fact, they have the reverse effect, and many solicitors, even under the present rules, are not now giving an itemised account unless specifically requested to do so.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, we should accept the Order as it stands, and accept the <Col N="713" /> assurance of the Incorporated Law Society Council that if at the end of a year injustice is shown to have been done, they are prepared to propose an amendment.  I feel that for us to do anything else would be supremely injudicious. In the circumstances we have two alternatives, one, to quash the Order&mdash;and that is what the Government is asking us to request&mdash; and to throw it back, as it were to the statutory body contemptuously, and ask them to try again, and that, without any clear indication of what is worrying us.</P>
    <P>The second alternative is to let the Order stand and be amended, if necessary, in 12 months in the light of experience. This course seems to me to be the one that commends itself to our common sense, and I personally, therefore, shall vote against this motion if it is put to a vote of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I might best start, as Senator Sheehy-Skeffington did, by referring to what is the constitutional position in this country. There is no doubt, no matter how we may try to avoid it, that it is involved in this matter.  This country is what is called a unitary State.  Despite that fact, we have here the usual pillars of democratic society, that is to say a Legislature, represented by the two Houses of the Oireachtas; an Executive, represented by the Government which operates in the main through the Civil Service; and a system of justice, the rule of law, which operates through the judiciary.</P>
      <P>It is not for the purpose of opposition or for the purpose of being difficult that we have heard every speaker, except the Minister, getting up and drawing the attention of the House to the fundamental rights people have. The Minister gave his reasons for his hurry coming here to-day.  I doubt if he is correct.  I notice this evidence of hurry on the part of the Executive.  I am extremely doubtful if it comes from the Minister's Government.  I would say that the Civil Service had better be careful about being in a hurry, or it may find itself in a position where it will not have any rights to hurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed wide evidence of the <Col N="714" /> Civil Service arrogating to itself rights it has not got, setting itself up with functions and making references in public to matters it has no right to mention.  I can give evidence of that if it is required.  It is extremely objectionable that there should be this kind of hurry.  I referred to it on another occasion.  The first people to suffer in this country as regards their rights&mdash;and they are considerable&mdash; would be the civil servants.  They would be taken from them more rapidly than anybody else if we got this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister gave us the minimum notice.  I noted the phrase he used that &ldquo;normal notice was given.&rdquo;  Normal notice of this matter was not given.  It is not normal in an important matter of this sort to give three or four days' notice. Actually, I did not get mine until Monday morning, but I do not want to make any point of that.  I went out early to my home and I did not get back until that evening.  It does limit the time one has to prepare material on the subject.</P>
    <P>The most important point the Minister made about the reason for his hurry was that he could not get any firm interpretation of this antiquated statute, Section 6 of the Solicitors' Remuneration Act, 1881.  The case he makes is that the time must run from the day the Order was sent to the Clerk of the Dáil.  Suppose this body, as it was quite entitled to do, had made the Order on 1st of August? Would this House or the Dáil have been called back for the purpose of rescinding it?  That is implicit in it.</P>
    <P>I suggest you can argue&mdash;I am as much entitled to my opinion as the Minister&mdash;that the 30 days should run from to-day, being the first sitting day of the House.  To be fair to the Minister, he did not pretend he had a firm opinion; he was making sure of his position as the Executive.  Further evidence of the hurry I spoke about comes from the fact that the Executive would not tolerate the position that they would have to wait a year. Although they got certain guarantees, they were not prepared to tolerate that position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Why, one asks oneself, is the Executive so keen on bringing the motion to rescind this Order before this House rather than before the Dáil?  I think there is a reason.  It is that in this House there is no practising solicitor. There are a number of them on both sides of the Dáil.  In this House, there are few practising barristers.  There are a big number of them in the other House.  I think this was a method of avoiding a serious and acrimonious debate in the Dáil.  We are more docile in this House; we are not so truculent about our opinions as perhaps are the people in the Dáil; but that is no reason why we should not put forward our opinions on an occasion like this in the most vociferous and determined way.</P>
    <P>I propose to go on to deal with a matter which certainly caused me a great deal of concern at the time.  It is the anonymous communication which every member of the House received during the summer and to which we subsequently received a reply from the Incorporated Law Society.  I propose to go through the document in detail.  I do not suggest that the Government paid undue attention to this communication.  From the statements made by the Taoiseach in the interviews he had and from the various messages he conveyed, it was quite obvious he was very concerned.  However, I still would like to know why, last Friday, the Government took a decision that they would have this Order rescinded.  We really have not the evidence.</P>
    <P>In any event, I propose to go through this anonymous communication paragraph by paragraph.  It is not on record.  It is in the <i>Gazette</i> of the Incorporated Law Society, but that is not a journal that circulates amongst many people.  This is the communication:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Solicitors' Remuneration Order, 1957</P>
    <P Just="Center">New System and Methods of Charging Costs by Solicitors</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society of Ireland (the professional association <Col N="716" /> of all solicitors in the Republic of Ireland) having made application to the Superior Courts Rules-making Committee an Order entitled as above was approved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, that is not strictly correct. It was considered at the time; it was not approved.  No Order is approved until it is made.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Order when it has been laid on the Table of Dáil Éireann automatically becomes law on the expiration of one month.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Order is to remove all limitation on the amount a solicitor may charge to his client for services rendered to clients in all matters, other than costs payable by the third parties in proceedings before the courts, and is in fact assumption of unbridled control of their own remuneration by solicitors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, was an outrageous statement, entirely contrary to the facts.  As has been pointed out, the Order does not apply to conveyancing where the normal scale of fees is fixed on the amount of the purchase money, whatever the figure may be&mdash;2 or 3 per cent.&mdash;and it does not apply to party and party costs in actual litigation. Therefore, that statement was a disreputable statement.</P>
    <P>The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Two results inevitably ensue. Firstly, the delivery of the public into the uncontrolled hands of solicitors, and, secondly, loss of revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>Up to the present the system of charging costs by solicitors to clients has been on a basis laid down in 1859 and increased by General Order from time to time&mdash;the most recent being one of 55 per cent. as from 1/1/52.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These statements are not correct either.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This schedule comprised items covering every conceivable task a solicitor could be called upon to perform and with a stated fee, or charge for each item.</P>
    <P>Under the present existing system <Col N="717" /> a solicitor is bound to furnish to a client a bill of costs showing details of the work performed for which the costs are charged setting out dates, details of work done and charges for each separate piece of work done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the matters Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to.</P>
    <P>The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So that the client may be satisfied that the charges are fair and reasonable and that the work charged for was done (as few people could even guess at this aspect of solicitors' work) he has a fundamental right to have the bill accurately checked and this is done by way of a taxation and measurement of the bill by the High Court Taxing Master appointed by Statute for such purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder how many of the bills solicitors furnish to their clients are taxed in such a way.  I wonder what the percentage is.  I know the answer is a negligible percentage.  The document adds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On such taxation the solicitor must vouch all the items contained in the bill of costs by the production of vouching documents, and of evidence that the work charged for was done, was necessary, was for the benefit, and done in pursuance of the instructions, of the client.  The client has of course the right of representation at the taxation and can make such objections to the bill of costs as are proper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I say, this is all argumentation because such taxations seldom take place.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The system of taxation and measurement of solicitors' costs has throughout the years protected clients (the public) against the possibility of being overcharged, and upholds the recent public assertion that &lsquo;in no other profession is the public more protected against extortionists than in the legal profession.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the solicitors' profession should be put to the trouble of <Col N="718" /> giving these detailed costs which add considerably, being drawn up by cost drawers, to the expense incurred. Apart from anything else, they are made out on very thick paper and, I would say, extremely expensive paper. It would not surprise me if two or three copies of a bill of costs contained £1 worth of paper.  If anything like that could be avoided, it would be an advantage to the client.  The anonymous document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new Order provides that each solicitor shall be the sole judge of what is a reasonable reward for his services and he shall be entitled to fix a bulk sum for his services and amongst other considerations laid down in this Order which may be taken into account by the solicitor in fixing such bulk fee are such as &lsquo;the special skill and knowledge a solicitor may have for the work undertaken&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why not, if he is a company lawyer, if it is an involved company question and he has long experience of that work for which there is limited demand in the community?  Why should he not charge for that special knowledge?  I saw recently where Senator Humphries in the United States said that the United States were suffering now from the attacks made in the last decade on its &ldquo;egg-heads&rdquo;.  An &ldquo;egghead&rdquo; is an intellectual.  A solicitor is an &ldquo;egg-head&rdquo;.  The truth of the matter is that anybody on a salary above what would be paid to the most formal clerk is an &ldquo;egg-head&rdquo;.  All people attached to universities are &ldquo;egg-heads&rdquo;.  and the United States is paying severely, in the opinion of Senator Humphries, one of its oldest Senators and a Conservative, for attacking &ldquo;egg-heads&rdquo;.  May I say with all respect that there is some evidence here of a similar attack on the &ldquo;egg-heads&rdquo;, an attack here in this House this evening, creating a similar position?</P>
    <P>The document also refers to &ldquo;The value of the work to the client and the rarity, urgency or complexity of the work&rdquo;.  Would you pay a man the same amount for one day's work, lasting the normal solicitor's day of <Col N="719" /> six hours, as you would for a day's work lasting 15 or 16 hours?  That is my comment on that.</P>
    <P>I quote further from the document:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This means that for the performance of identical work, different solicitors may fix on different fees and no client can be certain of what he is going to be charged for any particular job and could conceivably find when the bill was presented that it was so high that had he known the amount before he gave instructions he might decide that the results would not justify his having the work done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our people are not as foolish as all that.  They are also capable of arguing with their solicitors about the amount of bills of costs.  I have very little to do with the solicitors' profession.  I have no connection with that profession whatever, and I make that statement in case there is any doubt about it.  However, I do have knowledge of people who argued with their solicitors about their bills of costs.  They either visited their solicitors' offices, or had the solicitors come to their homes and, after argument, succeed in fixing an agreed bill.</P>
    <P>The document adds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a fundamental change from the present system whereby he can ascertain to a fairly close degree what any job will cost before he decides to have it done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless one is going to say that, when the new Order is made, the whole custom of the profession is going to change, I cannot see how there is any justification for a statement of that kind.</P>
    <P>I quote further from the document:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only suggested safeguard to a client in the new system is the provision that before a solicitor sues a client for fees he should inform the client that there is available to him a right of submission of the bill of costs to the Law Society for a certificate that the bill is fair and reasonable. In other words, the solicitors <Col N="720" /> would be the judges of their own cause and this might give rise to the feeling by a dissatisfied client that a disinterested tribunal or taxing master, as under the present system, would be more impartial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know one thing about professional people from experience of them over a long period of time.  No body of professional men are going to see one of their number overcharging a person, if it is drawn to their attention.  I think that is a scandalous suggestion there. Ever since the earliest times when the guild system operated, such bodies have controlled the work done and costs made, and these professional bodies are the nearest approach in our present state to the guild system of the Middle Ages.  The guilds took an interest not only in proper charges but in a proper standard of work being done.  They were inclined to be too rigid in their approach to the whole matter.</P>
    <P>The document goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a fundamental rule that &lsquo;not alone should justice be done but it should appear to be done&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That point is covered naturally under the new arrangement suggesting that the Taxing Master can be brought in. If a client is not satisfied, he can have a free taxation of his bill of costs under the arrangement suggested by the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A rather sinister feature of this provision in the new Order it will be noted is that it is only when a solicitor proposed to sue his client for fees that he need inform him of this right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That has all gone by the board.  This information will be stamped on the bills of costs.</P>
    <P>The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Order goes on to say that if a client pays the fees demanded he shall have no right to such a certificate from the Law Society.</P>
    <P>All the foregoing observations deal with the effects of this new system in so far as ordinary clients are concerned, <Col N="721" /> but when the position of public bodies is considered the result would appear to be likely to be chaotic.  All public bodies' solicitors' costs must be taxed by the High Court Taxing Master.  If the present Order becomes operative the Taxing Master will have no standard or guide to assist him in measuring solicitors' remuneration&mdash;he will have no priced details of the work and he cannot assess the fairness or otherwise of any of the charges made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are the Taxing Masters nincompoops? Have their long years of experience taught them nothing?</P>
    <P>The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Taxing Master decides that he cannot accept the solicitor's own uncontrolled estimate of the value of the services charged for, the bill cannot be taxed.  Local Government Department auditors cannot pass costs unless taxed.  This could conceivably result in public bodies not being able to get any legal business transacted if solicitors refuse to work unless their fees were paid on their own estimations of the value of their services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This goes from one absurdity to another.  Literally, there is no limit to it.</P>
    <P>It continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a normal year about 100,000 items of public bodies' solicitors' charges are taxed by the Taxing Master so that it can be appreciated that this aspect of the difficulties raised by the new system presents, or is likely to present, a grave problem for the Local Government Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why was that brought in?  It was brought in because all of us in this House know that reference has been made in county councils and other bodies to charges which some members of county councils, for example, felt bulked up too large for work done by professional men under a scheme.  That is a matter of opinion.  However, it was deliberately brought in here to prejudice the case, large numbers of Senators being members of public <Col N="722" /> bodies.  It was a deliberate effort to prejudice the case in the minds of Senators.</P>
    <P>It continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Departments of Justice and Finance would also be affected by the operation of the new system as by recent increases of stamp duty the Taxing Master has been made self-supporting and by the cutting out of taxations which would inevitably result by the new system the costs of running the Taxing Office would fall on the general State Revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These gentlemen were concerned about general State revenue.  They want taxation, on the one hand and, on the other hand, they point out the argument against it.</P>
    <P>The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These practical implications and effects of the new system would not be apparent from casual reading of the new Order.</P>
    <P>Only Dáil Éireann can now stop the implementation of this new Order by the bringing in of an objection within the statutory period of one month from the date of the laying of the Order on the Table of the Dáil and thus preserve for the people, county councils, and other similar bodies and organisations liable to solicitors for costs, the complete protection they have under the present system.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by the Law Society when recommending this new system to their members that a similar system has been operating satisfactorily in England for some years.  Leaving this aside the question of whether, having regard to the totally different economies of the two countries, a slavish copying of English methods is justifiable or desirable, it is a fact that no evidence in support of this suggestion is forthcoming and rather is it believed that the contrary is the fact.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, of course, they end up by wrapping the national flag about them.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the Incorporated Law Society, naturally enough, <Col N="723" /> got a copy of this anonymous communication which every Senator got and they replied to it in detail.  Theirs was not an anonymous communication. It was dated 26th July, 1957, and reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Solicitors' Remuneration General Order, 1957.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
    <P>The Council of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland have seen a copy of an anonymous communication which has been circulated to certain members of the Dáil and Seanad.  The memorandum is a complete misrepresentation of the facts in so far as it states or suggests that the effect of the Order would be</P>
    <P>(a)  to abolish the present system of taxation of costs by independent officers of the court, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to remove all limitations on costs and make solicitors the sole judges of reasonable professional charges, or</P>
    <P>(c)  to relieve solicitors from the obligation of vouching their professional charges and disbursements.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The true position in respect of these matters is the converse of what is stated or suggested in the memorandum, which contains other misrepresentations and inaccuracies.</P>
    <P>The internal evidence in the memorandum is strongly indicative that its author has a vested interest in the perpetuation of the present expensive and complicated system but is not a person who is at all concerned with the interests of clients. It is noteworthy that he has apparently obtained information concerning the Order, prior to its signature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He certainly obtained information about the Order a great deal more rapidly than we obtained information about the fact it was to be rescinded in this House to-day if the Minister could get the majority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> The letter continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The draft Order has been approved by the Statutory Committee under the Solicitors' Remuneration Act, 1881, consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Senior Ordinary Judge of the Supreme Court and the President of this Society.  It is inconceivable that such a committee would act without careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The council of this society are confident that no fair-minded person will allow his views to be coloured by an anonymous communication the only possible effect of which could be to create bias.  A factual statement is enclosed for the information of those who are interested in acquainting themselves with the true position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I now propose to go through this factual statement, just as I went through the statement bearing on the other side of the case.  It is headed: &ldquo;Costs in Non-Contentious Matters,&rdquo; and reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  This Order, which has been approved in principle but not yet signed, is the work of a committee consisting of four persons, namely, the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Senior Ordinary Judge of the Supreme Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society, who is the only solicitor on the committee.  This committee of eminence and impartiality have paid due regard to all relevant matters before approving the Order.</P>
    <P>2.  The Order, which has been approved by the Statutory Committee, deals only with parts of a solicitor's business and these are entirely unconnected with court proceedings. The costs of court business are prescribed by different rules and have not been changed.</P>
    <P>3.  The main effect of the new Order is to substitute for a lengthy and involved bill of costs such sum as is fair and reasonable having regard to all the relevant circumstances, and in particular:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> (a)  The complexity or difficulty of the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to make a comment on that.  It has been noted that when an extremely complex matter is resolved by somebody, everybody can see the solution.  The moment they hear it, it is obvious.  The more complex it is and the more sweat put into resolving it, the more obvious the answer is when somebody produces it.  But it is not obvious at all until somebody puts in an effort to produce it.  The statement continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  The amount or value of the property involved.</P>
    <P>(c)  The importance of the matter to the client.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If a client goes to a solicitor and says: &ldquo;This is a matter of the greatest importance to me.  I want you to consider it with the greatest care and to give it the very best attention,&rdquo; surely the solicitor, if he does that and carries out his work correctly in the manner I have said, is entitled to charge for that?</P>
    <P>The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  The skill, knowledge and responsibility involved.</P>
    <P>(e)  The number and importance of any documents involved.</P>
    <P>(f)  The place and the circumstances in which the business is transacted.</P>
    <P>(g)  The time expended.</P>
    <P>4.  The system described in paragraph 3 is basically the same as the method used by accountants, surveyors, medical practitioners, architects and other professions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it is basically the method which is used for all other professional work in this country.</P>
    <P>The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards non-contentious business where the costs are paid by the client to his own solicitor (and not by a third party as in litigation) there is no reason why solicitors should be in a different position from other professional men.  Much of the advisory work done by solicitors and accountants is of a like nature, but <Col N="726" /> an accountant does not render an itemised bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Much of the work done by architects is of a somewhat similar nature.  Again, there is a scale of fees and they render a general bill.  It is paragraph 3 that the Incorporated Law Society wants to have adopted.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the present system if a client feels that he has been overcharged his only redress is to have the bill taxed.  This will involve him in expense if less than one-sixth is taxed off, as he will then be liable for the costs of taxation.  The Order contains the following provision for the protection of clients:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The client will have the right to apply to the Incorporated Law Society for a certificate, which must be given free of charge, stating whether the amount of any bill is or is not fair and reasonable, and, if it is too high, what substituted sum would be a fair and reasonable charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister commented during his speech that the Order&mdash;I took down his phrase&mdash;&ldquo;affords inadequate protection to the client.&rdquo;  I must say I do not think anybody would suggest that, as far as taxation alone went, the existing system of solicitor and client taxation affords exceptional protection to a client.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  The client will still have the right to have the bill of costs taxed by application direct to the Taxing Master of the High Court whether or not he has already obtained a certificate from the Law Society.  The Taxing Master on such a reference will deal with the matter independently.</P>
    <P>(c)  On any taxation of a bill it will be the duty of the solicitor to satisfy the Taxing Master as to the fairness and reasonableness of his charge.</P>
    <P>(d)  If the Taxing Master allows less than one-half of the amount charged he must bring the facts of the case to the attention of the Incorporated Law Society, which <Col N="727" /> may result in disciplinary action against the solicitor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words he reports back, in the traditional method, to the parent body &mdash;the body to which he belongs and he is called to account if the people in the professional association feel that that is required.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(e)  The right of appeal from the taxing masters to the court will remain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these rights will remain, and he has the additional advantage of getting a free certificate from the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>The General Order goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A solicitor furnishing a bill of costs will know that it is subject to these tests.  The Law Society on reference to them and the taxing master on taxation will be entitled to all necessary information including the solicitor's files and documents to enable them to judge the reasonableness of the charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new system while allowing solicitors reasonable remuneration would be an incentive to efficiency and diligence.  A solicitor who completes business with exceptional skill or expedition would be entitled to fair recompense for his additional exertions.  On the other hand a solicitor who is dilatory or who transacts business in a roundabout or negligent fashion would be liable to have his remuneration reduced by the taxation masters.  It is suggested that this principle the value of the work to the client, is an important benefit.</P>
    <P>(7)  The Council of the Incorporated Law Society are most anxious to increase the standard of professional integrity and efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about that.  We all know the Act passed a few years ago which is intended to have, and in fact will have, the effect of improving professional integrity and competence. Yet it is suggested that this same body which co-operated with the last <Col N="728" /> Government in the passing of that Act will now turn around into reverse.</P>
    <P>The paragraph continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have shown this by the promotion of the Solicitors Act, 1954, and by the steps which they have since taken for the protection of clients against solicitors whose conduct came to their notice.  They believe that the new system would help the society in maintaining this standard.  The public interest would be served by freeing the profession from archaic restrictions while strengthening the hand of the professional body in disciplinary matters.</P>
    <P>(8)  The new system would help to reduce the present unnecessary expense and delay in preparing and furnishing bills of cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course it would.  At present if a solicitor has not a costs drawer in his office he must hand the whole load of files over to a costs drawer and it may take a long time.</P>
    <P>The paragraph goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No business concern could stand the expense of ascertaining charges and furnishing accounts which the present system imposes on solicitors. The following is an actual example of a solicitor and own client bill of costs taxed by a solicitor for a public body.  It is typical of many others:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Now, there is no necessary connection in any particular case between disbursements and the amount of work done.  There is a connection in general, and when the figure of disbursements is £331 it is quite certain there is a considerable amount of work involved.</P>
    <P>The paragraph goes on to state that the expenses of drawing and taxing the bill which resulted in a reduction of £40 were as follows: Costs drawer's remission, £103; costs drawer's scrivenery charges&mdash;that is using the <Col N="729" /> archaic word for what would now be described as the person who types out the bill&mdash;£38; costs drawer's petty disbursements, £9&mdash;paper, I suppose; duty on costs, £39.  There is a footnote on that item which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This bill was taxed in 1953.  The duty payable to the taxing office, which was then £7 16s., would be £39 to-day under the Fees Order made by the Minister for Justice in 1956.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To continue with the bill, taxation items amount to £44 and the fee to the solicitor and costs drawer opposing the bill amounted to £31.  That is a total of £264&mdash;22.15 per cent. of the solicitor's profit costs as drawn.  So the local authority ended up by paying to the solicitor £74 more than if they had just paid the bill of costs.</P>
    <P>The document goes on, still in paragraph 8:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the new system were in operation a considerable part of this expense could be saved.  If in addition a county manager (who from his experience of dealing with bills from year to year is something of an expert) were authorised in his discretion to settle his solicitor's bill of costs without taxation a further saving could have been effected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no use in pretending this is a kind of abracadabra.  There are in public and business offices many people who could make a fair shot as to what a solicitor's bill of costs would be.  I feel sure they would be within 5 per cent. of the accurate figure.  In large organisations dealing with different people in these matters from day to day they become experts.  There is a division of the labour and there is no difficulty.</P>

      <P>The reason I wanted to go through it was that it is not on the records of the House.  The reply of the Incorporated Law Society in paragraph 8 went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Taxation would, of course, be available if necessary.  Generally speaking the present system, outmoded as it is and not used by any other profession, results in an undue dependence of the solicitors' profession on a small number of costs drawers in Dublin who are paid by commission.  This is not a good thing either for members of the profession, who should be independent, or for their clients.  Commission and scrivenery charges are disproportionate as the above example shows.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This really comes down by tradition, as so many of these things do.  The Act of 1859, under which the original scheme was fixed, became law at a time when solicitors were scriveners and there is an interesting point in this.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Delays in having bills drawn and furnished due to the shortage of competent costs drawers may run into many months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The costs drawers' association have recently sought to impose on the profession a scale of charges varying from 5 per cent. to 7½ per cent. on the gross amount of a solicitor's bill including disbursements paid by the solicitor.  This may work out at 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. of a solicitor's net profit <Col N="731" /> costs after payment of disbursements and overhead office expenses.  The result is that a small body of men might receive for their services in preparing solicitors' bills in particular cases approximately one fourth of the amount which the solicitor receives in each case as net profit (and before payment of income-tax) for doing all the professional work involved in the bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So of course it is here.  That is where you have the real bottleneck in the whole position.  There are to-day 40 per cent. more solicitors in this country than there were 30 years ago and nobody can say, least of all the Government, which recently introduced the Prices Bill, that competition does not really improve service to the community. If the Government says that, it is facing two ways on the one day in this House.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is stated in the anonymous memorandum that the new system would result in a loss of court fees in the taxing office.  It should be pointed out, however, that these fees are added to the bill and paid by the client.  In the instance cited in paragraph 8 the fees would amount to £39.  The council regard these fees as exorbitant and, in so far as they must be first paid by the solicitor and later collected from the client, as an unfair imposition on the profession.  It is submitted that even if the new system resulted in some loss of revenue from fee stamps in the taxing office it would be inconsiderable in proportion to all court fees collected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the State is not doing badly out of court fees.  The very large increase in them in recent years has had the effect of making things extremely difficult for young solicitors.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The old system was discarded in England in 1953.  It was discarded in Northern Ireland in 1955 as regards the fee for instructions in non-contentious matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this being the matter we are talking about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" />&ldquo;In the Solicitors Bill, 1957, which has passed the First Reading in the House of Commons in Northern Ireland there is provision in Section 40 that a solicitor may, in respect of any non-contentious business carried out by him, charge and recover such remuneration as is fair and reasonable having regard to any schedule for the time being published by the Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland under Section 41 and the relevant circumstances, which are similar to those enumerated in paragraph 3 of this memorandum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extent of the work, thought and so on.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 41 provides that the Law Society of Northern Ireland may from time to time publish schedules prescribing the remuneration which shall be regarded as fair and reasonable and by Section 42 the Taxing Master is to have regard to such schedules.  If this Bill is enacted the position of the profession in Northern Ireland will be more favourable than that sought in the present memorandum for the profession in the Twenty-Six Counties.  As far as can be ascertained the system of item charges which it is now sought to abolish never existed outside these islands and certain British possessions. It has been abolished in Great Britain and is in course of abolition in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues has already pointed out that comparing 1937 with 1957 in regard to the amount of cost and outlay certified for payment, it was £225,000 in 1937 and £292,000 in the present year.  Is it not obvious to anybody what the value of money is to-day? At best, about 40 per cent. of what it was in 1937&mdash;two-fifths.  The number of persons involved is 1,300 as compared with 2,300.  That certainly proves that the taxing masters are not overworked.  There is no use suggesting that the solicitors as a profession are getting excessive incomes.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on just two points about the Minister's statement. I thought that the Minister's statement, as read out to us, was extremely polemical and categorical. <Col N="733" /> He was laying down the law, I thought.  Of course, the Minister is entitled to make his statement in that form.  I did think that in a matter of this sort, to which there are obviously two sides, it would have been better if he was not quite so polemical or quite so categorical.  For instance, he said that Parliament did not hand over to this committee the right to regulate costs.  Parliament did not hand over the right to this committee to regulate costs, but Parliament did hand over to this statutory body, composed, as it is, of people who certainly are above reproach in the matter of trying to put money into solicitors' pockets.</P>
    <P>Now the Executive is interfering with the decision of that committee, come to after mature consideration. Nobody could suggest it was immature. The gravamen of the case here to-day is that a provision in the law which should be invoked only in the case of extreme irresponsibility has been invoked now by the Executive to attempt to deny to this committee the putting into operation of a statutory instrument prepared by it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned&mdash;in this connection it was suggested we might like to hear from him further&mdash;that a court in England had pointed out a defect in the procedure which is suggested in the Order.  One would like something more on that.  I should like to end on the note that it is very desirable that the Minister should table the correspondence which he has had with this rules-making committee. I think it would enable the people to judge where the matters lie and what is in effect between the Executive and the judiciary.</P>
    <P>I myself am inclined to think that there is an element of dispute, contention&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;between persons involved in the Executive and the members of the committee.  Everybody will appreciate, I think, that it is desirable that the letters should be put on the records of the House, particularly as it is obvious that the Taoiseach made a tremendous effort to get this matter agreed between the parties. That is quite obvious from the information which Senator O'Brien read out <Col N="734" /> to the House.  I do not know exactly what went wrong in the end that this decision of the Government with which we are dealing to-day was taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened for three hours now to a debate on this motion and I cannot add anything to the collective knowledge of the Seanad in regard to the matter.  Why I rise to speak at all is to point out to the Seanad what I consider to be the importance of this matter and, secondly, to try to clarify my own mind as to what the position is and what my decision should be.  I say &ldquo;decision&rdquo; deliberately because I think that in this matter the Seanad is being asked by the Government to act as a jury to decide the rights and wrongs of the dispute.</P>
      <P>Some of us have often complained about the lack of power of the Seanad but I think in this matter we cannot complain if some of us may fear the responsibility that is being put on us. Nevertheless, we cannot escape it and apparently the Minister is not disposed to allow us to postpone that responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am not an advocate for the solicitors in regard to this matter.  I must confess that, like many laymen, when I think of our solicitors and their fees, I have a natural suspicion.  You may notice, however, that the solicitors do not appear to be short of very good advocates in the Seanad this afternoon. I am not, on the other hand, trying to persuade other Senators as to how they should make up their mind or whether or not they should agree with me.</P>
      <P>I have listened to practically all that has been said in this matter.  I have read the documents supplied to us by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland. More particularly, I have listened with great care to what the Minister said in introducing the motion.  In spite of all that, I and other Senators would like much more information on this important question, but apparently we are not to be given it, and with the little information we have at hand, we have to make up our minds as to whether this motion should be approved or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I delayed speaking as long as I could <Col N="735" /> in the hope that our colleagues on the other side of the House would make a case in support of this motion.  We have seven or eight speakers all against the motion.  There is a strange silence from the other side.  Perhaps, however, they are saving their ammunition, and I should be very glad to hear their arguments, because, quite frankly, if there is a case in favour of the motion, it has not yet been made.  I have waited patiently to try to get the case but I have not heard it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister considered the Seanad a very amenable body, quite prepared to agree with his opinion.  He did not go to any great trouble to persuade or convince us that his attitude and the attitude of his Government was right and proper.  I would not make up my mind on this question for or against the Government or look upon it in any way as a political matter. It is my responsibility as a Senator to consider the merits or demerits of the difficulty which has arisen and, in accordance with my conscience, having listened to what has been said, make up my own mind.</P>
    <P>With the best will in the world, I cannot accept the Minister in the rôle of defender of the general public against the body of solicitors, endeavouring to save the public from greedy solicitors anxious to overcharge for their services.  There is plenty of evidence that the present system of itemised accounts does not, in fact, lead to low charges.  The little experience I have in this matter is that every time one opens one's mouth to a solicitor, on the phone or otherwise, a couple of guineas are clapped on.  I cannot accept, therefore, that that method of assessing charges means of itself that one is charged fairly and reasonably.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put forward that the method suggested in this Order may lead to more reasonable charges.  I do not know.  There is no great body of evidence to support that. I must reject the suggestion that the present method leads to reasonable charging and to a greater protection for clients as against the method laid down in this Order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> Many speakers have implied that this represents a clash between the Executive and the judiciary.  I do not know if that is correct.  I do not know if it is an exaggeration.  I deplore the suggestion that it is the civil servants who are responsible and that we are in effect criticising the decision of civil servants in opposing this Order.  It is the Minister who is responsible and, ultimately, the Government.  The Minister may be advised, as I am sure he is, by his civil servants, but the responsibility is his and I deplore the suggestion by previous speakers that civil servants are responsible.</P>
    <P>I have listened to all that has been said; I have read the documents supplied. I am firmly of the opinion that, if there is a case in favour of this motion, we have not heard it.  Because of that and because of the arguments put forward by other speakers, I must vote against this motion.  The Government have taken a wrong decision and I, therefore, must in conscience oppose this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. P. Crowley Mr. P. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have an opportunity of listening to the major part of the debate on this motion earlier this afternoon.  I have, however, taken a keen interest in this matter, the more so as I was supplied by the Incorporated Law Society with a very comprehensive file, a file which makes rather illuminating reading. Like Senator Murphy, I do not hold any brief for the legal profession or for the scale of charges which they impose on an unsuspecting public.  I have my own views and my own ideas as to the moral justification, or otherwise, for many of these charges, but frankly I cannot accept the suggestion that that is in fact the case in point on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the point made by Senator Murphy just now.  I do not think the Government are being fair to the House in requesting us to give our approval blindly to this motion.  I deprecate the haste with which it has been put before us and I deplore the absence of any fair explanation as to its necessity.  I read the documents supplied to me very carefully and two important points impressed me.  The Government appear to be very hesitant, <Col N="737" /> if not unwilling, to implement an Order made by a statutory body.  That is tantamount to rejecting the whole principle of arbitration or fair ruling of any kind and I would find it impossible to support any suggestion that that represents right or proper conduct for any Government to pursue.</P>
    <P>The second point that impresses me is that the Government appear to be in possession of certain facts or information.  They appear to be in possession of certain correspondence. They have not taken the trouble to put either, or both, before this or the other House.  The Government are treating this House in a rather cavalier fashion. I would prefer to know a great deal more about this matter before passing judgment on it and we should not be asked to give our approval to it in the absence of Government confidence in us and in the absence of the information to which I think we are entitled before our approval is sought.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the maintenance of proper relations between the judiciary and the Executive, we are forced to refuse our sanction.  Unless we are given a great deal more information and some of the confidence to which we are entitled, we must oppose this motion.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider the desirability of postponing this proposal and giving the House the information and confidence to which we are entitled before we are asked to vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in some respects sorry that a particular line has been taken.  An effort has been made here to cause a rift between the Government and the judiciary.  It is a deplorable state of affairs that such an effort should be made in a House of this distinction. It has also been suggested that we are the enemies of the solicitors.  That implication has run through most of the speeches to which I have listened. I want to point out now that there are probably more solicitors, or more relatives of solicitors, in our Party than in any other Party or Parties either in the Dáil or Seanad.  We were quite conscious of all these facts when we came to discuss this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> It is very difficult to approach this question from the many points of view which were raised here by Senators, but one point in particular did strike me.  Reference was made to what I might describe as the brevity of my statement.  That was deliberate, because I did want to avoid anything that might be regarded as being in any way controversial or harmful to the solicitors' profession or insulting to the judges.  I wanted to be as clear as possible on the actual facts of the case and these I stated.  I could not do more because the issue in this is simplicity itself.  The issue is: Are we to allow the solicitors to decide costs to their clients or are we to prevent it? We feel it is our duty to ensure that exorbitant costs will not be charged in any single respect, and it is because we have that feeling that we have had to take this decision.</P>
    <P>I have made it very clear in the course of my statement that we are against this Order.  We made it clear in our communication to the statutory body that if they wished to consider other ways and means we would be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to their views.  Someone has been asking for the production of particular documents.  As far as I can see, there is nothing very secret about them, but the fact that they were regarded as being confidential by the people who sent them to us means that unless we get the consent of the statutory body, I should feel that I was not honouring my bond in respect of those documents.  Therefore, unless and until the statutory committee tells me that these documents may be made available to the public, I have no intention of making them available because I should feel I am not entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>In my statement to-day I should like to have referred Senators to a debate which took place here as far back as 1924.  I can refer them to the actual volume&mdash;Volume 2, column 631.  On that occasion, the Courts of Justice Bill was being discussed and it was on the same occasion that an eminent lawyer said that the battle for democratic control was fought and won.  I want to say that the winning of the <Col N="739" /> battle on that occasion was due in the main to the Labour representatives who were in the Seanad at the time. What we are discussing here to-day is in many respects the equivalent of what was being discussed then.</P>
    <P>There must have been some good reason for putting this section into the 1881 Act in regard to Parliamentary control.  The Rules Committee in its original form consisted of very eminent judges&mdash;I do not mean the personnel but their ranks&mdash;as now.  They were not regarded as being infallible then any more than they can be regarded as being infallible to-day, but does it not strike Senators that there must have been some good reason for putting in the particular section that gave the right to the Government to veto their decision if, in the wisdom of Parliament, it was considered necessary to do so?  Surely there must have been some good reason for that.  Some valuable foresight must have shown to somebody that such a situation as this could arise.  It has arisen now and the attitude of the Government in respect of it is to defend what we believe to be the rights of the common people.</P>
    <P>The policy of every Government in this country naturally is directed towards the greatest good for the greatest number.  We are satisfied that, in this instance, the greatest good will accrue to the ordinary public, who are compelled by reasons outside their own control to enter into legal work of this kind if the Order is disallowed. Most Senators will realise that non-contentious business consists of the simple matters that do not have to be taken into the law courts.  They are things such as wills, leases, purchase of houses and matters of one kind or another with which the man in the street is concerned from time to time. These are the things the costs of which, by reason of this Order would, in our opinion, be increased and increased perhaps abnormally by reason of the freedom that would be given to solicitors just to deliver bills without the client having the right to see the itemised account.</P>
    <P>I know play has been made about the case of a doctor&mdash;as to why, if a doctor <Col N="740" /> undertakes to carry out an operation, and takes out an appendix, he should not be forced to give an itemised account of all the things which he did. The fact is that anyone who thinks a doctor is overcharging him, to the extent that he feels he is being defrauded, has the right to take that doctor to court, and he has the same right in respect of every other profession. All that happens in regard to the solicitor is&mdash;and as far as I know it has not occurred to any great extent &mdash;that if you get a bill from a solicitor which you think is exorbitant you now have the right to go to the solicitor and say: &ldquo;Surely this bill you have given me is far in excess of what the work is worth.  I want to dispute this with you and I want you to show in what manner the bill has accrued to such an extent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This may be a hardship on the solicitor&mdash;I am not saying it is not&mdash; but if he is a good solicitor he will have his accounts in apple-pie order.  He will have them, as any other good business man will have them, and he will not be occasioned any great difficulty in itemising his bill.  A good costs drawer &mdash; Senator O'Donovan seems to think costs drawers are obnoxious persons&mdash;will do that work for the solicitor well and expeditiously. When the client gets this itemised account, he can sit down like any other common sense individual and examine it; and if, in his opinion, the bill is still exorbitant, he can go to the Taxing Master and have it taxed.  We know that that sort of thing has happened reasonably often and that the Taxing Master, having examined the bill, has knocked off a certain amount and has left the client reasonably satisfied.  That is the position at the present time.  If this Order were to go through, the position&mdash;in spite of the suggested safety devices which have been put forward by the Incorporated Law Society&mdash;would be that a person could get a bill for, say, £500 and would have to accept it or reject it without getting details of the itemised charges.</P>
    <P>We know that one can under the Order bring it to the attention of the society, but we must remember that the society is made up of solicitors.  I do <Col N="741" /> not know that it would be any great consolation to an individual, who believed that he was being charged an exorbitant fee by a solicitor, to find that he could have the account examined by a body of solicitors.  I do not wish to impute anything to those who would make up a body which would examine into such cases, but it is reasonable to suggest that the individual would not feel very happy about having to submit his charges to a body of that kind.  If the suggestion were that the account could be examined by an independent body, that might be reasonable and might be more acceptable, but I doubt very much if it would satisfy every client.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan made what to my mind were slighting references to the costs drawers.  I must admit, being a layman, that I do not know anything personally about either the costs drawers or the taxing masters; but as a result of this business, I do know that the costs drawers are important persons to solicitors.</P>

      <P>An easy remedy is there for the solicitors, to my mind. Speaking as one who might be regarded as an ignorant layman, I would point out that we are told there is a very large number of young solicitors, many of them looking for work in their profession.  I cannot see why the solicitors <Col N="742" /> should not take some of these young men&mdash;who, I am sure, are exceptionally well fitted for the task&mdash;and give them a course in the drawing up of law costs and in that way make them part of their own staff.  It is reasonable to believe that they would be a loyal staff, giving faithful service to the employers.</P>
      <P>I deplore the suggestions made here in respect of our attitude to the judiciary.  Speeches of the kind which have been made are doing a disservice to the State generally, in suggesting that this Government&mdash;or any other Government, for that matter&mdash;would deliberately oppose or put itself up against the judiciary.  The judiciary do not claim to be infallible, I am sure, and I do not regard them as being infallible; neither do the Government. When, in the course of our duty, we have to examine a matter of this kind, we have to arrive at our own decision on it; and if our decision, arrived at after full consideration, is that we should not allow a certain thing, then I can tell the Seanad that we would be very much lacking in our duty if we were to do other than what we believed to be right.</P>
      <P>I said at the conclusion of my opening statement that as far as the Government were concerned, we were prepared to give ample consideration to any suggestions put forward by the society.  That still stands.  I want to make it clear from this House to the society that, as regards the friendly relations which I have been informed have always existed between the Department of Justice and the society, I desire&mdash;during my term of office, however long or short it may be&mdash;to see that friendship and those relations continue.  I will make it my task to ensure, as far as I can, that nothing will take place to upset the good relations which have existed between the Department and the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the difference between the English Order and the Order we are discussing.  The most objectionable thing I saw in the Irish Order&mdash;as against the Order on which it was modelled, that is, the English one&mdash;was that all business which was not completed prior to 10th October <Col N="743" /> would be charged on the new basis.  I am sure that no Senator who gives any consideration to it, will say that that provision in the Irish Order is fair and reasonable.  In other words, if one had business which went back two, three, five or ten years, it would be charged for on the new basis instead of the old.  That, to my mind, is one of the most objectionable aspects of the Order.  I regard the Order generally as one which would inflict a hardship on a section of the population who often have legal matters of the type in question forced on them, by reason of the fact that someone has left them something in a will or because they may have to make a will themselves&mdash; simple kind of matters in which the ordinary man or woman in the street is involved.</P>

      <P>One of the things that amused me here&mdash;I do not mind saying that it amused me&mdash;was the fact that Senator after Senator stood up and said the Minister had given little or no information.  Then they proceeded immediately to make long speeches in respect to the Order; and not only that but they proceeded to quote from long, weighty, voluminous documents, which were obviously supplied to them from some source.  Every one of those Senators who complained about the lack of information then started to give me and my colleagues all the information that I was alleged not to have supplied.  There was something unreal about all that sort of thing.  The Senators knew very well what the position was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that I deplered was that the debate was carried on on a political basis.  There was no necessity for that.  If the Order was wrong, it was wrong and that is all that should be said about it; but the Government were the villains of the piece, even though the Government were endeavouring to protect what they believed was a section of the community that needed protection.  That is the attitude that was adopted and I deplore that attitude.  I think the matter <Col N="744" /> could have been discussed on its merits and left at that.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I can say any more.  I do not in fact wish to say any more.  I may have said too much and, if I have, I deplore that also because, as I have said, I want the good relations which have existed between the solicitors and ourselves to continue, and I want the good relations between the judiciary and whatever Government may be in power to continue also.  As far as I am concerned it would be my desire all the time to see that that is so.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I was one of those who suggested to the Minister that he might give us the correspondence. That was made to appear foolish by what the Minister said.  I should like to say that I have evidence in my hand that the Minister had permission from this statutory body to communicate that correspondence to the Incorporated Law Society on 28th October and, if he had communicated it to the Incorporated Law Society on 29th October, we could have had it in our hands a week ago.  We are entitled to point out that it was not such a foolish suggestion.  It is not confidential correspondence in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clarify that point.  Yesterday was the first intimation we had that the Law Society was anxious to see these documents&mdash; yesterday, not 28th October.  I should say that I was at a meeting of the Government the whole forenoon of yesterday.  Naturally, like any other individual, I had to go home and have my lunch.  I was back in my office at about 3.30.  The Secretary of the Department, who, like any other human being, also had to go home and have his lunch found, for the first time, when he returned in the afternoon, this request from the Law Society for the production of these papers.  We never had the authority of the statutory body to supply these papers to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no suggestion, I hope, that we are deliberately withholding something that would make Senators here change their minds in respect to whatever views they may hold or to whatever <Col N="745" /> attitude they may be prepared to adopt.  The documents which we received were confidential and that is the normal thing, if a document is confidential, that one does not use it for any public purpose.  Until such time as I am assured by the statutory body that they have no objection to these communications being made available to the public, I regard myself as being in honour bound to keep them confidential. That is the actual position as I know it, but I should say that as far as I am concerned, having a recollection of the documents&mdash;I have not seen them for some time&mdash;they are nothing that I personally would be averse from showing or letting any member of the Seanad see, much less read out.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil, the purposes of this Bill are, firstly, to provide for the continuance of powers in relation to certain miscellaneous social welfare schemes which were conferred on local authorities by three Emergency Powers Orders made under the Supplies and Services Acts, which are due to expire on the 31st December next, and secondly, to remove doubts which have arisen in the interpretation of the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930.</P>
      <P>The social welfare schemes concerned are the cooked meals scheme, the cheap fuel scheme and the public assistance footwear scheme.  In relation to the cooked meals scheme I should explain that, to meet the possibility of the dislocation of essential services, the Government decided in 1941 to invest county borough corporations with power to establish emergency food centres either directly or in association or by arrangement with any other person or body.  The Emergency Powers (No. 109) Order, 1941, was made accordingly.  The Order has been used in Dublin and Limerick as the authority for payments by the corporations concerned to voluntary bodies to assist them in providing meals for poor persons.  There is no cost to the Exchequer, the subsidies being borne entirely by the local authorities, but the Minister's sanction is necessary to the operation of any scheme.  It is proposed to continue the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Order substantially unchanged and Section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning now to Section 4 of the Bill. The cheap fuel scheme was introduced as an emergency measure in 1942, when fuel was scarce, to ensure that fuel would be available at a low price to poor people in areas then classified as non-turf areas.  The service is operated in 16 cities and towns mainly on the eastern seaboard.  A modified service is operated in Limerick City.  The <Col N="749" /> amount voted for the current year is £161,750 and there will be no increase in this amount as a result of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Certain of the powers given to local authorities in Emergency Powers (No. 108) Order, 1941, and (No. 310) Order, 1944, are necessary for the operation of this service.  The No. 108 Order empowers county councils and urban authorities to acquire, fell, transport, use, sell and dispose of timber. Article 18 of the No. 310 Order empowers them to purchase, sell or dispose of turf.  It is proposed to continue these powers for urban authorities as provided in Section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The public assistance footwear scheme is operated by public assistance authorities under the Public Assistance (Footwear Regulations) Order, 1944, made under the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  The scheme, which was initiated in 1944, was designed to ensure that a proportion of the leather then available would be utilised for footwear for children up to the age of 16 years, whose parents or guardians were in receipt of home assistance, or were deemed by the public assistance authorities to be unable to provide footwear for their children.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers (No. 351) Order, 1945, provides safeguards relating to inspection, sale, purchase and use of the special footwear manufactured for the scheme and also for penalties for abuse.  In practice, it has not been found necessary for many years to utilise any of these powers, other than that of inspection which has, in general, prevented abuse of the scheme.  It is considered necessary, therefore, to continue only the powers of inspection by inspectors appointed by the Minister and by the public assistance authorities and the associated penalty for obstruction and these are provided for in Section 5 of the Bill.  No extra cost is involved in the proposed provision.</P>
    <P>Reverting now to Section 3 of the Bill as regards the school meals scheme operated by urban authorities under the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930, in general, the Act is designed to provide for the supply of school meals on a contributory or <Col N="750" /> repayment basis, but provision is made for remitting part or all of the cost where the parents are unable to pay and for supplying meals free of charge to children who are unable, by reason of lack of food, to benefit from the education provided for them.  Since the inception of the service, as far back as 1914 the schemes have been operated mainly on the free-of-charge basis, the cost of the food being met out of the rates in the first instance. However, certain doubts have arisen as to the propriety of this procedure following the consideration of questions raised by the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the Appropriation Accounts for the years 1951-52, 1952-53 and 1953-54.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes to set this matter right by amending the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930, so as to place beyond doubt the right of local authorities to continue to operate non-contributory school meal schemes under Section 3 of the Act of 1914 and to defray the cost of preparing the meals.  Provision is also made to regularise expenditure in previous years on the cost of preparing the meals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement by the Parliamentary Secretary is interesting and informative for one reason and one reason only.  It defines Government policy with regard to these measures which unfortunately are so necessary. It is a fact that the poor will be always with us and every Government, and indeed every local authority, have a moral responsibility to take measures such as are envisaged in the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage in the economic development of the State the situation has developed that these poor people have been left in a worse position than that they were in previously.  We have seen the abolition of the food subsidies. While it would not be right for me to discuss the rights or wrongs of that decision on this measure, the results of that action impinge on these poor people.  It is my belief that the increases in social welfare benefits and public assistance that were made were not in fact large enough to compensate <Col N="751" /> poor persons for the loss of the food subsidies.  While people in a better off position eat less bread and butter, the people benefiting from many of these schemes eat more bread and butter. They would not be compensated by the slight increase made in social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>We have been clearly informed now of two things&mdash;firstly, that the Government does not intend to increase by one penny piece the amounts of money devoted to these schemes and secondly, that the Government does not intend to help the local authorities&mdash;and they are in a dreadful position with rates rising to an extraordinarily high level year by year&mdash;in their responsibility to provide for these people.  Running right through the Parliamentary Secretary's statement we get references such as that contained in the second paragraph which deals with the cooked meals scheme:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no cost to the Exchequer, the subsidies being borne entirely by the local authorities, but the Minister's sanction is necessary to the operation of any scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that the moral duty of the Government at present is to accept some responsibility for this scheme.  With rates rocketing as they are, it is a fact that when we on local authorities sit down at our estimates meeting and discuss how we shall spend the money available to us, we find that, much as we would like to do it, we cannot meet our moral responsibilities. Therefore, if a major Government decision of not so long ago has impinged on these poor people, the Government has a moral responsibility, having taken the previous decision, to see to it that these people are compensated and that they are as well off as they were before the removal of the subsidies.</P>
    <P>I come now to the third paragraph of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, which verifies the statement I made when I rose to speak.  I am referring to the paragraph about the cheap fuel scheme.  I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;People know that the amount voted for the current year is £160,750 <Col N="752" /> and there will be no increase in this amount as a result of this proposed legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, there is to be no increase for these poor people who are now finding it much harder to get fuel than they did prior to the removal of the food subsidies.  I am not discussing the rights or wrongs of the removal of the food subsidies, but I am discussing the moral responsibility of the Government to stand up to something that impinges on these people as a result of the Government's major decision.</P>
    <P>The following paragraph refers to the purchase, sale and disposal of turf. The Minister stated elsewhere, and he is quite correct, that the provision of turf and timber for this type of person is largely carried out in the eastern counties where there is not a natural fuel supply to which these people can have recourse.  It is, however, a fact that the quality of turf supplied is very bad.  I do not know if all the bad turf is kept for these poor people.  I do not know if it is a fact that, when the Government harvests turf, it does not do so as well as the private supplier or cutter, but I do know there have been serious complaints in the towns of Drogheda and Dundalk, for which I can speak.</P>
    <P>We should impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that he should take the most stringent measures, and address himself most energetically to this problem.  There is no use in giving unfortunate people a ticket for a bag of turf which has a moisture content of 75 or 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>I come now to the paragraph referring to Section 3 of the Bill and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the inception of the service, as far back as 1914 the schemes have been operated mainly on the free-of-charge basis, the cost of the food being met out of the rates in the first instance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to submit again that in respect of this scheme it is impossible for the local authorities to continue as they have been doing to put up all that money, and I have given the reason why&mdash;the increase in the cost of living <Col N="753" /> to these poor people as a result of the removal of the food subsidies, and the moral responsibility of the Government to provide these people with these schemes.</P>
    <P>Again in Section 3, we find the local authorities are again asked to continue the school meals scheme and Section 3, as the Parliamentary Secretary states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Proposes to set this matter right by amending the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930, so as to place beyond doubt the right of local authorities to continue to operate non-contributory school meal schemes under Section 3 of the Act of 1914 and to defray the cost of preparing the meals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The rates in this country are mounting day by day.  The Health Act, which we cannot discuss here to-night, placed an extraordinary load upon the rates.  Every ten shillings spent under the Health Act means 5/- upon the rates of local authorities.  In such a situation, local authorities can no longer bear these schemes.  I want to impress my view, and the view of the political Party I represent, on the Government and Parliamentary Secretary that there is a moral responsibility on him to do more than he has said he is going to do to-night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is one to be welcomed.  I think I am right in saying that the necessity for portion of it at any rate became evident arising out of the evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts for the Appropriation Accounts, 1953-54.  I would refer Senators to that report and in particular to pages 160 to 167 because it became apparent there, in particular in relation to school meals, that for a long time past the local authorities had quite clearly not got the full authority they required to carry out what they wanted in this regard. Neither had they any authority to apply a means test.  I should like to stress the fact in relation to Section 2, sub-section (1), paragraph (c), that local authorities in relation to the provision of meals, other than meals in national schools, shall have power &ldquo;to take such other steps as in their opinion are necessary for or incidental <Col N="754" /> to the provision of meals&rdquo;.  I take it these &ldquo;steps&rdquo; include the paying of labour.  I understand one of the difficulties in the past was the paying of labour.  All the local authorities could do was &ldquo;provide food&rdquo;.  There was no reference to the cost of preparing and distributing it.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 2 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The corporation of a county borough may charge such amounts as they think proper for meals provided by them under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if this means that the question of charging various amounts to different people will be in accordance with their means.  Can the local authorities under this sub-section apply a means test or can they not?  I do not think it is quite clear from the wording of that section whether or not they can apply a means test.</P>
      <P>I would like to quote from the minutes of the evidence given before the Committee of Public Accounts to which I have already referred.  Mr. Keady who was called and examined stated &ldquo;there was no power in the Act to prescribe any means test or any contribution because the regulations could only be made for the purpose of the adequacy of the scheme&rdquo;.  It emerged then for the first time clearly that local authorities had not got power to do something that in fact they had been doing for a long time. I should like to hear the Minister's comment on these activities.  Has it been considered necessary to take any retrospective steps in that regard?</P>
      <P>Mr. Keady further stated &ldquo;our legal adviser is also adviser to the Department of Health and Local Government and has been familiar with this problem for a number of years past&rdquo;. I feel that that is rather disquieting. That problem was there for a very long time past without being officially adverted to.  That is why I welcome this particular Act, because action is at last being taken.  Mr. Keady further stated &ldquo;we have a section of an Act which is of doubtful validity and which it is impossible to work&rdquo;.  It is to clear up that kind of situation that this Bill is being brought up to date to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The witness also, in paragraph 1189, <Col N="755" /> stated: &ldquo;I do not take that to mean lack of food due to financial stringency in the home but lack of food due to too long a period between meals.&rdquo;  Here is something about school meals which is not covered by this particular Bill, and it is a point upon which I should like to make some comment&mdash;the question that a child may not have enough food, not because of necessitousness, not because it is too poor, but because of the interval of time between meals rendered necessary by certain school hours being too long.  In some schools it had been the practice&mdash;I understand it has been largely abandoned&mdash;to give the children their school meal at 3.30 p.m. when they were going home, which frequently meant the food was thrown around on the roads.  That is the kind of thing which goes to make for waste of food.</P>
    <P>We are familiar in Dublin with quite a lot of controversy as to whether the children should get an interval during which they can go home for their dinner and then go back to school. That is a much debated point.  Some parents feel very strongly that they would prefer their children to be kept, if necessary, a little longer in school and let home finally, not having to go back, particularly in wet weather, where obviously it could be bad for health, and so on.  Parents also complain sometimes that the school hours in boys and girls' schools are different, as well as different from the hour at which the husband may get his meal. Consequently a good deal of inconvenience, not to say danger to health, is caused by failure properly to organise these school meals.</P>
    <P>The point I should like to make is that what ought ideally to be provided, and that for which local authorities ought to use the powers given to them by this Bill, is the provision normally in these big city schools of a hot sit-down school meal in the middle of the day.  That would obviate the necessity for these children to rush home in any weather in order to grab a quick meal and rush back to school again, perhaps getting wet, for another hour or two at school.</P>
    <P>I am sometimes told that if you give <Col N="756" /> a hot school meal to primary school children it will &ldquo;break up family life&rdquo;. That seems to me to be quite ridiculous. We are familiar with large boarding schools for secondary school children, boys and girls.  They, in their respective schools, spend two-thirds of their lives away from home in big boarding schools&mdash;not just an hour for a meal in the middle of the day.  They spend two-thirds of their lives in these boarding schools, taking all their meals there and sleeping away from home, without any suggestion that, for these better-off children, family life is destroyed by the very concept of the big boarding school.  Therefore, I regard it as disingenuous, to put it mildly, to suggest that if children in a primary school were given a hot meal in the middle of the day it would break up their family life.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity, on the passing of this Bill, which gives local authorities more clearly defined powers in this regard, to urge more school managers and more local authorities to consider the advisability of providing a reasonably good sit-down hot meal for children in the middle of the day.  I would regard that as of advantage to their health.  I would regard it as of advantage to their frequently harassed parents at home, and also, I think, of advantage to them socially, in that the schooling, the training, the discipline and so on in connection with the meal might frequently be every bit as important as the general social training given to them in connection with class-work.</P>
    <P>My final point is connected with what I have just been saying.  I want to quote from paragraph 1198, page 163, of the very same report in which the same official witness says: &ldquo;The main cause of waste was that the food was unpalatable, particularly for the younger children.&rdquo;  I am afraid that is the case. Somebody may say: &ldquo;I will give them a cheese sandwich and one-third of a pint of milk per child.  Every child should like it and, if they do not, it is the fault of their families,&rdquo; and so on. That is not the way to make young children like food.  Many of us here have an intimate knowledge of the likes and dislikes of young children in <Col N="757" /> regard to food.  You cannot just throw cheese sandwiches and milk at them and say: &ldquo;There is one-third of a pint of milk and a cheese sandwich. Eat the sandwich and gulp the milk down, and like it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to feel that local authorities are increasingly aware of this problem, namely, that the main cause of waste is that the food is unpalatable, particularly for the younger children.  There has been some talk of the cost to the rates and so on. Nobody desires to see the rates going up for no purpose at all, but, if there is any purpose for which there is a justification for increased expenditure that should not meet with opposition, it is for the purpose of giving all our schoolchildren, and particularly the poorer children, better meals, better nutrition at all times.  I think that that is the main purpose of this Bill, and for that reason I think it will be generally supported in this House.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I did not say what Senator Carter says I said.  What I did say was that the emergence of this Bill at this stage clarified the intentions of the Government and that the removal of the food subsidies had created a situation where a change was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have misquoted the Senator.  I read into his speech the implication that it was because of the increased cost, resulting from the withdrawal of the food subsidies, that this Bill was introduced. I wish to make a few brief remarks on the Bill.  The school meals scheme has got nothing whatever to do with the removal of food subsidies or the increase in the cost of living.  The Bill, I understand, was introduced to remove some doubts which had arisen regarding powers contained in the parent and subsequent Acts.  As this matter regarding the provision of school meals arose during the period in which I served on the Committee of <Col N="758" /> Public Accounts, I wish to touch on some points, the first being that experience teaches and the second that laws made for another country are not always workable here.  The deductions one might draw are that the School Meals Acts were framed in different times and different circumstances, being based on the principle of voluntary effort.</P>
      <P>The idea of school meals came about in England during a period of hard industrial endeavour.  It was intended to help the children of parents engaged in factory work from dawn till dark.  It took into consideration the fact that parents who were away from home all day might not be in a position, apart from poverty, to provide a midday meal for their children.  In the autumn of 1914 the British Parliament decided to apply the Act to Ireland. It was then known as the Education (Provision of Meals) Act.  It provided that local authorities should pay for the food for school meals within strict limits.</P>
      <P>Later, around 1916, the limit was raised and in 1917 further regulations followed.  In examining the accounts for 1951-52&mdash;I am subject to correction in this&mdash;the Comptroller and Auditor-General raised the question of the cost of the scheme.  Deputy Sheldon was then Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and, owing to his research, it was subsequently discovered that not only were the regulations bad but that the legislation on which they were based was, if not bad, highly confusing.  In the interval, the Committee, after a good deal of debate, decided to press for further consideration on the matter and this Bill would appear to have been brought in to meet their wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I want to say in conclusion is that, whatever regulations the Parliamentary Secretary may have in mind, it is to be hoped that he will insist on a standard that will provide a suitable type of meal.  I feel sure, on the other hand, that this legislation is not to be taken as providing a standard which would involve the provision of children's dinners in schools.  This is merely supplementary, if you like, because in both Houses of the Oireachtas we subscribe <Col N="759" /> to the view that the proper place to provide children with dinners is in their homes.  I would remind Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the architect of the welfare state, Lord Beveridge, has gone back to work at 70 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points to which I should like the Minister to refer when he is replying.  The first is in regard to the provision of free meals in national schools.  I have not read the 1914 Act, but there is now a substitution of words from that Act in this measure&mdash;&ldquo;, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Act, authorised them to provide free of charge, or to meet the whole or part of the cost of the provision free of charge of, meals for those children attending that school&rdquo;. I do not know whether this is the proper place in which to discuss the provision of meals free of charge.  Even if there was a charge of only 1d. a day, 5d. a week, I think it would eliminate this idea of getting something for nothing.  Giving children something for nothing so early in life may give them the idea later of getting things free of charge.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could enlarge on that point of view.</P>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the cheap fuel scheme and refers to timber and turf. Is there some reason why coal is not mentioned in the section?  We have schools situated in areas where there are coal mines and in fact numerous council houses are now provided with ranges which burn coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the footwear scheme.  The definition of footwear in Section 5 is: &ldquo;Boots or shoes manufactured for the purpose of distribution in accordance with the footwear Order.&rdquo;  I believe that there will be complaints always about articles provided officially.  I have heard many complaints about official footwear.  I do not know whether there is any truth in those complaints.  There is a suggestion that the quality of the leather put into official boots and shoes may not be as good as it should be by reason of the fact that such footwear is bound to be sold.  The recipients <Col N="760" /> of vouchers and coupons must buy a certain type of boot or shoe; they may not buy any type of boot or shoe.</P>
    <P>The only other comment I should like to make is again in relation to school meals.  I thoroughly agree with Senator Donegan that school meals should not be made a burden on rates, particularly in rural areas where children attending national schools do not benefit by the scheme.  Many children must walk three miles to school and yet do not get meals in those schools.  Admittedly there are no facilities in such schools for the provision of meals but I think it is most unfair that the parents of these children should be obliged to pay, through rates, part of the cost of the scheme.  Surely it should be a charge on the Central Fund.  I would urge the Minister to consider putting the cost of these things on the Central Fund instead of on the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold the view that any money spent on school meals is a good insurance policy and that, since health is the nation's wealth, it is good business as has been proved by the health statistics in relation to children here in Dublin.  In Dublin, as far as we can gather, about 40,000 pupils benefit through this scheme. The cost is about £140,000 a year of which 50 per cent. is provided by the Government.  There is no means test because it would be impossible, apart from anything else, to operate it.  I am afraid there seems to be some misunderstanding about what exactly school meals are.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the desirability of having hot meals in schools in cities. Unfortunately there are only very few schools equipped for the provision of hot meals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take a tremendous reconstruction programme to bring about that desirable objective. In case there are any misunderstandings about what a typical school meal in Dublin consists of I may say it consists of a sandwich, the full round of a <Col N="761" /> fine substantial sandwich&mdash;the sort one could pay at least 9d. for in certain hostelries&mdash;and one-third of a pint of first-class milk with plenty of cream on the top of the bottle.  Far from the food being unpalatable, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington seemed to infer, I should like to give the House a typical menu for the week in these schools: a sandwich on two days, a substantial sandwich of minced beef on two days and on another day they get cheese.  I am afraid Senator Sheehy Skeffington seemed to imply the cheese was being given out every day.</P>

      <P>These have been the types of sandwiches for quite some time; I checked up on them.  That is the menu: minced beef for two days, cheese for one day, strawberry jam sandwich one day and a large currant bun on one day.  They were getting cheese sandwiches on two days a week but the children seemed to prefer a change in the form of a currant bun and they get it, substituted for the cheese, on one day.  In case any Senators believe that this is the only food the children get during the day, it might be well to remind them that most mothers supplement this sandwich with an apple or an extra piece of bread and jam and these supplements are welcomed by the teacher and are a great help.  Lest some Senators think that mothers are negligent in their duty in this respect I may say that they are not.  There is hardly one child coming to the schools here in Dublin who is not equipped with a supplementary ration in the form of the things I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of that school meal, small <Col N="762" /> though it may be, is a great improvement in the health of the children.  If one speaks to teachers, particularly in what were once slum quarters, one will be told that there is now very little vermin, rickets or impetigo, from which they used suffer in former days. The school meals have been a great help.  That is why I say there is no doubt whatever, to my mind at any rate, that any money spent on them is money well spent.  I think it is also only right that tribute should be paid to the teachers for their supervision of these meals and also to the caterers and to the delivery staff for the high quality of the food provided and for the excellent service and expeditious delivery about which I have not found any complaints.</P>
    <P>There is one difficulty that I have come across and it seems to be in connection with the provision made by the corporation to tighten up the expenditure and to avoid waste in connection with the scheme.  As the delivery is made to the school before roll-call in the morning, the supply of sandwiches and milk must be based on the attendance in that school on the previous day.  The result of that is that if more children turn up on that day than turned up the previous day they may have to go short.  The alternative left to the teacher is to divide some of the sandwiches and milk and that is not a very satisfactory method and not a very fair task to give to the teacher.  In connection with that, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into it to see if there is any possibility of finding a remedy for the situation which does occur at regular intervals in some schools, by reason of the necessity for early delivery of sandwiches and milk.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more that I can say on the school meals portion of this Bill, but in connection with the cheap fuel scheme I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explore the possibility of delivering fuel to old age pensioners living alone in rooms in the cities.  I have come across some of them and many of them are unable to carry their hundredweight of turf.  They have to get a boy to do so and they have to give <Col N="763" /> him a few pence, usually 6d., to carry the turf to their room.  That, with the price of turf, is something that should not be continued if there is any way out of it.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to ascertain if there is any way in which old people living alone and who are unable to collect the turf themselves could have facilities for free delivery.  I welcome this Bill very much and congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on it.</P>
    <P>In connection with the free footwear scheme, the only complaint that I heard&mdash;and I understand there are about 79,000 people who benefit as a result of it&mdash;was not of the alleged inferior leather but that the type of boot or shoe was too heavy for schoolgirls. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of the suggestions made in connection with this and that he may find a solution to the points I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in praise of the Parliamentary Secretary for this Bill and to follow up what Senator Mullins said about the delivery of the free fuel to the old age pensioners.  In Cork we have tried to get this done but the manager had neither the authority nor the money to do so.  There is no point in going into details about the sad plight of people who have to drag their fuel up the stairs but I should like to answer Senator Donegan who spoke about the poor quality of the fuel.  He should do his duty and see that the local authority advertises only for machine-won turf and that the people entitled to this fuel get only machine-won turf.  We do that.  We get only the best fuel and the quality of the fuel supplied is the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin made an extremely good case in regard to the school meals.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take to heart what he said and encourage other local authorities to carry out the scheme as done in Dublin for the benefit of the children. May I again say that if the Parliamentary Secretary could make monetary <Col N="764" /> arrangements to have the fuel delivered to the old age pensioners, it would make such a difference to them?  We would be fulfilling a duty which, I think, we have to those old people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

      <P>The sole purpose of this Bill is to provide for a continuance of powers contained in certain Emergency Powers Orders made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Acts which are due to expire at the end of this year.  This Bill was first drafted two years ago and it would have been introduced long ago but for the continuation of the Supplies and Services Act.  The opportunity was taken in this Bill to clear up doubts raised in regard to the school meals.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to that when he spoke on Section 3 and about the keenness and ability, particularly of the Public Accounts Committee, in focussing attention on this: We could supply food but we could not provide the way of preparing the food.  Senator Carton referred to the work of Deputy Sheldon.  I hope I have clarified the point Senator Sheehy Skeffington made.</P>
      <P>In regard to the cooked meals, they are operated only in Dublin and Limerick and the Government is not bound in any way to have them.  The powers are permissive and apply to the local authority.  The Limerick people, I think, pay for the gas that cooks the meals which the voluntary body provides. In Dublin, the Catholic Charities Organisation spend a sum, in addition to their own, which the corporation gives them as a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school meals scheme is a very involved matter.  Senator Ó Maoláin and Senator Sheehy Skeffington went into it in detail.  It involves catering for children whose day is broken and catering for those who stay in school all day.  It has been a very difficult problem and my Department has been in touch with the corporation and certain suggestions were made to them. In order to secure more effective and economical administration, it is considered that the following action should be taken.  In schools operating <Col N="765" /> the two-part day, the meal should be served not later than 11.30 a.m.; in other schools, the meals should be served not later than 12.30 p.m.  The system of rotation in certain schools, under which a section of the pupils receive no meal each day, should cease, and where meat sandwiches are not acceptable to many pupils, they should be withdrawn and be substituted by bread and butter or jam.</P>
    <P>There is a difference of opinion between Senator Ó Maoláin and Senator Sheehy Skeffington on that, but, by and large, the experience is that the children prefer bread and jam.  We have come across cases where they threw away sandwiches.  There may be an explanation for that.  When the children get a meal after 11.30 a.m. and then go home, they are inclined to throw the sandwich away.  Children will do that.</P>
    <P>We have also tried to make milk, not alone in Dublin but throughout the country, the basis of the meal.  In places it is difficult to get milk.  We are constantly in touch with these bodies and the very useful suggestions made by Senator Ó Maoláin and Senator Sheehy Skeffington and the others who contributed to the debate will be borne in mind in our dealings with this problem in the Department.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole referred to paying for the meals.  There is nothing to prevent a charge being made.  The charge may be made or it may not be made. We do not directly operate the scheme and the local authorities operate it beyond their contribution.  If we had not the co-operation of the teachers and managers, the scheme would fall to the ground.  We leave them more or less to their own discretion in administering the scheme.  It is improving each year and, as Senator Ó Maoláin said, it is giving great satisfaction, particularly to children who might not have a proper nutritious breakfast going to school.  It helps them with their lessons to get this meal.  We provided in the Estimates what we considered was sufficient money to meet these schemes.</P>
    <P>In relation to the footwear scheme, we get the best leather possible put <Col N="766" /> into the boots.  I have here the particulars in relation to the cost.  The boots are stamped &ldquo;C.P.&rdquo;  With regard to footwear sizes 7 to 10 suitable for age groups three to seven, the original cost, when we started the scheme, was 10/6.  It is now 20/6.  With regard to footwear sizes 11 to 1 suitable for age groups seven to ten, the original cost was 13/- and it is now 23/11.  Footwear sizes 2 to 5 suitable for age groups ten to 13 cost originally 14/2, the present cost being 27/9. The original cost of footwear sizes 6 to 7 suitable for age groups 13 to 16 was 16/- and it is now 31/6.</P>
    <P>The total number of vouchers issued last year that we have an account of is 79,234.  There are inspections to see that cheaper boots are not substituted and to ensure that, when a voucher is given to a recipient, boots are given to the children and that the money is not spent on other things for the household. By and large, we have had very few complaints.  In fact we have not had complaints about the quality of the boots for years; they seem to be highly satisfactory.  There were complaints in the Dáil, however, about a rule-of-thumb method of distribution&mdash; first come first served.  There is a good deal of truth in that complaint and we have got in touch with local authorities and told them to examine all the applicants and give the most needy first preference.  In that way we shall improve the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with cooked meals. That service is entirely voluntary and is administered principally in Dublin and Limerick.  The Bill deals with what I would describe as urban school meals.  It deals with the cheap fuel scheme also.  I am surprised at keen people, like the people of County Meath, allowing in inferior turf.  It is not let in anywhere else.  Only the best Bord na Móna turf is accepted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Cole's point about letting in coal, Government policy has been to encourage turf production and to help turf production. Our main coal production is anthracite. There may be a point in what the Senator says about stoves now being capable of dealing with anthracite.  We <Col N="767" /> will bear that in mind, but I am not promising the Senator anything because that would apply to a very limited area, mainly North Kilkenny and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>We deliver turf in home help cases. Senator Mullins spoke about old age pensioners and Senator Mrs. Dowdall supported his contention.  We are very, very &ldquo;cagey&rdquo; in this respect. We have our doubts as to the manner in which we could do it and whether or not there might not be abuses as a result of which the old age pensioners might suffer.  Senator Mrs. Dowdall comes from a city which has set a headline in the administration of the school meals scheme.  The voluntary effort in Cork has been absolutely wonderful. I would like voluntary organisations to take this matter up; if voluntary charitable organisations in Cork, Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere would face this problem we would not be slow in giving them financial assistance to administer the delivery of fuel to old age pensioners.  That is all I can say at the moment on that subject.</P>
    <P>I have covered the various points that have been made.  If a complaint is made about bad boots, all the parent has to do is write to us and we shall insist immediately on an exchange. That has been the rule all along.  As I have said, there have been very few complaints since the inception of the scheme.</P>
    <P>This Bill consolidates a number of matters formerly covered by emergency powers legislation and it resolves doubts about the legality of the administration of the various schemes included in it.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee; reported without amendment; received for final consideration, and passed.</P>

    <P>The level and structure of cross-Channel shipping freight rates, including through rates; the extent, if any, to which collective arrangements or other restrictive practices obtain in the fixing and application of freight rates; and, if such arrangements or practices obtain, whether their maintenance is contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 7th September last the Irish and British Traffic Conference and the individual shipping companies engaged in the cross-Channel trade who, together with the railway companies, comprise the membership of that conference, announced an increase in cross-Channel freight rates to take effect from the 1st October, 1957.  The increase announced was a flat percentage increase at the rate of 7½ per cent., but after allowing for certain reductions in sea charges the net increase is, I understand, about 5 per cent.  This is the seventh increase in cross-Channel shipping freights made by the Irish and British Traffic Conference and its constituent shipping companies since 1950.  All these increases have followed the same pattern of applying a uniform percentage increase to existing freights and have, apparently, been agreed between the companies without regard to the financial position of individual companies or the economics of carrying different kinds of traffic.  Moreover the tendency has been consistently upward though over the same period ocean freights have fluctuated considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even before this latest increase was announced there had been a growing volume of criticism of cross-Channel freights.  The recently published report of an economic survey of the Six Counties area carried out by Professors K.S. Isles and N. Cuthbert of Queen's University, Belfast, indicates that there is reason to believe that on certain classes of cross-Channel shipping traffics, particularly coal, freight rates are rendered needlessly high, both because full use is not made of the most economical methods of shipping <Col N="769" /> and handling and also because of monopoly pricing.  The report points out that so far as shipping to foreign ports is concerned the competition of tramp and foreign shipping generally keeps rates fairly keen, but cross-Channel shipping is virtually immune from such competition and free of all restraint except that imposed by the trade itself.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable assumption that these considerations apply equally to the cross-Channel shipping between here and Britain.</P>
    <P>During recent months there have been discussions in the Department of Industry and Commerce with a representative cross-section of firms engaged in the export trade directed principally towards ascertaining and remedying the difficulties which impede further development of their exports.  With a remarkable degree of unanimity, these firms have referred to cross-Channel shipping arrangements and freights as being one of the greatest deterrents to the full development of their export trades.</P>
    <P>On 10th September, the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the Irish and British Traffic Conference and the shipping companies concerned that he was concerned to note the proposed increases, particularly as they appeared to be of a uniform order, and that, having regard to the impact of cross-Channel shipping charges on the national economy, he was considering the desirability of establishing a tribunal to make a public inquiry into these charges and into the arrangements under which they were fixed.  It was suggested to them that the operation of the proposed increases might be deferred in the meantime.  The conference replied on 24th September that they found it impossible to defer the introduction of the increases announced and claimed that these increases were the minimum additions considered necessary to enable the undertakings to maintain the present standard of shipping facilities.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory authority by virtue of which direct control can be exercised over the level of cross-Channel or other shipping freights; and indeed it is in the nature of the <Col N="770" /> trade that effective control of freight rates cannot be unilaterally exercised by the Government here.  In the shipping industry generally keen international competition controls freight levels.  I think it is urgently necessary to find out why collective arrangements for the fixing of freight rates have brought about a position in which freight rates in the trade have risen uniformly over a long period when shipping rates generally were fluctuating.</P>
    <P>The most suitable body to undertake such an examination would be the Fair Trade Commission, but as the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, does not apply to services other than those ancillary to the supply and distribution of goods, an inquiry under that Act could not be carried out by the Fair Trade Commission.  The Government have decided instead, therefore, to set up an inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, and to ask the individual members of the Fair Trade Commission to undertake the inquiry.</P>
    <P>They will have available to them the organisation which they use for their ordinary inquiries and they have, of course, valuable experience in conducting similar inquiries in other fields.</P>
    <P>While the inquiry will be concerned principally with the level and structure of the freight rates of the Irish and British Traffic Conference and the associated companies operating regular cross-Channel services, the freights charged for bulk cargoes, such as coal and cement, carried by tramp shipping between here and Britain will also come within its scope.  The rates for bulk cargoes are fixed by the British Chamber of Shipping, an organisation representative of British shipowners, and there were increases in these rates as recently as last June.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the inquiry will be primarily a fact finding one.  There is at present no information available to the Government on which any firm opinion could be based as to whether the present freight rates are justified.  We should endeavour therefore not to pre-judge in any way the outcome of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> There is a tendency in the public mind at present to link inextricably the question of cross-Channel freight rates with that of increased Irish participation in that trade.  These are, of course, two entirely different matters. We are now dealing with a problem of freights and of concerted action to arrange the charges which might well exist in the same form even if there were substantial Irish participation in the cross-Channel trade.  The desirability of Irish participation in that trade is another matter and one which is being kept in sight.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will agree that the carrying out of this investigation is a matter of urgent public importance and will have no hesitation in assenting to the resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight, I think all of us would support this motion, but I prefer to look at it twice.  In looking at it closely, it seems to me that it represents a waste of time.  I would not go so far as to suggest that it is a deliberate waste of time, but the situation obtaining at present requires something more than a resolution from the Dáil and the Seanad asking the Government to set up an inquiry, an inquiry which will last how long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this motion as representing a great show of activity and concern on the part of the Government in relation to freight rates, and so on, without conferring the obligation on the Government of doing anything at all.  They are going to set up an inquiry.  They are going to ask the personnel of the Fair Trade Commission to go into the whole matter very deeply, and to discover what is happening exactly.  In his speech in the Dáil, as reported in column 87, Volume 164, of the Official Debates of 23rd October, 1957, they will determine whether there are collective arrangements or restrictive practices operating in the determination of shipping freight rates.  At column 67 of the same volume he said that &ldquo;monopoly pricing exists&rdquo; and that&mdash;I quote&mdash;&ldquo;... cross-Channel shipping is virtually immune from competition and that <Col N="772" /> they are free of all restraint except that imposed by the trade itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of doing something, instead of tackling the problem immediately in the light of what we know, in the light of the circumstances, and in the light of our experience over the past 30 years, we decide to do what?  To set up a commission.  It is not a Royal Commission, admittedly, which is the stock method of the British House of Commons of avoiding taking any action for many years; it is a &ldquo;commission of inquiry.&rdquo;  What sort of confidence has this House got that the setting up of a commission of inquiry at this juncture is anything more than a smokescreen, a way of avoiding taking any useful action now, a &ldquo;passing of the buck&rdquo; to some tribunal in the knowledge that they will take a certain time to report back, and that by that time a number of conditions will have changed and the Government may perhaps have decided what they can do?</P>
    <P>I do not know how long this commission will sit, but supposing it were to sit for three or six months, or three years as the same body did in fact sit in relation to baby foods and pharmaceutical products; supposing it discovers that there are restrictive practices in cross-Channel shipping which constitute an unreasonable restriction on the supply of those services; supposing they make a recommendation that action be taken; supposing that, say, there is found to be a collective arrangement or understanding between the companies relating to the prices to be charged, that that is &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo;, in that it involves an unnecessary and unreasonable limitation on free and fair competition and accordingly should be prohibited; supposing that this <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal makes recommendations along those lines, what will the Minister do about it?</P>
    <P>We know the answer to that already, because the same Fair Trade Commission from whose recent recommendations I have just been quoting made precisely those recommendations in those exact terms in relation to the supply of infant foods and pharmaceutical goods, and what did the <Col N="773" /> Minister decide to do?  He decided to do absolutely nothing, and would not even appear before the Seanad to explain his inactivity.  Now we are asking these same people to take most complicated steps in order to tell him something, which in relation to a whole lot of other goods and services he regards as quite unimportant and unworthy of his attention or action as a Minister.  Therefore, I think that this is just a waste of time, a way of stalling, a way of putting off decisions, and I do not think it should be entertained by this House.</P>
    <P>I know that it went through the Dáil without even very much discussion, much less opposition; but there was one juncture at which the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To attempt to decide now what should be done or what can be done would be a rather futile procedure, because the inquiry might show that some of the things we might think of now were unnecessary or, alternatively, might show them to be impracticable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Dillon intervened and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I thought the Minister said the inquiry was not to inquire into the steps that might be taken&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>which, in fact, he had stated.  The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the inquiry is over we will consider then the steps which can be taken to deal with this problem of high shipping rates on the cross-Channel services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So he intends to wait until he has had a long and cumbrous inquiry to tell him something he knows already, and when he finds out from that, officially, what he already knows, then he will &ldquo;consider what steps can be taken&rdquo; to deal with the situation.  I do not regard this as a serious motion at all. I think it is a routine method of pretending to do something and, in fact, doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I should like to consider the situation. British shipping companies are raising their rates by the equivalent of 5 per cent., although the rates on British Railways, I understand, have been raised by 10 per cent.  Is it the <Col N="774" /> suggestion that British Railways are coining money out of our trade?  If so, what has so long prevented our enterprising &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo; from going into this, and competing with them on level terms, or at least attempting it?  They may say: &ldquo;Ah, yes, but we would not be allowed to use British ports,&rdquo; and so on.  Have they tried?  If there is money to be picked up there, surely our go-getting business community would not have missed the chance?  Is it that there is no money to be got there?  Or that our private enterprise is not in fact so very enterprising at all?  Why is it that this virtual monopoly exists?  Has it not been apparent to us in this country for years&mdash;if it was not apparent from 1922 on, did it not become apparent in 1939&mdash;that we must not depend upon outside shipping?</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to recognise that the Labour Party in this country for years before the war had been urging successive Governments to set up an Irish shipping company.  It was only when the war broke out that, finally, the Government decided to do so.  I think we can be proud of Irish Shipping Limited.  The only thing we can regret is that its operations have not been more extensive.  I believe the solution to this problem lies with Irish Shipping Limited.  I believe they have the experience, and I believe that if they were given the encouragement and the authority it would be possible for Irish Shipping Limited to use its experience, its knowledge and its skill to negotiate a parallel competitive cross-Channel line, if necessary in much the same way as Aer Lingus has been able to negotiate and to get the use of British airports.  I see no reason why Irish Shipping Limited should not go into it.</P>
    <P>No one can say a State-sponsored company would be interfering with private enterprise.  Private enterprise has had 30 years and has not found it possible to do anything in this field. Other people may say that if Irish Shipping goes into it, money will be lost.  I believe that is quite possible, because I do not believe that this trade is such a gold mine for the British companies, as is sometimes suggested. <Col N="775" /> But I believe that if money were to be lost it would be well lost, it would still be an excellent investment from the Irish point of view.  The loss would be a balance sheet loss, but the gain to the country would be the sort of gain which is made by having, for instance, the condition of our roads and distribution services kept in perfect order. If the flow of goods and people into and out of this country is made as smooth as possible, the fact that there is a technical &ldquo;loss&rdquo; in one element in that process does not really matter&mdash; provided, of course, it is kept within reasonable proportions.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that a certain loss on a service of that kind, which makes for the smoother export and import of goods and people would be of immense benefit to the country as a whole, and would be the sort of thing which the community as a whole might regard as a profitable investment, a sinking of capital.  For that reason, it seems to me we should long ago have set about some such negotiation in order that we should have an Irish shipping line sponsored by the State, in order to cover this pretty extensive field of the shipping of goods and people back and forth.</P>
    <P>One could go into a lot of details about the kind of improvement one would expect to see, but I do no think this is the place for it.  I believe that now is the time to start that negotiation, that now is the time to go into that field, that now is the time for the Government to ask Irish Shipping for their opinion and advice and to ask them to explore the possibilities of starting a branch of Irish Shipping for cross-Channel trade, even were a temporary balance-sheet loss to be incurred.</P>
    <P>I believe that that is the realistic way of setting about it, and not by the setting up of an inquiry to report in six months' or three years' time, to tell us something we already know now.  For that reason, I shall vote against this time-wasting motion today, which seems to me not to contribute usefully at all to the solution of our cross-Channel shipping problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst agreeing with much of what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, I am afraid I could not support him in voting against this motion. I think it is right that there should be this inquiry, because the situation has become thoroughly confused and the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary have not helped in the least to dispel the confusion.  Mention is made in the motion of through rates, but neither in the speech in the Dáil nor in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary here this evening was there an indication that the whole problem is the through rates.  Reference was made to the sea charges; comparison was made with the ocean rates and the way they have varied in the past few years; but the fact of the matter is, of course, that there is a collective arrangement between the transport organisations in Ireland and in Britain in regard to through traffic.  I think the two public transport organisations in the Republic, under the control of the Minister&mdash;namely, C.I.E. and the G.N.R.&mdash;are parties to that arrangement. What has been increased is the through rates.</P>
      <P>It means that in the case of consignments going from a point in Ireland&mdash;which could be inland, and most of it is inland&mdash;to another place inland in Britain, the rate for that traffic has been increased by 7½ per cent.  The reason for the increase is very clear and I think the Minister might have been fair enough to say the reasons for it.  Those rates were increased by 7½ per cent.&mdash;certain arrangements were made which brought it to an average of 5 per cent., as the Parliamentary Secretary said&mdash;and the increase applied from 1st October of this year.  The reason for the increase was that the internal rates in Britain on British railways, the rates they charge to their own people, increased by 10 per cent. from 1st August, 1957. Apparently it was agreed between these organisations, including our own organisations, that the best way of averaging it out would be to apply this lower percentage increase to the through rates from the points in Ireland to the points in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been successive increases over recent years and those that I <Col N="777" /> have knowledge of seem, like this increase, to be connected with an increase in the internal rates in Britain. The last increase in through rates was as from 1st June, 1956.  That was an average increase of about 5 per cent. It coincided with an increase of 7½ per cent. in the internal rates in Britain as from 23rd May of that year.  The previous increase was as from 1st July, 1955, which was an increase of 15 per cent. on consignments of less than one ton and 7½ per cent. on consignments of one ton and over, and that increase also coincided with an increase in the internal rates in Britain of 15 per cent. as from 5th June, 1955.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that all these increase are connected with increases in the rates charged by British Railways internally in Britain.  We have not details as to the necessity for these increases in Britain, but we have sufficient information to know that British Railways are not making a great deal of money, any more than C.I.E. are out of these increased charges.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that these increases which I have mentioned are applied and are taken advantage of by the concerns which operate only the shipping part of the transport.  I mean, the through rate may be increased by 7½ per cent. from an internal point in Ireland to an internal destination in Britain, but a great deal of the traffic, principally live stock, is booked from Dublin to Birkenhead or Holyhead and where the service is purely a shipping service, it does not seem to me that the increase can be justified on the basis that British Railways internal charges have been increased by a higher percentage. That is a difficulty which arises because of the collective arrangement.  It seems to me to be a commercial problem rather than a question of British Railways or somebody else mulcting the Irish people in respect of transport.</P>
    <P>I cannot envisage how that difficulty can be overcome.  It seems impracticable, when an increase has to be applied internally in Britain, that the entire rate structure affecting traffic from every point in the Republic to every point in Britain should be swept aside and a new rate struck taking <Col N="778" /> account only of the 15 per cent. increase, or whatever it may be, in Britain. That does not seem to be practicable, but, nevertheless, as I have pointed out, the concern which supplies the shipping service only is making a good thing out of it and I can assure Senator Sheehy Skeffington that it is a gold mine for the shipping companies only.  That is the trouble and that is how it affects our exports, particularly live stock.</P>
    <P>If the tribunal can find a solution to that problem and disperse the confusion which has arisen, it will do a good day's work and for that reason I welcome the motion and await the establishment of the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion on behalf of the live-stock trade of this country.  These increases will cost the live-stock trade and the carcase-meat trade something like £1,000,000 a year.  On last year's shipments, 7½ per cent. will cost the live-stock trade alone a sum in the region of £750,000 and the carcase-meat trade a sum in the region of £100,000, which is a total of almost £1,000,000. It is the farmers who eventually will pay that.  Throughout the world, shipping companies' freight rates are being reduced and obviously there is a ring amongst the companies operating in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington covered admirably much of the ground which I had intended to cover.  He mentioned most of the points that I had in mind. There is no doubt in my mind and in the minds of the people in the cattle trade that there is a ring operating in cross-Channel shipping and the country suffers as a result of that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the tribunal which it is proposed to set up will be like many other tribunals and that we will get its findings in two years' time or 18 months' time.  This matter is very important to the farming community generally, and I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary, in the interests of everybody concerned, to see that something is done about this matter.  For the past four or five years, I have been advocating that Irish Shipping Limited <Col N="779" /> should be introduced to the cross-Channel service.  I have been a voice crying in the wilderness.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to endeavour to get Irish Shipping Limited to enter this service, and I assure him that the Irish live-stock trade will give him every support if he does so, if that should tend to reduce rates.</P>
    <P>I shall give the House an instance of what the present monopoly is costing the country.  To ship one ton of chilled meat from Dublin to London costs approximately £13 10s.  To ship one ton of meat from Buenos Aires to London costs £14 15s.  There is a case for inquiry there, having regard to the fact that whereas the distance from Buenos Aires to London is 6,000 to 7,000 miles, and the distance from Dublin to London only 300 miles the difference in the rate is only £1 5s. a ton.  On that issue alone, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do whatever he can to help the live-stock trade and the meat trade in this matter of transport.</P>

When he proposes any investigation, I think it can be said that he really intends to see it through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>A point which puzzles me and which I wish to put to the Parliamentary Secretary is the scope of the inquiry.  Will it be limited simply to cross-Channel traffic?  This <Col N="780" /> has been mentioned by other speakers and all I intend to mention is the fact that the cost of sending a carcase of beef from the abattoir in Dublin to London and from the Argentine to London is practically the same.  That is fantastic although, of course, in the case of the Argentine, the meat is brought over in big ships in cold-storage. Nevertheless, the fact is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>What I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary is: May this inquiry deal with the overland aspect as well as the cross-Channel aspect, because the cross-Channel transport is not the whole question?  Whatever about our costs in transporting the meat to the ports here, there is also the subsequent cost of transport from the port of landing in Britain&mdash;in the case of live stock, from Holyhead&mdash;to the various depots to which these cattle are distributed. It seems to me there is a bigger question involved than simply cross-Channel transport.</P>
      <P>That suggests to me the question: What is the good of Irish Shipping Limited going into the cross-Channel trade when there will still be the subsequent distribution overland to be dealt with, this transport being in other hands?  We could still be priced out of the market.  I trust we shall be able to get sufficient evidence and information to cover the whole question and that, notwithstanding what Senator Sheehy Skeffington says, we shall be able to get it quickly, and have some results.  Certainly, good results are very desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything I can say that will meet the point of view held by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I think I made an appeal at the outset that we should not pre-judge the issue.  The difference between the Senator and myself is that he seems to know all the facts and I do not presume to know any of them, and I am suggesting that we should go after them and discover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the Senator bases his attitude on what has happened in the North.  I have referred to some extracts from the Isles and Cuthbert Report dealing with somewhat similar <Col N="781" /> matters affecting the Six Counties, but one finds that the Six Counties are not doing anything and Senator Sheehy Skeffington therefore suggests we should follow their example.  We do not propose to do that.  We have a problem and we have the humility to say that we do not know the facts and we are taking what we think are the most effective steps to find them out.</P>
    <P>I believe it is an absolute prerequisite that we should know exactly and precisely what the position is before we can even express an opinion on it.  Having said that, I do not think I should deal with any points made by the Senator in the course of his further remarks which were based on the knowledge he professes to have and which I do not have.</P>
    <P>The other Senators who have spoken &mdash;at least Senator Murphy has done so &mdash;expressed views which indicated that they had a good deal of knowledge which the Minister does not presume to have.  It may be that the inquiry may establish the veracity of the statements of Senators in respect of these matters but we have no incontrovertible proof at this stage that these statements are true.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the statement that shipping companies are coining&mdash; I think that was the word used by Senator Sheehy Skeffington &mdash; and Senator Murphy supported him in that but he confined his reference to the shipping companies.  I do not know whether the shipping companies are coining, or whether only the shipping companies are coining, or if the coining is being done by anyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Senator knows C.I.E. is not coining?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, I can tell Senator O'Donovan that the overland rates are included in the reference to through rates.  I think the motion itself explains exactly what the scope of the inquiry will be.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The level and structure of cross-Channel shipping freight rates, including through rates; the extent, if any, to which collective arrangements or other restrictive practices obtain in the fixing and application <Col N="782" /> of freight rates; and, if such arrangements or practices obtain, whether their maintenance is contrary to the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a complete answer to Senator O'Donovan's queries.</P>
    <P>There is very little that can be said when one is starting off, as I must perforce do, from the starting point of lack of knowledge.  I am not, therefore, able to cross swords with people who made categorical statements about what they want and on facts touching this cross-Channel transport service. The suggestion therefore that Irish Shipping should get into this business as a solution to the problem cannot be made with any degree of certainty here.  I take it the question of utilising Irish Shipping is a matter that will be considered by the Government but it cannot possibly be considered until all the facts in relation to the matter have been ascertained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping, as the Senator knows, has done very well in the ocean tramp trade but one cannot inevitably deduce from that that they would have done equally well in the cross-Channel trade.  It may be that the case made by these companies is fully justified and, if it is fully justified, I take it that in itself would indicate that Irish Shipping could not do anything better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only repeat that we cannot assume, in the present state of our knowledge, that coining is in fact taking place at the expense of the Irish economy.  When this tribunal has reported, and I feel certain it will not take two years to do so, as has been suggested by Senator Murphy, I am quite satisfied that whatever action is possible on the facts as then ascertained will be taken with full vigour and promptitude by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Should there be any monopolistic conditions imposed by foreign shipping companies to the detriment of the Irish cattle trade, I believe that the Minister who established the Irish Shipping Company <Col N="783" /> in circumstances of world emergency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1957, prepared <Col N="784" /> by the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, and Section 4 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938, and laid before the House on the 12th day of July, 1957, be confirmed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes are made under the authority of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1957.  Section 4 of the Act of 1932 provides that no scheme shall come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by a resolution of each such House.  It is in pursuance of the obligation imposed by that section that the amending scheme is now before this House for confirmation.</P>
      <P>The scheme, as will be seen, is primarily devoted to granting increases in the service pensions of members of the Army, the Army Nursing Service and the Chaplaincy Service, whose services terminated prior to the 1st November, 1952.  An Army pay increase took effect as from that date and anyone serving at that time who later went on pension got the benefit of a correspondingly increased pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme of 1956.  The increases in this scheme are being given on the same basis as the increases already provided for in the Pensions (Increase) Act of 1956, and in the Army Pensions Act, 1957, which became law in July last.  The increases consist of whichever is the lesser of&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the appropriate sum as defined in Articles 4 and 6, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the amount which would be payable if the last day of service were the 1st November, 1952, and the rank and service, etc., were the same as on the actual date of discharge.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scale is the same as that laid down in the Army Pensions Act, 1957, in relation to Army disablement pensions and in the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, in relation to other classes of <Col N="785" /> State pensions.  The increases commence with effect from the 1st August, 1956, and they are in fact being paid since that date following a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in the Dáil on the 25th July, 1956.</P>
    <P>The increases apply as well to pensions payable to widows and children of deceased officers and the rates of increase are arrived at by the application of the appropriate sum.  The increases which I have mentioned are authorised in Articles 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21 and 22.  Perhaps what I have said, when taken in conjunction with the explanatory memorandum circulated with the scheme, will suffice and I shall now turn to the general matters included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Articles 7, 8, 9 and 18 concern certain officers of the Naval Service who were commissioned on a temporary basis and of whom some have had service since the days of the emergency when what is now the Naval Service was called the Marine Service. In November, 1946, some of the Marine Service officers retired and were paid gratuities under the normal provisions of the schemes in respect of their service up to then.  They were then immediately re-appointed to commissions in the Naval Service on a temporary basis in order to maintain the officer strength of the Service until such time as young officers could be recruited and trained.  Special provision to pay these former Marine Service officers gratuities was then made in Article 12B of the scheme. Some of these officers have had their service extended from time to time in the interests of the Service and are still serving, with the result that when they come to retire on age grounds or on the expiry of their present engagements they will have over 12 years' service since 1946.  This is the minimum period of service required of a regular officer before he may qualify for retired pay so it has been decided, instead of giving the Naval Service officers in question a gratuity under Article 12B, to make them eligible for an award of retired pay and, if married, a married officer's gratuity in respect of their service since 1946, on the same basis as that applicable to <Col N="786" /> the voluntary retirement of a regular officer.  Articles 7, 9 and 18 achieve this.  Apart from these officers, there were others who were commissioned on a temporary basis subsequent to 1946 and who had not served in the Marine Service.  They are not entitled to any gratuity under the present terms of Article 12B, and Article 8 of the present scheme deals with the matter by bringing them within the terms of Article 12B.  It is necessary to make the amendment retrospective to 28th February last in order to cover the case of an officer who retired as from that date.  The Article also provides an increased rate of gratuity in respect of service in the rank of lieutenant-commander and rates for the first time for the ranks of ensign and commander.</P>
    <P>Article 12 is a technical measure amending sub-article (6) of Article 20 of the scheme to make it clear that the widow of an officer who retired on age grounds with at least 12 years' pensionable service is entitled to a pension under the article.  The article has always been construed on this basis but, in order to place the matter beyond question, it is considered desirable to clarify the position by an explicit reference to retirement on age grounds.  The article is deemed to operate as from the commencement date of the original scheme.</P>
    <P>Article 16 amends the provision governing the method of payment of pensions in order to simplify the calculations.</P>
    <P>Article 17 is another technical amendment.  The scheme as at present was found not to cover certain service of officers who, during the emergency period, had continuous service but in varying capacities such as enlisted soldiers, cadets and Reserve officers. The principle that continuous service in such cases should count as pensionable service is not in question and all this amendment does is to write that principle clearly into the relevant Schedule. The amendment is retrospective to cover past cases.</P>
    <P>Article 19 makes one change in the Fifth Schedule to the principal scheme which governs the rank by <Col N="787" /> which married officers' gratuities are to be calculated by providing that, where an officer holding the appointment of Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General or Quartermaster-General is compulsorily retired, or an officer holding the appointment of Chief of Staff retires in circumstances to which Article 6 of the principal scheme applies, a married officer's gratuity, if payable, shall be calculated by reference to the same rank as applied to the calculation of retired pay.  At present, by reason of the terms of the Fifth Schedule, the possibility exists that an officer retiring in the circumstances mentioned would have his retired pay calculated by reference to his actual retiring rank and his married officer's gratuity by reference to a lower rank held by him 12 months earlier.</P>
    <P>I now come to the last article&mdash; No. 23&mdash;which effects an important change in the process of making awards under the scheme.  Up to this, the consent of the Minister for Finance has been necessary to each grant made under the scheme.  Now, however, that the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1957, has taken this requirement out of the Acts it is possible to follow suit in the schemes and this article in effect will remove the Minister for Finance from the granting machinery and enable grants to be made by me without references to that Minister.  Needless to say this will eliminate the administrative procedures involved in referring each case to the Minister for Finance and will, I am confident, improve the administration in my Department and enable awards to be made more expeditiously to those qualifying under the schemes.  I shall, of course, continue to be bound by the terms of the schemes which cannot be altered except with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to a Resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That concludes my statement on this amending scheme which I commend to the House.  If there are any points on which further explanation is required, I shall be pleased to deal with them when I am concluding.</P>

      <P>I notice that, in reading through the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1957, all through the scheme the description given is &ldquo;the Defence Forces&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Forces&rdquo;.  In the Irish text, I see that the expression is &ldquo;Oglaigh na hÉireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forsaí Cosanta&rdquo;. All through, wherever reference is made, there is &ldquo;the Army Nursing Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Naval Service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In Article 17 of the scheme, at the end of paragraph 2 (a), referring to service, we read: &ldquo;Such continuous service shall be deemed to be service in commissioned rank in the National Army.&rdquo;  That is the only instance in the scheme where I can find any departure from the phraseology &ldquo;Defence Forces&rdquo;, &ldquo;Forsaí Cosanta&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oglaigh na hÉireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Forces&rdquo;.  Can the Minister inform me what exactly the term means?  Why was it necessary to depart from the phrases used all through the scheme? Why was it necessary to use that particular term and what exactly does it consist of?</P>

      <P>The only point in relation to the motion was raised by Senator Ó Maoláin.  It concerned the phraseology used in Article 17 where the words &ldquo;the National Army&rdquo; are mentioned.  That phrase &ldquo;the National Army&rdquo; arises there because Section 17 is an amendment to sub-Rule 2 of Rule 1 of the principal scheme which was introduced in 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Principal scheme of 1937 arose from the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, which was the enabling Act under which Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes were introduced.  The term &ldquo;the National Army&rdquo; was defined for the first time in the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932.  It was introduced <Col N="789" /> purely as a drafting term in order to classify under the one title all the different forces that were being catered for in the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin asked me for the definition given of &ldquo;the National Army&rdquo;.  It is first of all necessary to define what is meant by &ldquo;the Forces&rdquo;.  Section 1 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this Act the expression the Forces&rsquo; means the forces established under Part 1 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923 (No. 30 of 1923);</P>
    <P>The expression &lsquo;the National Army&rsquo; means the following forces, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the armed forces under the control of the Minister for Defence during the period commencing on the 1st day of February, 1922, and ending on the 31st day of March, 1922, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the armed forces maintained by the Provisional Government, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the armed forces maintained by the Government of Saorstát Éireann up to and including the 30th day of September, 1924, and</P>
    <P>(d)  the Forces,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;the Forces&rdquo; having already been defined.  Therefore, it was to include those four categories that the phrase &ldquo;the National Army&rdquo; was adopted.  It is because Section 17 is an amendment of that section that that phrase is used here.  That is the only point raised and I would ask the House to approve the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This pensions scheme arises from alterations which have been made in the Defence Force Regulations governing retiring ages for certain officers who, having been granted the 1916 Medal or the Service (1917-1921) Medal, or both of those medals, were eligible to have applied to them retiring ages which were higher than those normally applicable. I should perhaps explain that at present the normal ages prescribed by Defence Force Regulations for the retirement of officers with the 1916 Medal or the Service (1917-1921) Medal are one year higher than the normal retiring ages for officers without those medals.  Furthermore, up to recently an additional extension of two years could have been granted to an officer with either of the medals subject to certain requirements as to health and efficiency and to my being satisfied that it was in the best interests of the service if he continued to serve beyond the normal age for his retirement.  All such extensions were, of course, subject to the overriding maximum of 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>These extended age limits were brought into force in July, 1949, in so far as the additional year is concerned and in November, 1954, in so far as the extra two years are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I am called upon to go into the reasons which actuated the Governments then in power in granting these benefits to the officers concerned. I am satisfied, however, that the two year extension granted in 1954 did not redound to the general well-being of the Army in that it created a serious sense of injustice in the officers in the junior ranks who had not the medals and whose normal prospects of advancement were suddenly seriously impaired. The position was aggravated, of course, by the fact that the great majority of the officers benefiting were senior officers.  In the circumstances I have taken steps to have the authority for granting the additional two year <Col N="791" /> extension withdrawn in the case of officers retiring on or after 1st November, 1957.  The necessary amendment to Defence Force Regulations has been promulgated.  Officers who are already serving on a two year extension are not affected by the amendment to the regulations mentioned and they may, if they wish, continue to serve until they reach the extended age limits already approved in their cases.</P>
    <P>I recognise that those officers who up to this have acted on the assumption that they would have the benefit of a retiring age limit extended by two years may feel aggrieved by this amendment to the regulations.  I am fully satisfied, however, that the general well-being and morale of the Army as a whole demand that this two year extension of age limits should be withdrawn.  In order, however, to ensure that the remedying of one grievance will not create another, the Government have authorised me to prepare this pensions scheme which provides that the officers concerned will on retirement be paid supplementary retired pay which, when added to their normal retired pay, will bring their income by way of retired pay and supplementary retired pay up to the amount of the Army pay which would be payable to them if they had continued to serve for a further period of two years in the same ranks as they held at the dates of their retirement. This scheme, therefore, maintains for the officers concerned the financial benefits of a further two years' Army service.  The supplementary retired pay will cease when the officer reaches either the extended age limit which would have been applicable to him if the Defence Forces Regulations had not been amended or the age of 65 years, whichever is the earlier.  Provision to the foregoing effect is contained in Article 5 of the scheme which article also provides in effect that an officer in the category concerned who is already serving subject to an age limit extended by two years and who retires voluntarily before he reaches such extended age limit, will likewise be eligible for supplementary retired pay from the date of his retirement and up to the date on which he <Col N="792" /> would reach either the extended age limit or the age of 65 whichever is the earlier.</P>
    <P>Article 6 makes provision for a case where an officer to whom the scheme applies qualifies for a disablement pension on retirement.  In such an event, the supplementary retired pay would be reduced to such amount as would keep the total payable by way of retired pay, supplementary retired pay and disablement pension to the equivalent of his Army pay.</P>
    <P>Article 7 applies to supplementary retired pay certain general provisions of the pensions schemes which at present apply to normal retired pay. There is nothing new involved and I do not think it necessary to deal in detail with these.</P>
    <P>As to the numbers of officers affected by these proposals, at present there are 64 officers serving whose dates of retirement, without the extension of two years, fall after 1st November, 1957.  These officers, therefore, cannot be granted the two years extension of retiring age but they will instead qualify for the grant of supplementary retired pay for two years after retirement.</P>
    <P>There are a further 25 officers who were granted the extension of two years and whose extended dates of retirement fall after 1st November, 1957.  It is open to them, as I have mentioned, to continue to serve until they reach the extended retiring age. Where, however, they choose to retire before that time, they will be eligible for the grant of supplementary retired pay as from the date of retirement and up to the date on which they would otherwise have retired on age grounds.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of this scheme, it is estimated, having regard to the indications as to their intentions given by the 25 officers I have just referred to, that the amount of supplementary retired pay which will become payable up to 31st March next will be £4,000.  Normal retired pay which will be payable concurrently will amount to approximately the same figure bringing the total payable under both heads to £8,000.  This additional expenditure will be borne on the Vote <Col N="793" /> for Army Pensions but there will be a saving on the Vote for Defence of roughly an equal amount for the same period.  Of course, there will also fall on the Vote for Army Pensions the amounts payable on foot of married officers' gratuities ordinarily payable on retirement and these it is estimated will amount to £18,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> I do not think there is anything more which can usefully be said on the scheme which I commend to the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
