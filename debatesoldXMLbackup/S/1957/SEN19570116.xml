      <P>I have received notice from Senator McHugh that on the motion for the adjournment of the House to-night he proposes to raise the question on the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To request the Government, in view of the serious unemployment crisis, to initiate immediately large-scale emergency relief schemes.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 9.30 to 10 p.m., or earlier, if the business for the day concludes.</P>

      <P>I was just wondering whether, as the Bill stands, this section might not be open to an ambiguous interpretation.  It might be that the board would be taken to be a voluntary board like a voluntary hospital board.  I am just wondering whether the section really does indicate that it is a voluntary board.  If it is intended to pay the board, then the wording is a bit ambiguous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also worried about this matter.  The only thing I can find voluntary in connection with this Bill is the question of subscriptions.  Almost every other section of the Bill will go into operation with the Minister's consent.  Like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I, too, am wondering if &ldquo;Voluntary Health Board&rdquo; is a correct description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I do not understand exactly the point made by the Senators.  Surely the whole proposal contained in this Bill and the consideration of this matter over an extended period have had to do with voluntary health insurance.  The board which will offer to the people such voluntary health insurance will be a board set up for that specific purpose and, in my opinion, it is therefore correctly described as the voluntary health insurance board.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 and 3 agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="3" /> SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister consider the phrase &ldquo;to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify&rdquo;.  The board will defray the cost to that extent.  I take it that the extent the Minister could specify would have to be specified before the contracts were entered into.  Otherwise, this phrase might imply that the Minister might suddenly alter the benefits without notice to subscribers. I would like to draw attention to that point.</P>
      <P>There is then a further point I would like to raise in relation to sub-section (4) of this section.  The board is to fix the subscriptions so that they will be sufficient to do certain things.  I have had some experience with other insurance schemes in connection with the operations of the Revenue Commissioners. It seems to me that a scheme of this kind, run in any kind of sensible way, will at times have reserves of profits accumulated.  As the Bill stands, these profits might be subject to tax&mdash; I know that is a subject which should not be mentioned here&mdash;and, if that were to happen, it might have a very serious effect on any fund built up under the scheme.  These are two points which should be considered in relation to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-section (1), it is mandatory on the board, as Senator Cox has pointed out, to put into operation whatever health services are specified by the Minister.  That raises a very important issue because it puts the board in the position in which they can formulate, as we will see in a later section, health legislation.  If the Minister directs the board to bring into operation health services, of which so far we have had no details in the Bill, the board under this section will have to put those services into operation.  That means that the Oireachtas will be by-passed, as far as consideration of these proposed services is concerned.</P>
      <P>Again, in sub-section (3) it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A scheme under this section may <Col N="4" /> be amended by a subsequent scheme made by the board....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, to take an example, when the board receive this Act, they can amend it by a scheme of their own and, provided they obtain the Minister's consent to this scheme, that scheme as amended by the board can become law.  This is a board of a small number of people, a board with a quorum of three.  While I accept that State-sponsored companies or bodies may have power to make regulations under a section, it is an entirely different matter that a very experimental company such as this, sponsored by a State Department, should have the power to make an amending scheme without coming to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  Under sub-section (4), it is mandatory on the board to put the Voluntary Health Insurance Act on a paying basis.  I referred to this question on Second Stage.  I should like to know from the Minister what will happen if the board fails to put it on a paying basis?  They cannot continue to raise the premium year after year until they strike a balance.  I am not quite clear as to what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I wish to refer.  Sub-section (1) speaks of medical, surgical and other services as the Minister may from time to time specify.  Where are the services to be made available under this Bill to be obtained?  Is this Voluntary Health Insurance Bill confined, as far as benefits are concerned, to private hospitals, nursing homes and private accommodation in the public hospitals or&mdash;and this is a rather important point&mdash;could the Minister tell me can persons who are entitled to benefits under this Bill obtain such benefits in the public wards of our hospitals?</P>
    <P>I am sorry to put so many questions and to cross one section over another but there are some points there which, perhaps, the Minister would clear up for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points I wish to make on this section with special reference to sub-section (3), which indicates that a <Col N="5" /> scheme may be amended in future under certain circumstances and sub-section (4), which says that the subscriptions &ldquo;shall be sufficient, but only sufficient&rdquo;, and so on.  I asked the Minister a question on the Second Stage which he did not answer at the time.  If he is prepared to give it now, I should like him to indicate to us, if he would, within certain limits, necessarily, with what number of subscribers he thinks it is conceivable the scheme will work reasonably well and below what figures it will prove very difficult; in other words, in general terms, what kind of general target he has thought essential as a number of subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cox made a point on sub-section (4), that the board shall fix the subscriptions so as to be sufficient, but only sufficient, and he wonders whether, if they made a profit, that profit would be taxed.  I think the answer to that is that the words in the sub-section are that the amount &ldquo;shall be sufficient, but only sufficient (as nearly as may be),&rdquo; that is to say, the Bill avoids a mathematical arrangement.  The board is to do its best to see that no profit is made.  I think we would all be in agreement with that.  With regard to a point that a Minister for Finance at some point might make the board pay income-tax on a profit which it had&mdash;a small profit over a short period&mdash;I think Senator Cox, who is so interested in law, would have to take our word for it that that would not be practical politics.  I do not see the Minister for Finance now or in the future who would take any such action.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator ffrench O'Carroll, he thinks that the board should not have power, under sub-section (3), to amend the scheme in the Bill, but, as I read the Bill, there is no scheme in the Bill.  Is that not correct? I do not know how Senator ffrench O'Carroll comes to the conclusion that they have power to amend the scheme in the Bill because there is not any scheme in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of the Bill is that the Voluntary Health Board set up will make a scheme and that they may from time <Col N="6" /> to time amend it.  If you once accept the idea that there must be a board, that they can make a scheme, you surely must accept the further idea that they can amend the scheme when they have made it.  Therefore, it seems to me that there is no by-passing of the Oireachtas anywhere in the Bill.  The idea is that you set up the board and, under Section 4, they make a scheme, subject to certain powers of the Minister and having made the scheme, they can submit amendments to the scheme to the Minister, but I think that the Senator is misinforming himself when he suggests that there is a scheme in the Bill and that the board can amend the Bill. The board can make a scheme and then, naturally, they can amend the scheme in the light of their own experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite accept that I was incorrect in saying that the board can amend this Bill when it becomes an Act because, of course, we have not got the details here.  The reply which Senator Hayes has given to the point that I raised, in a way, does make my question all the more important.  We are passing health legislation here which gives far fewer details as to what it proposes to do than any other Health Bill I have ever read and I would submit through you, Sir, to Senator Hayes that that, in fact, makes it all the more important, as it is a very vague Bill and as we here have no idea what the scheme will be.  It makes it all the more important that when a scheme is drawn up under a Bill like this, with rather wide powers, that the Oireachtas should have an opportunity at least to see what is proposed or that there should be an opportunity for the Oireachtas to consider amendments before they become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to point out to Senator ffrench O'Carroll that the Health Bills of which he speaks were Bills which were compulsory upon certain classes of people. They were Bills dealing with health services which were available for certain people and the subscriptions towards which were compulsory on certain people.  Is that not correct? <Col N="7" /> Therefore, of course, they were public legislation and the scheme was in the Bill.  This is a Bill of a completely different character.  In this case, what you do is to set up a board which offers certain benefits which people may or may not accept and that is in quite a different category, therefore, from the other Health Bills of which the Senator has spoken.</P>
      <P>The only thing you can do with a Bill of this kind, once you accept the principle of it, is to set up a board and let the board do the best it possibly can.  The vital point about it is that it is not compulsory.  I am not compelled and nobody is compelled to join the scheme.  The scheme is a voluntary one.  That is the essence of the whole thing.  It is not for the Oireachtas to frame a scheme; it is for the Oireachtas to set up a board which will itself frame a scheme and which must have power to amend it.  That is not by-passing the Oireachtas in any sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the points put forward from this side of the House by Senators Sheehy Skeffington and ffrench O'Carroll and the point put forward by Senator Cox are worthy of consideration.  As Senator Hayes has mentioned, this is a voluntary scheme.  We must, at the same time, consider the fact that this board is being given a monopoly of this kind of insurance under Section 23. As far as my reading of the Bill enables me to come to any conclusion, the conclusion I have come to is that no other insurance body in this country will be given the opportunity to carry out any such health insurance as is envisaged in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I think it right and proper that we should have some machinery whereby the Oireachtas would have the opportunity of becoming acquainted with what the board is doing.  I think the best way to meet the point would be to ensure that when a scheme such as is envisaged in this measure is being carried out, it would be done by ministerial Order and that the details of that Order would be made available to the Oireachtas&mdash;that copies of the Order <Col N="8" /> would be laid on the Table of the House, that the two Houses of the Oireachtas would be given an opportunity of discussing the method by which the scheme would be carried out, as well as the details of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the other point which arises from sub-section (4) of this section, I must say I am not entirely satisfied with the explanation given by Senator Hayes.  He said it could not possibly arise that the reserves of this board would be subject to income-tax. After all, all bodies subject to company law are liable for income-tax&mdash; friendly societies and so on.  Any reserves they have out of profits are subject to tax.  I would like at this stage to ascertain from the Minister whether he can say now in fact whether the reserves, if there be any, will be liable for income-tax, because that, in the end, would have an effect on the premiums payable by voluntary subscribers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters have been raised on this section and perhaps if I deal with the matter lastly referred to by Senator Kissane, and earlier raised by Senator Cox, at the beginning, it would be best.  I refer to the point about the liability of the board, from its business of insurance, to pay income-tax on any profits it makes.  It is, I am told, correct to say that, under the present state of the law, income-tax would be payable.  Whether the law in that respect will continue as it is at the moment is a matter to be considered. I am not the appropriate Minister to consider that, but I agree it certainly is a matter that will have to be considered later.  However, it is not appropriate to a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators have mentioned as a criticism the power the board would have to alter benefits under their health insurance scheme.  I should like to put it this way to Senators: this Bill is a machinery Bill, designed to set up the machinery which is regarded as appropriate to provide this form of health insurance for the people of the country.  It is designed to fill a void which exists and to provide some <Col N="9" /> method whereby this form of insurance can be made available to those who require it.  If it were decided to provide in this legislation the precise benefits that should be contained in the insurance offered to the public, then it can be readily appreciated that this kind of legislation would have to be amended from time to time.</P>
    <P>If costs and expenses vary, if new medical techniques and new specialties become available, that would indeed be a very wrong way to provide for this need.  Senators can just think of the trouble that would be involved if this Bill contained a section setting out the benefits suggested in the Advisory Body's report.  At page 13 of that report, the benefits are set out. If those benefits were inserted in the Bill, it might be found in a few months that the £7 a week payment suggested in respect of hospital expenses was, in fact, inadequate.  It might be found that various specialist services set out in the report did not provide an adequate cover, that some new specialties and techniques had become known and that the insurance scheme thus proposed in the Bill would not cover them.  If such benefits were inserted in an Act of Parliament, it would be necessary for the Minister for Health to come back to the Oireachtas and amend the provisions by adding to or altering the benefits.</P>
    <P>For that reason, it was proposed here that the board set up would itself draw up a scheme of insurance, power being retained by the Minister for Health to ensure that the scheme the board draws up is adequate to meet the need.  That is why the provision which Senator Cox mentioned is contained in sub-section (1)&mdash;&ldquo;to such extent as the Minister may from time to time specify&rdquo;.  That is not intended to be a delimiting power.  It is intended to be a power to ensure that the cover will be adequate and that it will meet the public need so far as insurance is concerned.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that each contract of health insurance, whether made with the board or otherwise, is a yearly contract and that it must be renewed every year by the individual <Col N="10" /> insuring and by the insurers.  From time to time, it may be found by the board, in the light of their experience, that they have to alter the policy which they offer, and provision is made that in order to alter the insurance scheme, they must secure the consent of the Minister for Health, so as to ensure that at all times the insurance cover is adequate to meet the needs of the people.  No alteration of any kind could affect the contract which is then in operation&mdash;the yearly contract of insurance.  It can affect each individual insuring only at the end of the contract period&mdash;at the end of the current year of insurance.</P>
    <P>Senator ffrench O'Carroll asked whether this scheme was intended to provide cover only in respect of private and semi-private wards in the general hospitals, nursing homes and so on.  There is no restriction in that connection contemplated or intended. A person who insures under this scheme may go to any hospital and any part of any hospital he wishes.  He can go into the public ward of the hospital if that is his preference, and, wherever he goes, he will get precisely the cover set out in the scheme. Indeed, I anticipate that&mdash;I will not say a large number&mdash;but certainly some people may prefer to go to the public ward of one of the general hospitals with this insurance cover, because, of course, the charge falling uncovered under the insurance would be very much less than it might be in a nursing home or in the private wards.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked whether I could give an opinion as to the minimum number of persons necessary to provide a reasonable chance for the scheme to succeed.  It is not easy to be precise on a matter of that kind, but I am advised that it is felt that 25,000 persons at least will be necessary to enable the scheme to develop properly.  As I indicated on Second Reading, I hope there will be a great many more than that availing of health insurance, but it is felt that that would be the minimum to enable the scheme to operate satisfactorily.  I hope I have covered the different points made by Senators on the section and the various sub-sections, but <Col N="11" /> if I have overlooked anything, I shall be glad to give any other information required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with sub-section (3) of Section 4, is the Minister's consent necessary only in so far as the scope of the benefits is concerned or is it necessary in relation to any modification of any scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really a matter arising on interpretation, but certainly the idea is that there should not be any serious alteration in the benefits, without the consent of the Minister.  As regards going down to trivial details, I would imagine that that would not be desirable administratively, and probably it will be operated in that sense.  I should have mentioned earlier that, under sub-section (2) of the section in question, it is envisaged that the board may have on offer to the public not only the minimum scheme, that is, the scheme drawn up in accordance with ministerial specifications, but other schemes of a more expensive kind and perhaps providing greater benefits. The provision of such a scheme is also subject to ministerial consent in order to ensure that, by offering such a scheme to the public, the board will not lose money.  They will be encouraged to offer a choice of schemes, provided the return is satisfactory and does not lead to loss of revenue, or in any way militate against the main concern of the board, that is, to provide the minimum scheme that will be detailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in this statement by the Minister that beneficiaries under this Voluntary Health Insurance Bill will occupy the wards of our public hospitals. Might I remind the Minister that one of the reasons he gave us for postponing the Health Act of 1953 was that he himself felt he had only sufficient accommodation for the lower income group and that he had to postpone the operation of benefits for the middle income group until more accommodation facilities were available? I do not think there is anything <Col N="12" /> wrong with providing for all income groups and giving everybody an opportunity to become a patient in any of our hospitals, but I do assume that the Minister is aware that there is often a shortage of beds in our hospitals from time to time, and that we want to see that as far as the lower income group is concerned that shortage of bed accommodation will not in any way be accentuated by throwing the hospitals open to yet another group which formerly did not use the wards of our public hospitals.</P>
      <P>I would not worry very much about the delegated powers which this Bill proposes to give to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board if the position were as Senator Hayes suggests, that this was catering for a group of persons outside the present health legislation, but I think I established on Second Reading, and the Minister acknowledged it in his reply, that there would be an interchange between many sections of this Voluntary Health Bill and the existing Health Act.  In view of that, I feel that the Oireachtas should have an opportunity to consider whatever schemes are made under this Bill, particularly in so far as they will affect existing health legislation in the country and certainly anything which the Voluntary Health Board itself seeks to amend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point on which I should like the Minister to comment.  Sub-section (4) refers to the necessity for this scheme to meet the charges, whatever they may be, &ldquo;properly chargeable to revenue&rdquo;.  In paragraph 34 of the report of the Advisory Body, we are told that information was made available to them in respect of certain existing voluntary health insurance organisations and that information indicated that the administrative costs varied&mdash;they are talking about Britain and abroad&mdash;&ldquo;from 15 per cent. to 30 per cent. of premium income&rdquo;.  They go on to suggest at the end of the same paragraph, on page 16, that it is probable that an expense ratio of 30 per cent. of the premium income will be necessary, at any rate in the initial stages of the scheme here.  The administrative expense ratio will be as high <Col N="13" /> as 30 per cent., which is the highest figure that has been charged elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's comment on that in the light of the fact that the Advisory Body's information on this matter does not seem to me to be complete.  They say that administrative costs elsewhere &ldquo;vary from 15 to 30 per cent.&rdquo;  As I indicated on the Second Stage, the expense ratio of at least one British company, the British United Provident Association, is 10 per cent.  Therefore, it is not true to say that elsewhere it varies from 15 per cent. to 30 per cent.  It varies, if you like, from 10 per cent. to 30 per cent.  We are here being told already, therefore, that it looks as if the Irish scheme will be, from the administrative expenses point of view, comparable with the dearest of schemes elsewhere, and I should like to know why the expense ratio is anticipated to be so high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I, first of all, reply to what Senator ffrench O'Carroll has said?  It is, strictly speaking, irrelevant to this discussion, but, since he has raised it, I think perhaps I should deal with it.  Senator ffrench O'Carroll reminded the House that one of the reasons why I sought the postponement of the operation of the Health Act, 1953, was a shortage of hospital beds.  That is true.  I would remind the House, however, that, in the past two and a half years, a great number of additional beds has become available and the position in that regard has much improved.  It was for that reason that I found it possible to implement the postponed sections of the Health Act and I take some satisfaction in the fact that the advice which I had to give to the House two and a half years ago was, in fact, proved to have been sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, nowadays as a result of arrangements which I made, not only all the local authority hospitals but all the voluntary hospitals, who have entered into appropriate agreements, are bound to take into their beds all Health Act patients, all health authority patients.  That is a safeguard which now exists and which did not exist before.  Again, I feel I am <Col N="14" /> entitled to take some satisfaction for that state of affairs.  It means that any person availing of health insurance who desires to go to the public wards of either the local authority hospitals or the different voluntary hospitals will be enabled to do so, provided that a bed is available for him.  If a bed is not available, he cannot do so.  The beds that are available must be provided, in the first instance, for those who are entitled to avail of the Health Act services because they are regarded as being in need of assistance in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned the question of administrative expenses. We do not know what the experience will be with regard to the administrative costs of this scheme. The Advisory Body, in considering this matter, were, I think, quite correctly, concerned to ensure that the factor in the premium to cover administrative costs would be on the cautious side and they approached it from that point of view.  I am told that at the time of the Advisory Body's investigations the administrative costs of one of the English associations was around 15 per cent.  It has since, I am told, been reduced to around 10 per cent., but it would be foolish to rely completely on English experiences in these matters.  The circumstances here are quite different, and were a scheme to be offered based entirely on experience in England, or elsewhere, it might be found to be very faulty. Accordingly, it is wiser to take the outside limit&mdash;I think it is an outside limit&mdash;of 30 per cent. and then base the initial premiums on that figure, in the belief and hope that experience will show the administrative costs to be very much less and, accordingly, a more realistic premium can be arrived at later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points arising out of this matter on which we are not quite clear.  Firstly, with reference to this matter of taxation, I may say that we on this side of the House, as the Minister knows, have certain misgivings, as well as on the Bill as a whole.  We appreciate that the Bill is in the nature of an experiment and we are perfectly <Col N="15" /> willing to treat it as such and to give the board full scope to carry out its experiment; but are we to take it that the Minister appreciates the importance of this matter of taxing and non-taxing of reserves?  Insurance companies, like banks and various financial institutions, must in the public interest, build up very considerable reserves.  Normally, the reserves come out of what are called profits and normally, I take it, reserves are taxed.  The taxation at present rates runs to about 40 per cent. of the profits involved and the Minister can see what a heavy burden that could be on the members of this organisation, whenever it is set up.</P>
      <P>Are we to take it that the Minister appreciates the importance of that and is the fact that he has not made provision that these reserves will be nontaxable due to the fact that the Minister for Finance has the final say? If it is true that the Minister would have power to provide that these reserves be free of tax, then I think he should do it.  We had an idea that an amendment might be put down on this matter, but we were conscious of the fact that it might be ruled out of order as involving a charge on the State.  We were prepared to let it go and to hear what the Minister had to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point is in regard to the submitting of schemes to the Minister and their publication by means of Order.  It is one on which we should get some more clarification.  It seems that the board will be charged with the duty of developing a scheme and that that scheme will have to be submitted to the Minister.  I take it that the board will have to submit the scheme to the Minister for approval, and, if that is so, what is the objection to providing that the scheme, having been submitted, will be made a matter of ministerial Order and that the Order will then be laid on the Table of the House?  The Minister may say: &ldquo;But changes may have to be made from time to time.&rdquo;  That is true of all schemes; changes have to be made from time to time, Orders are altered and new Orders made, and I do not see why in this instance the scheme, when <Col N="16" /> prepared by the board and submitted to the Minister, should not then come before the Oireachtas by way of Order.</P>

      <P>May I say on this question of the board and profits and taxation that what I said before was that I thought that if the board was to make a profit, the Minister for Finance would not tax it.  Perhaps I could extend that somewhat.  I agree entirely with Senator Ó Buachalla.  I think that this board will not be a success, unless it can prove that it can make a profit on a certain scheme and should build up reserves.  I express the opinion freely that such profits should not be taxed.  The board will not be a profit-making concern, and, if it makes profits, it will use them for the purpose of showing that the scheme can be carried out on lower subscriptions from the members.  That is the position, I take it.  Most certainly, they should not be taxed.  As that is not clear from our present legislation, as I think at present it is not, then most emphatically the law should be altered so that such profits made by a board such as this should not be taxed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told he has not.  That is why I am making myself clear now.  I think he should have that power.  I think Senator Ó Buachalla will agree that it is not in this Bill but rather in a Finance Bill that that power should be taken by the Minister for Finance.  There can be very little doubt that anybody in the position of a Minister for Finance whose colleague was bringing in a Bill of this kind would be bound to put himself in the position in which he would exempt such profits as might be made by such a board as this from taxation.  There can be hardly any doubt of that.  I suggest, not because it would impose a charge but rather because it would be irrelevant on this particular type of Bill, that provision cannot be made here.  I think it certainly should be made elsewhere, presumably in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <Col N="17" /> With regard to the members of the Oireachtas seeing the scheme, there is not much difficulty involved, I suppose, in making regulations that such schemes shall be laid on the Table.  I take it that when the schemes are laid, copies will be circulated to all the members.  It will not be a Civil Service document coming under any form of official secrecy or not available to the public.  I am not a skilled person in this matter, but I presume that, when a scheme is made and an amendment proposed and finally agreed upon, after consultation with the Minister, as is provided for under Section 4, it will become for all practical purposes a public document.  If there are 25,000 subscribers, as is anticipated, or more, there will surely be plenty of copies of it.  In that way, members of the Oireachtas would find no difficulty whatever in getting a copy.</P>

      <P>I think Senators may be under a misapprehension. Senator Hayes has just touched on it. Remember that the concern of this board is to sell something&mdash;that they are out to sell insurance, to sell an insurance scheme.  They are not going to sell it by locking it up in their own office and not letting people know what is in it.  I look forward, indeed, to every member of this House entering into this health insurance scheme and buying this policy and having full knowledge of the extent of the benefits and, of course, being an insured person, being also aware of any alterations that may be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the proposal is that the Health Insurance Board will run the health insurance scheme.  If it were felt better to run it by the Department of Health, then I can see the need for publishing regulations and laying them on the Table of the Houses of the Oireachtas and all the rest of that, but that is not the proposal here.  This is a Bill to enable a board to run a health insurance and in that regard they should be as free as it is possible to allow in running the business it is set up to run, just as Bord na Móna are charged with the duty of developing our turf resources. The schemes they decide upon are matters entirely for them.  Their <Col N="18" /> schemes of development have not to receive the sanction or approbation of either House of the Oireachtas, but if, in fact, Bord na Móna or any other semi-State body does not carry out its duties, the Minister responsible is held to account in the Oireachtas for that failure.  Here, too, if the Health Insurance Board does not provide an adequate insurance cover or alters it in some way harmful to persons availing of insurance, then the Minister for Health, who must give his consent to any such alterations, is responsible and answerable to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would ask Senators to remember in this connection that in the Oireachtas we are not completely cut off from the outside world.  Everybody will know the extent of these benefits and it will be the concern of the board to make them as widely known as possible because they are out to interest people in buying this insurance.  If, as I say, alterations are made of a harmful kind, then, very quickly, the Minister for Health will have it drawn to his attention in the Oireachtas itself.  I do not think it is proper to go any further than that.  The board is set up to provide a scheme and I think they should be as free as possible to carry out the statutory obligation in that regard.</P>

      <P>Under this section, we are keeping an eye on two things: one being the board and the other the scheme.  The scheme is going to get away after this section.  We can pursue the board through several more sections.  I should like to ask the Minister one fundamental question about this scheme.  I can see that he will not be inclined to tie the board down in any way in drawing up the scheme, but if he possibly can answer my question, I think it will help our debate.  Will it be fundamental in this scheme that there will be no medical test?  In other words, will this scheme guarantee both good lives and bad lives?  Could the Minister answer that question?  I should be grateful if he could because some queries I want to make on the subsequent section depend on that.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first matter I mentioned a few minutes ago, the taxation of reserves, I am quite satisfied to leave that matter as it is.  I accept that the position is as Senator Hayes has indicated and I am willing to wait and see what will happen in regard to it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the laying of the scheme before the Oireachtas, I am not satisfied, to be quite frank.  It is true that there will be publicity and very wide publicity for the scheme that will be worked out by the board.  The difference between that and what we have in mind is that the schemes, while they will be made public, will not come before us.  We will have no say in regard to them.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;Why should you do that?&rdquo;  One of the main reasons which influenced me in asking that the schemes be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas is that we are about to give to this body what amounts to monopoly of this type of insurance.  There are other monopolies.  There is a good deal of publicity for the arrangements and the schemes devised, for instance, by the E.S.B.  They can come along any time they like and raise their rates and we have no say in regard to these matters.  I think this matter of insurance is much closer to us than even the affairs of the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna.  It is for that reason we should keep a very close eye on the activities of this board.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied.  If the Minister says he is not willing to do it or that it cannot be done, that is all there is to it, but I still think&mdash;and my final words on this are&mdash;that it is possible to have these schemes, as they are developed by the board, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that they ought to be so laid.</P>

That is their job.  The Minister has acknowledged that there will be a certain amount of interchange and competition between various sections of the Health Act and this Act. In all reasonableness we are entitled, therefore&mdash;those of us here in this House who are responsible for this legislation&mdash;to have an opportunity to see the scheme, so that we, who are responsible not only to the buyers of voluntary health insurance but to the whole public, the whole electorate, should be able to see that everybody's position is covered in any scheme which is brought in by this board.</P>

      <P>At no stage is it suggested that that should be the position. I thought it was common to everyone who spoke on this matter that the board itself should draw up the schemes, that it was right and proper that they should draw up a minimum scheme in accordance with the specifications which the Minister for Health might make and that it was right and proper that they could amend any scheme that they had, provided they got ministerial consent for so doing.  I understand the suggestion was made then that any scheme, either the original one drawn up or an altered one, should be made available to members of the Oireachtas and, of course, the public in general.  In fact, that will be so.  There will be, and could be, no concealment regarding the scheme that would be offered.  Full information will be available.  If the board is not doing its duty, through the action or inaction of the Minister <Col N="21" /> for Health, he will be responsible to the people to whom he has to account, that is, the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is a great deal to be said for this kind of board or body which the Minister suggests.  Reference has been made to the E.S.B. and Board na Móna.  I think that in the kind of way in which they were set up&mdash;that is to say, as semi-independent bodies and yet controlled by the State&mdash;a rather valuable innovation was made.  I doubt very much if as good progress could have been made with our electrical development or turf development, if a way had not been found to entrust to a board of experts, free from daily governmental control, the business of developing the task assigned to them.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that what the Minister is trying to do under this Bill is in effect to set up an insurance body which will be able to operate to some extent on its own and make decisions from day to day, while at the same time the Bill provides that the Minister must approve of all the schemes.  A set up of that kind combines the advantages of a certain amount of independence with the control through the Oireachtas.  After all, the Minister is responsible to the Oireachtas.  In some of this debate that side of the matter seems to have been overlooked.  A scheme like this presents the double advantage of keeping control and of giving a certain measure of independence to experts.  If they do not produce results, the Oireachtas can step in again.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply to the question put to him by Senator Stanford, I must say I was surprised, and a little perturbed, by his ready assumption that of course there will be a medical examination and that bad risks will be fairly ruthlessly removed.  I should like to quote the relevant portion of the prospectus of the Western Provident Association of Bristol, which is one of the big British provident associations engaged in the same type of work.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No medical examination is required, <Col N="22" /> but a short medical history is asked for on the application form.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to finish the paragraph, because it appears necessary in certain instances, but only in exceptional circumstances would there be necessity for a medical examination.  They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Board of Governors reserve the right to call for medical evidence from the applicant's private doctor, or otherwise, at the applicant's expense, to reject applications for initial membership or for renewal, or to require special terms of acceptance or renewal;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and this is what seems important to me&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;but normally it is to be understood that once you are accepted into membership of the association you may remain a member for life.  These conditions are necessary in the general interest of members but refusal to renew would only be exercised for the most exceptional reasons.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to feel that the Minister could assure us that under this scheme any rejections would be only in the most exceptional circumstances, and not rejections of those generally regarded as a poor risk or not a very good risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is so.  I may have misunderstood the way in which Senator Stanford put it.  I understood Senator Stanford to pose the question: &ldquo;Is the insurance scheme to be available without regard to the state of the health of the individual?&rdquo; In other words, is it to cover a person in chronic bad health?  Of course it is not intended that that should be so, but the mode of approach would be very much along the lines which Senator Sheehy Skeffington has read out from the Western Provident Association scheme.  A person offering to avail himself of this insurance would presumably be asked to give particulars of his medical history.  If the board felt that further particulars <Col N="23" /> should be given, arising out of a medical examination or otherwise, they would reserve the right to get them. Generally, I imagine the approach would be very much along the lines of the common practice with this kind of insurance throughout Britain.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 10, to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides for the constitution of the board and I would ask the Seanad to bear in mind that what is being done here is laying down a maximum number for the composition of the board.  I feel that the Minister is tying himself a bit too tightly in this respect.  His approach, I think, and the approach of the board would be to get the widest possible membership of the insurance scheme, and I envisage there will be different group in the country whom the board would be anxious to bring in, such as the white collar workers, the farmers, and the self-employed people, and I think it would be desirable that all such groups should, as far as possible, have representation on the board.  I think this would be desirable because it would help to get the group into the insurance. I also think it might be necessary and advisable to have other people on the board.  It might be desirable to have a member of the medical profession; it might be desirable to have somebody connected with the voluntary hospitals&mdash;various people like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the commission which drew up the report had, I think, 20 members.  I am not suggesting a board to run an insurance scheme should have 20 members but I think that the Minister is, as I said, tying himself too tightly in laying down a maximum of four with the chairman.  I am suggesting that might be six and if the amendment is accepted it would not necessarily mean that the Minister would be obliged to appoint six.  Indeed, if the amendment were accepted he could probably <Col N="24" /> appoint whatever number he has already in mind to be members of this board, but I am suggesting it might be in the interests of the scheme itself that he should leave himself a certain amount of room.</P>
    <P>It might be that after appointing a board he might find it possible to get another group of the community to come into the insurance scheme and if there was place on the board that could be filled from among the group, that would be helpful in the particular situation.  That is why I put in this amendment and I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this and some of the following amendments, I may say my sole concern is to ensure that the board which is envisaged in the Bill should, at least as Senator Murphy rightly said, be representative. Frankly, I think that, for a scheme of this kind especially, it is very difficult to see how a board constituted as proposed under the Bill could be said to be in any sense representative.</P>
      <P>We ought to bear in mind, in considering this section also, the fact that has been stressed throughout the whole course of the last stage of the Bill here and in the other House, that the scheme is intended to be, and that in fact, it must be, self-supporting. The Minister and the Department quite clearly would be against any suggestion of a subvention or anything else to help the scheme along.  It has been stressed throughout the whole course of these debates that the scheme must, in fact, carry itself.  That being so, we ought to bear in mind the fact that the people who will have to carry it will be the people contributing to the scheme and it seems to me at any rate only fair and just to suggest that the interests of the people contributing to the scheme and making it a success, if it is to be a success, should at least be adequately represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I do not like the type of provision that appears to be made under this and some of the following sections.  I want to point out that it would appear that, right from the very beginning, nobody but the Minister has any right to say who is going to sit on <Col N="25" /> that board.  How can we justifiably support that principle if at the same time we are saying to those people for whom the scheme is intended: &ldquo;You will have to pay for it&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I said on the previous stage of the Bill here that I did not think the Minister had any right, in fact, to go that far and I believe that in confining representation on the board to the very small number laid down in this section he is going a step further.  I think the board will not be representative and cannot, and, in fact will not, be put in a position to do its job properly.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister for a moment that, under the old National Health Insurance Scheme, there was a board which did a remarkably fine job under very difficult conditions but above everything else that board could be said to be representative. I took the trouble of looking back to know how the committee of management of the old National Health Scheme was contrived and I found it was comprised of a chairman, three trustees and three members' representatives all of whom were nominated yearly by the Minister.  In addition, it carried three trade union representatives, again nominated yearly by the Trade Union Congress, and in addition to those, it carried five representatives of the insured persons elected annually from a panel of seven persons nominated triennially by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In all, the board worked out on that basis at something like 15.  I do not suggest that for the purpose of the new scheme such a large committee of management would be necessary.  In fact I think I might make my criticism a little more in the other direction, that there might be a cutting down for two reasons; first, there will not be anything like the same wide representation of interests required for this scheme as for the old national health scheme: secondly, because it is also vitally necessary to try to keep the expenses of administration to the minimum in the case of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>To me the Minister appears to be taking a tremendous amount of <Col N="26" /> authority to himself under this Bill.  I submit even at this stage he should reconsider precisely what is involved in the type of representation he has envisaged in this Bill.  I would make a very strong appeal to him even now to reconsider the representation he intends to put on that board and to give at least some type of reasonable representation to the people who are expected to support the scheme itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say I have no very strong views one way or the other with regard to this amendment, but the problem that poses itself to me is this: should the board be representative of the different sections likely to avail of, or be interested in, health insurance?  If it should be representative, then obviously there are a number of matters to be considered. Instead of being representative, the board might consist of four or five people who are regarded, on their merits, as best able to carry out this form of insurance.  Those are the two methods of approach.  The board, as proposed in the Bill as it stands, is not intended to be representative, as such, and for that reason the membership is suggested as a total of five.</P>
      <P>If Senators think it is wiser to try to have a board more representative of the interests likely to be affected, then it seems clear to me that the membership would have to be increased, certainly by one or two.  However, I am very concerned to ensure that the overheads&mdash;the costs of running this scheme&mdash;should be as low as possible.  That consideration must be balanced, in considering this matter. If there is any general feeling in this House that there should be another examination of this matter, I will certainly do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I have no very definite view one way or the other in regard to this matter.  I am anxious that health insurance will be a success.  If it will make success easier to have a representative board, I will certainly make it representative.  If, on the other hand, it is more likely to be successful by the appointment of five people whom I regard as being more likely to make the scheme a success, then I will <Col N="27" /> do it in that way.  However, I will certainly consider the matter very carefully if there is any general view in the House that it should be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>Personally, I feel that this whole Voluntary Health Insurance Bill would have a much better chance of success with a small board.  They are catering for a certain limited section of the community.  I feel they would be much better fitted to make a success of it if they were people with a specialised knowledge in one aspect or another of the subject they are going to deal with, if the board is not representative.  I do not think the insurance can successfully cover a large section of the community and I do not think large community representation is necessary for its administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of any experience I have had of boards or boards of directors, I think a comparatively small board of more or less expert people is a very much more valuable and efficient working instrument than a rather large unwieldy board.  I remember that the late Tom Kettle always said that in Ireland any gathering of more than three persons should be deemed to be a public meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made some very good points.  In the first place, he said the board should be composed of those who are best able to carry out this insurance scheme.  The amendment stands or falls on how one judges that qualification.  Senator Cox's approach to it is, I think, that the people best able to carry out the scheme should be a small body of experts.  I take the contrary view completely. I think the best qualifications these people could have would be the ability, by their position, to contact groups of the community and sell insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think they will need to be experts in insurance to be members of this board.  I think, in fact, that that would be somewhat of a liability. I do not see how a small body of three <Col N="28" /> or four experts, remote maybe from the groups of the community which should be members of this scheme, could possibly be the best people to run this insurance scheme.  I do not want to press my viewpoint too strongly on the Seanad, but I should like to hear some other Senators make their views known on this matter.</P>
    <P>My approach is that it would be better for the scheme that there should be people from various groups there, because, by being members of the Board of Management, they could have some effect in bringing in groups and in selling the insurance to the individuals in the groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a second point, concerning the overheads.  Here, again, I am in through agreement with him. I should hate to press on the Minister a larger board if, by doing that, we were to add to the cost of the premiums which would have to be paid.</P>
    <P>The other amendments have not yet been moved but Senators will notice that there is a provision to eliminate remuneration for the members of the board.  That is all I should like to say on the amendment.  However, I would ask the Minister to give further consideration between now and the Report Stage to my viewpoint and also to the views expressed by other Senators.  I hope he will agree with me that it would be safer for him to lift his maximum&mdash;not to tie himself too tightly. He may appoint six members at any time, but I think it would be safer not to tie himself down to a maximum of four.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Murphy's amendment would not make much difference one way or the other. I agree entirely that this board should be a representative board.  I think this board should be a business board &mdash;a body that would draw up a scheme which it would then be the duty of the board to see to it that it would be presented to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> Senator Crowley referred to the old National Health Committee and said it was a representative committee.  I was a member of that committee for a short time, but I did not represent anybody on it.  The people whom I would be entitled to represent had nothing to do with national health insurance at all.  That was a representative board.  The people who were represented had to pay, both the employers and the insured people&mdash;the people who paid and who were bound to pay.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Crowley said something about the people whom we are talking about now having to pay. Nobody has got to pay under this scheme.  I do think it would not be right to make the board completely representative because you will have to increase the board very considerably in order to give representation to all the different sections demanding it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>When referring to the representative capacity of the old National Health Board I thought I made it clear I was not suggesting that anything like that should be set up for the administration of this scheme. Whether I succeeded in conveying that to the House or not I do not know.</P>
      <P>One or two aspects of this matter should be stressed.  The first is that the people we expect to support this scheme should be entitled to and should be given some say in its management.  I cannot see how they will have that if the power of appointment to this board is to be vested completely in the Minister.  The principle is wrong and bad.  I agree entirely with those Senators who say that the best type of board would be a small board consisting of people who would know something about the subject of voluntary health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say if the amendment moved by Senator Murphy and myself is accepted I do not think it will depart from that principle in any way.  There will still be a very small board.  My only misgiving is that we are leaving the board too small. The amendment merely asks for an extension of the number of persons <Col N="31" /> from five to seven and not any more than that.</P>

      <P>If Senators think it worth while, I shall have the matter considered.  I would have sympathy with the idea that, if it were possible to segregate consumer interests, they should be represented; but it is not a good analogy because members of the board will, of course, be subscribers. It would be very odd if they were not.  I am sure they will represent the interests of consumers, too.  I shall have the matter considered and see if anything further can be done about it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 17, before &ldquo;to&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of whom at least one shall be a woman&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It seemed to me, in setting up such a board as this to arrange a scheme for a large section of the public, that it was not too much to ask that one of these five people should be a woman.  I do not think it would be a good thing to say that there should be an exact or large proportion of the places reserved for either sex, but I think it would be a mistake to allow a board of five men to be set up.  There is a tendency in this country to remember women only in the appointment of boards which are fully voluntary.  They get plenty of voluntary work to do, on committees of all kinds, not merely minor ones but some major ones, too, but when it comes to paid positions somehow the women members of the community are forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> I notice in the Advisory Body itself the Minister appointed one woman out of 20.  That seems to me to be too small a proportion and it was lest the Minister might overlook altogether the claims of women to some representation upon this board that I thought it worth while putting down this amendment.  I think it is true that women might have a special attitude towards such a voluntary health scheme.  Apart entirely from the question, which presumably will be debated by the new board, as to whether there shall be a maternity benefit or not, women would have perhaps a more special view of the benefits to be allowed for dependents in general, whether they be children, the wife and so on.  Therefore, it seems to me not unreasonable to ask that at least one of these five members shall be a woman.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator Sheehy Skeffington in asking that at least one woman be appointed to the board.  I think a board of this kind would be singularly incomplete if it did not include a woman member.

      <P>May I express the hope that anything I say on this matter may not be interpreted as being in any sense anti-feminist?  It is not intended to be so.  I would, however, draw Senators' attention to certain aspects of this matter.  I cannot see, in relation to health insurance, that there is either a masculine approach or a feminine approach.  There is a human approach.  The concern is to provide under insurance a cover in relation to ill-health of a varying kind which affects all of us.  It appears to me to be a little bit odd to provide that in a board of that kind at least one shall be a woman.  One might as well say that at least one shall be a man; it is equally logical.  If it were provided in that section that one member of this board should be a woman, then the <Col N="33" /> Minister for Health is asked to consider should that woman be single or married.</P>
      <P>A single woman might have an interest in certain aspects of the health services.  She might not have any familiarity with other matters arising in relation to health services.  If a single woman were appointed, it might be suggested that the appointment of such a single woman was wrong and that what was really needed was the appointment of a mother of a family. We all know that the mother of a family has, in common with her husband, a wide knowledge of the ordinary vicissitudes that affect a family.  I do not think, as such, she would add any particular knowledge to the deliberations of the board. Indeed, one is driven to the conclusion that if one has to appoint a woman, as such, one can only expect that woman to contribute her own views, her own experience and her own interests as an individual to the deliberations of the board as a whole. She cannot bring to it any particular feminine or feminist approach because I do not believe such an approach exists in relation to health services.</P>
      <P>The need is, after all, a common one. Illness affects all of us, irrespective of sex.  It is the concern of all of us to see that health services are improved, both for men and for women.  For the life of me, I cannot see what particular approach a woman could bring to the deliberations of the board.  I think the section should be left as it is and, in considering membership of the board, if there is a woman in relation to whom it is felt that she can contribute to the operation of the scheme, then by all means let her be appointed. But she must be appointed because she can contribute as an individual and not because she is a woman and not because she is either married or single.  Indeed, I do not believe that is a worthwhile avenue to travel on. While I consider this amendment is not a good amendment and I must, therefore, be against it, I am against it not because I am in any way anti-feminist &mdash;I am not&mdash;but because I think it is inappropriate to consider such a matter in relation to a board of this kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister advises us to look at this from a human point of view rather than from a merely male or female point of view.  While I admit the logic of his remarks up to a certain point, it must be remembered that there is a whole range of illness peculiar to women and a whole range of problems connected with motherhood, for example, which are mainly of interest to women.  For that reason, he might perhaps depart a little from his rather too rigid logic in this respect and accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made an intelligent case, but he has not made an unanswerable case.  I am always a little suspicious when I hear someone beginning with such a phrase as &ldquo;I am not anti-feminist but&rdquo;, and the Minister has told us that he does not believe that there could possibly be a masculine or a feminine point of view in a matter like health or health insurance.  The Minister says we are all human beings and that one might just as well have an amendment saying that &ldquo;at least one shall be a man&rdquo;.  My contention is that in Ireland to-day there is no need for such a phrase as &ldquo;at least one shall be a man&rdquo; because this is an essentially masculine society in which the man is never forgotten but, when it comes to paid appointments, there is a very serious danger indeed that woman, however expert, will be quite forgotten.  I shall observe with interest the names of the four or five people who will be appointed by the Minister to see whether or not in practice woman, however expert, has been forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was for the purpose of reminding the Minister, shall we say, that there <Col N="35" /> is this other half of our society that I put down this amendment.  It is not an unreasonable amendment.  It does not preclude the Minister from appointing a single woman, a married woman and a widow.  There is no reason why all five should not be women, under my amendment, if the Minister considers them to be of sufficient merit.  The purpose of the amendment is to prevent him forgetting women altogether, and I suggest that that is precisely what he will do unless we pass this amendment now, for all his public declaration that there is nothing anti-feminist in his views. He has said&mdash;and this is of course a principle to which we would all subscribe&mdash;that these members will be appointed because of the contribution they can bring and not because they are either men or women.  I suggest that the women, many of them, could bring a very important contribution to the deliberations of the board.  I suggest they will nevertheless, in fact, be forgotten simply because they are women.  It is for that reason that I should like to see this amendment passed.</P>
    <P>I note incidentally that the one reservation in the report is on maternity services.  It is a reservation made by two men!  I should like to feel that when that particular aspect is being discussed by the new board in relation to the new scheme, there would be at least one woman present on the board. I must press this amendment for that reason.</P>

The criterion for election to the board should be who is the most competent.  I do not mind whether the board is constituted of men or women or men and women.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (5), line 32, to delete &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;fees for attendances&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on the Second Reading of this Bill I criticised to some degree the fact that here we were setting up a board to conduct voluntary health insurance, that we were providing remuneration for the members of that board, the fixing of allowances for them, and that we were in fact providing no finances whatever to meet those costs.  I suggested that the scheme, if it were to be successful, should have as low premiums as possible.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is directed towards that end&mdash;to reduce to some degree the administrative cost of the scheme.  I suggested it would be quite possible to get a board to run a voluntary health insurance scheme, the members of which would be prepared to do the work without remuneration. I suggest that, instead of remuneration, there should be fees for attendances at meetings of the board, those fees to be set out by the Minister, together with any other allowances for expenses that might be incurred.  I am not suggesting that the board should be one whose members would do this work and be out of pocket at the same time.  I am suggesting that you could get a board who would do this work competently and who would not require a fixed salary in order to do that work.  For that reason I put down this amendment which, I hope, will be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to oppose the amendment in so far as it seeks to substitute the word &ldquo;fee&rdquo; for &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;. It seems to me that in any body of this kind members really do their work not perhaps at meetings but over a period of time.  I believe the idea that people who are being paid just because they attended meetings is wholly wrong.  In all boards of this kind a great deal of the work may have to be done outside meetings, and I think it is quite a silly thing to suggest that because a person went to meetings, and possibly took no part in the discussion or did no real work, he should be paid a fee for attendance. I quite agree there is a lot to be said for people acting without remuneration, but, if there is to be remuneration, it should be in respect of the work done and not in respect of attendance at meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I understand that we are taking amendments Nos. 4 and 5 together, I suppose I am in order in discussing my amendment, No. 5, at this stage.  My amendment goes a little further than Senator Murphy's because I am asking that the members of the new board, though they be paid expenses, shall not be paid remuneration.  I have a consequential amendment, No. 8, which could also be discussed here. I shall speak on all these amendments now.  First of all, I feel very strongly&mdash; and I think Senator Cox has indicated his sympathy with that view&mdash;that the board should be a voluntary board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we have a large number of public-spirited people with expert knowledge who are anxious to see such a scheme as this work and <Col N="39" /> work in the best possible way.  I believe they would be quite proud, and consider themselves privileged, to work on the board in a voluntary capacity. It would be unjust, of course, to expect them to be out of pocket; therefore it is, I think, legitimate to suggest that their expenses be covered to a moderate extent.  To suggest that they should be remunerated is, I feel, wrong and against the whole spirit of the scheme.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, the Minister spoke a lot about self-reliance and the necessity for the scheme running itself.  He is very anxious that the scheme will succeed.  By imposing this comparatively small burden, but none the less burden, he is militating against the hopes of the scheme succeeding, and I feel that he is rather changing the character of what could be a striking example of voluntary effort.  After all, we have in this country a long record of voluntary service in relation to health matters.  Our voluntary hospitals yield pride of place to the hospitals of no other country.  The medical staffs in all cases and the voluntary boards for long years have been acting in a purely voluntary capacity.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister would, at least in principle, agree with me that it is one of the good things in our society, that we can get such committees to give long hours of service to the public good for no fee or reward whatever.  I am disappointed therefore at the fact that he contemplates in the Bill having remunerative posts on this board.  The work and record of the voluntary hospital boards, including, I may say, a large number of women, are such that one can affirm the work of this board would be extremely efficient though unpaid.  I am tempted to suggest that perhaps the object of my previous amendment might indeed be brought about if this amendment were accepted, because, if the posts were to become voluntary, perhaps the masculine prerogative of sitting on the board would not be so exclusively exercised; we might find a larger proportion of women on the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> In relation to amendment No. 4, its object is that fees for attendances would be paid.  I personally would prefer my amendment; I feel it goes further, though I should say that I prefer Senator Murphy's amendment to the Bill as it stands at present.  I am a little doubtful, though, whether it would be wise to accept this principle of fees for attendances.  If we in the Seanad were to be paid, say, 20 guineas a sitting I do not know what kind of effect it would have.  Perhaps it would save the State a lot of money, though it might well result on the other hand in an unusually crowded House.  I may say that the two Senators associated with amendment No. 4 have very good attendance records.  I cannot think of a meeting at which Senator Murphy has not been present.  Senator Crowley is also a strong attender. But look around the Seanad and see at the present moment about 22 Senators.  Admittedly, just now we had 45 Senators present for a division, but they vanished away after the hurly-burly of the vote, and so we have the usual 20 Senators present out of 59.  In the public eye, perhaps, we might look a little odd if we were to insist upon the principle of &ldquo;fees for attendance&rdquo; on certain committees when perhaps we would not like to accept it for ourselves.  Related to that is the point made by Senator Cox that much of the hard work of any committee or deliberative assembly such as this House is done outside of the committee or Parliament itself. Consequently we might be applying a principle here which we would not like to see, as it were, senatorially applied. Therefore, I would press rather my own amendment, that the principle of remuneration be removed altogether from this Bill.  That is the purpose of the fifth and eighth amendments here. If that is rejected, however, I should feel nevertheless that &ldquo;fees for attendance&rdquo; would be better than just &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister a question which I had asked him on the Second Stage, but to which he did not find time to give an answer, that is, what order of magnitude has he in <Col N="41" /> mind for the remuneration of the members of the board?  Will they be considered as full-time or part-time?  It is quite obvious their work will be considerable in the opening months, and that after that it will be, relatively speaking, routine work.  Would the Minister tell us what order of magnitude he has in mind, when he speaks in the Bill of remuneration as well as the payment of expenses to members of the board?</P>

      <P>I do not think the first amendment would be entirely acceptable for the reason that has already been given by Senator Cox.  In many of these cases, as we know from experience, a lot of good work could be done by a member of a board who would not be present at all the meetings, and it could also happen that a member of a board of the kind envisaged here could be present at all the meetings and do nothing more.  That is why I am not entirely in favour of amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>The substitution of the words &ldquo;fees for attendance&rdquo; for &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; might give rise to other consequences, say, as regards income-tax.  I do not know how fees for attendance would be calculated for income-tax purposes. They might be regarded as travelling expenses in the end.  In any case, I for one would not be in favour of the substitution of the words &ldquo;fees for attendance&rdquo; for &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; for the reasons that have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 5, standing in the name of Senator Sheehy Skeffington, that is a different proposition altogether, and I must say it is an amendment that is deserving of consideration. If it is a fact that there are public-spirited people in this country who can be got to do this work, the work of the board, without fee or reward, I do not see why they should not be got.  I believe there are such people here.  The mover of the amendment has referred to hospital boards, and there are many boards and committees operating in the country without any remuneration.  All over the country, for instance, you have vocational education committees, and so on, doing very important work, <Col N="42" /> attending frequent meetings, without a single penny of remuneration.</P>

      <P>That is a different principle.  We shall come to that later on.  What we are dealing with here is the question of remuneration.  I would suggest to the Minister that this is an experimental measure.  There has never before been a voluntary health insurance service in this country and we are bound to look at every side of the picture.  If public-spirited individuals, men or women, or men and women together, can be got to be members of this board and carry out the policy the Minister has in mind, I do not see why we should not try it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Senator Cox, Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator Kissane when they say we ought to consider the question of having this done on a voluntary basis.  It is possible that the Minister envisages an executive board which will have a considerable amount of work to do, but it would be a pity if we were to lose sight of the voluntary principle.  There was reference made to the Seanad. Sometimes I think the Seanad might be even more effective if it were run as a voluntary system but that is another matter.  Voluntary service is by no means a thing of the past in Ireland and if it could be extended in connection with this Bill it would be a very desirable provision.  On the other hand, I suppose if you do ask a man to come say, from Cork or Kerry, and he spends several days of the week away from his profession, business or occupation, and you tender him no remuneration, not alone is he giving voluntary service but he is at a loss.</P>

      <P>The only people then who would get the opportunity of doing voluntary service without incurring too much loss to themselves would be people who reside in Dublin.  That is the rather peculiar slant that it takes. <Col N="43" /> I can envisage a man who might reside in Kerry spending a day travelling to Dublin and another day travelling back and spending two or three days here, so that the best part of the week would be gone.  However, if the Minister would consider bringing the principle of voluntary service into this Bill, I think it would be a great advance and I agree with the Senators who spoke about it.</P>

      <P>Does a great deal not depend on just what this board is going to do?  If the insurance company or insurance society is going to have a managing director who can really run the whole thing himself with an adequate staff and if this board is to be an advisory and consultative board, I think it would be very wrong to pay them any considerable salary.  However, if the members of this board are to be the equivalent of a really good managing director then they deserve a good salary and I do not think we will get good service at the managerial level unless we pay good salaries. Perhaps the Minister would give his opinion on that.  Does he want four really hard-working managing directors or a consultative board?  If he gave us his opinion, then perhaps we would be clear about how we should view this amendment.</P>

      <P>I presume the job of the chairman, who will be a member of the board, will be nearly whole-time, and if you are to say that the board is not to receive remuneration, then the chairman cannot receive remuneration, either.  I imagine the board will consist of experts in insurance and it seems rather unfair to ask those to give their time without paying them. I know that one can get people to act in an unpaid capacity on hospital boards and I myself have been a member of a hospital board for some years, but that is a totally different thing.  I think it would be a mistake if the board were not remunerated.</P>

      <P>I am supporting the amendment and I am rather surprised at some of the statements to the effect that we could not get people to serve on this board.  Senator Murphy referred <Col N="44" /> to fees and allowances.  A man might lose a day's wages and I think he should be recouped that loss in wages and his rail fare.  You are killing the spirit of voluntary insurance if you start off by paying the board a yearly salary.  I have in mind the service that was given by the board which dealt with national health.  There are several other boards and I am not entirely in agreement with Senator Kissane that one could not get the type of people in insurance companies to come&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Then, I am afraid we are going to build up an insurance system very far removed from a voluntary system.  I know it is experimental and I am not very optimistic about this voluntary system of insurance, but I am prepared to give it support.  I do think, however, that we should not pay a salary to those on the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different proposals suggested in the two amendments.  Perhaps I should say, first of all, in order to make things clear to the Senators, that my idea with regard to the board is that it should consist of a chairman and four members, who are ordinary members at the moment.  The board, having been constituted, will appoint a general manager who will be the executive officer of the board and who will require to be a very skilled and experienced person, possibly having considerable managerial experience elsewhere.  The chairman and the members of the board will ordinarily be part-time members, but a case might be made in the initial stages that the chairman might be full-time for a period.  That is a matter that would depend on what initial work would have to be done.  In normal circumstances, all members would be part-time members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested by Senator Murphy that such members be paid fees for attendances and I assume the Senator <Col N="45" /> has in mind attendances at meetings of the board.  Obvious difficulties arise straightaway.  One has to ask oneself the question: &ldquo;What constitutes a meeting of the board?&rdquo;  For instance, as might arise, is a visit to the Department of Health to discuss matters of concern to the board, to be regarded as a meeting of the board?  If a member of the board is asked, as members may be asked, to conduct a particular inquiry in the interests of the board's functions, could that be regarded as a meeting?  If not, is such a member prepared to do that work without any remuneration at all?  It will be appreciated that to remunerate members merely because they attended a meeting is to remunerate them without due regard to the contribution they are supposed to give to the success of the scheme.  A member may attend a meeting, he may &ldquo;clock in&rdquo; and sit there like a bump on a rock without opening his mouth or saying a thing and he will draw his fees because he is given the <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <P>I take it there will be more regard to the selection of members than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just giving an example.  Members of the board will have to study very carefully the problem of health insurance and the manner in which it can be operated and they will have to do a considerable amount of work, apart altogether from meetings.  Meetings generally may represent the result rather than the occassion for the result, of the efforts of the members of the board and I feel that to consider remunerating them merely for their attendance at meetings is not a realistic approach.  In that regard, I would endorse what Senator Cox has said.  In my opinion, members should be paid, as remuneration, some fixed sum.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington feels that it should not exceed £50 per annum in respect of each member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Senators have <Col N="46" /> mentioned this already, and I think we must bear in mind that it would be a grand thing if everything was perfect in our society, if members of boards such as this gave their services out of a sense of duty to the people, but, in fact, many people are not free or able to do so.  A great number of people find it hard enough to discharge their ordinary duties and to make ends meet, without taking on additional responsibilities which, in time, would involve them in considerable personal expense. If this board were to be a board on which no payment was made, or merely a token payment made in relation to expenses, I feel that inevitably the selection of members would be confined to those who could afford to go on it.  It is that precise consideration which in other days led to the remuneration in the way of expenses of members of the Oireachtas.  I do not think it is desirable, however fine the motives, that we should, in effect, provide that membership of boards such as this should be open only to those who can afford such responsibility.</P>
      <P>I would remind Senator Sheehy Skeffington that if two or three members of the board living in one of our provinces&mdash;I might say straight away that I believe meetings of the board must be held normally in Dublin&mdash;had to come from the west, the south or the north, they might find themselves involved in an expenditure of something like £5 or £6 per attendance at meetings of the board.  It will be appreciated that at the initiation of the scheme very frequent meetings will be necessary in order to get the scheme going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senators will appreciate that in proposing to the Oireachtas this legislation, I am doing so in the hope and conviction that it will be a success. I will not do or encourage the doing of anything which would militate against the success of the scheme.  For that reason, in relation to remuneration, I will be as concerned as any member of this House to ensure that whatever remuneration is paid will in no sense affect the success of the scheme.  At the same time, I want to feel there will be available to the board the services of people who could <Col N="47" /> contribute to the success of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I feel that either of the suggestions made here would confine, in practice, the membership of the board and that would not be desirable.  I think the Bill should be left as it is, on the understanding which, I think, can be fairly accepted that neither I nor any other Minister for Health will fix remuneration at such a point that the effect would be to interfere with or injure the scheme itself.  At the same time, I think the remuneration should be such as to make it possible for any person whose services I feel are needed to give those services and thereby contribute towards the success of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not like to interrupt the Minister a second time.  I feel, however, that what the Minister said about the expenses of members coming to a meeting was related to amentment No. 6 which has not yet been looked at, my own amendment about restricting expenses to £50 a year, rather than to amendments Nos. 4 and 5, because my amendment, No. 5, asks for the deletion of &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;, but it does not ask for any limit on the expenses.  When the Minister speaks of a member of a board incurring expenses to the sum of £5 or £6 in order to attend an individual meeting, I feel that is not relevant to our suggestion that there should be no remuneration or that remuneration should be for attendance at meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood.  I think amendment No. 6 is of a separate type, if you like.  Therefore, if the Minister were to persuade me that, at the beginning, the amount of expenses <Col N="48" /> necessary for a member might be more than £50 in a year, I would be inclined to drop amendment No. 6, but I do not think that has anything to do with my contention that they should get expenses and not remuneration.  I do not think that point has been met by talking about expenses.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to meet it by suggesting that some people might be kept out of such service to the community because they could not afford to do it.  I am not convinced by that argument because, as several Senators said, various committees, councils and boards throughout the country have got precisely that kind of voluntary service from admirable people.  You have the corporations, county councils and vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all elected bodies, but the service is voluntary. It is very considerable and, although travelling expenses are allowed in certain cases, they are not allowed in all.  They are, in fact, minimal.  There is quite a bit of out-of-pocket expense.</P>
      <P>I was a little perturbed by the fact that the Minister omitted once more to take us into his confidence as to what order of magnitude of remuneration he has in mind, because, if it is to be a nominal sum, I should not feel so strongly about it.  If this is going to be &ldquo;a fat job,&rdquo; then I feel very strongly that we should insist on the voluntary principle being observed. The Minister has not really taken us into his confidence at all.  He said he is not going to pay too little, but he did not even give us an idea of the order of magnitude involved, though he has said that he regards these people as working part-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that there will be a big difference between the early months, in which they will have to work very hard, and the subsequent months and years, during which the scheme will more or less run itself, if it runs at all. I have my own doubts about that, but it is obvious that the amount of work required of these members will be considerably more in the opening months than ever again in relation to this <Col N="49" /> scheme, once it is established.  I should feel most uneasy at a rate of remuneration being calculated on the kind of work demanded of those men and women in the first few months of the existence of the board.  I should be inclined, therefore, to press amendment No. 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that at least the Minister would have converted Senator Sheehy Skeffington towards my amendment, because he made the point that if the member of the board was paid only expenses, only those who could afford to take the responsibility would be members.  The idea behind my attempt to provide for fees for attendance is simply that one may have on this board salaried workers.  They may be people who, because of attending meetings, would lose a day's pay.  Surely it would be quite wrong that such people should be asked to take the responsibility and lose their salary for the days they would attend the meetings.  They could not afford to take responsibility on that basis.</P>
      <P>That is why I said that, as well as the expenses involved in travelling from one end of the country to the other, they should be paid fees for attendances.  The Minister was rather critical of that.  He said there would be difficulty in defining what exactly attendances were.  I cannot claim to be an expert on that matter, but I am strengthened by the fact that, as Senator Hickey reminded us, the old National Health Management Board were paid some fees for attendances. Some of those were ordinary workers who came to a meeting and lost a day's pay.  There were some fees for attendance. There should not be any great difficulty in deciding what exactly a meeting is and in what circumstances fees should be paid.  That is why I had hoped that Senator Sheehy Skeffington would come behind me and say that it is quite fair that people who take the responsibility of membership of this board should be paid a fee for attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to enter into a discussion on the big principle as to whether or not people appointed to boards and bodies should be paid <Col N="50" /> remuneration.  What I am concerned with here is that this is to be a voluntary health insurance body and that there is an attempt to lay down in legislation that they should be paid remuneration but at the same time we are not providing that remuneration, as it will have to be paid for by the contributors in premiums.  That is why I say we should see how we can make the premiums as low as possible, without doing an injustice to the people we are asking to come on the board to manage the concern.  Therefore, I hope that even if the Minister will not agree with me, at least Senator Sheehy Skeffington will agree that my amendment is the better one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three types of payment referred to in this debate&mdash; remuneration, fees and expenses.  In objecting to remuneration, Senator Sheehy Skeffington thought out a rather novel method&mdash;to pay them expenses but make the expenses so substantial as to be equivalent to remuneration.  In my experience, expenses are something which are pretty well known definitely.  A person gets first-class travelling expenses or a motor-car allowance and a subsistence allowance per day.  If one were to suggest that the travelling expenses should be increased above the normal and that a man be paid £10 or £20 subsistence allowance for the day, surely that would be a ridiculous suggestion. If they are to be expenses, they will be just the ordinary expenses which a higher civil servant would get if travelling on the same kind of business. Therefore, that would not be a remedy for this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many public-spirited people in the country who are prepared to do public work, I agree, but the kind of work they do is philanthropic or social work.  This is not a philanthropic association and, although it is making arrangements for a voluntary scheme, one must remember that the &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; part refers to the people who will be paying and joining in the insurance scheme, but it is not a voluntary board.  I do not think we will get the type of people the Minister has in mind he should appoint to this board, purely because they are public-spirited <Col N="51" /> people who are ready to do this work.</P>
    <P>I want to stress this especially.  It was mentioned, I think by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, that, as this is an experimental business, we should try it out on a voluntary principle. Because it is experimental, that is the very reason we cannot afford to take any risks.  If it is tried on the voluntary principle suggested here by him and if it is a failure&mdash;as it might well be a failure just because of that&mdash;then we may bid good-bye to the possibility of ever having a voluntary scheme again.  Therefore, what is in the Bill is preferable to the other schemes mentioned and I would be prepared to support it.</P>

      <P>Surely Senator Kissane's own administrative experience has taught him that the Minister for Finance is interested in all kinds of payments and is particularly interested that no precedents be made which could be used against him for <Col N="53" /> the remuneration of Government servants. Even though that money does not come out of the public Treasury, there is no doubt in my mind&mdash;we regard it as a rather melancholy fact, but it is a fact anyhow&mdash;that the Minister for Finance will keep this figure to the lowest possible amount, consistent with getting the kind of service which he wants, and which, as Senator O'Connell points out, is not service in a philanthropic way, but service of a specialist character.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what Senator Hayes says, I wonder &mdash;although we have not succeeded in getting an opinion from the Minister&mdash; could we get some opinion from Senator Hayes on whether this &ldquo;lowest possible amount&rdquo; is to be £200 or £1,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to reform the law as to the limitation of actions and arbitrations.  Not alone does it propose to reform that law but it will also clarify and consolidate it.  In order to facilitate a study of the Bill, which is in many ways a technical one, explanatory sidenotes have been added. These notes indicate the existing statutory provisions and rules of law being consolidated, amended, repealed or overruled.  On page 4 of the Bill Senators will find a legend showing the short method by which each statute is referred to in the sidenotes. We hope the notes will be of assistance and we propose to use notes of this type in all our law reform Bills. They will not, of course, appear in the Bills as enacted into law.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House deals, in the main, with the general Acts governing the limitation of the principal classes of legal action.  The most important of these Acts are the Irish Common Law Procedure Act of 1853 and the Real Property Limitation Acts of 1833 to 1874.  The 1853 Act is concerned with ordinary actions of contract and tort and the Real Property Acts deal with actions relating to land and money charged on land.  It is important to note that, whereas the 1853 Act bars the remedy but leaves the right intact, the Acts of 1833 to 1874 bar the remedy and the right.  The principle enshrined in the Bill is that, where there is a charge on land or personal property, once the remedy is gone the right is extinguished.  This is in line with Government policy to simplify the title to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with special types of statutory action such as actions under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1956, the Industrial and Commercial Property Act, 1927, which deals with copyright actions, the Moneylenders Act, 1933, and the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1934.  It is a Bill to deal with the general statutes of <Col N="57" /> limitation and not with particular statutes of limitation.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill covers the periods of limitation for different classes of actions.  In Section II will be found the proposals for contract and tort actions.  The period will be six years for all such actions, except that for personal injuries actions and slander actions the period will be three years. We think that three years is long enough for actions arising out of, say, motor car accidents.  In the case of slander, there seems no real reason why the action should not be brought within three years.</P>
    <P>Actions to recover land and actions in respect of mortgages and charges on land or chattels are dealt with in Sections 13 to 42.  The period will, as at present, be 12 years to recover the land (including a rentcharge) or a principal sum charged on land.  The period for arrears of a rentcharge or interest on a principal sum will continue to be six years.</P>
    <P>The Bill distinguishes between express and constructive trustees.  By reason of Section 44 an express trustee will not be able to plead the statute where he has been guilty of fraud or where he retains the trust property. A personal representative will, however, be able to plead the statute except where he is guilty of fraud.  A personal representative, in the case of registered land, has been held to be an express trustee by reason of a decision of the High Court.  The Bill proposes to overrule the decision.  Our proposals will help people to establish title to land, and will also, we hope, encourage the taking out of probate and administration.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with disability, acknowledgment, part-payment, fraud and mistake.  In general, the law on these aspects of limitation is being simplified and a number of anomalies are being removed.  The disability of absence beyond the seas is being abolished.  Acknowledgment or part-payment need not imply a fresh promise to pay in any type of case.  The differences between the rules of common law and the rules of equity in regard to fraud and mistake are resolved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> Part IV of the Bill applies the provisions of the Bill to arbitrations and is simply a re-enactment of the relevant provisions in the Arbitration Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>The Bill will apply to the State and State authorities, but it will not apply to the recovery of taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  At present the State is not bound by the ordinary statutes of limitation because of the old doctrine that time does not run against the King.  We think it is high time that we abolished this doctrine. This is in accordance with our policy to remove from our law the special privileges of the State in legal actions.</P>
    <P>In ordinary contract and tort actions against the State, the limitation period will be the same as in actions between private citizens.  In actions to recover land the proposal in the Bill is that, whereas the period for an ordinary person will be 12 years, the period for a State authority will be 30 years.  The period for the recovery of foreshore will be 60 years.  At present where Crown land is concerned the period is 60 years.  No period of limitation applies to the Land Commission under existing law.</P>
    <P>We think that this Bill represents a badly needed piece of legal reform. The existing law is in many respects uncertain and difficult, and we considered that a very useful purpose would be served if it were amended, clarified and brought up-to-date.  On Committee Stage, I hope to be able to assist the House in dealing in detail with the various sections of the Bill. Also, the officers of my Department will always be readily available to discuss with any Senator any points arising out of proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is generally admitted that there must be a law of limitation.  There ought to be a definite restriction on ordinary litigation after a certain time. Where property is concerned, it is most desirable that title to it may be established after clear possession for a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>We trust we have succeeded in what we set out to do and that the Bill, when law, will be a great benefit not alone to lawyers but also to laymen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Having said so much in the mother tongue, I suppose I will have to say a few words in English but I will not detain the House very long with the few observations that I have to make because I realise this is a measure that would not usefully lend itself to a lengthy discussion on Second Reading. It is highly involved and highly technical. It is a measure in which there are many references to existing Acts.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in order to examine the Bill properly and see its provisions in their proper perspective it would be necessary for us to have recourse to all Acts of the past governing limitations &mdash;to legal actions and to statutes of limitation.  This is entirely, I would say, a non-Party Bill and therefore, I think, non-controversial.  That being so, it can be dealt with entirely on its merits.  It is essentially a consolidation Bill, a Bill which will, I think, go a long way towards codifying the existing Statutes of Limitation.</P>
    <P>If and when that end is achieved, that consolidation is arrived at, it will bring relief to many, to legal practitioners especially and, of course, to future litigants, because I think it is true to say there are few branches of the law of this country or of any country that are more difficult to follow, more difficult to understand than is the law dealing with this question of the limitation of actions.</P>
    <P>The most important of the Statutes of Limitation is the Common Law Procedure (Amendment) Act of 1853.  I think the Minister referred to that here; if he did not refer to it here he certainly did in the other House.  That Common Law Statute of Limitations dealt with such actions as actions in tort, in contract and other similar actions.  After that, we have the Real Property Limitation Acts from 1833 to 1874 which deal with actions in respect of land, ownership of and interest in land.  It also deals with profits and rents derived from land.  I submit that indeed in itself is a very complicated branch of law.</P>
    <P>This ownership and claims to ownership of land and the various interests in land have, in the past, given rise to a good deal of litigation.  That is why I say that the Real Property <Col N="61" /> Limitation Acts comprise a most complicated branch of the law as we know it.  I think the underlying idea of this measure is to bring the various Statutes of Limitation into a more regular system&mdash;in other words to consolidate these Acts.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill does more than that since it proposes to amend these Acts.  As well as amending them I think I am prepared to admit it proposes to do so in a desirable way.  Of course I would say it is right and proper that these Statutes of Limitation should more or less be brought up to date so to speak, that they should be brought into conformity with the requirements of modern society.  The social order and the conditions of living have changed a great deal over the years, especially since the Common Law Procedure Act was brought in in 1853. Indeed, it has changed since the Real Property Limitation Acts were brought in, those Acts that date from 1833 to 1874.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows the tempo of life has increased very much since those days.  The conduct of business affairs has undergone a profound change and it is, as I said, because of these things that a change in the law is necessary and desirable.  This Bill deals with many things: it deals with actions of contract and other actions of that kind, actions to recover possession of land and so on, actions to assert the ownership of land, actions to claim the right to certain rents from land, actions to recover settled chattels, actions to recover arrears of rent-charges, conventional rents, dower and annuities charged on personal property, actions in respect of mortgages and charges, actions in respect of trust property, that trust property being describable as equitable estate.</P>
    <P>Then there are actions in respect of deceased persons' estates and so on and, as I mentioned already in my Irish remarks, if we were to deal with all these things minutely, in detail and in a satisfactory way, the Committee Stage of this Bill would last for about six months.  Because of the complex nature of this measure and its many and varied provisions and the many aspects of the law that it touches upon, <Col N="62" /> I think it would be in keeping with common sense and good procedure to suggest that this Bill is essentially one for a Special Committee of the House so that those members dealing with it would be in a position to ask questions across the table and to put the various points of view from one to another and have the Bill discussed in a full and satisfactory manner.  I would put that suggestion to the House this evening before we settle the date on which the Committee Stage will be taken.</P>
    <P>There are certain changes being made in the law as to the time limit that should be put on actions.  This time limit operates in various ways and will still operate in various ways when this Bill becomes law.  We have the action for a simple contract debt, the time limit for which will still be six years.  I take it, therefore, that that is to be left unchanged, that it is only after a period of six years that the statute of limitations will run against the claimant.  There appears to be no proposal to change the law as regards debt in simple contract or any such obligation.</P>
    <P>There is also the special contract debt, what is called in legal parlance the speciality contract, that is, contract under seal.  Hitherto a contract under seal occupied a special place by itself and the statute of limitations did not run against that contract for 20 years, that is, a contract brought about by specific deed.  The reason for that was that those parties who would go to the trouble of drafting such a deed, having it stamped and registered, were, by that action, attaching more sanctity to it than would be attached to an ordinary simple contract.  What I mean by the ordinary simple contract is the contract which takes place every other day between people going into shops to purchase goods, and so on. Those are simple contracts, but these speciality contracts are those that are brought about by deed, the deed to be registered and stamped and duly executed.  I see that in this Bill that period of 20 years is being reduced to 12 years.  I think that is right because in the world of to-day with the quick passage of time&mdash;I mean that as regards people's imagination and feelings time passes more quickly now <Col N="63" /> than it ever did before&mdash;it is only right that the period of limitation would be changed as it is being changed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is then the limitation on actions in respect of the ownership of land.  I understand that that is being left more or less as it is at 12 years. The Minister mentioned actions for slander.  There are different kinds of slander, slander <i>per se</i> and the other kind of slander where special damages have to be proved.  Henceforth there is to be no distinction as regards such actions.  It will be a simple action for slander.  I understand from the Minister that the period during which an action of that kind can be brought is three years.  That is right also because after three years it would be fairly difficult to produce the necessary evidence to sustain the action in a court of law.</P>
    <P>There is also a change being made to which the Minister referred and which will go some way towards making the State amenable to the law of limitation as well as ordinary individuals.  This position which the State has occupied up to now derives from an ancient axiom of the law&mdash;&ldquo;The King can do no wrong&rdquo;.  Now the State takes the place of the king and hitherto the position was that the State could do no wrong.  However, even after the passage of this Bill there will still be a certain amount of leeway to make up in that direction to bring the State into line with the position of the ordinary individuals of society.</P>
    <P>I notice that as regards such land there has been an amendment since the Bill was considered in the Dáil. The period of limitation for a State authority was, as the Bill stood then, 40 years.  Now it has been reduced to 30 years.  That is about right, because, as far as I know, that is the position in Britain regarding the recovery of land by a State authority.  There it is subject to a limitation of only 30 years. Of course, the conditions in Britain are not exactly the same as they are here.  The vendors and purchasers' law relating to land is not the same here as in Britain, but I do not intend to go into that now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> I do not think there is any more I could usefully say on this Stage.  The Bill touches upon many items of legal procedure in this country and I would ask the Minister and the House to consider my suggestion that the Committee Stage be referred to a Special Committee of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much at the present stage.  It would be quite impossible on the Second Stage to discuss this Bill.  In Alice in Wonderland they were able to talk about cabbages and kings but the diversity of topics dealt with in this Bill of some 120 sections is far greater than that so that on this stage there is very little anyone could usefully say.</P>
      <P>There are just two major points that occur to me.  One is that&mdash;I do not know whether it is relevant to the Bill or not&mdash;I am very sorry that the position still remains that there is no Statute of Limitations as regards any sum which might be due in respect of tax.  I do think that this country should follow the example of the United Kingdom in regard to that and it is rather wrong, I think, that in this country claims of tax can be made back to the year 1922.  That is a matter which must be attended to some time.  The Minister has pointed out that under this Bill the State does give up certain privileges which it had.  I do think there should be limitations there as there are in England.  I think that the people who prepared this Bill are certainly to be congratulated because it is a masterpiece of care and accuracy. It obviously represents the labour of a very long period and undoubtedly it will be a very convenient thing to the lawyer to have a codification of this kind of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry in a way that it does not seem to deal very fully with the question of easements and it relates rather to the rights of property rather than of easements.  One might have thought that there might have been very many obscurities which could have been dealt with in an omnibus Bill of this kind.  As I have said, it would be a waste of time and energy to try to discuss the force of the laws changed in the Bill at this stage.  They are matters for Committee Stage. <Col N="65" /> Senator Kissane referred to the fact that in regard to slander the period had been extended from two to three years.  I feel that in the case of slander the injured person who does not take action within two years would have very little to complain of and I do not see why it should be extended to three years.  There are a couple of other laws which are introduced in the Bill which I think are really matters which might require a good deal of consideration.  I am only a solicitor and I am not an expert on law.  It seems to me that Section 72&mdash;the postponement of limitation period in the case of mistake&mdash;might be a fertile cause of doubt and dispute.  One of the really good things about a Bill like this, no matter how well drafted, is that it does give hope of almost limitless litigation over a period.  From that point it seems that it will be welcome.</P>
    <P>I think that what Senator Kissane said to the effect that some form of discussion, either by a committee of the House, or a discussion between those members who are most interested in the Bill, before the Committee Stage might be very helpful because undoubtedly this is the kind of Bill which can be discussed much more easily across the table and possibly some discussion of that kind could be arranged.  I think we have in this House one of the great experts on the law of limitations, Professor George O'Brien, who has made a close study of it.  In general, I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister and the draftsmen on what has obviously been a work of very great care and skill and I am certain it will eventually be of very great value in a very difficult branch of the law.</P>

      <P>A codification Bill of this nature is indeed one that will be appreciated by legal practitioners.  As the Minister has explained the limitation of actions is contained in various Statutes and Rules of Law.  This Consolidation Bill which will also amend the law of limitations will be a valuable addition to the Acts of the Oireachtas.  Like Senator Cox.  I wish to congratulate the Minister, his <Col N="66" /> advisers and draftsmen in bringing forward this Bill and having its provisions set out in a clear and precise form.  The explanatory notes of the Bill are most helpful for reference purposes.  It is obvious that a considerable amount of thought, research and consultation has gone into the preparation of this &mdash; as Senator Kissane has remarked&mdash;highly technical Bill.  The codification reforms which have been achieved under this Bill could also be applied with very useful effect to the law on fisheries, the licensing laws and the laws on local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage of the Bill in the other House a considerable number of amendments were made in the Bill seeking further additional improvements and tidying up the law of limitations.  One amendment, which has been agreed to and which was referred to by various speakers on the Second Stage in the other House, will be of much benefit, particularly to the small farmers with whom I have much contacts in the course of my practice. That is the law contained in Section 2, sub-section (2) (a) (ii).  At present in the case of a registered owner who died intestate, leaving a large family, and where one of the family, or the widow, would have a moral right to the holding, because of the fact that that person had remained on to look after, say, aged parents, while the other members had gone off to America or England and had been paid their dowries and their fares, the person who stayed at home sacrificed himself and possibly found it necessary to extract a grant of administration for the purpose of withdrawing a sum in deposit receipts or an amount payable under an insurance premium.  Because of the fact that that person had taken out administration he is also deprived of the right to ownership unless the next of kin release their interests, whereas, if administration had not been taken out, he could have gone to the Circuit Court and obtained an order under Section 52 and become registered as full owner.  I am glad the amendment which was made on the Committee Stage in the other House has now rectified that position.  It frequently led to a good deal of uncertainly, <Col N="67" /> as well as dissatisfaction and injustice to the personal representative.</P>
    <P>The six months' period which had previously been the law for commencing actions against the local authority, prior to the passing of the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Act two years ago, was in my opinion as a member of a local authority and as a legal practitioner, too short a period, but I feel that six years was too long a period and I am glad that the period is to be reduced to three years.  I even feel that three years may possibly be too long and that people may sometimes take advantage of it by delaying to take proceedings until such time as the official of the local authority who is familiar with the position has been transferred or resigned and then there is no one who is familiar with the particular circumstances.  At any rate, it certainly is an improvement on the period which formerly was the law.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that the Minister has seen fit to agree that the provisions of the Bill will apply to actions by or against a State authority under Section 3.  This is in accordance with the Constitution, although I still feel that there is a great injustice in the State's non-liability for tort, apart from the liability under the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  The law in this respect should, I suggest, be amended without any further delay.</P>
    <P>To permit the State 40 years to recover land is, in my opinion, to long a period as against the individual's right of only 12 years.  I can see no reason why that period should not be reduced to, say, 20 years as against the individual's right of 12 years.  I agree, however, that the recovery of foreshore should be a longer period because of the fact that the public as a whole have a greater interest in such a right.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be any provision in the Bill as to the period which may elapse from the time proceedings are instituted until they are determined.  I suggest, therefore, that something should be done concerning pending proceedings.  As far as I am <Col N="68" /> aware, a creditor may sue for a debt on a civil bill and have it adjourned generally.  There does not appear to be any provision against the civil bill being re-entered, say, 20 years later and a decree being obtained.</P>
    <P>Take the case of an equity civil bill brought by a creditor claiming the administration of an estate.  The order is made and the procedure as far as the taking of accounts and inquiries by the county registrar is carried through and the registrar's certificate is made up.  The creditor's debt may be paid, but if the creditor sues for all the other creditors as well as for himself, I can see nothing to prevent another creditor from having the proceedings re-entered and claiming the benefit of the administration suit which had been brought, as I have said, a considerable number of years previously.</P>
    <P>The same thing could happen where a judgment mortgagee brings a suit to realise his security.  A defendant may pay off his particular mortgage and the costs to date and the interest of the plaintiff then vanishes, but the order still remains.  The suit is not dismissed and I think it is open to a puisne mortgagee to have the case re-entered and obtain the benefit of the suit years afterwards.  I suggest it should be provided that if no steps are taken in such cases after a certain number of years, the proceedings should be automatically dismissed out of court.</P>
    <P>I also feel that some provision should be made in the case of debtors who leave the country and that the statute should run against such debtors while they remain outside the State.  It may happen that a debtor with a considerable amount of liabilities may leave the State and remain out for six years and then return.  His address, while he is absent, is unknown and, when he returns, he is clear of all debts and the creditors are without any remedy. I think there should be some way of keeping such debts alive.  Here in Ireland where, unfortunately, so many of our people have to emigrate, it is a problem that may arise more frequently than in other countries where this position does not apply.  At any rate, like Senator Kissane and <Col N="69" /> Senator Cox, I feel that if any useful amendments can be made to this Bill, they will be more practicably dealt with, as they have suggested, by a Special Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak now, but I have a number of questions which I had hoped to ask the Minister on the Committee Stage. I would like to support Senator Cox on one point he raised, that is, the fact that there is no protection at all for the ordinary citizen in regard to limitation on the period in which income-tax out of profits can be assessed and reassessed for income-tax purposes.  Under the existing law, which is not affected by this Bill at all, the Revenue Commissioners or the inspector of taxes can go back as far as 1922 and reopen an assessment which might have been agreed at that time.  Citizens, companies or bodies can find themselves in the position that they have made a thoroughly accurate return of their income in 1922 or 1935, or any year in the past 35 years, and they may have agreed it with the inspector of taxes.  In due course, that inspector may have retired and a new inspector may have been appointed, who is at perfect liberty to reopen the assessment for any of those years and decide that it had been made wrongly. I know one actual case at the present time.</P>
      <P>In Britain, I understand that, provided there has been no case of fraud, the Revenue Commissioners may not reassess after a period of, I think, six years.  I would ask the Minister to consider consulting, before the Committee Stage, with the Minister for Finance to see if any amendment could be made to give protection to the ordinary citizen against reopening an assessment, going back over a period of more than five or six years.</P>
      <P>I also join with Senator Cox and Senator Walsh in suggesting that this is a Bill which could be considered by a Special Committee and I should like to support their suggestion that it be referred to a Special Committee rather than to the House again.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on this Bill, but something <Col N="70" /> which Senator Walsh said provokes me to do so.  If it is the law at present that a debtor can go out of the country and after a lapse of years return debt free, it seems to be a very serious defect in our law.  If this Bill does not remedy that defect, I most earnestly suggest to the Minister that it should, that this is the time to remedy the defect.  I should like the Minister to give some assurance to the Seanad on that point.  If he could tell us that that in fact will not be so, that if a person goes abroad and comes back after a lapse of years, he will still be liable for his debts, then we will all be satisfied; but if he cannot tell us that, I would urge him to introduce a section into this Bill to remedy the defect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Douglas in what he said with regard to the power of the Revenue Commissioners to go back for a long number of years.  One of the great difficulties in that is that they often go back when the person who would have been concerned has died.  That often makes it more difficult for the trustees.  There is a big anomaly there.</P>
      <P>There was a case in which I was an executor myself.  The Revenue Commissioners caused an investigation to be made and the investigation cost several hundred pounds.  It was proved there was no money due, but the estate had to bear the cost of the investigation. Apart from the undesirability of always causing apprehension and disturbance to the executors, and maybe the widow, as it often turns out to be, I think it is a bad principle.  The principle which the Minister stated, when he was speaking here on the Second Reading of this Bill, that the State should not have rights greater than are enjoyed by the ordinary citizens, is a principle which should apply also to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners would not enjoy any greater rights either.  It is a peculiar anomaly that when the British moved out of Dublin Castle, the Revenue Commissioners moved in.  Sometimes I feel that some of the ghosts lurking in that building are still showing their defiance in the presence of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Cox, Senator Douglas and Senator Burke in their pleas to the Minister to take some action about the powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister has made a certain amount of play in introducing this Bill here to-night that the special position enjoyed by the State went back to the old days of kingships when &ldquo;the King could do no wrong.&rdquo; If ever we allow the Revenue Commissioners to enjoy the powers they enjoyed heretofore, of going back over 34 years for taxation purposes in cases already settled&mdash;and paid, mind you; it is not a question where they have been owed money but in cases settled and paid&mdash;surely we are giving to the Revenue Commissioners a divine right, so to speak, that was never enjoyed by kings.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that between now and the Committee Stage he should give very careful consideration to the introduction of a suitable clause in this Bill.</P>

Our one desire was to get a Bill on which we would have the co-operation of the House and which would be a good Bill.</P>
      <P>I have been asked a question, on which I am sure there would be a unanimous decision from both Houses, viz., could we interfere with the Revenue Commissioners regarding income-tax. While I have every sympathy with the views expressed, I can assure Senators that the position is that this is not the relevant Bill for the purpose. It is in a Finance Bill or an Income Tax Bill that one would have to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree to send this Bill forward to a Special Committee and the Senators appointed to that committee can discuss all the points raised around the table.  We are prepared to cooperate with the Senators as far as we possibly can in producing a Bill which will meet with general approval and remove the anomalies existing here for up to a century in many cases.  I <Col N="72" /> would ask the Seanad to pass only the Second Reading to-night and the House may then refer the Bill to a Special Committee to consider what amendments or improvements can be made in it.</P>
    <P>I would ask another favour, that is, that the committee should not meet sooner than a fortnight or three weeks from now.  We are engaged on another committee in the Dáil and it would take some time for the officials to prepare to meet the Senators appointed on the Special Committee of this House.  If the Seanad desires to appoint a committee to inquire into this and to discuss any amendments which may be desirable, I am, as I said, prepared to accept the suggestion.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to consolidate, with <Col N="73" /> amendments, the law relating to the status of married women and the liabilities of husbands.  Explanatory sidenotes have been provided showing the source of the provisions being reenacted, showing what provisions are entirely new, and also showing the provisions which alter or modify existing law.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes five important changes in the law.  First of all, it makes a married woman liable personally for her torts, contracts and debts, and it extends liability in bankruptcy to all married women.  Secondly, it allows one spouse to sue the other in tort.  Thirdly, it abolishes restraint on anticipation.  Fourthly, it allows a wife or child to enforce a contract made by the husband for the benefit of the wife or child, and similarly, in the case of a contract made by the wife. Finally, it abolishes a husband's liability for his wife's torts.</P>
      <P>At present, a married woman can sue and be sued as if she were a single woman, but she is only liable to the extent of her separate property.  Under Section 2 (1) of the Bill, her liability will be personal and not proprietary. The idea of separate property is being abolished, and, after the Bill becomes law, the property of a married woman will be her property, just as her husband's property is his property.  At present, a married woman can be made bankrupt only if she is trading separately from her husband, and judgment can be entered against her only to the extent of her separate property.  The Bill proposes to make her subject to the bankruptcy laws as if she were unmarried, and decrees may be enforced against her personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second change proposed is to allow a husband or wife to sue the other in tort.  This is, of course, not an entirely new provision.  Under Section 12 of the Married Women's Property Act, 1882, a wife can take all civil proceedings against her husband for the protection, security and recovery of her separate property as if she were a single woman.  She may sue him in trover or detinue or in ejectment, and she may obtain an injunction restraining him from interfering in her business affairs.  We now propose to give <Col N="74" /> her, and the husband also, a full right to sue in tort.  We are quite satisfied that the granting of this right will not give rise to objectionable or collusive actions.  Certainly, it will cause no more objectionable or collusive actions than the present law which allows a child to sue his or her parent in tort.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) of the Bill will allow a wife to recover against a negligent husband, who, while driving a motorcar, injures her.  Most drivers of cars are under the impression that their wives are covered by comprehensive insurance policies.  A wife or a husband is not, however, in fact covered by such a policy though a child is.  This is because one spouse is not liable to the other in tort.  A further point is that, if a husband and a third party by their joint negligence injure the wife, and she sues the third party, the third party cannot recover contribution from the husband under the Tortfeasors Act, 1951.  It has been argued that to allow one spouse to sue the other in tort will tend to upset the peace of the marital home.  We are satisfied that there is no substance in this.  When a man and wife have reached the stage of suing one another, there is very often little peace left to be disturbed. Moreover, the threat of an action in the background is bound to have a salutary effect on, say, the aggressive husband, and, in our view, will prevent a situation reaching what the Attorney-General described in the Dáil as &ldquo;boiling point&rdquo;.  When a safety valve is introduced at a lower pressure, things are much more likely to right themselves.</P>
    <P>It is far better to allow married people to settle their differences at an early stage than to preserve a law which tends to create a situation where the ultimate solution of a separation must be resorted to.  The existing statutory provision allowing a wife to sue her husband for the protection of her property has not, in practice, led to an amount of objectionable actions.  And it is common knowledge that actions in regard to property are generally more bitterly contested than ordinary tort actions for assault, etc.  Experience in the United States shows that, in those <Col N="75" /> States where tort actions are allowed between spouses, marital security has not been upset to any greater extent than in those States which do not allow such actions.</P>
    <P>We have given this whole matter the most careful consideration and we are convinced that we are doing the right thing.  Compromise solutions have not proved satisfactory.  To allow a wife to sue her husband for ordinary negligence and to refuse to allow her to sue him for criminal negligence can scarcely be justified by anybody who seriously considers the problem. Are we to say that a man who injures his wife in a motor car accident is to be liable because the insurance company pays but that a man who has a habit of beating his wife or who slanders her to the whole community is to escape liability?</P>
    <P>If he is to escape liability, the marriage is heading towards the courts anyway, and, eventually, a separation will ensue.  That is not the way to preserve peace and happiness in the home, and what is more it does not preserve it.  It must not be forgotten that a wife has a right to have her husband prosecuted criminally for torts which are crimes.  How much better it is to allow the wife to restrain a militant husband by a civil action than to force her to have criminal proceedings taken against him.</P>
    <P>The third important change proposed in the Bill is contained in Section 6&mdash; the abolition of restraint on anticipation. This is a device, invented by the Court of Chancery over a century ago, to protect a married woman's property against her husband.  It can be applied only to a married woman, and it is a term inserted in a settlement whereby the married woman may be restrained from anticipating the income from her property or using the capital itself.  It is generally accepted that the device has outlived its usefulness.</P>
    <P>It is a device which can be used, and has been used, to defraud creditors. When money values are declining, it prevents the woman from taking steps to safeguard her interests.  It prevents her raising money to start or expand a business or to provide for the education <Col N="76" /> of her children.  Generally, in this day and age, its disadvantages far outweigh its advantages and it is proposed to abolish it entirely.  We had thought of abolishing it only in future cases, but that would not help in those cases where it is a hindrance at the moment, and bearing in mind that the court had power to lift it in any particular case&mdash;the defect in this being the cost involved and the fact that the courts adopted a rigid attitude&mdash;we are not really, as might appear at first sight, embarking on retrospective legislation of a kind which might be thought to be objectionable in principle.</P>
    <P>The fourth important amendment of the law proposed in the Bill is contained in Section 8.  This section will allow a spouse or child to sue, as beneficiary, on a contract made by the other spouse.  Under our law, a third person cannot, except in isolated instances, sue on a contract made for his benefit, if he is not a party to it.  One of the exceptions to this rule arises in the case of life insurance policies; and we are extending this exception in Section 7 to cover endowment policies. The difference between Section 7 and Section 8 of the Bill is that Section 7 is designed to create a trust right whereas Section 8 creates a contract right.  An insurance policy for the benefit of a spouse or child may not be cancelled by the contracting parties, whereas an ordinary contract may.  If a man takes out an insurance policy for the benefit of his daughter and dies subsequently the policy moneys will, under Section 7, be her property and not part of his estate.</P>
    <P>The fifth major change in the law proposed in the Bill is to be found in Section 10.  We propose to abolish a husband's liability for his wife's torts. A husband is not at present liable for his wife's contracts, unless she contracts as his agent.  If, however, she slanders somebody he is liable for the damages.  He is also liable for her negligence, and this is a very practical consideration.  We think that the existing law ought to be changed.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the main changes the Bill proposes to make, particularly with the proposal that a husband or wife may sue the other for a personal <Col N="77" /> tort, and have emphasised that, under the law as it stands, a wife may take against her husband any civil action for the protection, security and recovery of her property.  I should like now to refer briefly to two suggestions which have been made.</P>
    <P>The first suggestion arises under Section 3, the substance of which is taken from the 1882 Act.  It was argued that, by saying that the property of a married woman may be disposed of as if she were unmarried, we might, without meaning to do so, be interfering with the law of devolution of property on intestacy.  The Attorney-General is quite satisfied that that is not so.  Disposition and devolution are two different things and that has been made clear in decided cases in the courts.  The second suggestion that has been made is that the Bill interferes with the ordinary marital right of living in the family home.  We have carefully examined this suggestion in consultation with the Attorney-General. We are in no doubt in regard to this matter.  The Bill proposes no change in the existing law in regard to the marital home.  It merely gives the right to sue, a right which the wife already has in regard to her separate property.  The Bill does not take away any defence open to the husband.  I am speaking of the case where the marital home is the property of the wife.</P>
    <P>We will welcome any proposals designed to make this a better Bill.  In this connection, I might mention that we decided, when preparing this Bill, to leave the law of bankruptcy as it was, pending a full examination of that law.  Senators are, I am sure, aware that our bankruptcy law is out of date and ought to be reformed.  The Taoiseach mentioned this in the Dáil in 1941 and a Committee reported on the subject as long ago as 1928.  We hope to tackle the whole law of bankruptcy when a suitable opportunity arises.  In this Bill, however, we are making one fairly important change. This change has been made because of the argument used by Deputy Seán Moylan in the Second Stage in the Dáil.  Under the 1882 Act, where a husband goes bankrupt, a wife who is a <Col N="78" /> creditor, is postponed until the claims of the other creditors are satisfied. The Bill as originally introduced proposed to re-enact the relevant provision in the 1882 Act.  On Committee Stage in the Dáil, I had the re-enacting provision in the Bill deleted.  In future, therefore, a husband or wife of a bankrupt, if a genuine creditor, will be able to claim in the same way as the other creditors.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that we regard this Bill as an important advance in legal reform?  It will free the married woman from the restrictions imposed on her by the law.  These restrictions have been gradually relaxed over the years.  Now we propose to remove them altogether.  The progress of organised society is judged by the status occupied by married women. If and when this Bill becomes law, we will be able to say that our law as to the legal position of married women is the most modern and advanced in the civilised world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is another step in the direction of the consolidation of the law relating to the status of married <Col N="79" /> women.  I think we are entitled to regard it as an important Bill in that connection.  I must say that, on the whole, it is a good measure, a measure that should commend itself to the Seanad.  At the same time, I am bound to say that there are certain features in it that require further examination.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to Section 2 of the Bill.  I regard Section 2 as the most important section in the whole measure because it is within the framework of that section that most of the changes in the law relating to the status of married women are being brought about.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of civil rights as between husband and wife&mdash;the right this Bill, if enacted, would give them to sue each other in the courts of law as ordinary individuals can sue one another.  When I read it first, my reaction to that section was that it was going too far in that direction and that, despite anything the Minister has told us this evening, the operation of the section could result in unhappy relations between husband and wife.</P>
    <P>I am aware that certain legal rights exist already for the protection of the married woman's status.  Here, however, we are opening the door entirely so that the husband and wife will now stand as two entirely different people in the eyes of the law and can bring a civil action in the court for such things as, say, conversion, detinue or even slander, or any of those transgressions that come under the heading of the law of torts.  It may be said that the husband or wife would never have recourse to such an action, but that should not be the criterion that should guide us.  We are making that provision in such a way that the husband can sue the wife, or the wife the husband, as the case may be, in a court of justice in a civil action.</P>
    <P>I realise that an amendment of the law was necessary inasmuch as, in motor accidents, the wife should be given the right to claim for damages against her husband.  I take it in a case like that, if she would not have the legal right to sue her husband in court, she could not recover from the <Col N="80" /> insurance company.  We have had the position here that in spite of the fact that the owner of the car&mdash;we shall say he is the husband&mdash;had a comprehensive policy, his wife sitting in the car beside him was not covered by that policy.  That, I submit, was a position that required re-examination and an amendment of the law was certainly desirable.  As the Minister knows and as other people, especially those connected with the law, know, there have been cases of hardship because of this position that has obtained up to now.</P>
    <P>While I say it is right and proper to amend the law so as to give the married woman that right, I do not think what the Minister mentioned here&mdash; the right of the wife to sue the husband for other torts&mdash;is to be commended in the same way as giving her the right to sue her husband for the recovery of damages in the case of a motor accident where the wife suffers injury, sometimes serious injury.  When you give certain legal rights to people, it is not incumbent on them to exercise those rights.  At the same time, the temptation would be there and now, for the first time, we are providing the married woman with the temptation to bring her husband into court in a civil action when, perhaps, she might not ever think of it otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister and the Government have given this very important question the consideration it should be given.  I should like to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, whether any outside bodies were consulted about this change in the law, which, as I said, could in certain cases change the happy relationship that has existed, generally speaking, between husband and wife here. If it is a question of furthering the rights and privileges of the married woman, it would be of interest to find out if, for instance, the organisation known as Bantracht na Tuaithe, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, was ever consulted about the desirability of effecting this change in the law.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the United States of America.  I think he has in <Col N="81" /> mind the State of New York because, from what I can gather, that is the only State where a wife can bring her husband freely into court in any action in tort.  Neither the Minister nor anybody else has adduced evidence here to show that the system there has been working well.</P>

      <P>I have not seen them. I would like to have them here for our guidance.  I suggest that what might be applicable to the United States of America might not be applicable to the conditions here.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of changing the bankruptcy law as regards married women.  This is also covered by Section 2 of the Bill.  I am in favour of that.  Hitherto a married woman was not liable in contract unless she was carrying on a separate business.  The reason I am in favour of having the bankruptcy laws amended is that I consider no quibble of the law should allow debtors to get away from the payment of their just debts or defraud creditors of the payment of the lawful debts due to them.  The same principle should apply to the enforcement of court orders and judgments of courts.  I consider it is right that even married women should be made amenable to these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restraint on anticipation is another branch of the law that is being amended here.  Restraint on anticipation is an equitable doctrine whereby the married woman was prevented from making use of her estate because it was considered by the law that she was all the time under the influence and persuasion of her husband. It was meant originally as a protection for the married woman, but, as matters developed in later years, this doctrine turned out to be inequitable inasmuch as the married woman could not make use of her property, even for good and beneficial purposes. For that reason, I am in favour of that amendment of the law.  There are 22 sections in this Bill and we will, of course, have an opportunity of considering them between now and the <Col N="82" /> Committee Stage.  I would, however, ask the Seanad to give special consideration to Section 2 of this measure, because I think the provision goes a bit too far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his draftsmen are to be congratulated once more.  If the Minister goes on at his present rate, he will, I think, prove to be a greater legislator than any since the Emperor Justinian.  To a lawyer, there is something very satisfying in these codifying statutes, since we suffer in this country from a lack of textbooks.  We carry on here on a very complicated basis of English statute law, common law and decided cases.  That system has been possible in England because of the frequency of textbooks and so forth.  Because this country is so small and because the market is so small, it is impossible to produce textbooks here.  Indeed, in the end, this country may have to turn to a code of law such as exists in the <Col N="83" /> Roman law countries, for example, France and Germany.</P>
      <P>The Minister is doing excellent work in gradually codifying the law here. That codification will ultimately clear the way to what will be a simpler and more appropriate form of jurisprudence here.  If we continue as we are going at present, in a few years' time, the law will be completely unknowable. It has practically reached that point at the moment, because of lack of appropriate textbooks.  From that point of view, the work the Minister is doing along the lines of codification is extremely valuable and he is to be commended for it.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill which lends itself to discussion more on Committee than on this stage, but there are nevertheless extremely important points which must be made now.  There are some things omitted from the Bill, things which I hold should be incorporated in the Bill.  One is in relation to the devolution of property when a wife dies intestate. A married woman has exactly the same right and freedom to make a will as an unmarried woman or a man. That has been the position for years. If, however, a wife dies without making a will, all her personal property goes to her husband.  That used to be the law in England.  It is not the law in Scotland; it is not the law in France.  It is time it ceased to be the law here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a husband dies without making a will, the wife takes one-third and two-thirds go to the children.  I think the same position should obtain when the wife dies intestate.  I see no reason why the husband should automatically succeed to the whole of his wife's property. I see no reason why the law of devolution of property in the case of a wife should be any different from the law of devolution of property in the case of a married man.  Indeed, one might have thought perhaps that it should have been the other way about, because the husband is supposed to provide for his wife and, if he fails to make a will, then all his property should go to his wife.  I see no reason why all the wife's property should go to the husband and I should like to <Col N="84" /> offer an amendment to that provision. It is a very important point.</P>
    <P>There is another point which is not quite so important.  At the moment, there is an anomaly in relation to married women.  Under our Constitution, the husband is the natural guardian of the children.  One would expect that, on the death of the husband, the wife would be the natural legal guardian; but she is not so, of necessity.  No matter what rules one lays down, there will be hard cases, but it should be the law that, when a husband dies, a wife should be the guardian of the children.</P>
    <P>There is one clause to which I am very much opposed.  Senator Kissane approved of it.  I refer to the clause abolishing restraint on anticipation. The idea hitherto was that a father in providing for his daughter had power to settle property in such a way that the daughter, while married, could not anticipate her income.  The purpose was to protect the woman from the possibility of her husband's folly. There obviously could be cases in which, having made that provision to protect the daughter, it might subsequently be found much better, had the daughter been able to dispose of her property; but experience has proved that restraint on anticipation was both wise and proper and I see no reason why the Legislature should now seek to prevent people giving that protection.</P>
    <P>I am as anxious as everyone else to ensure that the status of women should be both as strong and as good as that of men.  I hold they should have exactly the same rights as men.  But it is the experience of everyone who has to deal with this kind of case that you do get cases of a woman with property who has to be defended or ought to be defended against the attempts of her husband to get at her property.  As the Minister has said, such a clause in a settlement could be set aside by the courts but that is no reason whatever for general abolition of it and I think that in introducing this section we are merely following an example that was set in England some years ago and, I think, was set with very doubtful wisdom. <Col N="85" /> There is this very unfair part of this provision, that it applies to past settlements and wills as well as to future ones.  As regards future wills, really no difficulty would arise because, even if the section is passed in the form in which it is now, it would be a very simple matter for a draftsman, even with the section as it stands, to draft a clause that would give exactly the same protection to a woman but the effect of passing the section in this way is that you are upsetting retrospectively perfectly valid dispositions which were made in the past by people for the protection of the daughter or the woman.  I feel that that is wrong and I do not think that we ought to do it.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal said as regards Section 2, which gives the right to the wife to take actions against the husband.  That is a thing that really should be considered very carefully and very fully because one would have to try to follow out what are the consequences of it and where does it lead us.  As it stands in the Bill, it looks a very good thing and a very sensible thing.  It seems clearly a sensible thing that the wife should have exactly the same rights as any other individual to protect herself or her property against her husband, but what may be the consequences of that when the law begins to work on it?  Is it to apply both ways?  Is the husband to have exactly the same rights against the wife and, if he is, how far are the wife's rights being irretrievably damaged?</P>
    <P>One very important part of a marriage ceremony is that the husband gives his wife the right to his property or goods.  Of course, to a large extent, in practice, that is nonsense nowadays because it does not mean that the wife gets all the husband's investments or anything like that, but it does mean that she gets very great rights in many ways to his property, to live in his house and use his things &mdash; to do all sorts of things.  If the Bill were passed in its present form, it undoubtedly means that the wife can prevent her husband from interfering with any of her property.  That is a very sensible and a very just thing and I fully agree with it but does the corollary apply? <Col N="86" /> Does it now mean that the wife is really left with no rights whatever against her husband?  It seems to me that, as the Bill stands in that respect, it wants a great deal of consideration and it seems to be quite possible that, as drawn at present, this Section 2 may have extraordinary results and may have results which might be very injurious to the married woman.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything more on this stage.  The Bill is obviously a most important one.  In dealing with the status of married women it is really dealing with the status, not of half the population, but of the whole population because it cuts both ways and it is obviously a Bill which requires very careful discussion on Committee and later stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have frequently in this House, both from this position and from the position opposite, protested that there should be a truce to legislation, that the House and the country would benefit very much if, for a period of, say, 12 months, no Bills at all, except a Finance Bill, were introduced. I have also often protested against legislation by reference.  I should like to say that this Bill certainly seems to me to be the kind of measure that is highly desirable.  I should like to say also that it is a most admirable example of legislation which tends to clearness and simplicity in the law.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not only clear and simple but it is also, of course, progressive in so far as it brings our law more into line with the actual position of women in our society.  Until these two Bills here this evening, I have never before seen a side-note in a Bill which said that a provision of a Bill was new. There is no objection to what is put into a side-note because I understand that side-notes are not part of the law but I think it was an excellent idea and I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the idea of furnishing us with a Bill where there is no necessity to refer to any other Act and where also you can see by looking down the side-notes what sections of it introduce new things into the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> I am not quite right in saying that there is no reference at all.  There is one reference, as far as I can see it, to the meaning of the word &ldquo;adopted child&rdquo; but that is in an Act passed only a few years ago &mdash; 1952.  From that point of view, therefore, it seems to me that the Minister is to be congratulated, as Senator Cox has said, in making this Bill a clarification of the law.  It is an entirely desirable form of legislation that there should be codification and there should be an advance.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister also on his speech although I did think from parts of the speech that he represented the state of matrimony as rather a state of war.  His vocabulary suggested that matrimony was a kind of armed conflict, with boiling points, actions, attacks and defences, and occasional periods of peace.  However, I presume that was really not intended.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing also that ought to be said about this Bill before one deals with the details of it in Committee. That is that a great many married women will not be in the slightest bit concerned with it, either because they have no property &mdash; and they are a considerable number &mdash; or because they have no quarrel with their husbands, no bones of contention, no fear of common assault and no fear of slander and no desire to take an action for tort or for anything else. At the same time, I think it is true to say that the Bill recognises the progress that has been made and that it brings the law into a state with which we would be in general agreement.</P>
    <P>The Bill is entirely a Bill for Committee. Accordingly, I do not propose to deal with it in detail.  Senator Kissane raised the point that there was a temptation in the Bill for a married woman to bring her husband into court.  Surely anyone who has any experience of life at all must agree that it can be a temptation only to a married woman who is already in a state of concealed warfare with her husband.  The provision in the Bill will certainly have no effect in making the <Col N="88" /> situation any worse than it is at present.  I do not think that the prospect in this Bill that a wife may bring her husband into court is likely to change a relationship which is already reasonably happy.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to meet the points Senator Kissane raised, because he asked us what was the experience in the United States of America and said that, if we told him what it was, then it would not be an analogy with this country at all.  I am inclined to agree with him that it would be difficult to find a place where the position of women is quite the same as it is here. I doubt if there is any place in which married women have as much power as they have in this country.  It is very difficult to find an analogy by which to be guided.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, by the way, that one of the points raised by Senator Kissane was also raised in the Dáil, yet no amendment was put down in the Dáil and no attempt was made to alter the Bill in that direction.  The Senator also made the point that a wife should be allowed to sue in tort for detinue and conversion.  She can do that already, and the Bill does allow her to sue her husband for such matters as civil assault and slander.</P>
    <P>The position in the United States was alluded to in the Dáil and the Attorney-General cited judges in the U.S.A. and said that the dark forebodings of the judiciary were not borne out by experience.  I agree with Senator Kissane that the question of experience in the United States is not perhaps quite applicable to our circumstances, which are quite different. As I said, the Bill is one which can be better discussed in Committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox has raised a very interesting point with regard to the power of a man making a settlement upon his daughter to prevent anticipation.  You are in the difficulty, of course, that you cannot regard a woman as an equal person and at the same time regard her as somebody who must have protection as if she were not equal at all.  I think that Senator Cox's point deserves consideration.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that we allow at least a fortnight to elapse before we <Col N="89" /> take the Committee Stage.  Of course, if Senators require a longer period there would be no difficulty in arranging it.  The question of amendments will be considered at the next stage. I should like to congratulate the Minister upon the general context, the general form of the Bill and on the fact that the Bill notably lacks the difficulties which have been part of our legislation.  It has been almost impossible to read some other Bills unless one was surrounded by statutes and skilled in studying these statutes which, after all, very few are.  The Minister and his Department are to be congratulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Senators have stated, this Bill with its marginal notes, introduced and explained by the Minister, has been presented to the House in an admirable form.  All concerned with its presentation and drafting are to be complimented.  The alterations proposed in the Bill are consistent with modern outlook and modern approach to the rights and privileges of the married woman and her property.  This is especially the case now when so many married women are earning money and have savings.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the provision in regard to restraint on anticipation is now only occasionally used in wills, but the settling of property on married women, usually prior to their marriage, did create from time to time great hardships for creditors and others.  I feel that it was also sometimes a shock to husbands when they discovered the true position.  In these days I think a woman has a great deal more to say on the question of whom she will marry.  It is only right, therefore, that she would have more discretion in dealing with her dowry.  I feel that now, with the high rate of taxation and death duties, dowries are not as common or as large as they were in the old days.  They certainly were never a feature in the life of the part of Ulster with which I am familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On account of the provisions contained in Section 11 of the Bill, I fear much injustice could be done to a woman's creditors if this restraint on <Col N="90" /> anticipation were not removed.  It is only right that if married women are to have equal legal rights with single women they should also have equal responsibilities with men.  The present liability of a husband for a wife's torts was often unfair.  For instance, a most amiable and peaceful husband, minding his own business, could be made liable for the slanders of his wife at a golf club or bridge party in another part of the country.  The amendment of the law in this respect is desirable and will afford protection to husbands in such cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox referred to the position concerning a married woman who dies intestate, and I am glad to note that it is proposed to introduce a new Administration of Estates Bill.  The present law is that when a married woman dies intestate leaving a husband and family, the husband is entitled to all her estate to the exclusion of her children.  I consider that law unjust.  It could mean in extreme cases that a married man who died a short time after marriage could leave all his estate to his widow.  Subsequently there is a child of that marriage and later still that widow remarries and dies intestate.  Her second husband would be entitled to her complete estate to the exclusion of her first husband's child.  I trust it will not be long until a new Bill rectifies that undesirable position so that a married woman's estate will devolve in the same way as those of husbands, at least as far as her family are concerned.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out great hardships have occurred from time to time where women passengers in vehicles were injured, sometimes seriously, by the negligent driving of their husbands despite the fact that there was a comprehensive policy of insurance.  These anomalies will be removed by Section 2 (2) of this Bill. Whether, however, the sub-section is too wide in permitting all classes of actions of tort and contract to be brought by a married woman against her husband or <i>vice versa</i> is open to question.  We have already heard to-night various viewpoints on that subject. Such a provision enabling such actions against a spouse is apparently not acceptable in most cases and only <Col N="91" /> time will tell whether or not they will have undesirable consequences.  At any rate, as the Attorney-General pointed out in the other House, it might be desirable that such actions, apart from the running down cases where an insurance company is involved, should be heard <i>in camera</i> at the discretion of the court.  If this view was accepted by this House, would it not be desirable that such a provision should be embodied in this Bill or would it be sufficient to incorporate it in the rules of court?</P>
    <P>Senator Cox also referred to the position concerning the right of a widow to the guardianship of her infant children.  At present she has no absolute right to such guardianship, though given preference, but evidence is required that she is a fit and proper person.  I consider that a widowed mother should automatically have the guardianship of her children as of right, unless serious reason is shown to the contrary.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that viewpoint when the Committee Stage is being brought before this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with those Senators who have praised the Bill in general terms.  I think it is true to say that in the Dáil, as I read the debate, the opposition to the Bill seemed to me a little too strong and a little unfair, and I think that the consideration of the Bill in the Seanad has been more constructive.  Personally, I am glad to see the genuine concern of so many Senators that justice be given to married women.  On previous occasions I have attempted to persuade Senators to vote with me in that regard, but not with conspicuous success.  However, I take this as a sign of enlightenment spreading, and the Minister and his Department are to be congratulated on that account too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is good, as has been said, technically.  It is not by any means an uncomplicated subject; yet it remains clear.  It is excellent in intention, and good in its general effect.  The Title is perhaps a little deceptive, because it covers quite a bit more than married <Col N="92" /> women's status.  It deals quite a lot with the limitation of liability for married men, but that is concealed in sections and paragraphs not mentioned, as I think it ought to be, in the Title; because at least part of the purpose of the Bill is to liberate the married man from certain disabilities and liabilities under which he labours at the moment.  I feel it would be franker to recognise that in the Title of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes, I think, mentioned the fact that it is reasonable to ask for equal responsibility from women now that they have been granted equal rights.  I am afraid the suggestion is too lightly made sometimes that they have in fact been granted equal rights, whereas of course in Ireland, though they have been granted many rights, they have not, even under this Bill, been granted equal rights.  There is a large number of concessions, and certain concessions which I think are very valuable, but the Bill does not go quite all the way.  I do not think it goes all the way that was suggested by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>In the long title to the Bill the liabilities of husbands are mentioned, and that refers to many sections. Sections 10, 11 and 14 are framed specifically to liberate husbands from awkward liabilities.  I have been told on at least two occasions in this House &mdash;I think it was when dealing with the Local Government Bill and the Civil Service Regulation Bill &mdash; that that was not the time to suggest that married women should be allowed to continue in employment whether they were married or not.  It was suggested to me in a friendly way by many Senators that what we needed was a general Bill to deal with the general principle of the status of married women and whether or not they should remain in employment though married, rather than to tinker with the problem, as it were, and try to amend individual Bills, like the Civil Service Regulation Bill and others.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should regard this Bill as an admirable opportunity for suggesting that certain disabilities which married women suffer in the Civil Service, for instance, should be removed <Col N="93" /> under, say, Section 2 of this Bill which says that &ldquo;subject to this Act a married woman shall be capable&rdquo; of this, that and the other thing.  I should like to see another paragraph added to that, that she shall be capable of seeking or entering, or continuing in employment as if she were unmarried.  I confidently trust that those Senators who assured me that if the general principle were to be put in some all-embracing Bill they would strongly consider supporting it, will do so when I come to put down such an amendment to Section 2.</P>
    <P>I notice that Section 19, on the other hand, fails to remove a disability existing at present in relation to married women.  Section 19 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring or authorising any body corporate to admit a married woman to be the holder of any shares therein, contrary to any enactment, charter, by-law, articles of association or deed of settlement regulating that body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There may be very strong legal reasons for that.  You might not want to tamper with this, that and the other.  You might not have the power under such a Bill as this to tamper with such holy documents as charters.  Nevertheless we should note incidentally that this type of disability upon married women stands unremoved by the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox has referred to Section 6, and he has told us he will be putting down an amendment to it, with which I shall find myself very much in sympathy.  This section deals with restriction on anticipation; the present position, as I understand it, being that it is within the power of, say, a father bequeathing property to his daughter to prevent her from anticipating the value of that property for the benefit of her husband or anybody else.  I consider that the right to do that &mdash; not the obligation to do that &mdash; could be a valuable one; it could be one that might even be appreciated and wanted by the married woman herself, who might in certain circumstances be quite glad to be able to say to a drunken or dissolute husband: &ldquo;I am sorry, but I cannot realise this property.&rdquo;  We <Col N="94" /> are trying under Section 6 to remove that restriction on anticipation.  I think that that is a bad thing.  I agree with Senator Cox and I look forward to supporting him.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in concluding, said that we had, in this State, freed married women from many legal restrictions, and then he went on to say that we are now abolishing legal restrictions on married women altogether.  I am afraid that he went too far in that. We are not in fact abolishing all restrictions; there are certain disabilities remaining.  A married woman teacher gets dismissed because she has committed the indiscretion of getting married.  A woman civil servant gets dismissed on marriage also.  That might be defended in some ways, but one certainly cannot say that there is no restriction on the married woman.  I should like to see this Bill going further, before I would agree with the Minister that in relation to the treatment of the married woman we are the &ldquo;most advanced country in the world.&rdquo;  I think he is too optimistic. There is also the law of devolution of property and the law relating to the guardianship of children.  I would join with those Senators who welcome the Bill, even though it may not go all the way suggested by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill confers rights on married women which they have not hitherto possessed and I am wondering if the Minister has given any consideration to the effect that this Bill will have on the marriage rate.  It is low enough already but it might seem to some shy and hesitant swain that this is putting further obstacles in his way.  He might be one of those wary gentlemen who would like to be sure that he would be the member of the matrimonial team who would always wear the trousers and, if it were to be different, he would think twice before entering into this bond.  He might be one of those people who would be inclined to go to the &ldquo;local&rdquo; and be a bit talkative when he goes home.  He would have to be careful of his words, especially if his mother-in-law were present, or he might find himself faced with an action for slander.</P>

      <Col N="95" /> I was glad to hear Senator Sheehy Skeffington say that he was supporting this Bill because it confers equality of rights on the sexes.  That attitude is somewhat different from the one he adopted earlier this evening in a motion to confer certain privileges on one of the sexes.  I should like to say that I am supporting this measure subject to any changes that may be made on the Committee Stage.  I think it is long overdue and I think the amendments mentioned by Senator Cox are very important.</P>

      <P>With regard to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's reference to the concluding words in my speech, I said that it will free the married woman from restrictions imposed on her by law.  The restriction on married lady teachers is not imposed by the law as far as I know.  It is imposed by administrative action.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for the manner in which they have met this Bill and the co-operation they have given me. We can deal with all the matters that have been raised when we come to the Committee Stage.  Senator Cox referred to intestacy and I am wholeheartedly in sympathy with the views he expressed.  I consider that the rights of a widow to property should be the same as a husband's.  We are already engaged in considering that matter and I hope soon to introduce a comprehensive Administration of Estates Bill to simplify, codify and improve many of the injustices of the present law of intestacy.</P>

    <P>It is pleasant for a Minister to come in here with a non-controversial Bill and to have the Seanad discuss it in a non-Party way in order to see what is the best thing to do.  It is my desire as far as possible in the Bills which I introduce, being a layman, to try to give information to the other non-lawyers so as to save them the trouble of wading through law books and statutes to find out what a particular section means.  We can deal with all the points which were raised on the Committee Stage when we will consider them sympathetically.  In the <Col N="96" /> meantime my Department will consider them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have requested the Government, in view of the serious unemployment crisis, to initiate immediate large-scale unemployment relief schemes.  I think I would be failing in my responsibility as a Senator if I simply requested the Government to do this without indicating how, in my opinion, this would be best accomplished.  I do not think it is necessary to detain the House long in talking about the gravity of the unemployment situation.  I think, apart from the demonstrations which we have heard about to-day, that it is already apparent we are approaching the peak period of the unemployment in 1953 and I think that, by March, it is reasonably safe to assume we will have passed it.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say that there appears in my name a motion on the Order Paper concerned with long-term economic planning, although to-night I am speaking on the need for interim action.  With regard to unemployment, these interim suggestions postulate long-term planning.  I would also say that short-term planning cannot be considered <i>in vacuo.</i>  Sometimes measures are common to long-term and interim planning.</P>
      <P>The need for dealing with the unemployment situation has been, I think, largely recognised by the Taoiseach in Cork in his speech there on 12th January of this year.  Here I am concerned only with that speech in so far as it bears upon the interim planning of large-scale unemployment relief schemes.  In that speech in Cork, the Taoiseach said that the increase in unemployment in recent months was largely due to external causes.  I am inclined to differ on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is misquoting me.  I did not say &ldquo;largely&rdquo;.  I said to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Taoiseach included in his reasons that the credit squeeze was to a large extent responsible for unemployment because it is quite certain that, before the Garden of Eden had vanished and <Col N="99" /> Eden along with it, unemployment had begun to mount.  The cause of unemployment&mdash;I think it is a platitude of the economists &mdash; is insufficient total expenditure within the framework of the economy.  During a credit squeeze, I think it is equally incontestable that expenditure is reduced within the economy.  A credit squeeze thus helps to increase unemployment and I for one do not believe you can stem unemployment by large scale unemployment relief schemes, unless you relax in many respects the credit squeeze. Therefore, the immediate initiation of large scale unemployment relief schemes, in my opinion, calls for the immediate relaxation of the credit squeeze; otherwise.  I think you are operating two directly opposed policies.  On the one hand, by the granting of, say, £1,000,000 here and there, you are closing or endeavouring to close one floodgate of unemployment, and, on the other hand, by operating a credit squeeze, you will leave open two larger floodgates of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I would say that the immediate relaxation of the credit squeeze would involve such steps as telling local authorities to go ahead with certain schemes they have already planned and for which in many cases they have obtained sanction and which are held up through the operation of the credit squeeze.  I do not think there is any lack of schemes.  Many local authorities have schemes all ready to be put into operation.</P>
      <P>I think, further, that such institutions as the Irish Sugar Company and the E.S.B. have schemes that only await sanction or finance to go ahead with.  I think that the credit squeeze to a large extent has been responsible for the hold-up of these schemes.  The Taoiseach at Cork announced that he recognised the necessity for dealing with the unemployment situation.  He announced that £1,000,000 would be made available for immediate works of a productive character as an unemployment relief measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the granting of that money, I would suggest that it is completely inadequate.  In the short space <Col N="100" /> of time at my disposal, I do not propose to speak too long as I am sure there are other Senators who would like to say something on the matter. I think that the £1,000,000 is largely fictitious.  When you deduct certain sums payable to certain institutions, as a matter of fact, only between £250,000 and £500,000 are available for productive employment.</P>
    <P>Further, I would point out that the effect of this expenditure in reducing unemployment is largely, to my mind, counteracted by the credit squeeze.  In one particularly glaring example, there has been a reduction of £600,000 in the moneys available for the provision of employment in rural areas during the winter months &mdash; a reduction of £600,000 from the figure granted for these equivalent months during the period 1955-56.  I am not sure whether it is necessary to say how that sum is made up.  Roughly £500,000 of it was for supplementary road grants and £50,000 for local authority works grants.  The other £50,000 is made up of various sums.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that, therefore, the unemployment situation is unlikely, I hold, to be remedied by the measures already proposed and, again, the credit squeeze is largely to blame.  What is needed is obviously large-scale unemployment relief schemes necessitating large-scale expenditure. I do not believe this can be provided without an immediate change in financial policy.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my last point. Large-scale unemployment relief schemes cannot be introduced, even for an interim period, without immediate financial measures designed to direct capital investment.  An Taoiseach in his speech in Cork has correctly argued, I think, that any large-scale reduction in unemployment must be based on national development.  He has gone on to argue, in turn, that this must be based on increased investment. He restricted himself a little too much, I think, in emphasising the part which savings must play in this investment and in devoting a considerable part of his speech to an appeal to private investors to repatriate at least part of their foreign investments. <Col N="101" /> I have one or two observations which I intend to make on this point, in conclusion.</P>
    <P>First of all, I would say that interim large-scale employment schemes are impossible without adequate direction of capital investment.  Capital investment of the kind required, I hold, and hold very strongly, cannot be financed purely out of savings, even if our savings were at present at the maximum figure.  On the contrary, they are at present declining, and, over the past four years, they have been reduced by, I think, £70,000,000 in 1953 to something like £47,000,000 in 1956.  I hold that, during the credit squeeze, savings are likely to decline further.</P>
    <P>Again, we find contrary policies operating.  On the one hand, people are urged, and urged very rightly, to save, but, on the other hand, the restriction of credit undoubtedly causes them to eat into their savings.  Therefore, I submit, finally, that large-scale unemployment relief schemes necessitating large scale expenditure can be financed adequately only when the Government acts through the Central Bank to control the investment policy of the commercial banks.  The establishment of the Investment Board provides some evidence that this may be done, but its power seems to be largely advisory and I think the crisis demands very urgently that power must be used to control the investment policy of the commercial banks.  I think that step is as necessary to short-term interim planning as it is to long-term planning for ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say simply that, as part of my request to the Government to initiate immediately large scale unemployment relief schemes, I would urge that in order to do so they should relax the credit squeeze, where relaxation is necessary in order to promote employment and, secondly, that they should take immediate steps, acting in consultation with the Central Bank, to control the direction of policy of investment of the commercial banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the remarks made by the last Senator who spoke on this question of unemployment.  The reason I do so is that I am afraid the Government have <Col N="102" /> no policy whatever to deal with the serious unemployment situation we have in the country to-day.  The figure for unemployment has reached 88,500, which is a near record for this country. When we consider and examine that position and compare it with what the Government once told us, that they had a plan for the relief of unemployment, I am afraid that the present Government stands indicted.</P>
      <P>While I have referred to the figure for unemployment, it is also right to refer to the question of emigration from the country, which goes hand in hand with unemployment, because, as everyone knows, the problem of emigration at the present time is much more serious than it has been for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reference to emigration in the question which has been raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that the figure for unemployment would be much greater, were it not for the fact that there are people leaving this country by the thousand as a result of unemployment.  When they cannot get work here, there is no alternative left to them but to emigrate. Therefore, the figure would be much greater, as I said, were it not for the fact that we have increased emigration.</P>
      <P>The Senator has referred to relief schemes.  While they in themselves would be welcome, still anyone must be prepared to admit that, while these relief schemes may relieve the situation for the time being, it would be far better if the Government would promulgate some comprehensive policy to deal with the entire question.  The people of the country expect it and are looking forward to something being done by the Government, but I myself firmly believe at the present time that the people of the country realise that there is only one remedy to solve this situation which has been referred to by the Senator &mdash; and that is a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that, on this Adjournment debate I should as briefly as possible express the very great concern of the whole Labour <Col N="103" /> movement at the increasing unemployment in this current month.  I am conscious of the fact that the trade union movement last autumn gave a warning to the Government that, unless remedial action were taken, unemployment would likely reach 90,000 or 100,000 in the new year.  I am very sorry that the forecast appears likely to be realised.  I understand that the provisional United Trade Union movement has sought an immediate meeting with the Government on the matter and in those circumstances I do not wish to anticipate any points they would make.</P>
      <P>However, I would make two points very quickly.  I would reiterate the point I made previously to the Minister for Finance, namely, that the levies have largely accomplished their objective and they should be quickly looked at again, in so far as they affect employment.  The second point is that touched upon by Senator McHugh.  It is that semi-State undertakings should be called upon immediately by the Government to put in hand quickly a capital programme.  I understand that most of those undertakings have capital programmes which have been pigeonholed.  Now is the time to draw them out, to &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo; at them, and to give some relief in the unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>If I have made these points very quickly, I trust the Government will be equally quick in doing something along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the raising of this matter.  We are all concerned with the fact that unemployment has reached nearly the 90,000 mark, and equally concerned that 750,000 workers have now gone to bring their skills over to Britain.  I would ask Senators to look about them in this country and ask themselves are there not a thousand tasks and things crying out to be done?  Yet, because no short-term individual profit is to be found in them, these things are not as yet done.  Despite that fact, we have men standing idle and others are leaving to bring their skills, perhaps permanently, elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, that what <Col N="104" /> we ought to do is to plan for the long term profit of the community, to build the schools and go right ahead with it, to create our forests, our co-operative agriculture, our Irish mines &mdash; really Irish mines &mdash; yes, and even the factories, if necessary.  Private enterprise is breaking down in this country and what we require is courageous public planning to take its place.  If this were a desert isle on which we had been shipwrecked and if there were work requiring to be done &mdash; shelter to be put up, food to be gathered, fuel to be collected &mdash; and if hundreds came in from outside, we would welcome them with open arms, and would not ask where the money was to come from before we could put them to work. What we require, then, is a planned economy, not just to &ldquo;give relief&rdquo; or &ldquo;give employment&rdquo;, but to use employment, to use all our resources in manpower and materials, to do the thousand things that need doing in this country to-day, whether or not they can be justified on a short-term, narrow pinchbeck, profit-seeking basis. If private enterprise has failed, as I think it has, let us have the courage to engage in public enterprise, for the public good, set all hands to work and build for the benefit of all the people, the same Workers' Republic for which men like James Connolly lived and fought and died more than 40 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No Senator is more concerned with the problem of unemployment and the growth of unemployment that has overtaken us in the last few months than myself and my colleagues in the Government.  We are deeply concerned with the position and we very deeply sympathise with those who have lost their jobs and those who may think their jobs are in jeopardy. We have spent many anxious hours, days and months in the consideration of this problem over the past 12 very difficult months.  I hope those Senators who are concerned with the problem of unemployment and the finding of a permanent remedy for unemployment, rather than those Senators who make political points against the Government, will accept from me the fact that we are deeply concerned with this <Col N="105" /> problem and are bending every energy we have to finding a permanent solution to it and to dealing with the immediate situation so far as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane said the Government have no policy.  We have a policy and it has been given to the country and accepted by the country.  It is the policy which I announced on 5th October last.  The trouble about that policy is that it is long-term in its nature, but it is not a long-term policy such as Senator McHugh has in mind. That is something to which consideration can be given hereafter.  But we have the immediate problem and the long-term problem that would spread over five, six or ten years, and then we also have the longer long-term problem referred to by Senator McHugh.</P>
      <P>We have had to deal with a very difficult situation in the past 12 months. We have had economic problems of great complexity to deal with, and some of those problems, I think, we have handled with some degree of success.  So far as unemployment is concerned, I indicated in very broad outline as Senator McHugh has said, our concern in the speech I made in Cork on Saturday night, but he did not have the text before him at the time.  Perhaps Senators will pardon me if I quote just a few lines from that speech.  What I then said was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The increase in unemployment which has taken place in recent months &mdash; due, in part, to external causes &mdash; is a matter for great anxiety.  Our programme has been designed to promote expanded production and increased employment; and, as an interim measure, the Government have, notwithstanding the present difficulties, taken special steps to make available a sum of £1,000,000 for works of a productive character.  We are now examining, with anxious care, the extent to which that decision has had time to become effective and, generally, the present and immediately prospective situation regarding unemployment. Any real and lasting reduction in unemployment must, however, be based on national development. National development, whether private <Col N="106" /> or public, cannot take place without increased investment and increased investment in its turn must be matched by increased savings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that extract from the speech I made in Cork is sufficient to indicate here the Government's attitude.</P>
    <P>The £1,000,000 referred to in that speech &mdash; I think Senator McHugh misinterprets the application of that £1,000,000 &mdash; was made available by the Government on 20th November last year at a time when we had very serious financial difficulties to overcome, but, notwithstanding the fact that there were such serious financial difficulties and the very great difficulty in getting money, we made available that sum of £1,000,000 for the relief of unemployment.  That was allocated towards specific items.  Senators will, perhaps, pardon me if I give the list because, from what Senator McHugh has said, I think he does not understand how that £1,000,000 was applied.</P>
    <P>The purposes for which that sum was allocated were:&mdash;</P>

    <P>That was the £1,000,000 which we made available at the end of November for the purpose of allowing work to be proceeded with which would be, as far as possible, productive and which would give employment.  I think that the dissemination of that £1,000,000 over these purposes has not yet taken its full effect, and because of that, I think that, included in the figures for unemployment given at present, there <Col N="107" /> are some people who will be absorbed into work when that £1,000,000 takes effect.</P>
    <P>I admit straightway that is only a palliative: that it is only something to get over the difficulty in which we found ourselves in the autumn and the beginning of the winter this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think there was any such reduction.  This £1,000,000 for those specific works which I have enumerated is there, and nothing can be taken from that.  I know of certain works which have not yet started or which have started only within the last few days.  That is but an interim measure.  Our policy was propounded in the speech I made on 5th October last year, a policy of production, a policy designed to increase productivity and production so as to give permanent employment and thus to help towards reducing the adverse balance of our international payments.</P>
      <P>We have, then, the long-term policy outlined in my speech of 5th October last year.  We have the interim arrangement of £1,000,000 to meet the difficult situation which exists at the present time.  We have to arrange for the capital programme for next year, and we believe, as I have already said &mdash;and I think it will be accepted by everybody &mdash; that the only real way to furnish any permanent solution for unemployment is to expand production. That is what I said in Cork.</P>
      <P>Now we have to deal with the question of the capital programme for next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we really want to achieve and the only thing that is really worth while achieving is a permanent increase in employment based on an expansion of productive capital investment. This capital investment can only proceed at the rate at which the community <Col N="108" /> are prepared to support it. That is one of the reasons why we insist so much on savings.  It is not so much a question of the Government providing employment: rather is it a question of its being up to the community themselves, by their action and support, to do everything in their power to help the national economy to expand and thus create a progressive increase in the opportunities available for productive employment.</P>
    <P>Because of our anxiety in this matter of unemployment and because of the necessity we feel to deal with it in an orderly way, the decision was taken and announced by the Minister for Finance some time ago to bring forward the capital Budget by two months.  An early settlement of our detailed proposals for the capital Budget next year will enable the bodies concerned to see very much earlier than they have been ever enabled before where they are going. The completion of the arrangements for financing that capital programme will make possible the smooth working of that programme during the coming year because of that early announcement. Once a decision is taken on that very important matter and the capital programme for next year announced, it will be possible to proceed with economic developments on other fronts. In considering the capital programme we have to deal with a problem which is one not merely of determining the amount of the capital programme itself but also of ensuring that the community will provide the necessary resources to support such a programme.</P>
    <P>We have already given anxious and very urgent consideration to the outline of this capital Budget.  The Capital Investment Advisory Committee is sitting this week: I think it sat to-day. We have made arrangements that we will have a report from them within a matter of, I think, a week or so, at the latest.  When we get that advice from that committee, the Government will consider it and take policy decisions on it.  The general lines of policy having been determined, we propose to have discussions with the trade unions and other interests concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> As I said a few moments ago, we approach the consideration and formulation of the capital programme with the conviction that it must be done in an urgent but orderly way.  Only by formulating it in an orderly way can the economic difficulties really and effectively be dealt with, with some hope of long-term success and with the basic confidence which is the necessary foundation for economic activity.</P>
    <P>May I interpolate here what I said in Cork that some of our difficulties arise from causes such as the shortage of petrol but that others are caused by our own internal stresses?  Furthermore, this period of the year &mdash; January &mdash;is the period when there is the peak of unemployment.  Thas has been the experience over a large number of years&mdash;that it is in January and perhaps February that the peak of unemployment comes and that it tends to go down, in normal circumstances, over the following months.  We hope that that reduction in unemployment will be accelerated.  At all events, we have the £1,000,000 and the long-term programme which I outlined and which the Government took steps to implement with as great speed as possible.</P>
    <P>We still have the problem of the immediate difficulties and of dealing with people who are now out of employment. I do not think Senator Kissane's point is worth bothering about, but he said that the figures now are greater than they were ever before. In that connection, I would refer <Col N="110" /> Senators to the figures for the year 1953 and, having done so, I will pass on.  We are fully conscious of the necessity for dealing with the matter on an immediate, interim and a long-term basis.  I have given the immediate basis &mdash; £1,000,000.  The long-term basis was outlined by me in the speech I made on the 5th October last, which has been carried out by the measures passed by the Oireachtas in the last few weeks, so far as it has been possible to carry it out in so short a time.</P>
    <P>As I said in Cork, we are examining with anxious care the extent to which the decision to give the £1,000,000 has had time to become effective and generally the present and immediately prospective situation regarding unemployment. We are concerned to see that the immediate problem is dealt with so far as is possible.  We are endeavouring to see what further can be done to relieve immediately unemployment, with special reference to the building industry, including the bringing forward of certain schemes which would ordinarily be charged on the capital programme of next year.  I have indicated the fact that we are deeply concerned with this problem and that we are doing the best any Government can do to meet a very anxious and trying situation.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 17th January, 1957.</P>
