      <P>The few remarks I have to make will be directed towards the problem of increased agricultural production.  It has been said many times, and it cannot be said too often, that the salvation of this country lies in increasing agricultural production.  Last night I referred to progeny testing of pigs.  This is a matter which is about to come into its own and not one minute too soon.  We should pay more attention to progeny testing in the insemination centres.  We have some valuable animals in these centres and we probably have some others that are not so good.  It would be a good job to segregate them and to breed only from the best.</P>
      <P>Cattle raising is the most important branch of our agricultural industry. The raising of stores is considered by the experts to be the least profitable undertaking in farming.  They think that dairying, sheep raising and tillage are more profitable than the raising of stores, but, at the same time, the value of our store trade is very big.  It is the biggest trade we have and if we could direct our minds towards lowering the costs of producing stores, it would be a very useful effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our grazing problem is not approached in a proper way.  If we could extend our grazing season at both ends, both early and late in the year, and could make better hay and silage, we would be doing a lot to turn out our store cattle as forward stores at the age of about two years.  If we could do that it would certainly be a step in the right direction.  We sent <Col N="528" /> £4,000,000 worth of cattle to the Continent last season.  It was well for us we had that market because otherwise the bottom would have fallen out of the cattle business here.  The peculiar thing about it is that Great Britain appears to have sent £12,000,000 worth of cattle to the same market. That is something I do not understand, but the figures go to show that it is so. It is something that should be examined.  There is no reason why we should not obtain a bigger slice of that market, provided it is profitable, and it must be profitable when Britain is exporting to it.</P>
    <P>We have had some experiments in calf rearing in West Limerick and North Cork.  As a result of these experiments, a remedy was found for white scour in calves.  As a result of that remedy, a large number of calves have been reared that would otherwise have died.  White scour has been prevalent among our cattle since the introduction of creameries away back in the early part of the century.  A Dane was brought over to this country to unravel the mystery of the disease but he did not have very much success. However, in 1952, these experiments in West Limerick and North Cork provided the answer.  Nobody now need lose a calf because of that terrible disease which was prevalent in Limerick and Cork, but which also obtained in other areas.</P>
    <P>The sheep population of this country has increased very considerably in recent years.  That is probably due to the increased price available for mutton.  While we spend a good deal of money in providing sires for our live stock, for our horses in particular, very little is done for the sheep except in the congested areas.  Sires are sent into the congested areas, but, as far as I know, no sires are otherwise available.</P>
    <P>Another source of worry to the sheep farmer is the stray dog worrying his sheep.  This results in a great loss to the farmer.  Nobody near a town or city will engage in sheep farming because of the danger of stray dogs around the cities and towns, most of them probably not fed.  In other countries, dogs must have a strap around <Col N="529" /> the neck with the name of the owner inserted in that strap.  The dog licensing laws here are too lax, and it would be hard to estimate the loss to the sheep farmer because of this laxity.</P>
    <P>The coming harvest is likely to be a very big one.  Loans up to £2,500,000 have been made available for drying and storage.  I presume these loans are available to merchants and other people engaged in the buying and selling of grain.  It would be a great advantage if similar facilities were made available to the farmer.  If the farmer were in a position to dry his grain and store it, it would be a big incentive for him to go into pig raising and pig fattening.  It would also encourage him to feed his live stock better in the winter period.</P>
    <P>The development of seed growing is very important.  Holland derives a very large revenue from the growing of seeds of various kinds.  Only small efforts are being made here to produce good grass and cereal seeds.  Last year we imported 10,000 tons of seed barley to the value of £500,000.  We could easily save that amount by growing this seed barley ourselves.  At one time Scotch seed potatoes were the rage in this country, but our experts found out that our own seed potatoes were a better proposition and then, instead of importing seed potatoes from Scotland, we actually exported them to Scotland.  It might be found also that seeds of different types grown by ourselves might be better than those we import from other countries. If the Dutch people derive a big revenue from seed growing, I see no reason why we cannot do it here.  It may be that the Dutch climate is somewhat better, but the Dutch farmer is no better than many of our farmers who do go in for seed growing in a small way.</P>
    <P>We have greatly increased our advisory services and let us hope that increased production will follow.  There must be several places along the coastline where horticultural crops such as early potatoes, cauliflowers, black-currants, strawberries and cabbage may be grown.  Cottiers and small-holders could be encouraged to go in <Col N="530" /> for these types of crops.  There are plenty of cross-Channel markets, I believe, but if these crops were grown on a very large scale the provision of transport would be a problem.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our principal industry and everything should be subservient to it.  I shall conclude by repeating what I said at the start, that the salvation of this country lies in increased agricultural production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Appropriation Bill is a very important measure for this House because it is the only medium through which we can express our judgment on how the Government spends the money which it is authorised by Parliament to collect from the taxpayers.  I am sure every member of the House must feel that he has an obligation to pass judgment on the value given to the country from the way this money is distributed.  The sum to be spent by the central Government is very large, approximately £129,000,000, and it is exclusive of other funds which they propose to use by way of capital investment and disregards those other moneys which the ratepayers contribute to their local authorities for the maintenance of local services.</P>
      <P>There is the general view, which has been expressed already here, that this sum is so large that we must study ways by which it can be reduced.  I wish I could see how that could be done.  At any time the amount of money which a Government will spend must be related to the competence of the people to pay.  If our personal incomes and the total national income were higher, if our earnings were larger, our ability to carry this load would be relatively greater and we would feel less oppressed by the weight and the size of the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that this debate gives the opportunity to members of this House of saying what they feel about how our competence to carry this burden of taxation could be improved. That is the real problem for the future. While we may at times express the pious wish that we should cut expenditure, who of us can see the possibility of that being achieved anywhere?  The <Col N="531" /> national Government certainly give no evidence that we can have faith in the possibility of this being accomplished. Those of us who are members of local authorities have to admit our inability to achieve it.</P>
    <P>In this country we are perplexed by many problems.  Sometimes, some of our young men say that our failures, whatever they are, are the result of a lack of leadership.  It is often difficult to determine what they mean by this phrase &ldquo;lack of leadership&rdquo;.  Perhaps they have one definition and we have another.  I think it is important for the country's future that the members of the Oireachtas, no matter on what side of the House they may be or of which House they may be members, should not be slow in expressing their views and in giving out what is in their minds as to what the policy of the country should be in the future. They all must have views, and in so far as they have views, they should try to give them; they should be courageous enough to express them, even though they may not be popular.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious that the country should develop, that greater progress should be made.  Many members of this House and of the other House, and many people in the country who have never entered either Chamber, have made considerable contributions in their day and generation to create conditions which would enable us to make national progress.  We have not succeeded in doing all the things which, as young men, we had hoped to achieve when we were reading <i>Nationality</i>, and other organs of opinion, away back in the early years of this century.  However, we cannot take the line that we have failed to do any of the things we set out to achieve, because that would not be true.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing above another which the people in this generation must display, it is faith in the country's future.  They must take some pride in what they themselves have accomplished in their day and generation. Again, I say, no matter what our beliefs may have been, we cannot go around the country to-day without seeing <Col N="532" /> evidence of progress as compared with the conditions as we knew them as young men.  There is a great deal to be done, but in what country is there still not a great deal to be done?  We came late into the race; we were an oppressed, subject people for many centuries and even yet you will find people who do not believe they are free, who behave as if they were still slaves and who still are not inclined to make the necessary effort for the betterment of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We have not available to us in this country all the knowledge, all the techniques, all the information which were at the disposal of the leaders of opinion in other countries, and if we have not made the best use of our opportunities in our time, we should not be too hard on ourselves because, after all, here we did what even the most forward thinking and informed peoples did not do.  We learned the hard way.  Just as now, there were many people lying along our path then ready to throw stones and to discourage us.  These people are with us still.  I do not want to dwell any longer on that aspect of our problem.  We must accept it and realise that it is there.  All I want to say in this, and I want to support Senator Mullins in what he said last night: in my view, the first essential in national development in this or any other country is the establishment and maintenance of order.</P>
    <P>You cannot have progress where there is any semblance of disorder.  It must be clear and plain to all that there must be justification for men and women having confidence in the future of their country and that the justification which they require most is that they should see around them evidence of peace, order and the competence of the people to maintain order.  Personal behaviour at times is something which has to be regulated.  If you come to the point, as apparently we have come to it to-day, when there is an organised effort on the part of a group of people to disrupt order and peace and therefore to hinder progress, that is something which must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is something which we must all face.  As far as I am concerned, I must pass unfavourable judgment upon it <Col N="533" /> because it does the nation a great wrong.  It is a betrayal of the people who died for this country.  It is preventing those who have their hands at the helm to-day from doing what the country needs most.  Goodness knows, the time of Ministers and of the forces of the State should not be taken up at this moment in trying to maintain peace between ourselves.  What is this but a confirmation of all the things that were said against us when the conqueror was with us?  They said they had to stay here to keep us apart because we could not live together in peace, because we could not be trusted.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, I commend to the House the words of Senator Mullins last evening.  I say, with regret, that it is difficult to determine why the present position should be so.  It is disquieting to see a number of young men, the credentials of some of whom at least could hardly be challenged when one knows the stock from which they come, who seem to believe that we can do more to bring about the reunification of this country by shedding blood than by preaching the doctrine of peace and charity.  Well, a great deal of blood has been shed in the world even in our generation, and somehow it does not seem to have made much contibution to the unification of the human race.  Neither will it be a solution for our problem here.</P>
    <P>I said previously in this House that what we have to achieve is the conquest of the minds of those who are separated from us.  Dead people are no good to us in the building up of the future Ireland.  Along that course there is no hope of success.  As I asked already, why should it be so? Why young men should think like this is something on which we should examine our consciences.  What contribution have we ourselves made to the formation of that type of mind?  I shall not try to pass judgment on that point now, but if that problem is to be resolved, we must study the considerations that have led to the creation of that type of mind.</P>
    <P>Are those people poorly informed? Do they not know what it is to be a real patriot?  Have they not thought and discussed among themselves what <Col N="534" /> consideration these actions of theirs are likely to make towards the betterment of the people as a whole and towards the forwarding of the ideal we all have at heart&mdash;the reunification of the country?  These questions require to be studied.  In our generation, we read and studied.  Perhaps we did not have as much time and opportunity as was desirable, but at least we had the gospel preached to us, through the columns of <i>Nationality</i>, by Griffith and others.  We had a job of work to do and we knew that when that was accomplished, there was still a problem left.  We educated ourselves and we educated each other.  We knew where we were going and that a very high price had to be paid.</P>
    <P>I sometimes think that enough has not been done to give the same sound, solid basis to the education of the young men who came after us, and that waywardness and lack of appreciation and understanding of the things that go to make for the sure development of a nation are not appreciated by them.  Perhaps the fault is very largely ours.  I shall not go any further along that road to-day, but I do think that we will not resolve the problem by any sledge-hammer blows at the moment.  We must face the problem as we see it now.</P>
    <P>We know that when the Danes established their independent Government they had at their disposal their folk schools where the minds of their young men were trained in the history of their country and in its potential economic development.  There were a number of combinations; a number of factors were brought together, all of which were essential for the full development of their national life.  Their foundations were broadly and strongly based.  Any of us who gives a moment's thought to the problem confronting us in the maintenance of order and peace must come to the conclusion that we have been negligent and that we are reaping the whirlwind.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister at some stage would like to make a statement on the present position which confronts the Government.  It is a matter on which I would not press the Minister.  At the same time, I <Col N="535" /> think that everyone who has a view on this matter should express that view. The general expression of popular and public opinion as to what is right and wrong, as to how the national interests can best be served, as to how the maintenance of democratic government is to be continued and sustained in this country, should not be left in abeyance.  I have a feeling it might be a very good thing at the moment if the Government's policy on this matter, if their justification for their actions, were reiterated.  Nobody would then be left in any doubt.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Callaghan, Donegan and others addressed themselves mainly to the problem which confronts us in regard to the country's economic future &mdash;the problem of the fuller development of our agricultural resources.  As I said earlier, the possibility of this Government or of any succeeding Government presenting us with an Appropriation Bill containing a lower amount than that contained in this Bill is very remote.  If that be the position, if we are to see fewer people gainfully employed, if the national income is not rising, the increased expenditure will bear more heavily on people and therefore the standard of living will be lowered and the future, from that angle, will not be bright.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have within our shores the potential for a greatly increased national income.  The income on the land is increasing for more reasons than one.  Prices are higher and on many farms there is more productivity. One cannot help observing, as one goes along the roads throughout the country, the development that has taken place in regard to grass crops. The improvement is fantastic when compared with results a few years ago on some of our farms.</P>
    <P>The whole problem of agricultural output and production is the key to our future living standards.  A number of things require to be done.  I am sure when the Minister for Agriculture comes in with his Bill for the setting up of the new agricultural research organisation, the opinion will be expressed that one of the first studies that should be made is research into the minds of so many of our farmers <Col N="536" /> who have not up to date embraced the modern techniques and scientific knowledge that are available to them and ready to hand to serve them, if only they are employed.  That is something I cannot understand, something to which there is no obvious answer, and it is at the root of our problem in regard to agricultural development.  It is the first problem to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The research organisation will be an excellent thing to bring in young men and train their minds and give them an opportunity of absorbing the information which other countries have collected through study and research so that our men can go on building on that; but those of us who have made any attempt to avail of the scientific knowledge which has been to hand for some years cannot but be depressed by the evidence that so many of our neighbours are making no effort whatever to employ these modern methods which are available to them as to others.</P>
    <P>We must make knowledge of these methods available throughout the country.  It is our major problem, our first problem to be tackled.  It was there when the present Minister for Finance was Minister for Agriculture; it was there in the days of his successor and whether the present Minister will solve it or not I do not know, but on its solution by some Minister for Agriculture depends our future agricultural output, our national income level, our taxable capacity and our ability to carry a much higher Appropriation Bill than we have to-day.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the different branches of agriculture because Senator O'Callaghan and Senator Donegan did that to some extent.  I know at the moment there is present in the minds of many people in the country the notion that if the Government and the country decide to become part of the European Free Trade Area it will solve many of our agricultural problems.  I agree completely with the Minister for Agriculture that it will not solve any of them; that we are, perhaps, going into a wider market but one which is just as highly competitive as that into which we have been trying to pour our products down <Col N="537" /> the years and at the present time.  It is futile to think that the Danes will not be in that market, and the Dutch and the Swedes as well.  We know our competence to compete with the Danes, and when we hear Senator O'Brien tell us about the plight of Danish economy at the moment, when they have to borrow from the International Bank at a very high rate of interest to maintain equilibrium in their balance of payments, notwithstanding their 700 or 800 gallon cows, their 2½ or 3 lb. of meal to make 1 lb. of meat on pigs, their high poultry production and all the rest, we must remember that it is those people that we shall have to compete with in the Free Trade Area and that is not as simple as many champions of the European free trade notion would like us to accept.</P>
    <P>We shall have to solve our problems on our own farms, each one of us for ourselves in the first instance.  Then, having raised our productivity through utilisation of known scientific techniques that are already at hand, we must proceed to decide how we can handle the problem of the sale and marketing of these products.  It will not be any easier for us than it is for our competitors, whether Danes, or New Zealanders or Australians.  We will still have our competitors pouring their goods into world markets&mdash; Argentine beef, New Zealand butter and whatever else it may be.  There is no easy road or simple method by which we can solve our economic problems.  It is better that we should face that and see how far we can go in practice towards proving that we can solve our own problems in the hard way.</P>
    <P>If that is not possible, the pessimists will be justified.  I am convinced there are people within our shores who do not want to see this State succeed. They are critical of it, some for one reason and some for another.  It is not a pleasant thing to say and I do not want to adduce the arguments which I believe would be very convincing, but I am satisfied that it is so.  Those of us who do not want to see these prophets justified and who are convinced there is every justification for faith in the future and that the Irish <Col N="538" /> race is not a failure want to see steps taken by the Government and the people themselves which will give the lie to these prophets of evil.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Mullins made a valuable contribution in a variety of topics in his speech last night. Although he sits on the Government side, he was not slow to criticise Government services.  It is a good thing we have reached that point.  It shows forward thinking and it ought to be appluaded, no matter from whom it comes.  That is the road to reconstruction.</P>
    <P>He had a good many things to say about the Irish language.  He did not dwell at great length on the whole scheme of education.  I think, in relation to our national life, the time has come when we must study anew the impact of the methods we have adopted in trying to restore the language and in our whole scheme of education.  Perhaps the time has come to study whether or not the type of education being given is the best type in our circumstances.  Are there defects in our scheme of education to-day which are responsible for the existing conditions in the country?  I have a feeling that if a body of people were got together and given new and original terms of reference to study this position in relation to the known facts of our national life, they might make recommendations to us which in a way would be revolutionary, but in fact would be the key to the problem of the better education of our young people.  They would ensure that when these young people put their hands to the wheel, they would have at their disposal information and knowledge and the patriotic enthusiasm that does not seem to be present in the minds of many of our young people at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is just one further comment I want to make and I have referred to this matter in this House on a number of occasions.  I have never found much support and I do not know why.  One of the difficulties in dealing with Irishmen is that you have to be trying something new.  It is very hard to keep them on the old path, just doing the old things that their fathers did before <Col N="539" /> them.  There is that sort of adventurous spirit which urges young men to go out into new paths and conquer new territory.  Some of them think they can conquer the Six Counties or the people of the Six Counties by certain methods which do not commend themselves to me as an Ulsterman.  But there is something else we ought to attempt to conquer and which I believe would stir the imagination of our people if it were faced up to in the proper way.</P>
    <P>There are Connaught men here.  I have spoken on this matter here before and I could never understand the silence of the Connaught men on this problem.  We have in this country something around 1,000,000 acres of peat.  There is no other country in Europe with that vast area available to the people who have left it untouched. A good deal of the land of Holland, the finest in Europe to-day, is built up from their peat soils.  So also is it in Sweden.</P>
    <P>We want to conquer new territory; we want to add to the area of our estate.  We have 1,000,000 acres of peat available to us which would make as fine productive soil as anything in the County Meath.  I have gone to see what Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have done and I do not know why other people have not done the same.  I have asked dozens of people, who, I would have thought, would have known everything and have been as enthusiastic as I was, but they had not seen that scheme.  You can see where they have taken in thousands of acres of peat land and grown on it grass just as good as anything I have seen on the plains of Meath.</P>
    <P>Capital investment is necessary, but they have the known techniques available to them.  We could build new homes for hundreds and hundreds of people.  We could give an opportunity to the pioneers to go out and do this work.  They would have great machines at their disposal.  If the problem were tackled with the courage, imagination and determination the managing director of the sugar company has shown on a somewhat smaller scale, it would <Col N="540" /> give our people a new approach to the future of their country.</P>
    <P>Any small country in Europe to-day would be charmed to have available to if the possibility of conquering 1,000,000 acres of new soil.  I have urged here before, and I put it to the Minister now, that there ought to be established in this State something like a soil utilisation authority, to study all our known resources and see how best they could be utilised.  You have a position where Bord na Móna is here and is there, and in between there is nothing but waste.  I think that should be studied and organised in an orderly way.  Bord na Móna have done a tremendous job.  The country is proud of their work, and rightly so.  It may have its critics, about some of the things done and how they were done. Nevertheless, I have had foreigners across the bogs and have shown them &mdash;British members of Parliament&mdash;and they just could not believe Irishmen were capable of doing that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I would like to see order in the development of our resources and, before we go too long in bits and patches, creating a sort of patchwork quilt which you cannot get ever as a common whole again, I think the situation should be studied.</P>
    <P>I recommend that point of view to the Minister.  No more than Senator Hayes or others, I do not like the size of the bill we have to meet, but I cannot make any comment as to how it could be reduced.  All I can do is voice my opinion and judgment as to how the people of the country could be made more capable of bearing the burdens they are being called upon to bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, at the outset, that I think we all have sympathy with the Minister for Finance in having to sit through a debate in which practically every subject under the sun is regarded as relevant and in which all the Departments and their various sins of omission and commission can be reviewed, while he has to sit patiently and endeavour eventually to deal with each point.  It is a pity in a way that in this House we have not the opportunity of dealing with the Estimates <Col N="541" /> one by one, so that one might hear a particular Minister on his Department, as they do in the Dáil, but I recognise that in practice that would be exceedingly difficult.  We have to do the best we can with this Appropriation Bill debate.  Those of us concerned with a number of things will, I hope, be forgiven &mdash; as I personally forgave Senator Mullins last night&mdash;if we range the field, as it were, because the number of topics is vast and this is our major opportunity to speak about them.</P>
      <P>I intend, in the main portion of my speech, to concentrate principally on one Vote, the Vote for the Department of Education; but I would like to start by saying something about what several Senators have mentioned, the recent decision&mdash;the reluctant decision, I am sure&mdash;of the Government to reopen the internment camp at the Curragh and to place young Irishmen&mdash; and women, presumably&mdash;in detention there, if they are convinced that they are acting in such a way as to prevent the preservation of the peace.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter said, and I think he is right, that those of us who have opinions on this matter should express them.  I am glad that I seem to have converted Senator Baxter to this view, because when in December, 1955 I put down a motion and proposed it, approving of the general tenor of the Taoiseach's statement about the I.R.A. but regretting that he had not yet taken active measures to prevent the recruiting and drilling of private armies in this country, I regret to say that no Senator supported me and no Senator even seconded the motion.  That was at a time when county councils throughout the country were recklessly passing votes expressing sympathy with the relatives of unfortunate young men who got killed or injured in this kind of affray, instead of making it clear that public opinion, as it now is, I think, was opposed to this method of trying to end Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see, then, that the Seanad now, and the Dáil have reached the point of virtually unanimous support for the Government on its action in this regard.  Without in any way taking any pleasure in the <Col N="542" /> fact that this internment camp has had to be brought into use again, we all feel, and we must feel, that we cannot allow in this country a private army, two private armies, three private armies, to be running, and to be dictating the policy of the country to the Government.</P>
    <P>I recognise, and I think we would all recognise, that these young men and women are idealists, and are not in this for what they can get out of it. They are inspired by ideals which one would like to see more widely inspiring people to activity&mdash;but they are inspired to the wrong kind of activity by such ideals.  They are wrong-headed, misdirected, anti-democratic, because they refuse to accept the will of the people, which is represented&mdash;I like to believe and I think we all do&mdash;by the two Houses of the Oireachtas, against which the printed speeches and utterances of many of these people inveigh. I would like to say here at the outset that I confidently hope that these people will be treated in the most scrupulous manner.  It is not our purpose to victimise them, to allow beating up in police barracks, to allow any departure from the strict letter of the law.  I would be in favour also of granting them full political treatment in internment, but they must be prevented from continuing to disrupt the peace of the country in what I can only regard as an insensate way.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many of them say that they are in the tradition of 1916, that &ldquo;the only things we ever got in this country were got by force&rdquo; and that 1916 was successful because it used force.  But they seem to fail to see the fallacy of that.  After all, one of the main things we got in 1916 was the right to elect our own Houses of Parliament in this country, yet these two major symbols of what we won in 1916 are not in fact recognised by those young men of the I.R.A. and of Sinn Féin.  When they say that &ldquo;all we ever got was got by force,&rdquo; they are failing to recognise as good the things that in fact we did get arising out of 1916.</P>
    <P>These people refuse to recognise our law courts and refuse to recognise the Dáil.  They refuse even to plead in our <Col N="543" /> courts, and it is possible they may refuse even to appear before the commission to which they have a right of appeal.  They refuse to recognise our army and want an army of their own. How many sections of this community are we to permit to have armies of their own?  I am not, in fact, in favour of any armies, I do not like the military spirit and I do not like the army; but if we must have a minimum token official force, let it be the only one.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred, rightly, to the possibility that not all of the blame lies on these young men.  I would develop that for a moment, and say that I think the blame lies at least in part on the shoulders of many of our political leaders over the past 20 or 30 years, who found it much easier on political platforms to avoid the problems of poverty, disease, health and education, by talking about Partition, as if the only thing preventing this country going forward was the fact that we were partitioned.  I believe that that was dishonestly used by many people as an excuse for failure to grapple with our real problems.  The young men who are now taking action believed much of what was told them by the leaders of all political Parties of this country about the &ldquo;terrible results of Partition&rdquo; and of how it prevented us from grappling with our problems&mdash; a quite untrue proposition, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am alone in the country, but I am one of those who remember that in December, 1925, an agreement was signed between the Irish Government of the day and the British Government, which said that, &ldquo;being resolved mutually to aid one another in a spirit of neighbourly comradeship, hereby agree as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) The powers conferred by the proviso to Article XII of the said articles of agreement of the commission therein mentioned are hereby revoked, and the extent of Northern Ireland for the purposes of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and of the said articles of agreement shall be such as was fixed by subsection <Col N="544" /> (2) of Section 1 of that Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. That was the agreement which consolidated the present Partition of Ireland &mdash;the present Border, the present division.  I think it is dishonest of us to forget that not merely was that agreement signed, but it was ratified by both Houses of this Oireachtas.  It was ratified in the Dáil by 71 votes to 20.  I think it is worth mentioning that, although at that time there were absentionist Deputies to the number of 48, if every one of them had been there and voted against the agreement, the voting still would have been by the majority in the Dáil in favour of that agreement&mdash;an agreement about which, on 7th December, 1925, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave said in the Dáil that Britain had thereby agreed: &ldquo;to close all outstanding questions of controversy&rdquo;.  I may be the only one in the country to remember this agreement.  Many people have been actively and successfully endeavouring to forget it for a very long time, but I think we are in honour bound to remember it.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not believe that agreements are things which cannot be renegotiated, bilaterally reopened.  I do not believe they are to be taken as binding for ever, but I do believe that it is dishonest to pretend that that agreement was not signed and was not ratified by both Houses of our Oireachtas, and that it was not from that agreement that the consolidation of the present boundary stems.  At that time, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins and Mr. E. Blythe sent a telegram to the Irish people asking them to ratify this agreement when it finally came up in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Senator but it is rather difficult to relate that to the Appropriation Bill before us to-day.  I would ask the Senator to keep that fact in mind.  I do not want to reopen a discussion on the history of the country since 1921.</P>

      <P>I recognise that.  I am answering to some extent some of the points that I thought the <Col N="545" /> Leas-Chathaoirleach himself made in his capacity as a Senator in laying part of the blame, perhaps, for the activities of these young men upon our Party political leaders in the past&mdash;&ldquo;upon all of us,&rdquo; I think he stated.  I should like just to be allowed to quote the sentences from this telegram to indicate in what frame of mind this agreement was signed, because the telegram to the Irish people referred to it as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An instrument which provides a same and constructive solution born of a genuine desire for peace between the two nations has been signed.  We bring back an instrument solemnly executed by friendship.  This agreement, accepted in the spirit in which it was negotiated and signed, provides a basis of sure and lasting peace.  We confidently recommend it to the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are old things, but I do not think they should be forgotten things.</P>
      <P>If we intend to alter that agreement, to go back on that agreement, we have a perfect right to do so, but we should negotiate honourably, and not try to pretend that such an agreement was neither signed nor ratified, because it was both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I do not know whether or not it has occurred to many people that, if you are dissatisfied with the way the country is being run in relation to foreign policy or home policy, the thing to do is to start an army.  I do not know whether or not people have realised that that example, if it were to be followed by others&mdash;by the unemployed, for instance&mdash;might have for our whole economy a most disastrous effect.  I would ask some of these young men in the I.R.A. to reflect that they are not the only ones suffering form a sense of injustice, and that, in fact, they may not be those who are suffering most from injustice and that it would be extremely dangerous for the whole country if we were to toss aside our Constitution&mdash;however much we may criticise it or however frustrated we may feel sometimes within its bounds.  It would be dangerous for the whole country if we were to give to <Col N="546" /> every group of citizens the right to take arms privately within the State.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter&mdash;and that brings me to the main thing I want to say to-day&mdash;is, I am afraid, and I think the Leas-Chathaoirleach would agree with me here, that these young men are undereducated and miseducated. They have been badly and, I am afraid, wrongly taught.  I feel that, in relation to this basic question of education, we are not doing our duty in this country.  I am quite certain that in that feeling I am not alone, though possibly some of the criticisms I intend to make would not be shared.  However, the dissatisfaction is general.</P>
    <P>I should like now to relate my remarks to the money voted for the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the reason why a small country like Switzerland, with very little in the way of native raw materials available to it, succeeds in maintaining a very high standard of living for its people&mdash;living, employment and so on&mdash;can be related directly to the Swiss educational system.  I would draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that in practically every Swiss product sold abroad, there is a very high skilled labour content.  Why can we not emulate them?  What prevents us from exporting things with a high skilled labour content?  Why can we not We have the native wit; we have the native intelligence; we have the native skill untapped.  But we do not harness them.  We do not develop them. Therefore, the major field of development for us ought to be the educational field.</P>
    <P>You cannot build skilled technicians without building well-educated masses of people in our ordinary schools.  In that matter, in my opinion, we are falling down lamentably.  Last year, the President of the I.N.T.O., Miss Margaret Skinnider, whom I should very much like to see in this House, and who unfortunately was an unsuccessful candidate in the recent Seanad election, said on one occasion recently that the education which we were able to provide seemed mainly to be designed to produce labourers and <Col N="547" /> maids for the British labour market. It is a lamentable thing that we have not been able to do more for our people in the field of education.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said&mdash;I think his exact words were&mdash;that the time has come to study the whole question.  I would say, with respect, that the time is long past, and I would remind him, and the Seanad, that on 5th May, 1950, a Council of Education was set up to study just the things that he wants studied now.  That council consisted of some 37 members, 16 clergymen and 21 lay men and women.  It was a competent and intelligent body, and its members sat and investigated and took evidence from some 76 individuals and bodies.  They studied precisely the whole question of our education in the primary schools.  They finished their report on 14th May, 1954, and published it in August of that year.  Therefore, I do not think it is a good thing to say here in the Seanad now that the time has come &ldquo;to study the whole problem&rdquo; as to what we should be doing.</P>
    <P>The problem has been studied.  A report has been issued on it, and it has been in the hands of the Government since August, 1954, and this is July, 1957.  I should like to be able to assume that we have all read this report, possibly not both in Irish and English, but at any rate in one of the two languages in which it is printed; but at least we must assume that the officials of the Department of Education have read it and that both the previous Minister for Education and the present Minister for Education have read it.  We must be surprised that no action whatever has been taken arising from it.  I know we were told last year and the previous year that it was necessary to consult certain bodies to find out if the recommendations of these highly reputable people were, in fact, good or not.  We set up a commission; we get their report; they make recommendations and then we refer their recommendations back to a large number of people and bodies, unnamed, to find out whether the recommendations are good or bad.  In the meantime, of course, &ldquo;the Minister can do nothing.&rdquo;  And we get up here <Col N="548" /> and say what a pity we do not study the question of education.</P>
    <P>I should like to consider the question under three main headings and develop them.  Firstly, I should like to consider&mdash;and in relation to our schools, I think it is the point at which one should begin&mdash;the question of personnel, the teachers.  They are the pivot of our schools; later I am going to talk about premises and curricula, but the central point is the teacher. We all know from our experience of learning that what makes a good class is a good teacher; not so much method, as the personality of the teacher.  I believe the teacher should be regarded as an élite in our community and treated as such.  I realise that he is not and I am afraid there is often a very ignorant attitude adopted towards the teacher.  Patrick Pearse said that &ldquo;between the salary offered to teachers and the excellence of our country's educational system, there is a vital connection.&rdquo;  That is the first point: unless you treat your teachers decently, you will not get decent educational standards.</P>
    <P>In relation to the training of teachers, I notice on page 63 of the current report of the Department of Education&mdash;the current report being the report for 1954-55&mdash;figures relating to trained and untrained teachers.  I might say in parenthesis that a national school child coming in a few minutes late to school runs the serious risk of being slapped, with &ldquo;a light rod or cane&rdquo;&mdash;not with a strap, of course; that is forbidden&mdash; but when the Minister brings in his report two or three years late, not just two or three minutes late, that is regarded as being more or less all right. It is regarded as part of the picture, part of the pattern and one shrugs one's shoulders.  It is convenient, incidentally, when you are doing very little, to live as it were on a kind of intellectual overdraft by only referring at the present moment to what you did three or four years ago.  Thus nobody will know until 1959-60 what the Minister is doing now in 1957.</P>
    <P>On page 63 of this report, then, there is a table, No. 18, which gives the number of teachers, trained and <Col N="549" /> untrained, in the service on 30th June, 1955.  I am speaking now about the training of teachers.  The record as regards the male teachers is reasonably good, but the proportion of uncrained women teachers is deplorably high.  I notice, for instance, that the figures for principal teachers among the women is that there were 1,571 trained and 228 untrained.  Two hundred and twenty-eight may not seem a very big number, but these are principal teachers and it represents some 13 per cent. of the total women principal teachers.  A similar percentage is found in the women assistant teachers where you have 485 untrained and 2,746 trained.  When it comes to junior assistant mistresses, however, you find that the percentage of the untrained teachers is very nearly 95 per cent. because there are, of that category, 1,323 untrained and only 70 trained.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is a very good condition of things.  Those figures refer to lay teachers.  At the bottom of the table is a paragraph referring to: &ldquo;Members of religious orders of monks and nuns who are members of the minimum recognised staff required by the regulations in monastery or convent national schools paid by capitation&rdquo;. Among the men, the proportion, while high, is not too high, but I notice even so that there are 207 such male teachers trained and 220 untrained&mdash; that is to say, more than 50 per cent. untrained.  Among the women, there are 1,155 trained and 678 untrained, about 36 per cent.  Down at the bottom of the page, there is a paragraph: &ldquo;In addition, there are supernumerary teachers (chiefly nuns) most of whom are serving in schools paid by capitation&rdquo;. The numbers of such women teachers trained are 157, and untrained 486, about 75 per cent. of that category untrained.</P>
    <P>You will notice the figures are far worse for the women than for the men. They are very startling figures; yet we continue to dismiss women teachers on marriage.  How do we do it?  How can we bring ourselves to insist that the married woman leaves her post upon marriage?  Many such women, I agree, might want to leave, and should of course have the right to leave, but we <Col N="550" /> insist that they leave whether they want to stay on or not, and they are dismissed on marriage.  It is our duty either to see to it that our teachers, or at least a very big proportion of them, are properly trained, or else, until such time as that has been achieved, to retain in the employment of the Department of Education all qualified married women teachers who are prepared to continue teaching. Having said that, I do not want to say any more about personnel for the moment.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the question of premises.  We all know that there are nearly 1,000 primary schools which require either to be completely replaced or reconstructed.  I do not think the word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; is too strong to be applied to them.  The last Minister for Education mentioned that 822 new schools were needed in the country.  A further 161 needed to be reconstructed. I think the recent figure mentioned for building actually being done was about 50 schools a year, so that it will take us something like 20 years to make up this back-log&mdash;provided that no school deteriorates in those 20 years.</P>
    <P>Are we satisfied with this?  Is this what we want?  Are we doing our best? Are we doing what is right and just by our children?  My opinion is that we ought to have an emergency policy for school building.  We ought not to aim immediately now at the great, colossal, palatial school.  We ought to aim at the smaller, temporary and, if you like, provisional, utility, emergency premises, in which the teaching can be maintained at a high standard until such time as we can build adequately. I am afraid that our sense of urgency is not sufficient.  I am also afraid that in some cases we are going in the wrong direction.  We are attempting to build too big and too expensively.</P>
    <P>I saw the other day that one of the biggest schools in Europe was opened in Ballyfermot.  It is obviously a very big school.  It is going to cope with 4,500 children.  I do not know whether we are satisfied that that is the kind of way we want our children to be dealt with.  I am reminded of the phrase of Patrick Pearse when he talks of such mass education as &ldquo;the rapid and cheap manufacture of readymades.&rdquo;<Col N="551" /> I do not believe you can turn out truly educated children from schools containing 4,500 pupils.  I do not believe it is possible.  It would be far better if they were limited to 200 or 300 children.  If we must go beyond that figure, let us not go up to this colossal number which must, with the best will in the world and the best teaching in the world, fail by very reason of the number.</P>
    <P>I notice that there are to be 78 classrooms in this school, which means that for this new school the intention is to have classes of something like 50 children on the average.  That is not proper planning in my opinion.  It is not planning in accordance with the recommendation of the Council of Education.  It cannot produce good results.  I also notice that the school is to cost something like £500,000 to build.  That is to say, over £6,000 per classroom on the average.  I am aware, of course, that there are all kinds of ancillary buildings going with it.  Yet are we getting the best possible value for the money we spend under this Estimate for the building of schools, if we spend, on the average, over £6,000 each to build 78 classrooms?</P>
    <P>On this question of overcrowding and the numbers in classes, the Council of Education has specific things to say. It recommends that the &ldquo;optimum figure&rdquo; in classes ought to be 30.  Yet in &ldquo;one of the most modern schools in Europe&rdquo; we are aiming at an average of about 50.  The Council of Education also say&mdash;I am referring to paragraphs 317, 318 and 319&mdash;that in present circumstances they recognise it will not be possible to get that optimum figure, and that, therefore, the maximum figure which should be put under the charge of a trained teacher is 40.  We are not even aiming at that in these new schools.  Again, the report says: &ldquo;Taking into consideration the needs of the smaller schools, we recommend that the average number of pupils on roll in a one-teacher school should not exceed 25.&rdquo;  Is our present planning in connection with expenditure related in any way to these recommendations? <Col N="552" /> I notice that the I.N.T.O., as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 24th October, 1956, referred to the question of overcrowding of classrooms and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Overcrowding of classrooms in Dublin schools has been a source of worry to teachers for a long time. In some classrooms the number of pupils may be anything from 70 to 80 pupils, and classes of from 60 to 65 are quite a common feature of most schools.</P>
    <P>A spokesman of the I.N.T.O. said yesterday that on several occasions representations had been made to the Department of Education for lower numbers in the classrooms &lsquo;but,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;we have not been able to get anywhere since 1948.&rsquo;...  Teachers think that classes should not be larger than 25 to 30 pupils.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the teachers think.  That is what the Council of Education thinks.  What does the Minister think? What does the Department think? That is the kind of recommendation by the Council of Education into which I should have expected the Department to have made immediate investigations. Since the recommendations were first made, I should have expected that the Department would try to find out whether those figures are true&mdash;classes of 70 and 80.</P>
    <P>I met a national teacher last year who had a class of 57 12-year-old boys, to whom he was supposed to teach every subject.  I have got one 12-year-old boy and another ten-year-old.  Anybody who has sons of that age will recognise that it is quite enough to try to answer the questions of any two of them without having to try to inculcate a knowledge of five or six subjects in them. How do you work with 57 12-year-old boys?  The answer is that any of us, be we ever so patient, might well be driven to resort to physical violence. That is, of course, the basic reason why there is far too much physical violence in our schools, but the fault does not lie with the children.</P>
    <P>If physical violence is the answer to the problem of overcrowded classes, against whom should it be used? Against those responsible.  Far be it from me to suggest physical violence <Col N="553" /> against a Minister with the name of Lynch, but it seems most unfair to me that the children should be the sufferers for conditions the blame for which, wherever it should lie, does not attach to them.  The blame for these conditions lies, in fact, not just upon the Minister, but upon all of us, because it is our society, he is our Minister and it is our Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I noted that last July Deputy McQuillan put down a question in the Dáil to the Minister about overcrowding in Dublin classes.  As I say, I should have expected that at least by 1956 the Minister, who has had recommendations of this kind put before him in 1954, should have been concerned to find out what the facts were, yet the Minister told Deputy McQuillan in the Dáil last July that he did not know the answer to the question.  He just gave him an average figure.  He knew how many school-going children there were in Dublin, and how many classes there were, and dividing one into the other he found that the &ldquo;average&rdquo; was 43 pupils per class.  That &ldquo;average&rdquo; includes classes of 15 and 20.  It also apparently includes classes of 70 and 80.</P>
    <P>But the Minister does not even know the facts.  The Department of Education does not know how many there are in the various classes in our Dublin schools, and, when a Deputy puts down a question, the Minister has in effect to admit: &ldquo;I could not gave the Deputy the answer without sending a special circular to the schools.&rdquo;  The Department of Education has not even got the figures, and has no mechanism for getting the figures, except by getting out a special circular.  So he said in July that, since the schools were about to disband, the Deputy would have to wait until the autumn to get an answer.  Deputy McQuillan, being a persistent Deputy, put down the same question again in October and the Minister said in effect: &ldquo;I am sorry, but we still have not collected all the figures on this.  We have sent a special circular out, but we have not got all the answers.&rdquo;  In fact, the question has never been publicly answered.  The point I am making is that the Minister and his Department are not sufficiently concerned to find <Col N="554" /> out the facts, in their own interest, and, even when the Minister is asked a specific question in the Dáil, he has to send out a special circular.  I do not think that that indicates a serious attitude towards his stewardship of the education of Irish children.</P>
    <P>On the content of our educational system, I believe we are harassed and held back by a preoccupation with what I would call &ldquo;programme disease&rdquo;, a preoccupation with the prescribed course, with the Intermediate Certificate examination, with the prescribed course of reading for Leaving Certificate and so on.  Even where there is not a prescribed course, there is a very narrow interpretation of the kind of things one is likely to be asked.</P>
    <P>Patrick Pearse wrote an essay on education.  I make no apology for quoting it.  He called it&mdash;he was speaking, of course, of the system here under the British Government&mdash;<i>The Murder Machine.</i>  I regret to say that I feel that that appellation is as valid to-day about our educational system in 1957 as it was in 1912.  This is what Patrick Pearse said about &ldquo;the programme&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The idea of a compulsory programme imposed by an external authority upon every child in every school in a country is the direct contrary of the root idea involved in education.  Yet, this is what we have in Ireland.  At the present moment there are 15,000 boys and girls pounding at a programme drawn up by certain persons sitting around a table in Hume Street.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Probably they are not the same persons to-day, but almost certainly it is the same table!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Precisely the same textbooks are being read to-night in every secondary school and college in Ireland ... and the programme bulks so large that there is no room for education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that is what is happening in Ireland to-day.  Yet I believe that what is needed is the encouragement in our children, in primary schools, secondary schools and universities, of originality and not of conformity.  The purpose of education should not be the <Col N="555" /> mere factual indoctrination or &ldquo;informing&rdquo; of the child.  It should be the encouragement in the child of the capacity to think.  I am led to believe that, in practice, the major object of our present educational system is to prevent the children from learning how to think, and I believe that, in that respect, it has been very successful.</P>
    <P>What does Patrick Pearse say on that point?  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is not the precise aim of education to &lsquo;foster&rsquo;&mdash;not to inform, to indoctrinate, to conduct through a course of studies&mdash;but, first and last, to foster the elements of character native to a soul, to help to bring these to their full perfection rather than to implant exotic excellences?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that what we should encourage, therefore, is thought and the capacity to think, thinking processes rather than repetitions and parrot-learning.  I believe we should encourage the critical faculty and not obsequiousness and an externally imposed slavish discipline.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the fact that he thinks there are, perhaps, too many slavish-minded people here. Patrick Pearse felt the same.  Patrick Pearse said that in the ancient pagan republics...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... To the children of the free were taught all noble and goodly things which would tend to make them strong and proud and valiant; from the children of the slaves all such dangerous knowledge was hidden.  They were taught not to be strong and proud and valiant but to be sleek, to be obsequious, to be dexterous: the object was not to make them good men but good slaves.  And so in Ireland.  The educational system here was designed by our masters in order to make us willing or, at least, manageable slaves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How much of that attitude have we to-day originating from those around the table in Hume Street or elsewhere? I believe we should aim, and therein I find myself entirely in agreement with Patrick Pearse, at diversity <Col N="556" /> in our schools and in our children and in our teaching, rather than at uniformity. We should aim at organised recreation, at the encouragement of manual crafts. We should aim at smaller schools, schools with greater individual diversity. We should get away from these colossal schools aiming, as Patrick Pearse said, at &ldquo;the rapid and cheap manufacture of readymades.&rdquo;  We do not want readymade thinking.  We want people to think for themselves, and one element that is essential for that is, of course, the element of freedom. &ldquo;In particular,&rdquo; said Patrick Pearse, &ldquo;I would urge that the Irish schools system of the future&rdquo;&mdash;I like to think that Patrick Pearse in these words is speaking to us to-day in 1957 &mdash;&ldquo;should give freedom, freedom to the individual school, freedom to the individual teacher, freedom, as far as may be, to the individual pupil.  Without freedom there can be no right growth and education is properly the fostering of the right growth of a personality.&rdquo; I believe, therefore, that we should not have all this fetish of examinations and certificates, honours and passes, prescribed courses, and rules and regulations.  I believe that Patrick Pearse was right when he spoke about the necessity for freedom for the teacher, not always hedged round and overlooked as it were by inspectors, however kindly, whose duty it is to see to it that certain regulations are kept to the letter.  Freedom for the individual school: I should like to see the individual school having far more liberty to decide what its programme shall be.  And freedom for the pupil: I believe that we have in our schools, in too many of them, partly due to overcrowding, far too much emphasis upon an externally imposed discipline and far too little upon discipline encouraged to grow from within.</P>
    <P>I shall not go over all the ground again about the beating of children in schools.  The fact is, however, that in our schools to-day there is far too much beating of children for minor offences&mdash;such as what the Minister in his own regulations calls &ldquo;mere failure at lessons.&rdquo;  I am convinced that children have corporal punishment regularly administered to them in a <Col N="557" /> very large number of schools for mere failure at lessons.  I do not suggest that they are wildly or savagely beaten, but I do suggest that they are needlessly beaten far too often in a trivial way for trivial offences.</P>
    <P>It is true that the last Minister reintroduced the strap and then, within ten days, abolished it again; nearly knocked himself out with it, in fact.  I do not think that the present Minister, either, has shown, in his answers in the Dáil, a very clear notion of what his policy is in relation to corporal punishment. He does not really seem to know whether the strap is &ldquo;legal&rdquo; or not. One thing we all do know is that the strap is widely used, and that it is not allowed in fact by the regulations.</P>
    <P>Another thing that we know is that in the future Irish schools foreseen by Patrick Pearse it would not have been necessary to beat Irish children for mere failure at lessons, or for minor offences, or, in fact, I believe, at all.</P>
    <P>Now I want to come to the question of parents.  A great deal is spoken about the parents' rights, but very little active recognition is given to the parents' rights.  I believe very profoundly that the Council of Education are right in paragraph 334 when they urge a very large measure of active co-operation with each local school by the parents.  I believe that it could be of the greatest benefit to those running the school, the manager, the principal teacher, the teachers, if there were a regularly-meeting parent-teacher organisation for each school.  That does not mean that the parents would be coming in telling the teachers how to do their job.  In fact, it might well result very frequently in the teachers telling the parents how to do their job; and why not?  Would not such discussions be fruitful?</P>
    <P>What I do believe is that if teachers and parents were grouped together around the school, in the school, meeting regularly, discussing not merely complaints and grievances but how they could co-operate locally for the good of the school, it would be infinitely precious for our educational system, and I should like to see our Department of Education encouraging <Col N="558" /> the setting up and maintenance of such groups for regular discussion between parents and teachers and the manager in relation to every primary school in the country.</P>
    <P>Now I want to come to the question, which has been mentioned by several Senators, of the teaching of Irish. Senator Hayes said that he thought perhaps we ought to reassess the position. Senator Baxter said something similar, I think.  We ought to inquire at this stage how far we have been successful, and, if we have not been as successful as we had hoped, should we not retrace our steps and find out whether the methods we have been using have been good, or even whether the goal that we have been aiming at is attainable?</P>
    <P>I am aware that Patrick Pearse's goal was the re-establishment of Irish as a vernacular language in this country.  I do not really believe that that was possible even in 1911 or 1912. I am absolutely convinced that it is no longer possible to-day.  After all, we have had two generations since those days, and we have had quite a lot of enthusiasm, and quite a lot of money spent, and quite a lot of Irish taught in the schools, but can anyone in this House really say that we are within measurable distance of seeing Irish established in this country as a second vernacular language or as the first vernacular language?  It just is not so, and I think we ought to face the fact and recognise that it is not coming.</P>
    <P>I believe that damage is done to the language by diluting it and teaching it very widely, and in a cursory way, to a number of people who in fact have no particular taste for it and no intention of using it.  I believe there has been a dilution of Irish, and damage to the language wrought by our system, based upon the hope of some that Irish could be re-established as a vernacular tongue in this country, and I think we ought to recognise now that whatever about 1912 or 1922, that goal is not now attainable.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullins referred, I think in a jocular fashion, to Trinity College and its policy on Irish.  He wanted to know, if he failed in Irish in the <Col N="559" /> entrance examination, would he be admitted to the college.  The answer is very simple.  Any student presenting Irish as a subject, that is to say, choosing Irish as one of the two languages that he or she must take at the matriculation examination for Trinity College, Dublin, and failing in that subject, is not admitted.  As a language, it is no more compulsory than Latin.  Any student presenting himself for entrance must do two of the following languages&mdash;Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Irish, French, German, Italian or Spanish.  Consequently, if Senator Mullins were to present himself and were to fail in Irish, having chosen Irish as one of his languages, he would not be admitted, however much we might desire to have him. That is the answer to the question that he propounded.  He seemed to think that one could do Irish in the matriculation examination and fail in it, and yet get in.  The answer is, one cannot.</P>
    <P>Now, I wonder does the Seanad realise how many students going into Trinity College do in fact choose Irish from this list of languages as one of the two that they must do?  I took the trouble to look up the figures for the last entrance examination.  Forty-three per cent. chose to do Irish.  I think that that is a very significant figure, for this reason, that these candidates presented Irish by free choice, and not because it was rammed down their throats, and I think that is a principle upon which some of us might reflect in thinking about the teaching of Irish and the public attitude towards Irish.  The people who will cherish and preserve the tongue are the people who love it, and choose it, and not the people who have it thrust upon them. To spread it too widely to such reluctant people is to dilute and thin it down.</P>
    <P>The time has come, then, to recognise that Irish&mdash;it may seem sad to say&mdash; will never be our spoken tongue generally in this country again. That represents, in my opinion, a real loss.  I think the loss of any element, particularly a language, in a cultural heritage, is a real loss, a melancholy <Col N="560" /> thing to contemplate.  I believe that it has already been lost.  I do not believe that we can ever reach even the point that has been maintained by Wales, but I do recognise, and I think we should recognise, that with that melancholy loss there go major compensatory gains, and I do not think we should lose sight of those.  The major compensatory gain is that we speak another language, English, which is a world language; and I think we can pride ourselves on both speaking and writing it reasonably well.</P>
    <P>In 1933, I was in the little country of Latvia, which has subsequently been swallowed up successively by two totalitarian régimes.  But in 1933 it was still a free small nation.  The Latvians are less than 3,000,000 in number and they speak Latvian.  In order to communicate with their northern neighbours of Estonia, they have to speak faulty Russian or halting Swedish; and to communicate with their southern neighbours, the Lithuanians, they have to speak broken German or Russian.  Each one of these 3,000,000 people speaks his own language admirably, so I am told, but he speaks rather imperfect Russian, German or Swedish.  In their own language they express themselves faultlessly because it is their own.  They are proud of it. But nobody understands it but they, and it is a fact that it has been a factor isolating them from the main stream of western culture.</P>
    <P>Now, our place in English literature and English thinking is a place of pride, and it is a recognised fact that, in relation to something that was thrust upon us, the English language, we can say that we had the revenge of conquering it in our turn.  When we speak of Wolfe Tone, Pearse, Burke, Goldsmith, Lecky, O'Casey and Shaw, Yeats and Joyce, we speak of people who have given Ireland a proud place in English literature, in English thought, and consequently in world literature and world thought.  If we shed a tear for the loss of our own tongue, as a living tongue to be spoken by all our people, nevertheless let us see the consoling fact that there are very large compensatory gains.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, in the Irish <Col N="561" /> people on the question of the Irish language, a large measure of apathy; I will not say dislike or distaste, but apathy.  You might not think so, if you were to listen only to public speeches, but this is what the Council of Education says in talking about the Irish people:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Among many, the majority, perhaps, there is towards Irish what must be described as apathy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe the present official attitude belittles and betrays the language.  It tends to breed contempt, perhaps, and certainly apathy, if not dislike, and not infrequently hypocrisy, a pretence to revere a language, which in fact the person never speaks and hardly understands.</P>
    <P>We have a system here which in our infant schools tries to introduce practically all the infants to speaking Irish and learning other subjects through it. The regulation says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the teachers are sufficiently qualified the aim should be to reach a stage, as early as possible, in which Irish can be used as the sole language in the infant school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sole language&rdquo;&mdash;that looks very much like a large measure of compulsory Irish to me, and I think it is a mistaken system, and I speak as a linguist.  I do not believe that is the way to teach Irish, to teach mathematics or reading.  I believe, indeed, that you could teach far more Irish in the infant schools by teaching it through the medium of English.  I am absolutely convinced of that.  I believe we have been misled for generations by the ideas of the late Reverend Professor Corcoran who, I do not want to use too strong a term, was I believe misguided, about the &ldquo;direct method&rdquo;.  He believed that it you learned your first tongue by the direct method you could learn other languages the same way.  Now, every young child is eager to communicate at least its wants to the outside world, and the direct method is successful for the first language. The average child may take as many as ten or 12 years, however, to learn adequately its own first tongue, and, if you add another ten or 12 <Col N="562" /> years, it might, through the direct method, learn a second language.  But I believe that this attempt to use Irish as &ldquo;the sole language&rdquo; in the infant schools, even with competent teachers, is a major mistake, and has taught in fact less Irish than would have been thought if that language had been taught in these classes through the medium of English.</P>
    <P>On page 276 of the Report of the Council of Education certain recommendations are made.  In paragraph 65 it states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some of our members urge that, if Irish be introduced in infant classes in schools in English-speaking districts, a teaching period of at most one hour daily would be sufficient, the remainder of the infant programme to be taught through the medium of the home language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no question but that those members are right, but the Minister has done nothing.  He has said nothing. He has not publicly examined this report.  The next paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The majority consider that the programme in the infant classes is essentially a language programme designed to give young children from English-speaking homes a basic and vernacular command of Irish and, having regard to the national aims in relation to Irish, they recommend that the present practice be maintained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The majority of the council recommend it be maintained.  Some of them, however, feel strongly that it is the wrong way to go about it.  I should like to know what the Minister has to say about that.</P>
    <P>There is a remarkable and valuable minority report on this whole question of the attitude towards Irish as a spoken tongue, and in it is quoted on page 301 the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1941 the I.N.T.O. published a &lsquo;Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the use of Irish as a Teaching Medium to children whose home language is English&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is what the I.N.T.O. said.  This <Col N="563" /> is not a foreign organisation, it is not an anti-Irish organisation.  They are teachers and this is what they said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The great bulk of evidence supports the view that a smooth and easy educative process imposing comparatively little strain on the child, and making his life in school a happy one, is extremely difficult in a language other than his home language, even with the brighter pupils, and next to impossible with those of average or slow mentality. The average child comes to school already equipped with a vocabulary sufficient to express in simple language the experience of his everyday life.  He is suddenly transferred into a new and unnatural world.  The simplest expressions of the teacher or of the more advanced pupils are quite unintelligible to him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we can disregard that completely, as it has been disregarded officially since 1941, but that is the thoughtful and informed opinion of our teachers in relation to this question.  I know I have already spoken at some length on this topic, but it is a most important subject, and I will leave this particular aspect by saying that I believe the time has come for a change in our whole policy towards Irish.  We must face the fact and recognise, whether it was originally wise or unwise to strive for the revival of Irish as a vernacular, that we have failed.  We ought to face that fact and direct our energies and limited finances to broader educational fields.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point now that there is too much general division of our education system, the primary school, the secondary school, the vocational school and the universities.  I believe they are too separate.  I believe that there is not sufficient interchange between them and I believe that there is even something like a class distinction between them.  I notice that out of approximately every 60 primary school children, on the latest figures available, only about ten get a secondary education&mdash;among the <Col N="564" /> children in secondary schools only about 5 per cent. are State or scholarship aided&mdash;that another 15 get day continuation education for a time, and, of the initial 60, only two or three get to the universities.  As Jean Jacques Rousseau said in effect: &ldquo;It is manifestly against justice that the child of a slave should be born into slavery and maintained in slavery.&rdquo;  It is just as unjust that the child of the slum-dweller should be born into slums and maintained in slumdom.  I believe that all our children should get at least some chance of getting a little bit more than primary education.  I believe, indeed, that a large proportion of them would benefit by going right up to the university. Now, the university should be guarded and protected as a place for disinterested learning, where the utilitarian aim is kept severely in the background, and where the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake may be encouraged.  I believe that a far bigger section of our people could benefit from that than in the present circumstances ever get there.</P>
    <P>On that question, Pearse said: &ldquo;Our very divisions in primary, secondary and university crystallise a snobbishness partly intellectual and partly social.  At Clonard, Kieran, the son of a carpenter, sat in the same class as Columcille, the son of a king.&rdquo;  I do not want to exaggerate on this point but I would like to feel that the primary school child of initial talent would get a reasonable chance of going forward to the university by getting a full and &ldquo;roomy,&rdquo; as it were, free education in primary and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention now two points of detail.  I notice for instance that, on page 204 of the Estimates, reference is made to the two excellent training colleges for domestic science instructors, St. Angela's and St. Catherine's.  These two are residential convent colleges.  I understand that there used to be a third one which has ceased to exist.  I notice also that there are scholarships involved and a certain sum of money is voted for them. I cannot help wondering is it considered absolutely impossible to have <Col N="565" /> a male instructor in domestic economy? Because it seems to me that these two residential training schools, both of them convents, would find it difficult to make accommodation available for him.</P>
    <P>I also feel prompted in this connection to ask a question as to what provision is made in such cases for the residence, in taking up a scholarship, of a non-Catholic who might desire to become a domestic economy instructor in one of these excellent convent residential training schools?  I do not know whether the point has already been met or made, or whether in practice it is dealt with in an entirely simple way, but I should like to know what is the practice, in view of the fact that the third lay training college has ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>I feel that something ought also to be said about the recent leakage of examination papers.  Nobody has yet referred to that here.  I do not know whether we are all satisfied that the public has been told the full facts.  I know that in France when there is a railway accident you can be quite certain the blame will be placed upon the official who is known as the <i>lampiste,</i> who is the very smallest member of the staff of any French railway.  He is the man who carries and trims the lamps; and it always turns out that the accident was due to him.  I had a presentiment, when this investigation into the leakage of information in relation to examinations was taking place, that the entire responsibility would turn out to have been that of a very small employee.  My guess was right.  According to what the Minister said, it was just one person in one printing office who could in any way be said to be blameworthy.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy about that. I assume that the Minister, when he made his statement in the Dáil, expected to be believed.  He also said there was only one district outside Dublin concerned, that no school was involved, and that all the blame lay with this very junior printer and some of his friends.  Yet, he said that the reason he would not give the name of the district outside Dublin where the <Col N="566" /> papers were to be replaced, was that people would assume that the school in the area was involved.  Why on earth should they assume that the school was involved, if they believed the Minister, who said the only person who was to blame was the junior printer?</P>
    <P>I should have preferred the Minister to be more frank.  I believe that there is a widespread feeling that a lot of these children have been unfairly treated.  It is all very well to say that the papers will be marked in such a way that the children doing the first lot will not be given any advantage over children who did the second lot or vice versa.  Was the second lot easier or harder, and how is the standard to be established?  This is not just a pass examination.  A number of scholarships depend upon it.  I am not satisfied that fair play has been given, or indeed could be given, and I think it is actually monstrous that children in a tense state, working for examinations, should have had to go through the ordeal of wondering first whether they would have to do some papers again, and then many of them having finally to do papers again. Some of them may actually have benefited by getting a second chance, but the nervous strain was quite unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>While we may say that it was not the Minister's fault this time, I should like to hear a categorical assurance that this will not happen again.  I notice that when in the Dáil he was asked to say if it had ever happened before, he could give no such assurance.  I find that highly alarming.</P>
    <P>And now to conclude: I should like to see a new educational policy in this country.  I should like to see, for the first time since we took over the direction of our own destinies, a Minister for Education inspired to implement a new policy for education, a policy which will be truly inspired and really free.  I wish to see the path of every Irish child made easy towards a full and free education with no means test, no holding back of the children of the under-privileged.  I should like to see established freedom to learn by book and by hand, freedom to think and freedom for children to grow, mentally <Col N="567" /> and physically.  I should like to see teachers given a chance, both financially and in relation to the numbers in their classes.  I wish to see the children also given a chance, no longer regularly beaten because the teacher is driven half-crazy by the overcrowding of the class, or by the overstrain of the backward child being put into the same class as other children.  And I want to see that backward child getting not just a chance, but a special chance, instead of being given, in all too many cases, no chance at all in our primary schools.</P>
    <P>In addition, as I have said, there is need for a reassessment, however painful it may be, of our whole attitude towards the Irish language policy, in accordance with the realities to-day.  I want our educational system to be so planned and inspired as to produce an educated generation of Irish men and women who will be unafraid to think for themselves, who will lead the way to an educated and intelligent planning of our economy for the effective service of all our people, in a community in which the freely educated mind will be the aim and the privilege of all and will be placed, as a matter of course, at the service of all.</P>
    <P>The future of this country depends, in the final analysis, upon what we are prepared to do now for the real education of our people.  In order to do this we must spend far more money.  We must encourage all those who are interested, teachers and parents, to have a real sense of urgency in regard to the problem.  I believe that the expressed profound dissatisfaction of the Council of Education as to the standard of education so far achieved, is more than justified, because I believe that that standard is at present entirely insufficient.  The Council of Education have clearly stated that they believe that it is entirely insufficient.  I am afraid the Minister and the Department of Education are taking that judgment far too lightly.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the relevant passage from the Report of the Council of Education.  This will be the last quotation I shall make this <Col N="568" /> evening.  At paragraph 371 it says in regard to our present primary education: &ldquo;It is, in effect, an insufficient minimum education under modern conditions.&rdquo;  That was stated in August, 1954.  Do the Minister and the Department of Education not feel ashamed and disturbed when they read that opinion?  I believe we all should feel ashamed and dissatisfied that, in July, 1957, no action whatever has yet been taken on that report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the teaching system briefly.  We have heard a long speech from Senator Sheehy Skeffington on our system of education and I do not propose to follow him into all his arguments.  I would more or less agree with him in regard to some things he mentioned but there are others with which I could not agree. <Col N="570" /> Like the Senator, I agree our system of education is rather hidebound, not flexible enough and that it would be far better if the teachers were given more freedom when teaching the children.  I am also afraid we overemphasise the importance of examinations. Many of us seem to think that passing examinations is the be all and the end all and the real criterion of an educated people.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>As regards examinations we are too much inclined to impose tests that are too difficult on the pupils.  They are presented with complex abstruse questions. As somebody said, the policy would seem to be, not to find out what they know but what they do not know.  I fear that the examination complex has a bad psychological effect on the pupils and I suggest to the Minister and the Department of Education that they should modify their programme. That is one point on which I am more or less in agreement with Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>
    <P>The question of punishment in the schools has been a vexed question for some time back and it is very hard to know on which side the justice of the case lies.  My own view is that it is very difficult to avoid some sort of punishment in the case of a child that is not amenable to discipline.  It is all a question of discipline and the point is: can discipline be maintained in schools without some degree of punishment, however slight?  As I have said, the question is a vexed one and I do not feel competent to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion and controversy through the years about teaching Irish in the schools and I suggest it is also a topic on which there has been much misunderstanding. We hear a great deal about compulsory Irish, but is not every subject on the school curriculum compulsory? Is it not a fact that if a candidate does not pass in English in the Intermediate or Leaving Certificate examinations, he will not pass at all? That is compulsory English and we do not hear a word of complaint about it.</P>
    <P>If the Senator and others who criticise <Col N="571" /> the teaching of Irish refer to the teaching of other school subjects through the medium of Irish, that is another question, or another aspect of the question.  My experience, for what it is worth, is that no teacher is supposed to take upon himself or herself to teach the ordinary everyday subjects through the medium of Irish, unless he or she is fully competent and also unless the pupils are sufficiently well up in the language to receive instruction through its medium.  That is the rule of the Department and there is no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>Is there anything wrong in speaking to young children in the mother tongue, using phrases, salutations and simple sentences when, even in English or in any language, it is only by such means infants can be taught?  If the teachers do not commence teaching everyday phrases and salutations to the children when they are young, when will they commence?  Is that not the time to get hold of the children and get these things into their heads in the same way as their tables?</P>
    <P>Last evening, Senator Mullins referred to the Irish language and its use in the schools and I agree with him entirely in one thing he said&mdash;the emphasis should be more on the spoken language than on the written.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Mullins, I would also advocate that there should be an oral Irish test in the primary certificate examinations. There should also be an oral test in our secondary schools and there should be an oral test as a preliminary for admission to the university colleges.  It is only by cultivating and encouraging the spoken word in every possible way that the Irish language can be restored.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect of the question.  No matter how much good work is done in the school, its effect will be largely lost if the language is not used in after life by those who have acquired a knowledge of it in the schools.  The question is what encouragement and what inducement do people get to make use of the language? What example do they get? It is up to the leaders of public <Col N="572" /> opinion in the professions, in commercial life and even in politics to give encouragement and good example, as far as the speaking of the Irish language is concerned.  It is by that we will be helping the cause of the language and not by taking up what I would describe as a defeatist cynical attitude towards that important problem.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact in Irish that this is not an easy problem.  It is not indeed an easy thing to restore a language that has not been generally in use for a century or more, particularly when we have the English language on both sides of us as well as foreign culture and foreign ideas.  I do not agree at all with those people who say that the Irish language is making no progress.  It is making a certain amount of progress, but not enough.  It is up to us to try to find a method by which we can make better progress.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington&mdash;I am sorry he has gone&mdash;referred to another important matter, that is, the peace and order of the country.  I think we are all agreed that this is a very vital matter for the security of the State and for the proper guidance of the young people of to-day.  There is no doubt that this campaign of violence in the country is a very unfortunate affair.  It is heartening to know that members of all Parties subscribe to the idea that this campaign of violence should not be given any encouragement whatever.  What we want down here is peace, order and progress, so that we can set an example to those people who are watching us with critical eyes and let them see we can order and regulate our own affairs in our own way.  Without peace, order and discipline in a country, no progress can be made.  These are the pre-requisities for the making of progress in any direction.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to find Senator Sheehy Skeffington, when dealing with this question of peace and order, endeavouring to justify the Boundary Agreement of 1925.  He tried to impress upon us that it was accepted down here.  It was not accepted down here. The position is that this agreement <Col N="573" /> was foisted upon the people of this country.  They did not know anything about it; they had no say in it.  It was not brought about by any democratic method.  It was repudiated solemnly by the Deputies of the time who were out of the Dáil.  It was repudiated by a solemn declaration in the Rotunda. This so-called Boundary Agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think we are all agreed that the most important thing for the country to-day is to increase production from agriculture and industry, but I think pride of place must be given to agriculture.  The land of the country is the greatest national asset we have and we should do everything in our power to improve it. Senator Baxter, in his very constructive speech, referred to the desirability of bringing 1,000,000 acres of peat land in the West of Ireland into production. That is my opinion, too.  I am entirely in agreement with him.  Furthermore, I believe we should turn our attention more to the development of our bogs than hitherto.  We all know that Bord na MÓna has been doing good work and is worthy of approbation for the wonderful schemes of bog development they have carried out.  I fear we have to a certain extent neglected the hand-won turf industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The development of both sides of the industry has been assuming greater importance year by year, because the price of coal has been soaring all through the years.  I read in a British Sunday paper that there have been no fewer than 29 increases in the price of imported coal from Britain over the past ten years.  That position should give us furiously to think and we should aim at the position when we can do without a lot of this coal and make use of our own peat resources.  That is part of the Sinn Féin policy which we should try to operate and develop here.</P>
    <P>Then, as Senator Baxter said, there is the question of bringing the peat lands into production.  There is also the question of bringing into production other land which is not peat land at all.  In my journeys up and down the country, I see any amount of waste land, potentially good land, which has gone to waste, land covered by furze, brushwood and briars, and every kind of dirt, land which has been rendered useless for the farmer himself and the dereliction of which has gone so far that the farmer himself cannot tackle it.</P>
    <P>This problem should be examined by the Government with a view to bringing that land into production, in co-operation with the farmers.  I am certain and sure that if such waste land were in Holland, the people there would very soon reclaim it, seeing that they reclaimed land there from the very sea itself.  Neither would that waste land be tolerated in countries like Germany and Italy.  In Italy, with the expenditure of large sums of money and with very great labour, they brought the Pontine Marshes into production.  Similarly, in the United States of America in the Tennessee Valley there was a huge scheme of land reclamation carried out.  Some similar scheme should be tackled here since this land is potentially arable and there are tens of thousands of acres of it&mdash; of which there is even some here in the eastern counties.  This problem should be examined by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>We have had some marathon runners in this debate and I do not wish to be one of them, so I will conclude my remarks <Col N="576" /> on this occasion and express the hope that the economic position of the country will improve in the years that lie ahead.</P>

      <P>Tar éis an méid cainte atá ráite, ní maith liom-sa breis a chur leis.  Tá ábhar dhá chéad óráid sa pháipéar atá os ár gcomhair &mdash;an Bille Soláthair airgid phoiblí.</P>
      <P>Bhí rud nó dhó ag rith trím aigne le linn caint na ndaoine eile agus b'fhéidir nár mhiste tagairt dóibh.  Tá a lán cainte déanta againn i dtaobh na talún agus úsáid na talún agus sochar a bhaint as an talamh.  Daoine i bhfad níos eolaisí ná mé fhéin atá tar éis cainte, ach tá pointe beag agamsa i bhfoirm ceiste&mdash;an bhfuil aon imní tagaithe ar Aireacht na Tálún faoi an uimhir mhór d'fheirmeacha talún, de thalamh maith, atá ag dul searbhach díomhaoin ar fud na tíre agus na daoine gur leo iad, tar éis glas a chur ar an doras agus imeacht leo thar lear, na feirmeacha á bhfágaint ar cíos aon mhí dhéag ag siopadóirí as na bailte beaga, gan bó ná gabhar ar na tailte sin, gan tor cabáiste ná prátaí ná meacain ag fás orthu, gan aon ní á dhéanamh leo ach beithígh ag fosaíocht ortha.  Tá a lán tionóntaí den tsaghas sin anois agus is dóigh liom gur éirigh an cheist chomh géar san nár mhiste leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta spéis a chur ann agus iachall a chur ar dhaoine gur leo na feirmeacha sin, a fágadh gan úsáid, gan ach buachalláin bhuí agus feochadáin bheith ag fás orthu.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liom gur ceist thábhachtach í mar tá an iomad den tsaghas san, go mór mhór, ins an dúthaigh go bhfuil feirmeacha beaga ann.  Is talamh maith an chuid is mó de agus tá sé anois gan toradh á bhaint as agus gan á saothrú ach fear an bhaile mhóir, é féin agus a mhadra ag teacht uair amháin in aghaidh na seachtaine chun féachaint uirthi agus comhaireamh a dhéanamh ar na beithígh agus iad a fhágaint fé Dhia ins na háiteacha sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is dóigh liom gur ceist í sin a thiocfaidh &ldquo;te&rdquo; go luath agus nár mhiste don Roinn Talmhaíochta machnamh a dhéanamh roimh ré agus bheith ullamh le réiteach éigin a dhéanamh.  Ní dóigh liom gur ceart é a chur mar chúram ar <Col N="577" /> chuid d'fheirmeoirí na tíre, le cuid de thalamh na tíre, bia na tíre do sholáthar; agus daoine eile, go bhfuil talamh chomh maith acu, a bheith ag imeacht gan dualgaisí ar bith á gcomhlíonadh acu maidir le cothú agus tionscail agus le leasú na talún atá ar a seilbh.</P>
    <P>Tá nithe eile sna meastacháin seo nó ar an gcaiteachas atá curtha ar leathtaoibh, ach ba mhaith liom caint ar aon rud amháin.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuilimid ag éirí tuirseach den méid argóna atá á dhéanamh agus den méid comhairle atá á thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom caint a dhéanamh faoi ghnóthaí na Roinne Oideachais. Tá deacracht sa scéal maidir liom fhéin mar táim im bhall den Chomhairle Oideachais.  Bhí mé páirteach sa ghnó do rinneadar agus sa Tuarascáil do chuir siad amach ar bhun-oideachas agus níl rogha agam faoin Tuarascáil sin ach a rá, fé mar adúirt an fear dubh uair amháin, &ldquo;them's my sentiments.&rdquo; Is iad san mo thuairimí agus, dá bhrí sin, ní ghá dhom tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh.  Tá an obair ar siúl fós.  Níl an tarna Tuarascáil foilsithse go fóill ach tá sí á cur le chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist á plé maidir leis na meánscoileanna. Is tábhachtach an scrúdú a deineadh air sin ach, ós rud é go bhfuilim féin im bhall den Chomhairle sin, ní ceadaítear dom aon eolas a thabhairt faoi agus ní bhacfaidh mé léi.</P>
    <P>Deineadh mórán tagairtí do thábhacht oideachais talmhaíochta do mhuintir na tíre seo.  Do thabharfadh smaoineamh ciallmhar agus beartú, dá mb'fhéidir é, toradh fónta sa scéal sin. Maidir le bun-oideachas, braithimid go ndéanfar obair bhun-oideachais ghnáthaigh gan dul le speisialtacht sa réim sin den oideachas.</P>
    <P>Tá an chéist chéanna ag baint le meán-oideachas.  Tá daoine ann a bhíonn ag bagairt nach cóir dúinn dul le speisialtacht ansin, ach an oiread, agus daoine eile á rá go mba chóir dúinn dul níos faide i dtreo eolaíochta, talmhaíochta agus rudaí áirithe eile. Bíodh sin mar atá, níl sé socair gur ceart go mbainfeadh an speisialtacht leis an meán&mdash;oideachas ach tá an cheist sin ann agus níl sé réitithe fós.  Is dócha go dtiocfaidh réiteach air sin.</P>
    <P>Ansin, tá na scoileanna gairmoideachais <Col N="578" /> speisialta ag fás le déanaí le haghaidh cúrsaí speisialta; níl mar chúram orthu ach gnóthaí eolaíochta, curadóireachta, síolrú stoic, agus mar sin de.  Sin rud áirithe agus braithim í ag fás agus réim speisialta oideachais inti.  Lasmuigh de sin tá sórt eile oideachas ann&mdash;ceard-oideachas.  Sin speisialtacht ó bhun go barr agus is cóir gur mar sin a bheadh sé.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir liom a rá an féidir an t-oideachas speisialta sin a bhrú isteach ar an meán-oideachas nó ar an mbunoideachas. Sin deacracht agus sin í an chúis go bhfuil mórán daoine ag clamhsán nach bhfuil an rud seo nó an rud siúd á dhéanamh agus go bhfuil múinteoirí ag clamhsán go bhfuil an iomad gnóthaí cheana féin á múineadh ins na scoileanna agus nach féidir leo teacht suas air seo agus air siúd ag an am gcéanna.</P>
    <P>Ní dhéanfaidh mé aon tagairt d'oideachas ollscoile.  Tá sé sin thar m'eolas-sa chomh mór sin nach dealraitheach go mb'fhiú puinn mo thuairimí faoi.  Tá rud amháin ag rith trí na cheithre réimeanna scoile agus is í sin ceist na Gaeilge.  Is cúis áthais dom gur aontaigh roinnt Seanadóirí le tuarascáil na comhairle oideachais agus go háirithe tugaim fé ndeara gur aontaigh an Seanadóir Sheehy Skeffington beagnach go hiomlán leis.  Do thuig mé uaidh ná raibh sé sásta nár chuir siad a dtuairimí iomlána ar cheist an oideachais isteach inti.  Is beag tuairim, dá luaitear anseo, nach ndéantar í a chíoradh agus a chur trí chéile.  Tá daoine atá tuisceanach faoi cheisteanna scoile in ár measc agus d'aontaigh siad beagnach is uile leis an tuarascáil a rinneamar agus ar an méid atá déanta agus ar an gcuntas ar an méid atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGaeilge, tá mo thuairim nochtaithe sa tuarascáil sin agus beidh tuairimí eile le fáil sa cheann atá le teacht.  Tá gné den obair anseo agus is gné an-thábhachtach í&mdash; is é sin, go bhfuil sé riachtananch luí níos mó agus níos déine ar cheist na Gaeilge agus go háirithe ar labhairt na teangan a bheith mar thoradh na hoibre sa réim oideachais ar fad.  Aontaím go hiomlán leis sin agus aontaíonn gach éinne go bhfuil machnamh déanta <Col N="579" /> aige sa cheist leis an tuairim sin freisin.</P>
    <P>Níl obair na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna gan toradh.  Tá torthaí iomadúla de bharr na hoibre sin.  Sí an t-aon toradh nach furast a fheiscint ná gnáth-labhairt na teangan, í a bheith mar ghnáth-theanga labhartha agus scríofa ag na daoine ar fud na tíre.  Tá sé sin, b'fhéidir, le casadh ar an obair nár éirigh léi sa treo sin ach, taobh amuigh de sin, is mór go léir an toradh atá ar an obair.  Nuair a thosnaíomar ar an obair 50 bliain ó shoin, agus níos déanaí, is beag an aird a bhí ar an teanga i gcúrsaí oideachais.  Níl an scéal amhlaidh anois.  San am sin do bhí daoine in Éirinn ná raibh aon eolas ar bith acu ar an teanga agus bhí daoine ann nár chuala riamh focal dí. Ní mar sin atá an scéal anois.  Ceist phoiblí anois í&mdash;rud nárbh ea riamh sna laethanta sin.  Tá múineadh na teangan fé dhíospóireacht ag daoine atá ag taobhú leis an obair a dhéanamh agus ag daoine atá i gcoinne na hoibre sin.  Pé ar bith é, ceist bheo anois í agus sí an obair a deineadh 50 nó 30 bliain ó shoin is ciontach leis sin.  Má tá laige ann nár shíleamar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Fiche bliain níos déanaí nó mar sin thosnaigh réabhlóid níos déine agustháinig sé chun straidhne agus chun buillí.  Bhí cuspóirí áirithein ár n-aigne.  Do chuamar ar aghaidh leis an réabhlóid.  Ar chuma áirithe d'éirigh leis an réabhlóid sin.  Fuaireamar nithe áirithe.  Is é an príomhrud a fuaireamar gur ghluais cumhacht Shasana, arm Shasana agus institiúidí Shasana as an tír seo ach d'éiríomar ansan as an réabhlóid agus ní raibh an réabhlóid ach tosnaithe.

      <P>I wish to deal with another aspect of education and that is the adult education movement. Senator Baxter spoke about the spirit of the people in connection with increased production and everything else.  I suggest the answer to that may be the adult education movement.  This is a movement that is covered in Vote 22.  It was started by our late President of U.C.C., Rev. Dr. O'Rahilly. Its aim was to train leaders from the ranks of the workers, farmers and citizens in the large and small towns to take their place in the community and run their own organisations.</P>
      <P>This was carried out very successfully in connection with the vocational education authorities.  It is an answer to the point made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  He spoke of class warfare between the various branches of education.  I am happy to say that the adult education movement drew the universities, at least U.C.C., and the vocational education bodies together in harmony and in mutual respect and co-operation.</P>
      <P>Courses are run for workers, trade union executives and farmers.  There are also some courses for leaders.  In all some 875 diplomas have been conferred. That means that in the five Munster counties, excluding Clare, which for this purpose is in the province of Connaught, over 400 have been trained in workers' courses.  They are now playing a very prominent part in their organisations.  Likewise, 320 have been trained in the farmers' courses.  I need only mention some names like Mr. Seán Casey, Senator Murphy and Senator Crowley and on the farmers' side such leaders as Mr. Dempsey of Waterford, Mr. Maher of Tipperary, Mr. Hickey of Limerick. These are carrying what they learned into their organisations and we expect that the good work they are doing will achieve much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers are 60 per county at present and this has gone on quietly; in fact, you may have read recently about the Red Island Folk School idea.  The Danish Folk School idea is <Col N="582" /> just a pale week-end imitation of the adult education courses that are being conducted by the university.  You cannot really do much more than surface training at a week-end, but where you get young men who at the end of their day's work are prepared to come in and work solidly for three nights a week from October to May, for two solid years, then you are achieving something really solid, especially when the course is designed on a union between citizenship and sociology and with economics as the main plank and includes a training in business, the conducting of organisations, debate and so forth.  That is the union of what is best in the Danish Folk School with what we need here, with the practical side grafted on.  As I said, the Danish Folk School is not a new idea here.  It began in 1946.</P>
    <P>I come now to the sore point, that is, that the movement is in sore need of funds.  It received an average grant of £2,700 for the six years from 1949 to 1955, but in 1955 a little money had accumulated and it was reduced temporarily to £1,500.  Unfortunately the temporary reduction is still in force.  I have confidence in the Government and in the present Minister that they will remedy this position because the present programme of 13 courses, with 300 young men about to embark on a two years' course, cannot be carried through unless we have something near our original grant.  It can be carried on by going into debt, but I take it that we fully value our rural leaders, our trade union leaders and our leaders in the small towns at something more than the £20 each, which it costs to run this course.</P>
    <P>Just to finish on this topic, I wish to pay the highest possible compliment to the Department of Education, especially to the vocational education branch and to the chief executive officers of the Minister counties, with whom we are all happy to be associated.  I would also say that for us in the university it has been a worthwhile experience to get the opportunity to talk to these groups as visiting lecturers, to have tea with them and to get to know their problems.  It has brought a number of <Col N="583" /> us down to earth and I think we are all the better for it.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to raise is in regard to the universities.  I think it is realised on all sides that at present we are in rather a quandary. The nation says that the universities are not doing their job and the universities say that the nation is not providing sufficient resources.  I take it that we will approach this problem just as we approached Shannon Airport and the jet age.  We had to keep Shannon in the forefront and the speed with which both Houses passed £1,000,000 for the new runway at Shannon was highly commendable.  I think our approach to the university problem ought to be equally direct in the very near future.  I take it that our approach will be somewhat along the lines of Edmund Burke's famous definition of a statement.  The definition was: &ldquo;The disposition to preserve and the ability to improve taken together would be my definition of a statesman&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that there are none more critical of the universities than those of us of the younger generation who have studied abroad and who are prepared to play our part at home.  We are highly critical and we know that some of the faults lie within the university and some lie in a lack of resources and a lack of general appreciation of their efforts.  It is a heartening sign to see that the strongest criticism is coming from university groups and Senators may have read some of the outpourings of criticism in Cork last night at a meeting, at which I had the honour to be chairman, dealing with science in the universities.  <i>Convocation</i>, the graduates' magazine, has called for a university commission and I think it would be a very wise step to take so that we will see where we are going and make sure that our institutions&mdash;in this case, our universities&mdash;perform the function which they should and will always perform in a scientific age in an advancing country.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go any further into that, except to mention that the total grant enjoyed by Queen's University, <Col N="584" /> which caters for one-fifth of this country, is greater than the total of all grants to the existing universities within this State.  I am not saying that we should spend money, or that we can afford to spend money, on the lavish scale that is regarded as necessary in England and America, but we will have to do a little better than we are doing, if we are to get the best from the talent that has come back.  Speaking for Cork, I can say that we have a dozen men who have been in the best graduate schools in England, America and elsewhere. They are anxious to do the work and England and America are very anxious to get them back, but we hope that they will never be so unpatriotic as to leave what is a reasonable living here for the sake of financial advancement.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great disparity in the Estimates over a number of years, between what the Government, or, shall I say, the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance, are prepared to make to individual institutions and what they are prepared to give those run directly by the Government.</P>

      <P>I am not in any way reflecting on any Minister when I mention the grants given to the agricultural schools.  I am just using these as a yardstick.  I find in the Estimates that Athenry Agricultural School has about £36,000, less £16,000 appropriation, giving the net amount available of £20,600; Ballyhaise has around £13,000; the Munster Institute £17,000 and the Clonakilty Agricultural Station £24,000.  I am not saying they are getting too much&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I want to use it as a yardstick because that money is, so to speak, clear to pocket in so far as the money has not to provide for the pensions of the staffs involved.  It has not to provide for any major capital expenditure on buildings and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these items, including stationery, pensions, etc., have to be provided for by the non-Government institutions. Accordingly, in order to compare what is paid to a Government institution with what is paid to an autonomous institution one has to deduct at least <Col N="585" /> 20 to 25 per cent. from the amount paid to the independent institution so as to find the comparable figures.  I have actually done that with the total amount of money available to the dairy science faculty between the Government grant of £25,800 in fees and a few other small items.  Going through last year's accounts, which are available to anybody who wishes to look at them, I find the comparable sum is about £17,000.  In other words, the amount paid there is just comparable to what is paid to an agricultural school.</P>
    <P>I submit there is something really wrong in that balance.  But things are much worse when we compare a Government agricultural school with a private agricultural school.  We take places like Warrenstown, Pallaskenry and so on and we find that the grant to Warrenstown is £2,700 per annum, plus a capitation which I estimated at something round £2,000.  In other words, Warrenstown has £5,000 for&mdash;I speak subject to correction now as to numbers&mdash;something like 60 students.</P>
    <P>I believe they are turning out about 60 young farmers per year whereas Athenry, which I am using as a standard of comparison, has 24.  If my figures are correct, it costs six times as much to train a young farmer in a directly run Government agricultural school as it costs to train the same man in one of the private schools like Warrenstown, Pallaskenry or Mount-bellew. I am not making this comparison to reflect on the State schools and the amount of money they are getting&mdash;the amount is relatively small&mdash;but I am pointing out the fact that, by comparison, non-Government institutions are starved.</P>
    <P>I believe all this goes back to a conflict in the mind of the Department of Finance.  The officials of the Department of Finance are not prepared to give out money unless one goes before them at the start and tells them how every penny will be spent for the next year.  They want to check expenditure before the money is actually spent. They are not prepared to accept that the body which is getting the money is a properly constituted body, knows best how to spend it and will ultimately <Col N="586" /> be answerable to the Comptroller and Auditor-General that the amount spent has been spent in accordance with the purpose for which it was voted.  There is that conflict between the demands of the Department of Finance and the desire for autonomy on the part of the outside institutions.  I submit there may be room for compromise.</P>
    <P>I go so far as to suggest that where bodies are in receipt of grants-in-aid or other State funds they should be subject to a statutory review&mdash;I do not like to use the word &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;&mdash; of their activities every ten or 15 years, or at some other interval.  Such a procedure should be taken as a matter of course and the review should be accepted as a review into the manner in which they are serving the community and how they compare with similar bodies elsewhere, how expenditure compares with that of bodies run directly by the Government, and recommendations could then be made for the next ten-year period.  I believe that would and should prove satisfactory both to the Department of Finance and to these institutions.</P>
    <P>As I am on the subject of investigation, I believe investigation should also be statutory on our State Departments. It does one good to be investigated. We have learned that from the medical authorities who have investigated our medical schools over the past ten years.  We have had the American Medical Association and the British Medical Association.  Investigation was irksome.  We did not like it naturally, but it has done us good. It has pinpointed the weaknesses within and it has also pinpointed the weaknesses without in the nature of lack of funds and so on.  The result will be that vigorous action will be taken and the schools will be reorientated over the next ten years, probably in a way they would never have been reorientated had they not been investigated.</P>
    <P>These investigations were not what I would regard as a comprehensive examination because they dealt, first of all, with what I shall describe as the formalism, the teaching aids that were available and so forth, the staff, the number of secretaries, the <Col N="587" /> laboratory facilities and so on.  They did not deal with the products.  In fact some of the Americans expressed amazement that with the facilities, which they described as primitive in comparison with theirs, the products could be so good and such a high percentage of graduates could win prize Fellowships in the English institutions. I express these views in the belief that there may be some way by which we can get the best out of State bodies and non-State bodies and get them all to work together for the good of the nation.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the scientific Civil Service as covered by Vote 52. The problem is a very serious one and it is one which will have to be dealt with in the immediate future because, make no mistake about it, there is a conflict, and a very serious conflict for this country, between the scientific Civil Service and the administrative Civil Service.  That conflict has arisen in other countries too, but they are well on the way to resolving it.  Our meteorological service is accepted as being second to none.  It has grown up since 1940.  We find that our young men are fleeing out of this service.  Far more are leaving than are coming in and the result is that we have had to invite in Spaniards and others at double, and even treble, the salary we are prepared to pay our own men.</P>
    <P>The conflict there is that it is held that attractive terms cannot be given to our own high grade scientific men, our meteorological officers.  Attractive terms cannot be given to them because that would disturb the whole balance of Civil Service salary scales generally. I submit that when you are condemning men to work night shifts, when you draw up a scale in such a way that a man going into the service now can expect, with luck, promotion in 1990, when you are doing that, you will also have to provide incentives. Up to a year ago a minor incentive was given that after two years' service an officer would jump immediately by five increments, which meant he went from a salary of about £600 up to £750. That was an inducement but it has been withdrawn.  At the very same <Col N="588" /> time as it has been withdrawn the same inducement has been given to the administrative officers, of whom there is a waiting list from here to Clontarf.</P>
    <P>I submit that the plight of the meteorological service needs a very immediate investigation.  An officer with 17 years' service left for Chile recently.  I am not condoning it in so far as I believe that those officers have a duty to stay in the country if at all possible but there is something wrong when our best graduates are fleeing like that.  I say that it is just a problem of bringing up the scientific officers, putting them on a par with the other civil servants, as has been done in England, so that a career in the scientific Civil Service will be equally attractive with a career in the other Civil Service.  In the modern jet age, if we have not scientists, who are the administrators going to administer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Michael Hayes, when he opened this debate yesterday, threw down a challenge to everybody in Irish public life. Senator Hayes has been long in the service of this nation and the words that he has spoken should be listened to by every one of us.  His appeal was timely.  He addressed it to those who were the principal actors in the drama that was unfolded from 1916 to 1921.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention briefly my experiences during the emergency period. When France fell and the call to our people was answered, when we felt it was for everyone who lived here to defend this island against invasion, there was an appeal then to something that was common to all of us.  I remember meeting people who spoke Irish and people who had a poor view of the necessity of anybody speaking Irish.  There were people who played football under a ban and people who did not believe in a ban.  I met tough Rugby forwards being told what to do by ardent Gaels.  Everyone answered the call willingly and for the country. If we are to save Ireland to-day, we shall have to recapture some of the spirit that prevailed in the '40's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes I think it is a pity that we did not get a slight touch of the war that our brothers in Europe got. <Col N="589" /> The crucible of war might have blended us into a more compact nation and might have removed even the great political problem that remains to be touched.</P>
    <P>Most of our problems must be settled along economic rather than political or national lines.  The young people leaving Ireland to go to Canada and other countries are doing so because they believe a better future can be worked out for themselves and their children in those countries.  Often, they are not just young men following in the tradition of the Gael who likes to wander the seven seas.  Some of those who have gone enjoyed good positions in this country.  Some were men who had the opportunities of a university education, who were brought up in a tradition that should allow them to appreciate a fuller life and even to appreciate the advantages enjoyed in the society in which we live, which, certainly, is not completely materialistic.</P>
    <P>If we wish to solve our economic problems, we must, even at this eleventh hour, devote all our energies to creating the conditions necessary for increased production on the land.  One of the reasons we have not had the success which the facilities available suggest that we should have is that the system of land tenure is antiquated. Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture might mention this matter at a later stage because he must be primarily interested.</P>
    <P>My view is that we should do away with the 11 months system and the conacre system as operated in this country.  Leasing of land should be allowed.  Early in January our local papers contain pages of advertisements for the letting of land by conacre or grazing by the 11 months system.  Such a system does not afford any opportunity to the young man from the town or country of working on the land.  If land could be obtained on lease, as is the position in Britain and other countries, there would be many new entrants to the land&mdash;second and third sons of progressive farmers, thrifty agricultural labourers and even persons living in towns, many of whom are not so far removed from the land, who <Col N="590" /> would welcome the opportunity of working a farm and showing they could make a success of it.</P>
    <P>The present system is a dead hand. I know that the previous Government asked the Department of Lands to review this system and to report on it. I would ask the Minister for Agriculture to interest himself in that aspect of the problem.  If the Department of Lands have made that survey and that report, perhaps the recommendations would be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas and legislative effect given to a system which would allow the young men of Ireland to show that they can work the land efficiently, applying scientific methods, such as those that Senator Quinlan, Senator Baxter and others well acquainted with this problem would advocate.  Work the system that the previous and the present Minister for Agriculture would like to have worked.  The vital and progressive spirit that is wanted will not be got until we change the present system of land tenure.  You have the oldest son remaining on, until 50 years of age or more, before he can get married.  If that opportunity of renting or leasing a farm were there for him, he might get out and do something for himself.  That also applies to the second and third sons, many of whom are forced to work in London or Birmingham, or emigrate to other parts of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Finance Bill, I said I believed that the burden of taxation imposed by State Departments and local authorities was one of the greatest deterrents that we had on our economy.  I understand local and State taxation takes the appalling sum of 45 per cent. of our entire revenues. I have been informed by an economist that that is about equivalent to the amount that was taken in Britain during the worst period of the last total war.  If that 45 per cent. were being taken by the State to declare war on the ills which we have in this country, we could justify it.  If it is taken, and we can be indicted to some extent as being responsible, for the purpose of preserving institutions of State which the country is not in a position to sustain, it is time we examined <Col N="591" /> the problem and saw where we can save money which would allow conditions to be provided in which the productive return of people who earn&mdash; let them be workers or employers&mdash;will not be taxed to that extent.  That appalling total of 45 per cent. of what everybody earns and produces is being taken and spent by the State.</P>
    <P>I said I would indicate where I thought some savings should take place.  Some months ago, a speaker on Radio Eireann, after the 1.30 p.m. news, dealt with the Budget.  He mentioned that out of every £21 provided for emergency schemes, only £7 found its way into the pockets of the people employed on these schemes.  I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that when he is preparing the next Estimates he might consider whether it would be more desirable to use the £658,000 provided for emergency schemes on more productive schemes. I believe emergency schemes are in their essence defeatist.  The money should be provided for some form of really productive work.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the £2,637,000 which is devoted to retiral allowances and Army pensions.  Several chairmen of leading insurance companies in Britain have recently spoken about the enormous burden of pensions.  The chairman of the Prudential Insurance Company, one of the largest insurance companies in the world, as reported in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 19th May, said: &ldquo;The proper sequence of events is that savings should take place and that these savings should be invested to fructify increased production&rdquo;.  The whole burden of his speech was that if the money collected from people which went to build up the pension fund was not invested, there was no real advantage. Investment in sound productive enterprise would pay the expense of the fund.  That is not being done in this country and it is putting a strain on the economy which we are not able to support.  With the present burden of 45 per cent. taxation, we are not able to do it.</P>
    <P>I also believe, and it has been suggested to me by a man who was a police officer in one of the Commonwealth <Col N="592" /> countries, that a great deal of money could be saved on the Garda. Síochána if there were fewer stations and the Gardaí were made more mobile.  If that were done, the cost of supporting the force would be considerably less than the £4,750,000 demanded under this heading.</P>
    <P>I often wonder what the Department of Industry and Commerce gets for the £8,250,000 spent by it.  I know they must make grants to such desirable projects as are covered by the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Act passed last November to provide much of those benefits to the rest of the country.  Grants are not made available to factories, the owners of which wish to extend their businesses.  I would ask the Minister to take a note of this because it is very important.  If one wants to start a new industry, one has to employ people with the technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;.  It may happen that people employed who are supposed to have the technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; do not have it and difficulties may arise. Money has been lost in that way, money which we could not afford to lose when the business was not a success.</P>
    <P>Money will be granted for the starting of new factories, but where factories have the technical &ldquo;know-how,&rdquo; and where they are producing goods for the home market and wish to extend for the production of goods for export, no grant-in-aid will be made. That is a defect as the law stands.  If the Minister for Finance can have that remedied, it might do a great deal of good to our economy if these proven Irish industries which wish to extend were helped.  It would be a lesser gamble than starting a new industry. Very often, new industries involve the training of new staffs and people do not expect them to pay their way for some years.  The old established industries would, if aid were given, be in a position to pay their way immediately. Paying its way is important because it contributes some of the money for the things the Government have to undertake, and also contributes to local authority taxation and is a help to the common weal.</P>
    <P>A sum of nearly £4,000,000 is provided to support the various transport <Col N="593" /> services, both inland and sea transport. A commission has recently reported on inland transport and we will probably get an opportunity of discussing that report in the future.  I believe, however, that one of the main disabilities under which the Irish transport system operates is that the whole organisation was based on the British model where they had a frequency of transport that was unknown in Ireland.  Here we pay a stationmaster at every little wayside stop.  It is almost the same as if every sub-postmistress were a whole-time permanent official.  If we had that system operating in the postal service, it would probably cost a couple of shillings to post a letter.  That problem is at the root of our transport difficulties and that has been suggested to me by people who served on the old Railway Rates Tribunal.</P>
    <P>One of the largest figures we have to turn our attention to in the Book of Estimates is the total of over £33,750,000 for social insurance, social assistance and health.  Savings will have to be made in the coming year on that head.  One of the greatest difficulties of our economy at present is that we are living next to a country that has adopted, if you like, the system of the welfare State.  Many observers hold that Britain is to-day living beyond her means, taking the long-term view.  She is not able to sustain her position as the great carrying country of the world.  Some 25 years ago or so she had nearly 50 per cent. of the total shipping of the world. To-day her percentage has gone down to about 17½ per cent. and the difficulty for us and the difficulty for many people in Europe is that she is raising the costs on us and on those people and she is leaving it open to the Asiatics&mdash;the Japanese and others&mdash;to compete on more than favourable terms.  That is a problem that will have to be solved by the common sense not alone of the general body of the public but particularly of trade unions and industrialists.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what Senator O'Brien has said, that we know the problem here.  Many of those best qualified, who have spent their lives studying our economic problems &mdash;they may not all agree in detail but <Col N="594" /> they agree in a general sense&mdash;know the problem, but many of us do not want to face it.  I believe we are not facing it to-day.  On the last day I said that Deputy Dr. Ryan was now Minister for Finance in a Government which had a larger majority than any Government ever entrusted with this high responsibility since this State was established. The next few years will probably be vital for Ireland, and it behoves all of us in public life to co-operate with the Government and with everyone in the country to try and solve these problems.  However, we must, as Senator O'Brien said, apply the remedies which are the proper ones to solve this great problem.  If we do we shall have results.  If we do not, history will record that we were unworthy of our generation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is for a very substantial sum of money and it covers a very wide field.  The higher economics aspect has been dealt with by Senator O'Brien but the aspect of the ordinary everyday wants of the people is catered for by people like myself. The provisions of this Bill were denounced from all sides by the opponents of the Fianna Fáil Party, but it may not be out of place to recall that whatever hardships may be involved are due entirely to the mismanagement of the Coalition Government.  It is worth while to contrast the Appropriation Bill now introduced with what was served up to the country some 12 months ago when the then Government presented us, not with an Appropriation Bill but with three separate Budgets.  That was done for one purpose, to mislead the public mind and to cover up the failure of the Coalition Government in their efforts to fulfil some of the rosy promises which they had made and which brought them into office two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill cannot be understood except in the light of the consequences of the previous three Budgets.  The actions of the previous Government were responsible for a period of unemployment unequalled in the history of the country.  Trade and industry were depressed; the cost of living had skyrocketed; <Col N="595" /> rates on every local body in the country had reached an all-time record of severity, and we were facing great difficulty in small counties like my own with a very low valuation.</P>
    <P>The effect of this Bill has been to restore public confidence.  People connected with factory and farm who were unable to hold on to their employment during the Coalition period of office have now some assurance in relation to their labour and their service. Many thousands of people who lost their employment when the Coalition Government was in office have now the satisfaction of seeing opportunities opening up so that they can secure employment and earn a reasonable living.</P>
    <P>It is unwise to contend that all these difficulties can be overcome without some element of sacrifice being called for, but there is this satisfaction.  Last year the Government imposed industrial and commercial levies, increased the cost of telegrams, telephones and postage generally, and the people, realising the heavy burden of debt that had been imposed on the country, decided to hand over the affairs of the nation to the present Government.  We know that the steps taken to-day are absolutely essential.  They are not the only ones that will lead to economic and social recovery. Burdens on a limited few were imposed by the removal of the food subsidies.  Their removal created a problem to some extent for certain workers.  However, many of the workers have now a better prospect of steady employment than they had under the Coalition Government. Married workers with families will benefit by increases in children's allowances.  Old age pensioners and other such beneficiaries will have their burdens offset to some extent by increased allowances.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the position of public bodies throughout the country whose rates have been soaring to such an extent.  Last February, the Louth County Council received a deputation from the Louth branch of the National Farmers' Association.  The deputation wanted to discuss with us the problem <Col N="596" /> of the rate we would have to face in the ensuing financial year.  That deputation represented the farmers in the truest sense of the word.  Their roots went back for generations and they had never before had reason to complain. They pleaded with us to call a halt when examining our estimates some weeks later.  We went into the details supplied to us by those farmers and learned that none of them had any profits to bank.</P>
    <P>Most of these things arose because of promises made by the Coalition groups before they took office two and a half years ago.  Last June twelve months, we had another example of the methods employed by the Coalition Government.  At that time, the Minister for Health summoned a conference of resident medical superintendents of mental hospitals from all over the country.  They were told to carry out a series of improvements in their hospitals.  The cost apparently did not matter.  The walls surrounding each institution were to be reduced to a height of not more than four feet; every footpath, roadway, passageway and towpath was to be concreted; every inmate was to be provided with a locker wherein to keep all his effects; each employee of these institutions was also to be provided with a special locker in which to keep his effects.</P>
    <P>We came to the conclusion that it would take another building near each institution to provide for all these new amenities.  We had a consultation among ourselves in the visiting committee. Louth is a small county with a valuation of £320,000, where 1/- in the £ gives only £16,000, where 1d. brings in only £1,333 and where we have a rate of 35/4¼ in the £.  We discussed this thing.  Of course the visiting committee, most of whom are members of the county council, realising the financial position, saw that we could not possibly agree with the proposals made in the Minister's recommendation. On the following Monday morning, the county council had before it a circular letter from the same Department to the effect that there were to be no further increases, particularly in the health services, and that anything over the stipulated <Col N="597" /> expenditure for 1956-57 would have to be met from the rates.</P>
    <P>These are only a few of the difficulties brought about by the Coalition Government.  Certain Senators have criticised the administration of institutions like those I have mentioned. The best thing they could do&mdash;and I am issuing the invitation now&mdash;would be to come down to our mental hospital, to one of our monthly meetings, and see how the affairs of the hospital are conducted.  I feel sure that what I claim for County Louth can be claimed for every other county.  I hope this Government will be able to lift us out of the rut into which we were landed by the Coalition Administration.  We have been criticised about the services provided in mental hospitals.  I wish to say, without fear of contradiction, that inmates in our institution are much better off than they would be at home with their own people.  They get personal attention which, I am afraid, is more than they would get in their own homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief and shall deal only with a few of the points raised by other Senators.  Senator Stanford referred to the cut in the grant for secondary education.  I must say with him that I deplore very much the cutting of grants for secondary schools in this or any other country.  In other countries, grants for educational purposes are going up and up.  They want scientists and technicians.  The future industrial and agricultural progress of this country depend on the men who come out of secondary schools and I think it is a great pity we should have cut the grants for those schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, Senator Donegan referred to the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants being discontinued.  I must say that I agree with cuts in 50 or 60 per cent. of the grants issued under that Act.  What happened was that we had large schemes carried out under which successful drainage work was the outcome.  However, three years after these works were done, the drains were as bad as they were at the beginning. I would submit that the only way in which an Act like that could be successful is by bringing in legislation <Col N="598" /> which would compel&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;compel&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;the benefiting farmers to keep the drains clear, once the work had been done by the local authorities.  That was done in Northern Ireland in many instances.  If the farmers did not clear those drains, the local authority came in and charged the farmers the cost of clearing them which was probably greater than the work would have cost if the farmers had done the job themselves originally.</P>
    <P>I should like to see greater assistance rendered to the smaller farmers throughout the country.  I am glad to see that the Minister for Agriculture is standing in for the Minister for Finance at the moment because most of my remarks will be directed towards his Department.  There are small farmers in my county and in Leitrim, Roscommon and throughout the western seaboard, who get no advantage out of wheat schemes, barley schemes, beet schemes, or any of those other schemes which are of great assistance and of great financial benefit to the larger farmers in the East and South.</P>
    <P>These small farmers are to some extent the backbone of the cattle industry and it is from them the buyers in the Midlands and the eastern part of the country buy a great deal of the stores.  Because they are small farmers they have no facilities for travel, no need to travel, and do not travel, and do not learn. Their education is derived solely from their fathers or grandfathers.  Son succeeds father, rears a few cattle, keeps a few cows and never gets an opportunity to educate himself even in connection with his farm.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more interest shown in small farmers' sons.  One way of showing it would be by means of lectures at national schools given perhaps by officials of the Department or of the committee of agriculture or well qualified local farmers so as to get boys and even girls interested in agriculture. Frankly, I am very disappointed with the position of vocational schools in my county.  Probably the same applies all over.  Pupils go rather because they are sent and seem to have no interest in their education. A few of them go to get jobs in garages <Col N="599" /> and the girls become typists or accept some other posts in city offices, but I should like to see those schools become almost agricultural schools to encourage small farmers' sons to learn a little more.  That is the only place, apart from the national schools, where we can teach them anything.  If we get them interested in farming topics I think we shall get more production from the land.  If we had just a little more production, even one more store beast on every farm what a difference it would have made in the balance of payments position during the first six months of the year.</P>
    <P>Other means that might be availed of to interest small farmers' sons would be lectures on cattle production, calf-rearing and grassland.  One great difficulty with the small farmers is that they do not sow the proper seeds, if any at all, when letting out land. When compulsory tillage was in force in Northern Ireland there was a scheme which I can recommend to the Minister here by which the Department supplied certified grass seed or instructed companies to supply certified grass mixtures suitable for the land for which they were to be used.  We could quite easily have grass seed mixtures that would suit the type of land about which Senator Baxter spoke; we could have seed mixtures to suit bog land, upland, moorland, dry land and sour land.  If these mixtures were made up for the farmer who had no opportunity of studying the matter it would greatly improve our grassland and, in turn, production.</P>
    <P>Money has been provided for market research.  I should like some of that money to be spent on appointing what we might call agricultural attaches at embassies in various countries, in Britain, France and Germany and in countries to which we are likely to export agricultural produce.  I should like to have better information in advance on markets that may be available. That information should be published, not confined to the larger exporters, so that the farmers could see what they are to aim at in the future. I do not want to have academic farmers or lower officials of some Department <Col N="600" /> appointed.  For the next few years I suggest we want the keymen of the Department of Agriculture sent on those jobs to study markets and to send back word in regard to the matters for which we should plan in our farms.</P>
    <P>If we had such men alive to the position at the present time in the British markets, surely farmers who sold cattle last October would have got some warning that there would be a great demand for store cattle in Britain when the spring came?  Surely we would have had a greater opportunity of taking part in the European market to which Britain is sending her cattle now?  Part of that market should have been our market.  But if we had that information would we be able to send the cattle?  Have we the boats available? I am afraid we have not.</P>
    <P>Last night Senator Donegan drew the attention of the House to the fact that in Northern Ireland the Government build factories because they want industrialists to come in and give employment.  Could we not build boats in which to send our cattle to wherever the market was?  We could use those boats for cross-Channel transport and I believe the exporters would be glad to get them.  I do not see why the Government should not build those boats and have them ready for the market when it is possible to get it.  Britain now gets the market. They may be sending subsidised cattle, but if we take off the freight from here to, say, the north of England and from the north of England down and across the Channel to the Continent, I do not see why we could not compete in that market if necessary.</P>
    <P>I feel we should give more education and provide more interest and information for the small farmers who are at present in a somewhat stagnant situation with no outlook and very little incentive to risk any small capital they have on schemes of their own when they do not know what will happen to the markets because they have not sufficient information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over the whole aspect of our national economy.  In my view, there are two attitudes of mind revealed in <Col N="601" /> this debate which are of serious consequence to-day in that they affect the whole attitude of our people towards our future progress.  They are, first of all, the attitude of mind we had last night from Senator Donegan of political play-acting in dealing with serious Bills of this kind.  The second matter affecting us adversely is this pessimism so much abroad to-day.  We had it from Senator Michael Hayes last night when he talked about the pessimism of the younger generation and the desperate situation in which this country finds itself.</P>
      <P>Senator Donegan came out with all the old catch-cries last night: the wisdom of spending money on Store Street, on pulling up tramlines in Dublin and a lot of these irrelevancies. They were very popular during the 1954 General Election when they were temporarily successful in that they succeeded in ousting a Fianna Fáil Government in 1954.  Three years later, in 1957, the people showed in another general election that that sort of political stunting was no longer to their liking and that they had learned it was of no help whatever in the governing of this country.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to indulge in any of that political play-acting.  If we are to get down to remedying the problems affecting the country and planning ahead for the future in a practical way, we shall have to stop this political play-acting and end what Senator O'Brien described as &ldquo;a reluctance to take advice which is politically unpalatable and unpopular.&rdquo;  If we get this political play-acting out of our system and get down to doing the right thing in a courageous and honest fashion, we can solve many of our problems.</P>
      <P>Secondly there is this question of pessimism.  This country is not in a bad state basically.  It was a grand thing to hear Senator Professor O'Brien say that.  The basic position of the country is sound.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our very sound economy was temporarily disrupted over the past few years.  Serious problems were created through incompetence <Col N="602" /> and shilly-shallying in Government. It is important that men in public life should realise that this is a basically sound country which can be made into a great country where we can create an expanding economy and give more employment to our people.</P>
      <P>That sound economy we have here touched the nadir in the year 1956.  In that year there were fewer people employed in agriculture than in 1955, fewer in industry and there was the lowest number of people at work in this State since 1922.  The value of agricultural output was down; the volume of industrial production was down.  This was caused by a deliberate Government policy which brought about a recession in trade by deliberate restriction on hire purchase and by restrictions in the form of import levies and lack of banking accommodation.</P>
      <P>This general recession which we had in 1956 is a serious problem, but it is not a desperate situation, as Senator Hayes thinks it is.  It can be remedied by strong, courageous Government. This Appropriation Bill is a step in the direction towards strong, courageous Government.  It is a step away from what Senator O'Brien described as &ldquo;the reluctance to take advice which is politically unpalatable or unpopular&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this Appropriation Bill the Minister has made an Estimate for the Supply Services for the year 1957-58 of £106,000,000.  That is a cut of £6,000,000 on the Estimate prepared by his predecessor for the same Supply Services. There is a practical example of a cut in current Government expenditure at the appropriate time.  The previous Minister for Finance made an Estimate for the Supply Services for the year 1957-58 involving an expenditure of £112,000,000.  The present Minister has cut it down to £106,000,000.  That is a practical step forward in balancing the Minister's current account and cutting it down as much as possible.  It is a real economy, such as Senator O'Donovan would desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having done that, having pruned the Estimate for the Supply Services in the coming year, the Minister has got down to deal with the serious problem <Col N="603" /> left to him by the previous Government. That is the serious problem I referred to&mdash;the unemployment we had in 1956 caused by the restrictions imposed. The Minister has got down to it by increasing State capital investment in 1957-58 by £2,200,000 over the amount spent last year.  That money will be principally devoted towards the building of houses.  I do not need to elaborate on the recession in the building trade which took place last year.  That has been improved by the authorisation by the Minister of extra money to be made available to local authorities from the Local Loans Fund. That is the major item in this increased capital investment by the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan last night criticised expenditure on social projects such as this.  The Senator should know well that it is an established fact that this type of social investment in housing, roads, runways at Shannon Airport and so on is long-term investment and can only be done by the State.  No private individual could undertake it.  It is a contribution by the Government toward solving the unemployment problem. When the present Government decided to expend an extra £2,000,000 odd on capital projects in the coming year, it was enabled to do so by cutting down on its current expenditure on the Supply Services.  That was the method by which the Government was enabled to improve its capital investment and so reduce the unemployment figures during the next year.</P>
    <P>The Government, besides balancing the Budget and increasing its own capital investment programme, has also turned its mind to the basic problem, which is to export more.  It is all very well to talk about building up agricultural and industrial production, but if we really want to solve the problem we must be able to market the output from industry and agriculture and, in particular, we must be able to market a growing volume of the output in countries abroad.  In agriculture the problem is a long-term problem, a problem of having a growing volume of State investment in our agricultural colleges and schools and in agricultural education generally.  The Minister for <Col N="604" /> Agriculture has announced already that his Bill on the Agricultural Institute will be coming before us in the next few months.  That is a practical step forward, a long-term State investment in agricultural research and education.</P>
    <P>As regards other aspects of agricultural production, we had a contribution from Senator Baxter, in which he talked about spending money on bog lands and bringing them into cultivation. That may be an admirable idea, but I would think it more important to get land which we have in production already producing more.  That is a more immediate problem and a problem which only means increased application of lime and fertilisers to the lands already in production.  That is the first problem, before moving on to the bog lands and other marginal lands described by Senator Baxter.</P>
    <P>What the present Government has done, within a month of coming into office, with regard to improving agricultural production, is well known. Within a month, the Government provided the sum shown in this Appropriation Bill, £250,000, for agricultural marketing abroad.  That is £250,000 towards the improvement of agricultural marketing methods, so that we can export more.  That is a practical step taken by the Government within a month of coming into office.  The farming community know well, however much we improve our grassland by improved application of lime and fertilisers, however much we improve agricultural training and research methods, that is all of no value unless we market more abroad.  Here is a practical step by the Government towards improving our marketing position. Within the next year I am sure we will have more details as to how that money is to be spent.</P>
    <P>On to-day's paper we had a big example also in another item of progress with regard to agriculture.  We see that the N.F.A. have announced, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, that our barley needs at home will be almost entirely supplied by home-grown barley.  In other words, maize will be, by the end of this year, practically supplanted by home-grown barley for the feeding of pigs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very damaging to the future of the country&mdash;and I mean that, in all sincerity.  I was not claiming credit for our Minister for Agriculture, for the heartening progress in regard to our barley production; but I say it has always been part of the policy of the Party to which I am proud to belong, that we should supply all our foodstuffs and bread needs by <Col N="606" /> crops grown in this country.  That has always been a fundamental part of our policy, that we keep ourselves as free as possible from the import of foreign foodstuffs and foreign wheat.  It has been our basic principle and it is a good thing we are at last nearly achieving it.  It is a fine thing that we see the prospect of an all-Irish wheat loaf in the near future.  Within the next year, we may see the situation here where Irish grown wheat is processed or baked into a completely Irish loaf and all our feeding stuffs are supplied by home-grown barley.  That is a sign we are getting somewhere and achieving something.</P>
      <P>Basically, the agricultural problem is a long-term one.  I said that in the debate on the Finance Bill and still think that is the case.  The problem of treating our grasslands properly, the problem of supplying our home feeding needs from crops grown at home, the problem of finding markets abroad&mdash; these are basic problems.  Especially the last problem is a basic one and that is why the Government is to be congratulated on taking the step of devoting £250,000 to marketing.</P>
      <P>The farmer knows that, in the past, increased production meant lower prices.  The only thing to do is to broaden the basis of the market.  If he is to produce more, it will not then be for the same market but for a broader one.  We must elbow ourselves out into broader external markets. That is why the Government saw fit and thought it desirable, within a month of coming into office, to devote £250,000 to the objective of getting markets abroad for agricultural produce.  That is progress on the agricultural side.  That practical help has been given by the Government in this Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards industry, which is the other leg of our national economic activity, the Government has taken the practical step of giving fiscal concessions, which we discussed last week on the Finance Bill.  It is giving a very practical fiscal concession, that is, that any industrialist&mdash;whether an outsider or a native&mdash;starting industry here, in so far as he is producing goods for export, will get 100 per cent. remission <Col N="607" /> of income-tax and corporation profits tax, for five years.  I suggest to the Minister that that position could be improved.  I would think a period of ten or even 20 years would be an improved concession, in such a vital sphere.  It is fundamental that we must increase our exports.  The Government has taken a big step in that direction.  A remission of 100 per cent. in the case of new industry which is exporting, in regard to income-tax and corporation profits tax on profits derived from that export, is a real step in the right direction.  Perhaps a further step could be taken, in some other Finance Bill, in view of the importance of this matter, by extending that to ten or even 20 years.  There is room for improvement there.</P>
    <P>If the unemployment problem&mdash; which has been endemic in this country, and which was aggravated and exaggerated last year by Government policy&mdash;is to be really tackled, it can only be on the basis of increased industrial expansion.  Improved agriculture and improved agricultural production may in the long run reduce the unemployment figures, but I am afraid it is only the long run.  Agricultural improvement now will not give increased employment this year or the year after: it will only, in the long run, put increased savings in the pockets of farmers, which can be devoted to home industry.  It is only in the long run that agriculture can help unemployment. As regards the short term, unemployment generally can only be relieved by a rapid industrial expansion, which is to be achieved only by the fiscal concessions in income-tax and corporation profits tax of which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>Further, in regard to industrial expansion, by which we can bring about a growing volume of employment, the other aspect of it is that the risk capital is not in this country at the moment for that rapid industrial expansion. The risk capital is not here and we must face up to that problem. I am glad to see that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in particular, has announced recently that he is aware of that problem.  Senators may have noticed that one of the first Bills <Col N="608" /> to be introduced after the Recess is a Bill to amend the Control of Manufactures Act.  That is a very practical step forward in the way of getting outside capital.  Risk capital is not here for rapid industrial expansion and that expansion is necessary in order to solve the unemployment problem. Therefore, we must get in risk capital from outside.  We have not the native risk capital here; we have no money market here and no risk capital in the hands of people in this country.</P>
    <P>It is along those lines that the present Government has seen fit to think.  In its short spell of time in office it has tackled these basic problems. In particular, it has tackled the basic problem of providing more employment at home.  They have the key to that problem in the single word &ldquo;exports&rdquo;.  It is the basic key to solving our unemployment.  We must export more unless we are to have recurring balance of payment crises.  The tragedy in this country since 1922 is that every time we seem to be making real progress towards a greater volume of investment activity, it has been halted or hindered by a balance of payments crisis.  We had a crisis over the past two years.  We had the crisis of 1956 and the crisis of 1955.  That is recurring and is due to the fact that we are not exporting enough.</P>
    <P>If we export more, we shall not have a balance of payments crisis.  The Government has seized on that as the key to the country's problem.  If the Government follow their present pattern of activity, we can be assured of a better Ireland.  Within a month of taking office, it seized the key to our problem.  In this Bill, there is a grant of £250,000 for agricultural exports. There is a fiscal concession in the Bill towards industries geared for export and there is the announcement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the intention to amend the Control of Manufactures Act.  These are all practical steps towards the objective of increasing exports on which we can base an improving economy in which more people will be employed.</P>
    <P>The basic thing is confidence.  The present political situation is one in which the people can have confidence. <Col N="609" /> That arose because in March of this year a Party was returned with 78 seats and a clear majority in our popular Parliament, which represents the highest majority attained in our history. I will not even talk about that particular Party being Fianna Fáil. The point is that some Party early this year had to get clear control of this country and had to have a guarantee that, after the election, it would be in office for four or five years, if confidence was to be induced.  That has happened.  We have that now in contradistinction to the shilly-shallying and indecision of the Coalition Government. In any Coalition where groups are pulling against each other, there is wasted effort, whereas in a Government commanding a clear and disciplined majority, there is no political play-acting.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil got into office on the single promise that it would govern the country and restore the confidence that was necessary&mdash;the confidence of banking circles, the confidence of people with money to invest, the confidence of people who give employment. This Government has given the green light to people who want to invest money in this country by virtue of the fact that it will remain in office for four or five years.  That single fact alone induces confidence in the country to-day.  That confidence was absent in this country with every Government since 1948.  The last Fianna Fáil Government had not a clear majority and in the two Coalition Governments, there was indecision and only a slender majority.  Now we have a Government commanding a clear majority and confidence is restored.  Once there is confidence, there is optimism and hope for the future and a realisation that the desperate situation about which Senator Hayes spoke last night is ending.</P>

By giving these fiscal concessions, we shall have an expanding economy over the next four or five years in which we shall experience greater agricultural and investment activity which, in turn, will mean expanding employment and reduced emigration.  The Government has got down to that job in a very practical fashion within a month of coming into office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past two days this debate has been largely nonpolitical in its approach to the Bill.  I do not propose to follow Senator Lenihan into what he so aptly describes as &ldquo;political play-acting&rdquo;. Probably most of what I say will be unpopular on both sides of the House. My friends in the trade union movement know that I have an unfortunate habit of saying unpopular things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the debate on the Appropriation Bill last year, I started off by criticising the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is an unpopular criticism all round, but I think I should more or less say the same again on this occasion.  We have had to provide increased money for travelling allowances for members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, due to the fact, as I pointed out last year, that up to the present no Government has had the courage to appreciate that the allowances paid especially to Dáil Deputies are quite inadequate and have to be supplemented by travelling allowances.  In order to live, Dáil <Col N="611" /> Deputies must drive their own cars and look for travelling allowances.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go too deeply into this subject because I know it is inclined to be unpopular and certainly I am not raising it with a view to any undesirable publicity.  I say that the Government should look at this problem of the allowances to Deputies. The allowance is quite inadequate to attract the best quality people to enter the Dáil, to leave a job and be paid an allowance of £12 per week.  We all appreciate that, for a Deputy, it is quite inadequate.  It would be all right for people who have busineses of their own&mdash;public-houses, farms, or those who are auctioneers, and so on. In such circumstances, membership of the Dáil, and the allowance that goes with it, is probably very good, but for the ordinary worker, manual or otherwise, the £12 a week is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I think the point of what I am saying could be illustrated if we just looked at any particular Department listed in this Book of Estimates and open at a page referring to probably one of the most important Departments. We find that the Minister&mdash;I am not saying which Minister&mdash;receives a salary of £2,125.  The Parliamentary Secretary in that same Department gets £1,560.  The Secretary of that Department gets £3,310.  The Assistant Secretaries seem to have a salary of about £2,430.  I am not saying that the officials are overpaid as I should imagine they are worth every pound mentioned there.  Surely, however, it is ridiculous that the Minister of an important Department&mdash;who must accept the responsibility and who should be and must be a man of ability &mdash;is paid a lower salary than the Secretary to his Department?  The Minister is, under our democratic Government, the man responsible and it is, as I say, fantastic that you have the situation that his officials under him&mdash;worthy men and all as they are, they are not overpaid&mdash;have more than the Minister himself.  That illustrates the position into which we have allowed the remuneration of our Parliamentarians, our T.D.s and Senators, to slip.  It is now quite inadequate <Col N="612" /> and it largely accounts for the fact that you must have an increased allowance year after year for the travelling of T.D.s and Senators.</P>
    <P>Another unpopular question is the subsidisation of the Restaurant in Leinster House.  I said last year that I failed completely to understand why it should be necessary to subsidise the Restaurant, which has a bar attached to it, to the extent of £2,000 per annum, or about £40 a week.  This year, the subsidy has been cut to £1,600.  I should imagine that last year the £2,000 was not actually spent.  It was not in 1955-56.  But even £1,600 is fantastic.  We all know that it is not that the food is particularly cheap; it is not.  The food is as dear as in any outside restaurant and it seems that the position should be looked into.  It is wrong that the taxpayers' money should be used for this purpose.  Even though it hurts ourselves, it is our first duty to look into expenses on our home ground; if we do not, then the people outside cannot have very much faith in what we say.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to come to is the question of the enforcement of the law.  I am not referring to any internment camps at the moment, but simply the enforcement of the ordinary traffic regulations.  I think we are tending to bring the law into disrepute by not enforcing the minor regulations.  For instance, many of us passing up Kildare Street to come in here to the Dáil or Seanad, know that no matter what signs are up about parking, there is inevitably parking on both sides of the road.  We ourselves probably offend in that regard.  We know there is very little attempt to enforce the law, although some months ago we had a statement that there was to be enforcement of the traffic regulations in the City of Dublin, but the whole thing seems to have pretered out and we know that very little has been done about it.</P>
    <P>We can see the same thing with regard to cyclists careering all over the road, going without lights and apparently no attempt is made to check them or prosecute them.  I am not criticising individual members of the Garda.  What I am suggesting is that it <Col N="613" /> seems to be the policy not to enforce the law.  Whether the Department has arrived at the decision that it is not worth while bringing prosecutions, or that the fines imposed are inadequate, I do not know.  I am suggesting that it is very bad that the law should be ignored completely and especially by our younger people.  They know that no matter what is said about the necessity of having a light on bicycles, and a reflector, in fact they can pass members of the Garda and usually nothing is said to them, and their names are not taken.</P>
    <P>A lot of time in this debate has been devoted to the question of the Irish language.  I warned the Seanad at the start that I was going to say things that would be unpopular.  I was struck by an appeal made by two Senators that we should approach the problems of the country with honesty and that we should not be afraid to say what we think.  I want to say right away that the criticisms that I make are not made in any spirit of cynicism, but rather in the hope that we would be really honest and face up to the actual situation.  If one thinks for a moment about the type of speech which we hear in this House&mdash;and there are now quite a few Senators of what I might call the younger generation&mdash;one will find that none of them&mdash;at least none that I have heard so far&mdash;have spoken in Irish.  Those are the people, and I am one of them myself, who have had the benefit of education since this State was founded.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that compulsion in regard to the Irish language has failed and that we should appreciate that fact and have the honesty to accept it. Senator Kissane said that, in fact, there was no compulsion and it seemed to me that later on in his speech he went on to argue, in effect, for additional compulsion.  We were told that there should be a compulsory oral examination for the primary and intermediate certificate and that the universities should be obliged to have Irish as one of the compulsory subjects in the entrance examination.  I hope that the universities will have the courage to stand out against any more compulsion in this respect.  I say that <Col N="614" /> the will to make this country an Irish-speaking country is not there.  I do not see that any of us are any less Irishmen because that will is not there.  I think that Senator Mullins is just as good an Irishman as Senator Kissane&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I beg his pardon; I did not think he started off in Irish.  In any case, let me say that I think I am attempting, in all honesty, to express the views of quite a number of my generation.  Our approach to it is that we have gone through the schools; we have learned Irish and the methods that were used to teach us Irish have not left us with any love of the language; and as soon as we leave school we forget the Irish language.  May be we are worse Irishmen than those of the generation that preceded us.  I doubt if we have as much courage as that generation, but we happen to be the generation that is here and growing up.</P>
      <P>We feel that the people, as far as we can discover, have not given this Government or any Government the mandate to attempt or to keep on attempting to turn this country into an Irish-speaking country.  Quite frankly, the majority of the younger generation do not seem to see value in it.  They think they can be quite as good Irishmen even if they speak what some of you would term the foreigner's language.  We regard it as our native tongue.  We have been born into it and we have learned to speak it.  Even though we have learned to speak Irish, we forget it as soon as we leave school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warned Senators that I would say unpopular things, but I appeal at least for your understanding.  I do not speak in a spirit of criticism, but in the spirit of honesty I hope.  I do not think that these are simply my personal views.  I spoke to many of my generation about this problem and the <Col N="615" /> common idea seems to be that we do not quite see what it is all about.  We think it is wasted effort to attempt to turn this country into a Gaelic speaking country.  It certainly cannot be denied that it has failed up to the present and we are the generation who got all those opportunities.  Perhaps we were unworthy, but it is the older Senators who speak in Irish.  The younger people, even if they have come through the national schools, the secondary schools or the universities, inevitably speak in English.</P>
    <P>As I am on the subject of education, might I take up Senator Mullins in regard to history?  Again, a lot of our generation feel that history is taught with a particular slant at the present time and, indeed, worry as to whether our children going to those schools may not be given that same sort of slant.  Some of us worry as to whether, in fact, that is the explanation for the type of demonstrations of patriotism which we have had in recent years.  I would say, not in any sense of flattery, that the majority of the people who have been involved in raids in the North are sincere young men.  They are probably the best of our generation and probably the bravest, but I feel that because of the teaching of history, they have been given that particular slant which we think is wrong and which we think is not for the benefit of the nation and which is certainly only pushing back the day of the final abolition of Partition.</P>
    <P>I wonder have any inquiries been made as to the type of school through which these people have gone.  There is a suspicion&mdash;might I call it more properly a fear?&mdash;that some sections of our teaching profession tend to educate with a slant which produces this type of young people, foolish but sincere. They are teaching against the interests of this country and against the teachings of their Church.  We wonder, in fact, whether this suspicion or fear of ours is well grounded and whether there can be any link between the schools through which they have gone and what has been happening in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington probably twitted us about the fact that, when <Col N="616" /> he put down a motion a year or two years ago, he could not find anybody in the Seanad to second or support him. He now says that we are all in agreement and that we have all fallen in behind him.  He is right to a certain extent, but he overlooks the fact that public opinion has changed from what it was a year, 18 months or two years ago.  Public opinion has now come round to a sensible viewpoint.  It has come to appreciate that this type of action is not in support of our fellow countrymen in the North and certainly would not end or help to end Partition.</P>
    <P>I have some knowledge of the North. I think I have more knowledge of the North than many fellow-Cork people who have gone there on surprise visits. I have many friends in the North, both orange and green.  I have been asked by some of them, Catholics particularly, to say, whenever I got the opportunity, that this type of action is of no help whatever to them; that they are living in the Six Counties and attempting to bring up their families, and that this type of action, if persisted in, will do no good for them. Instead, it will create very great difficulties.</P>
    <P>I know that public opinion has changed somewhat but I know also that as long ago as November last the Provisional United Trade Union Movement issued a statement on behalf of the workers asking the people of Ireland as a whole to renounce violence as a means of achieving any political ends in the country.  That was the view of the trade union movement.  I hope it is a view which will now be generally accepted in the country by the people who claim to love Ireland better than we do and who should see that this sort of action will do no good.  Up to the present there has rather surprisingly been no reference to another difficulty further South, namely, the difficulty in Fethard-on-Sea.  I do not want to say very much on this matter at all.</P>

      <P>I did not want to discuss it, except to suggest that it is an <Col N="617" /> example which if followed in Northern Ireland, would grieve us very much.  I hope it will not continue.  Might I turn to a more mundane subject&mdash;the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce?  I do not know whether I am in order, but I shall have to risk it when I come to the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce. I should like to take the opportunity of withdrawing a statement I made here on the debate on the Adjournment last Thursday.  I was referring then to the failure of the Minister to make an Order, as requested, by the Fair Trade Commission and I was criticising the Minister. In the course of my criticism&mdash;I felt very strongly on the matter&mdash;I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now we have a report which is not being accepted and not being acted on by the Minister and it is deliberately not being circulated...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In fact, I was mistaken and I should like to take this opportunity of withdrawing that statement.  As Senators are aware, the report did reach them the following day.  My information, when I was speaking, was wrong.</P>
      <P>In relation to Industry and Commerce, my particular interest lies in the question of transport.  Before we go too deeply into this, may I say that in the Estimate for that Department, we have provision made for two airports and I notice that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General for the year 1955-56 shows that there is a loss on the operation of the two airports, Shannon and Dublin?  Between the costs of providing the services and the amounts collected in landing fees, and so on, there is a difference of about £500,000 per annum.  This sum does not take into account interest on capital so far expended of about £3,500,000.  I am not suggesting that the money is wasted.  It is money well spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the problems of internal transport, problems which have been brought very much to the fore by the report recently published by the Committee of Inquiry.  I know that that report has not yet been considered by the Minister and I shall not go deeply into it. It is the view and the desire of people engaged in public transport that the services should be operated without subsidies and that that can be done by lightening the load on public transport. The report makes one very important and one very fair point.  C.I.E., they say, is heavily over-capitalised and that capital should be reduced; by reducing it, there would be an annual saving of £803,000 per annum on the depreciation and interest charges.  That would help public transport to start off on a better basis.  It would give it a chance of operating without annual losses&mdash;losses which are very bad for the morale of the undertaking.  We shall probably have an opportunity at some later date of debating that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the G.N.R., we had a motion here last November, carried unanimously, expressing the view that, in the light of the report of the chairman of the two tribunals, the three secondary lines should not close. It has, in fact, now been agreed that these three lines will close as from 30th September next.  The statement which was issued, following upon the meeting of the two Ministers in May, refers to other questions also.  Even <Col N="619" /> though it was very carefully worded, it seems to imply that our Minister is not alone accepting that these three secondary lines should close but that also there should be a review of the agreement between the two Governments providing for the joint operation of the G.N.R.  It has been agreed that that agreement will be reviewed with effect as from 1st October, 1958.</P>
    <P>We have since learned that the Minister in the North has announced that, in all probability, the Portadown-Derry line will close after two years. This brings to the fore the question of the future of that railway, and particularly the future of Dundalk.  Dundalk is a railway centre.  Dundalk is an industrial town because Dundalk depends very largely on the railway workshops, workshops that service the whole of the G.N.R., north and south of the Border.  Apparently, it is envisaged that the G.N.R. will cease to be a joint undertaking after 1st October, 1958.  We will be left with the remnants of it here in the Republic and we shall certainly not have anything like enough work for the Dundalk workshops in the maintenance of these remnants.</P>
    <P>In Dundalk, there are some 1,200 people employed in and around these workshops.  The wages paid must be in the region of £600,000 per annum.  That is a very important factor for the town. The employees and the trade unions are very seriously concerned as to the future.  Every effort should be made to get work for these workshops. There are there skilled employees. There are there the machinery and the workshops themselves.  What will be running short is work to be done in them.  We should make every effort to continue the operation of what is left of these secondary lines radiating from Dundalk&mdash;the line to Clones, Monaghan, Castleblayney and Cavan. These are large and important towns and the responsible Minister should make every effort to keep the lines to those towns open and thereby ensure some employment in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the pressing problem of the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway.  We have provision <Col N="620" /> in the Estimates for a grant of £15,000 annually to meet the operating losses of that railway.  I am speaking from memory now.  That railway will have to close when the secondary lines in Northern Ireland close on 30th September. I should imagine that already there must be an application for a closure Order under the 1933 Act. That Act makes provision for compensation for the employees who will lose their employment as a result of closure.  I think there are over 100 of those employees in the Republic.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if consideration has been given to the question as to whether there will be finances available for the payment of compensation to those people.  The Sligo-Leitrim Railway has been maintained for years now by way of subsidy.  It cannot, I think, have any funds of its own and, under the law as it stands, compensation must be paid by the particular railway.  Before the Minister would make any closure Order, I hope that he would see to it that the necessary funds would be available for the payment of compensation to the people in the Republic who will lose their employment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the desirability of keeping open the lines radiating west from Dundalk.  It would be a considerable help in doing so if the Minister would now review the agreement which provides for the free entry of lorries from the Six Counties into the Republic.  They are allowed in free for 72 hours.  They are now extending their operations away down to the South into Cork and Kerry, taking live stock, and it cannot be denied that they are largely operating illegally. They are supposed to come in for their own goods and get out again within 72 hours.  They can pick up their own goods within this territory.  They are not supposed to pick up somebody else's goods and let them down again within the Republic.  That is in fact what they are doing.  They have already embarrassed us with the G.N.R.  Let us face up to this problem before they further embarrass public transport as a whole in the Republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I might perhaps say at the start, as <Col N="621" /> Senator Murphy has dealt with the G.N.R., that the whole question of the closure of certain branch lines of the G.N.R., and its consequences, none of which, I can assure the Senator, has been overlooked, is under active consideration and I could not say any more at the moment.</P>
      <P>This debate has proceeded over a fair length of time and it would be very difficult indeed to deal with all the points that have been raised.  I can, however, deal in a general way with some points touched upon by several Senators.</P>
      <P>One of the big considerations underlying this legislation, of course, is the provision of money, which was referred to by many Senators, and I should like to take this opportunity of referring to a recent issue that we made of Exchequer bills.  We have now had some little experience of that, and I should like to say on this occasion that it was over-subscribed, which was very gratifying, and there have been many inquiries as to whether we mean to issue these bills again and, if so, when.  Of course, there is no doubt, we will issue them again, at the very latest on 30th September, when the present bills mature, and I hope that we will be able to issue them more frequently in future.  Those who are looking for an investment for their money may be assured that we will give them every opportunity of placing their money as soon as we have an opportunity to look into it.</P>
      <P>Senators are aware that the banks have given an undertaking to re-discount these bills, if they are offered to them.  The banks intend to place any bills that they may discount on sale, so that from time to time there, probably, will be bills on the market, that is, for the first three months.  As time goes on, we may be able to arrange to have a more constant supply, as it were, of these bills available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banks also took up some of these bills and they will be prepared to sell some of their own bills also, if there is a big demand.  I think that we have every opportunity of intercepting money that is going to Britain for Treasury bills there and of giving an opportunity to people who have money <Col N="622" /> to place on short term loans.  With a little more experience, we will be able to have a more constant money market here in Exchequer bills.</P>
    <P>In replying to the debate on the Finance Bill, I said that there were certain matters raised which were more appropriate to the Appropriation Bill. One matter in particular had been raised by Senator Miss Davidson just before I got up to speak.  That was the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  It was not referred to, to any extent, in this debate, but it is only fair that I should deal with it because it was raised by some Senators on both the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson, in concluding her few remarks on the withdrawal of the food subsidies, which she condemned, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the Minister should, at the earliest date possible, review his Budget actions and look at the country from the angle of its people, its families and its homes, rather than from the angle of balanced Budgets, banking interests and cold, hard, financial considerations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is in column 392, Seanad Debates, Volume 48.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Senator Miss Davidson and other Senators that the primary consideration in all these matters is the people, the family and the home and, indeed, I think I would be right in saying that, no matter what Government is in office, whether it is a Fianna Fáil Government or any other Government, it can be taken for granted that their consideration will always be the people, the family and the home.  They may not, of course, approach any particular question in the way that, say, an individual Senator would approach it.  I think we have common ground that we are all out for the same thing, but may not do it in the same way.</P>
    <P>The balanced Budget is part of a plan.  If you like, it is not a thing to be aimed at in itself.  It has no great merit in itself, I admit, but it is part of a plan and I do not think that the banking interests come into it.  I do <Col N="623" /> not see how they could come into this. It does appear, if you like, as Senator Miss Davidson put it, a cold, hard financial consideration that the food subsidies should be withdrawn.  I said in the Dáil that I had no interest in balancing the Budget except as part of a financial policy.  It is part of a plan to raise the standard of living.  I submit again that would be the aim of every Party who might be in power, and of every Minister for Finance, to raise the standard of living of the people, of the family and of the home. With regard to banking interests, we can put them aside.  Senators will agree with me that the bankers will look after their own interests.</P>
    <P>A balanced Budget is necessary for two reasons, one of which is the maintenance of a proper balance of payments in our foreign trade.  That balance of payments cannot be maintained if you have to borrow for ordinary current expenditure.  That fact must be evident to everybody.  If we not only import what we cannot produce at home but we also import current consumable goods which we should pay for out of income, that is going to add to our imports and, therefore, it is going to affect the balance in our external payments.  A balanced Budget is also necessary in order to avoid using borrowed money for current purposes.  Every Senator who touched on that point spoke of the necessity for having more capital in order to get more productive projects going.  Any Senator who examines the financial accounts issued at the time of the Budget will see it is not easy to get the amount of capital that we require for our ordinary Government purposes, apart from the capital required by private enterprise to develop industries.</P>
    <P>I need hardly again go into the danger of an imbalance in our external payments.  As we have experienced it leads to credit restriction, which, in turn, leads to unemployment, emigration and all those very unpleasant things that we have seen are the results of not keeping our balance of payments right.  We set out to balance the Budget as part of a financial <Col N="624" /> policy.  In order to do so, we found we had to cover a very big gap.  I explained in the Dáil that I, first of all, examined how far we could raise money by additional taxation.  I found there were limits to which one could go in that respect.  For example, everybody knows if the cost of the pint of stout is increased steeply, there will be a very steep decrease in consumption, and probably nothing at all will be got as a result of the increase.  It is only by raising the price by a small amount that you can hope to get a return.  We had the experience in the past of a steep increase in the price of spirits and we lost more than we gained.</P>
    <P>I came to the conclusion it was impossible to cover the gap by means of increased taxation and that we had to cut expenditure.  The removal of the food subsidies was in the end the only way we could cover the gap.  We provided compensatory reliefs by making the following calculation.  We took the total amount of bread and butter consumed last year and, in conjunction with that, the total population.  We found the increase that would result from the removal of the subsidy on bread and butter would be 1/1 per head per week.  People will say, and quite truly, that the poorer a person is, the more bread he consumes.  That does not hold for butter, but, on the other hand, there is not a very big increase. We found we were a bit tight for money and the best we could do was to give compensation to the social assistance classes at the rate of 1/- a week, so that old age pensioners, non-contributory widow pensioners, those drawing unemployment assistance for themselves, their wives and families. or in the case of non-contributory widows for themselves and their children, were largely compensated.</P>
    <P>It may, I admit, be costing them a penny or twopence a week more to buy food for their families, but against that there was provision in the Budget, that though the maximum increase might be 3/3 per week, if there were more than there in the family children's allowances would come in in order to make up the extra cost from the second child onwards.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, more so than here, it <Col N="625" /> was put very strongly indeed that we should have got this money in some other way.  I should be very glad to hear suggestions, but I fear that the suggestions that were given both in the Dáil and here would in no way meet the bill we had to meet.  I said in the Dáil that there was no use in talking to me about a matter of £10,000 or £25,000 because it was millions of pounds we were looking for in order to cover this gap.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke mentioned emergency schemes.  We did provide in the Budget an extra £250,000 for employment and emergency schemes.  As Senators from the country know, these schemes operate under various headings, such as bog roads, rural improvements and unemployment schemes in, for instance, some village where there is a certain amount of unemployment and where a scheme may take the form of laying a new pathway.  In the cities, there are employment schemes operated as well. I agree it is a great pity that these things should be necessary.  Where you are putting in a path or taking up tramlines, there is no great productive element, but, as I pointed out when winding up the Second Reading discussion on the Finance Bill, I felt the unemployment level was very high and, if it were at all possible, we should not let it get worse than it was.</P>
    <P>We have hopes of bringing about a general improvement in the economy of the country, but that is going to take some time, for example, in building up industry.  In the meantime, we should try to maintain employment at the highest level we can.  For that reason we thought it as well to maintain the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes, and that sort of thing, and I went only as far as to bring in the same amount as was brought in last year.  My predecessor had cut last year's figure and I thought it was well to restore it to what it was.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to retirement allowances.  He made a sensible suggestion that we could cut the pensions for civil servants if we let them work on a little longer so that there would not be so many on the pensions list.  That suggestion has already been made previously.  It is a very big <Col N="626" /> question.  It has been considered by Governments and by Government Departments, over and over again, and I would not like to say at this stage whether I would be for or against it, because there are so many things that would have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The same Senator suggested that we make a saving on the Garda Síochána. The Garda Force has been reduced fairly considerably over the past couple of years.  The Senator thought that by having them in larger units and with more transport, they could do their job more economically.  I think that is the tendency, that smaller stations are being closed and more transport is being provided, but that reminds me that no matter what savings or economies are suggested, there is sure to be trouble.  If you decide to close a police barracks, you will almost certainly have a deputation from the village in which it is centred who will say it is going to ruin the place.  Some savings were made latterly in rural postal services.  Where a rural postman retired, his district was divided among three or four others.  It is extraordinary the number of letters received about the inconvenience of such a situation.  In all of these economies, therefore, no matter how small, there is a great deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>There is, I admit, a very big amount for local government, over £4,000,000. However, there is something like £2,000,000 provided for housing grants. There is also a large sum included for works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Then there are sanitary schemes, and so on.  A very small part of that money is being spent on administration.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senators that I am glad to have suggestions.  As I told the Dáil, we had so short a time before the Budget was brought in, that we could secure only a very few savings but that we meant as a Government to go into things much more fully during the year to see if substantial savings could be made in the various Departments in time to come.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary also&mdash;I am not referring now to suggestions by Senators or Deputies&mdash;the number of suggestions which come from outside <Col N="627" /> which I can say without exception are suggestions to save it on the other fellow.  I do not think I ever received a suggestion yet from any group saying: &ldquo;Take a bit off us.&rdquo; It was always a suggestion to take it off the other person.  In that connection and in connection with what Senator Murphy has said, very many made the suggestion that we should save on the salaries of T.D.s, Senators, Ministers, of course, the President, and so on.  I do not know whether Senators realise&mdash;people outside do not realise&mdash;that since 1923 when the cost of living was very much lower than it is now or if you go back to 1931 when the cost of living was lowest, Senators have received an increase of 30 per cent., Ministers 25 per cent. and Deputies 73 per cent.  There are very few other people in the country who have got such modest increases since 1931 to the present time, especially when it is remembered that it is Deputies and Senators themselves who have the power to regulate such increases.  I think everybody must admit that they have used that power very sparingly in the last 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes said the Fianna Fáil Party as a Government for 20 years had gone on consistently increasing taxation and increasing expenditure. The Fianna Fáil Party, perhaps, can claim to be original in some respects but they are certainly not original in that.  I do not think there is a country in the world that has not gone on increasing taxation and expenditure over the last 20 years, and I suppose we are taken along by the tide like everybody else.  The fact that everybody else is doing it, of course, does not excuse any Government.  I think we must agree with Senator Hayes and others that the total sum is too high and that we must do something about it.  I hope I shall be able to say, if I am spared to come before you again next year, that we have been able to effect some economies.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes appealed for national resurgence and was supported by Senator Mullins and others.  That would be very useful even from the financial point of view.  I agree with Senators that pessimism is an extremely <Col N="628" /> bad thing for any country.  If we had a more optimistic spirit among the people, a national resurgence, so that people would have more belief in their own country, it would be much easier to make progress.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of talk on education.  Senator Stanford drew attention to the fact that the grants here for education are not as high as they are in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  That is quite true but you must remember we are spending £13,000,000 a year between primary, secondary, university and technical education, and it is a very large amount of money for a country like ours.  It would be difficult indeed to supplement that to any substantial degree. Therefore, I am afraid it would be dishonest of me to promise that there will be a big improvement made in the amount spent on education, at any rate, in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullins said the primary schools were turning out Irish speakers but not good citizens.  That may be. I must say I do not know very much about that.  I am gone beyond the age now of having anybody at the primary school; I would know more about the university end.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford asked about the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham.  The Royal Hospital has been the object of much attention from Governments for many years back.  I remember as a matter of fact some few years ago when I was Minister for Health I was very anxious to get that hospital for some purpose I had in mind.  At the time I received a report that it was in fairly good order and repair but that there was a suspicion that there was some dry rot in the timbers, which I think has been attended to since.  I do not know whether it is finished or not, but I do not think there is any fear that the Royal Hospital will be neglected in any way or allowed to go into decay.  It is hoped to make good use of it as soon as its present infirmities with regard to dry rot are fixed up.</P>
    <P>To come back again to Senator Mullins's speech about Irish, I do not want to get into this discussion on Irish; we have had a fair discussion on it and we are not likely to get agreement. <Col N="629" /> However, there is one point on which I can never agree&mdash;that you should substitute oral for written Irish tests at the end of the secondary course.  Irish is one of our official languages and it would be a shame if a student could emerge after his secondary course speaking Irish and not be able to read or write it.  Therefore, I would insist that students should do a written as well as an oral paper.  It was always regarded as very essential to have the three R's, and I believe it is just as essential to have them in Irish as in English.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised by Senator Mullins had reference to An Comhairle Ealaion.  What he said was true.  The director who was there for five years, an ex-Minister, Mr. P.J. Little, had no salary, but about this time last year or some time in 1956, his five years being up, another man was appointed and the new occupant of that position is paid, I believe, £1,000 per year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rule that they do not consider applications from individuals, I should like to take the council's annual report and to give their reasons for that.  The report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Additional grants were also given to two students to enable them to complete courses in study abroad in music which had been undertaken originally with financial assistance given by the council, and to a third student in similar circumstances to continue a course of study in bronze casting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report then goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Owing to the great number of applications received for grants of this kind it was decided that no further grants to individuals would be given, other than those awarded by publicly advertised competition for scholarships or prizes.  A prize of £100 for musical composition open to Irish composers and a scholarship to the value of £500 for training abroad in the violoncello, open to students of Irish nationality, are being offered by publicly advertised competition during 1956-57.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So the council made a regulation that <Col N="630" /> they would not consider an application from a private individual.  In case anybody would care to look it up, it is on page 26 of the Report, dated March 31st, 1956.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan found fault with the spending of money on our roads and on the new Shannon runway instead of on factories.  The Shannon runway was necessary, we were assured by the powers who manage these affairs.  They said it would be absolutely necessary in four or five years' time because the planes then coming in would not be able to land at Shannon unless the new runway was in existence.  There is a small amount being spent this year on that runway. It will take three or four years to complete, and it is estimated that the cost over these three or four years will be £1,000,000.  It was put to me, as Minister for Finance, that if we did not do this job Shannon Airport would have become useless in four or five years' time.  It was a matter of saving Shannon by spending this money or of cutting our losses and letting it go. I do not think anyone in my position would have taken a different decision.</P>
    <P>As regards the making of roads, my predecessor, Deputy Sweetman, took £500,000 out of the Road Fund.  He was hard up, as Ministers for Finance often are.  I found it well to put that £500,000 back and to add another £500,000 to it.  If we did not do that, the loss of employment on the roads of the country would be seriously increased. Even with the money that is now provided, it may be difficult to continue employment at the same level as it was in 1955.  I may be criticised by Deputy Donegan for that but I think that most Senators, most Deputies and most people outside would say it was not an unreasonable thing to try to keep employment on the roads at a certain level.  Apart entirely from employment, every county in the country has a programme of roadmaking.  These programmes will take ten years to complete in some cases, and in some places will be spread over a period of up to 100 years.  It is no harm to get on with the job at least at the same level as in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan also had some <Col N="631" /> criticism to offer with regard to our wheat-growing policy.  He seemed to think we were not going far enough. He pointed out also that we were spending money on Shannon Airport and on the roads instead of putting it into factories.  A colleague of his, Senator L'Estrange, mentioned barley growing.  It is a great thing to feel as I, a veteran of Fianna Fáil, must feel that we have converted a great number of people to wheat growing, to barley growing and to the building of factories.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to the years from 1932 to 1938 and think of the long acrimonious sessions we had in the Dáil in an endeavour to get a tariff through for a factory, and the sarcastic remarks we had from the Opposition about the sweat shops, etc., that, it was alleged, we were putting up in order to produce inferior stuff at higher prices.  That is now all gone.  They are now converted to industrialisation.  It is very gratifying to think that we have been responsible for that conversion.  The same applies to wheat growing.  We spent many years trying to persuade them that wheat could successfully be grown here.  In the 1932 election a pamphlet was issued pointing out that if Fianna Fáil got in they would make the people of the country grow wheat, and the pamphlet set out to prove that it could not be grown here.  It is gratifying to see that they are converted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We always dealt on the British market.  Senator O'Callaghan spoke of the work carried out in relation to the curing of certain diseases in cattle, mentioning white scour.  That is but one of the instances in which veterinary science has been so kind to us.  Others are mastitis and, to some extent, contagious abortion, milk fever and others which are so easily preventable or curable now as compared with 25 to 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a number of references to the arrest of certain people lately. <Col N="632" /> I am glad to see that Senators are of one mind that the popularly-elected Government must govern or otherwise we would have anarchy and chaos.  I suppose it follows from that that if any group tried to usurp the powers of the Government, the Government must deal with it&mdash;are bound to do so &mdash;whether that interference is aimed at internal or external affairs.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Sheehy Skeffington, since he asked the question, that the Government will not stand for any ill-treatment of prisoners or for even a suggestion of that kind. He can rest assured that they will be treated with humanity, both when arrested and when in the hands of whomsoever they may be when subsequently imprisoned or interned.  I would also point out to Senator Sheehy Skeffington that we were reluctantly compelled to take these measures.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned by another Senator that we should have a soil utilisation authority to advise on the use of our land.  I know that a comprehensive soil survey is contemplated, but I cannot say when we may have the personnel to deal with it.  A soil survey is planned, and I think those concerned in the Department of Agriculture are endeavouring to recruit personnel before they can proceed with it. It would be very good to have this done because it would give a good indication, both by way of district and by way of the single farm, of what would be suitable treatment for soil for any individual crop or for the feeding of any particular animal.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke also of the necessity for education as a foundation for skilled trades.  He said a report had been in the hands of the Government since 1954 on which they had not so far taken action.  Personally, I was not aware of that, but I will make inquiries to see if it is being examined or when it may see daylight.  I quite agree with the Senator that we should examine the feasibility of planning less palatial, less costly schools.  I would go further and say that we should be more careful when we get a request for a new school to find out whether the existing <Col N="633" /> school could not be reconditioned and made serviceable for a longer period.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Senator is right in saying there is too much beating of children for minor offences. I have not heard complaints of that kind personally.  The point is often made, and it was made by the Senator, that there should be more opportunities for people who cannot afford to pay for their own education, to go further; in other words, that there should be an opportunity for primary pupils to go to secondary schools and for secondary pupils to go to universities. There is, of course, a limited number of opportunities in scholarships, perhaps not enough, and I think any Government would be inclined to make it possible for at least the most promising of primary school pupils to go to the secondary schools and for those who are very promising in the secondary schools to go on to the universities.  It would be impossible to make that universal.  The question is how far we should go and how far we can afford to go, but it is a proposition that would have my sympathy, if the money were available. That is a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to the leakage of examination information, I can assure the Seanad that the Minister for Education gave all the information he had to the Dáil.  He did not mention names because he thought it would not be wise to do so.  I know he gave the very same information to the Dáil as he did to the Government and he did not withhold anything.  He could not, of course, give an assurance that it would not happen again; nobody could.  All he could say was that he would do his utmost to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane agreed with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that examinations were overdone, but I must say that I can never see how you can get away from them.  I do not purport to be an authority on education; in fact, I do not say that I ever gave much thought to the matter, but I cannot see how you can find out whether the student leaving the primary school is going to benefit by secondary education or not, unless there is some test of <Col N="634" /> his knowledge before he goes on.  The same would apply in the case of the secondary school pupil going to the university, and when the university course is over, I think it would be a very dangerous thing to allow, say, a medical student to hold himself out as being fit to treat sick people without some sort of test.  I think examinations will be necessary in many cases, anyway.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha talked about small farmers going away and leaving holdings behind them.  Senator Cole also talked about the plight of small farmers.  I suppose we must say it is part of the general condition of farming at present.  It appears that in recent years the small farmer is, comparatively, not as well off as he was some years ago when he appeared to be as well off as the big farmer.  Now the comparison is getting very much worse because the big farmer, with mechanisation and so on, seems to be very much better off than he was, while the small farmers are hardly as well off as they were.  That is a problem we have to examine and we must see what can be done about it.  It is a very big problem and I do not know whether we can find a solution, but in any case it must be examined.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan drew attention to the fact that we cut the Estimates by £6,000,000.  Here is a rather strange coincidence which I mentioned in the Dáil: the last Government in November decided&mdash;and this was mentioned both by Deputy Costello, Leader of the Opposition, and by Deputy Sweetman &mdash;that the Estimates must be brought down to £96,000,000, that is, the current Estimates, leaving out, of course, the capital element in these Estimates.  We, by removing the food subsidies, also brought our Estimates down to £96,000,000 so that, to that extent, we have agreement in the Parties that £96,000,000 was about the limit of the sum we could raise in the present circumstances. We did it by removing food subsidies: the other Parties have not told us how they intended to do it and I am not finding very much fault with them on that score because I suppose Parties in Opposition have certain privileges and are not bound to tell the <Col N="635" /> Government what their plans were, even though they criticise the Government for the plans produced.  We all do that in our time and I do not blame the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The final point made by Senator Lenihan concerned the amount in the Estimates for marketing.  At the moment I cannot say very much about that.  Senators know the Minister for Agriculture did not come into that office for some time after the other Ministers took office and he has not had very much time.  He was up against some very serious problems since he took office.  I think it was only yesterday he told me he was not yet ready to discuss with me plans for the spending of this £250,000.  That does not say that he has no ideas: he has the ideas all right, but one sometimes finds it difficult to get ideas on paper and get them properly straightened out.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am very keen on this provision for marketing because of my own experience and any experience I had of farming in other countries. When I was abroad, I always tried to spend a day or two in farming districts because I was naturally interested in the agricultural position in other countries and, as far as I could see and gather from reading about these people, I think our farmers are very well equipped in knowledge. There are some ignorant men among them as in every other class, but on the whole, they are very well equipped in knowledge and well able to do their job.  Generally speaking, they could do with more knowledge, and I think the farmers who have most knowledge are those who are seeking more.  There is no doubt that they could all do with more knowledge, but on the whole they are well equipped, industrious, hard working and prepared to work hard at any time.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that production will increase, if we can promise markets.  I am quite sure if we can say to the farmers: &ldquo;We will promise you remunerative markets&rdquo;&mdash; we may have some difficulty in deciding what &ldquo;remunerative&rdquo; means&mdash;&ldquo;for bacon in the next five years,&rdquo; I think <Col N="636" /> we will have any amount of pigs in a year or two.</P>
    <P>If you promise the same for any crop, you will have any amount of that crop grown, too.  Marketing is the most important need to get production going.  That is why I was very keen on making this Vote of £250,000 to help marketing and make trial consignments even where there may be a loss.  I quite agree that £250,000 is not very much. It would be swallowed up in a few months.  But for trial consignments to other countries, for getting knowledge of the difficulty of marketing in other countries and for studying the methods of experienced exporters in other countries, for all that kind of knowledge I was very keen on getting the Oireachtas to vote this small amount.</P>
    <P>The last point raised by Senator Lenihan was in reference to the five-year concession for exporters.  He said we should try and make it ten years or 20 years.  There is a limit to what you can do in that matter.  It is very difficult to forecast what conditions may be in five years' time when some other Minister for Finance is trying to make ends meet.  Indeed, he might be very unkind to me if I tied him down for too long.  Anyway, if this is working well and getting results and if after two or three years there is a necessity to extend the period, it can always be extended by a few years so that men making plans will be assured they will reap the benefit before the concession ceases.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with the points raised and have answered Senators interested in having a reply.  If not, we may have an opportunity on some other stage of the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Army Pensions Bill, 1957&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is mainly concerned with the grant of increases in disablement pensions and wound gratuities, and in certain allowances and gratuities to dependents of deceased persons, payable under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1953.  The increases are effective from 1st August, 1956, and in fact are being paid since that date on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions approved on the 25th July, 1956.  This Bill provides the necessary statutory authority for them.  The scale of increases is the same as that applied to other classes of State pensions by the Pensions (Increase) Act of 1956 and ranges from 15 per cent. on pensions not exceeding £100 to 6 per cent. on pensions of £450 or over.</P>
      <P>Pensions of £450 or more are being increased for the first time under this measure.  Under previous legislation which granted increases, a pension or aggregate of pensions which amounted to £450 or more got no increase.  Moreover, in the case of a pension or aggregate of pensions so near to £450 that the grant of the appropriate increase would bring the amount above that figure, the increase was limited to such amount as would bring the pension or aggregate to £450 and no more. That restriction is not repeated in this measure, with the result that pensions of £450 or more will receive an increase of 6 per cent.  However, the increases apply to the pensions as payable under the previous Acts, so that the effects of the previous ceiling must be taken into account before the rates of increases now authorised are applied.  This position is achieved by Sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Married pensions, that is pensions <Col N="639" /> payable to married men in addition to basic disablement pension, are being increased by a flat 35 per cent. instead of the 25 per cent. authorised in the Army Pensions Act of 1953.  These married pensions vary in such a way that it is not practicable without creating anomalies to include them in the scale of increases which apply to the basic pensions.</P>
    <P>Gratuities payable in respect of wounds, and gratuities to widows and other dependents of deceased persons to whom the Acts apply, are being increased by approximately 75 per cent. These gratuities have not been increased hitherto and the percentage increases now being authorised are therefore higher than those applicable to the pensions and allowances.  Certain educational allowances which were not previously increased are now being increased as well.  The foregoing matters are dealt with in Part II of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The estimated total annual cost of the increases provided for is £23,330 and the necessary provision has been made in the Army Pensions Estimate for the current year.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains some miscellaneous amendments to which I shall now refer.  Sections 31 and 39 amend the Acts by relieving the Minister for Finance of certain functions which he exercises in relation to the making of grants of pension and other matters.  At present the consent of the Minister for Finance must be obtained before a grant of pension, allowance or gratuity is made under the terms of the Acts.  The amendments embodied in Sections 31 and 39 will remove the necessity for such consent and in future grants will be made solely by the Minister for Defence.  A similar measure in respect of awards of service pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts to former members of the Permanent Defence Force was recently passed in this House. That measure, and these amendments now, are part of a general development between my Department and the Department of Finance, aimed at improving administration by removing requirements which are not really <Col N="640" /> essential from an Exchequer point of view but which involve time and administrative procedures which would not otherwise be necessary.  I am, of course, bound by the terms of the Acts and the interests of the Exchequer will in no way be adversely affected.  On the contrary, official time will be saved and more expeditious clearance of cases as they arise will be possible.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides a new scale of percentages of pay for calculation of pension in the case of an officer of the Permanent Defence Force who retires on or after the date of the passing of the Bill and who may qualify for a pension under the 1923 Act, i.e. in respect of a wound received before 1st October, 1923.  This arises from the introduction of consolidated pay for officers and follows what was done in the 1953 Act in relation to other pensions.</P>
    <P>Sections 33, 36 and 38 deal with certain aspects of special allowances.  The latest date at present laid down for an application for a service medal which, if granted, renders a person qualified to apply for a special allowance, is 5th August, 1954, i.e., 12 months after the date of the passing of the Army Pensions Act, 1953.  Section 36 moves forward that date to one not later than 12 months after the date of the passing of this Bill.  Since the last closing date, viz., 5th August, 1954, over 3,000 applications for such medals have been received by my Department and these will be validated by this section in so far as the time limit for application is concerned and no renewal of such applications will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with the position which arises when, in the case of a person already in receipt of a special allowance, his entitlement to the medal on which his eligibility for the special allowance is based, is impugned by later evidence.  If, in such a case, I cease to be satisfied that the medal was duly awarded, then the special allowance is of course stopped. This section gives me clear-cut legal power for that step and it also enables me to restore the special allowance if further later evidence should substantiate the original claim to the medal.  The section operates as from <Col N="641" /> the date of the passing of the 1945 Army Pensions Act, which introduced the service medal as a qualification for a special allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 38 also deals with special allowances and makes two changes.  It removes the obligation placed by Section 43 of the Army Pensions Act of 1953 on a special allowance holder, to notify any improvement in his means since they were last investigated on my behalf.  Experience of the operation of that section since it was introduced has shown that for legal and practical reasons it has been largely inoperative, so that its removal is desirable. In future, the normal departmental investigation will be relied upon to bring any improvement in means to notice and I am satisfied that this is the most practical way to meet the situation.  The other change effected by Section 38 of the Bill is that, in effect, it applies the terms of Section 50 of the Army Pensions Act, 1937, to prosecutions.  This provides that a prosecution for an offence under the section may be brought within six months after the date when the evidence to sustain the prosecution came to the notice of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 and 35 relate to allowances payable under Part II of the 1953 Act in respect of certain deceased persons who had pre-Truce service.  Section 34 gives power to the Minister for Finance to review and alter an opinion reached by him in certain cases and to grant an allowance if he should be of opinion that the applicant should be treated as a dependent of the deceased.  Section 35 extends the time limit laid down in Section 6 of the Act of 1953 for applications where an applicant died before a decision was reached on his claim and where another relative then wished to apply.  The position in this respect at present is that the second relative might be ruled out under the existing time limit before in fact he would be aware of his eligibility to apply.</P>
    <P>Section 37 arises primarily as a consequence of the amendments in Sections 31 and 39 which do away with the necessity for the consent of the Minister for Finance to the grant of, among <Col N="642" /> other things, a gratuity to a relative of a person who dies in certain circumstances before an award of a pension, allowance or gratuity is made to him. Section 12 of the Act of 1949 and Section 44 of the Act of 1953 are repealed, but the new section adapts their provisions to the new circumstances and also extends the benefit of the earlier provisions to the case of a disablement pensioner who dies after the expiry of one award and before a further award has been made.  In such a case a gratuity equal to the amount of the pension which would have been due to the date of death will, as a result of this new section, be payable to any of the relatives mentioned in the section. The section becomes effective as from the 1st November, 1955.</P>
    <P>The foregoing is an outline of what is contained in this measure.  If there are any further points on which information is required I shall endeavour to deal with them when I am concluding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to welcome the Minister for Defence on his first appearance in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I wish to make one or two points on this Bill, because I understand it is intended merely to validate something which was carried out on the 1st August, 1956.  The Minister in his opening statement referred to quite a number of pensions in the upper brackets.  I shall try to bring the Minister and the House down to the lower brackets in the pension field.  From time to time, the Minister and his predecessors&mdash; Government after Government&mdash;have completely neglected to study the sphere in which the ex-private soldier has to live after he leaves the Army. Having completed his 21 years, he is given a pension which, immediately prior to the introduction of this Bill, worked out at 15/9.  It is bad, to my mind and I am sure it is bad to the mind of every Senator here, that a man, having given the best years of his life in the service of his country, should at the end of that period get the princely sum of 15/9&mdash;which is now increased, by this Bill, by 15 per cent. of that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Health, when discussing what it would cost a <Col N="643" /> man to live at home, rather than in a hospital, said it would cost more than £2 2s. a week to live at home.  I entirely agree with that and the whole House, by its attitude to the Minister for Health yesterday, also agrees with it.  I have not the effrontery to blame the Minister; I am blaming the system.  I am blaming all the Ministers and all the Governments over the years.</P>
    <P>When there is any publicity in connection with pensions, invariably the public hear about the £450 a year pensions. As I said before, these are the pensions in the bigger brackets. Nobody hears about the private soldier.  I am putting his case to the Minister to-night.  Not alone is 15/9 the amount allocated to a man after giving the best years of his life to the State but there are no less than five different categories.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of this Bill, we had one category at 15/9; a second at 18/-; a third at 20/-; a fourth at 21/9; and a fifth at 24/6.  The first three categories are affected by the 15/-.  I do not know how the other two categories, namely, the 21/9 and the 24/6, are affected.  However, if the 15/9 pension is increased by 15 per cent., then that soldier's pension will approximate to 18/- a week.  I know I can be told that if he is married, he will receive an extra 7/- or 8/- However little we may think and however poor a view we may take of the ex-soldier, for Heaven's sake let us not take an equally poor view of his wife. We give him 18/-; let us leave the money we give to his wife out of it.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I will not take up the Minister's time nor the time of the House now because I realise the Minister can do very little at this stage. However, I hope that on this, his initial visit to this House, my few words to him may cause him to give consideration in a general way to the case of the private soldier.  If the Minister cannot possibly increase the rate of the fellow below, or if he has difficulty because of the various categories with which I know he is tied up, and so on, could we not reach some level of parity so that every soldier who gives <Col N="644" /> 21 years of his life to the Army will be treated similarly?  Why should a soldier because he left on the first day of a month be treated differently from the soldier who left a few days later? I know that civil servants will find a reason for it.  They have found a reason for many things.  Nevertheless, it is unfair to cut short what is a decent and economic allocation to an ex-soldier and change it from a pension to what every one of us must agree is a pittance.  There is no use in asking the youth of the country to join the Army if, when the youth looks around them, they see the pittance given to a soldier after spending the best years of his life in the service of the State.</P>
    <P>Some people are inclined to say that the soldier was not at war and that, therefore, he should not get as much as the fellow who was at war.  I am neither from Trinity nor from National. I cannot quote Shakespeare <i>ad lib.,</i> but I might repeat now something which was said a long time ago: &ldquo;They also serve who only stand and wait.&rdquo; No matter what army he soldiers in, the mile is just as long, the burden is just as heavy, the neglect of his future is equal to that of any soldier anywhere else on earth.  The private soldier of the National Army has been treated in a niggardly fashion over the years.  He is the truly forgotten man.</P>
    <P>The House has had a long and wearisome day and I merely mention this now.  Perhaps in the future, as the Minister is probably aware, we shall meet in other spheres and he will be able to listen to my plea privately and give hope for the fellow with less than £1 a week to keep himself; if he has a wife, he will get an extra 7/- or 8/-.  In all, we are giving him about 26/- a week, whereas if he had waited until 65, he would get 24/-.  I should like the Minister to take note of that.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill is perfectly in order.  I welcome it as it is a measure and represents something.  I am sure the Minister will think in the future of raising the standard of pensions for privates and for junior N.C.O.s in the Army.  We have always prided ourselves on being a democratic nation, on never having servility. <Col N="645" /> However, when one sees the vast gap that exists between the pension of an N.C.O. and an officer in the Irish Army, it makes one think and wonder if we have introduced an aristocracy which we thought we had got rid of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as I would welcome any Bill which tends to improve the lot of those who offered their lives and the dependents of those who offered their lives for the independence of this country.  I welcome it, too, in so far as it tends to improve the lot of those engaged in defending that independence up to date.  I think it is true of all countries that, in time of war or such emergency, the soldier is the greatest hero in the land.  Nothing is good enough for him but when the danger has passed and the country is at peace the heroism of the soldier and his sacrifices are no longer appreciated in most countries.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to place on record that in all the years I have been associated with both Houses of the Oireachtas I have not heard one dissentient voice raised fom any part of either House when any proposal was put forward to improve the lot of those who gave this unselfish service to the country.  On pages 1 and 2 of this Bill the large number of Acts that have been passed for this purpose are indicated but their very number shows that each one of them, while it improves the position, always fell short of what was to be desired.  Even to date, with all the goodwill in the world, we have not succeeded in making the provision for those people which this House would wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore we must hope that we shall continue to amend those Acts until such time as we can make the provision that this House would feel justified in making for the persons affected by those Acts.  While I welcome the Bill from the point of view that it is an improvement, I must confess that I am disappointed with it as it falls short of what both Houses would like to do for these people.  I am not satisfied with this measure and I sincerely hope that this debate will <Col N="646" /> encourage the Minister and the Government to bring in the further amendments required at the moment and to do so with the least possible delay.  I hope that this Bill will get a speedy passage so that there will be no delay involved for the people who are to benefit by it.  It is not, of course, a Bill to increase pensions, as would be supposed from the title, but merely legalises, as the Minister explained, pensions payable since July, 1956. There are sections in the Bill that we must welcome and which we are very pleased to see.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the time extended for the application for medals as this section will ensure that all persons who have been granted medals since the 5th August, 1954, will be entitled to the benefit of the special allowances, having proved that the medals were duly awarded.  Under this section a further time limit has again been specified.  Perhaps it is good tactics from a departmental point of view to indicate that there should be a closure some time or another.  I am one of those who hold that there should not be a time limit and that whatever a man or woman is entitled to-day, in consideration of his or her services to the country, they should still be entitled to five years or ten years from now.  If they wish to avail of it, that is their right.  No Act of this House should deprive any of those who gave that unselfish service to this country of anything to which they may be entitled, whenever their circumstances change or whenever they may feel that they require it or wish to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section with which I am very disappointed.  That is the section dealing with dependents.  I think it is Section 37.  I am in entire disagreement with the sections dealing with dependents in all the Army Pensions Acts and I hope to voice that disagreement until such time as this grave wrong has been remedied.  This grave wrong has been done to dependents in all the Pensions Acts up to date and it is repeated again in this Bill.  It is hard to understand how a wife, father, mother, brother and sister can be declared dependents of a man who gave his life for the country and <Col N="647" /> that a child cannot be considered a dependent. Surely that is fundamentally wrong?  Surely a child is a man's dependent? In ordinary life a man's child is his dependent.  There is no doubt about it but the Department of Defence and all the Army Pensions Acts refuse to recognise that.  They will recognise his wife, father, mother, brother and sister as dependents but not his child.</P>
    <P>I referred to this matter in a motion before this House last December and I mentioned this grave wrong.  The then Minister alleged that there was some provision in some Act for disabled children, over 16 years of age, of men killed in action.  I do not know what Act it was but the reference is to be found in Volume 46, column 1684 of the Official Reports.  It was suggested that there was provision in some one of the Army Pensions Acts prior to 1932.  I have examined all the Acts to the best of my ability and I have, so far, failed to find where this provision existed.  I should be glad if the Minister would again examine the Acts to find if this provision was there, and, whether it was there or not, if he would make arrangements to introduce an amendment to the Army Pensions Acts to that effect.</P>
    <P>I hold it is a disgrace to us that 37 years after a man gave his life for us, we have failed in our duty to provide for his disabled child.  There are, thank God, very few cases of that description.  There are very few cases, indeed, of a man who gave his life for Ireland being invalided, disabled and destitute, but there are some.  I know of one at any rate who is forced to live on a few shillings home assistance. His child undoubtedly would have been provided for by the father, if the father lived his normal life.  If he never made an effort to strike a blow in the struggle for independence and had lived his normal life he would have made provision for his child who later became disabled.  That is, I think, a standing disgrace to each and every one of us&mdash;a disgrace that we must make up our minds to have remedied. I hope I have said enough about it.  I bring this grave matter to the Minister's <Col N="648" /> attention so that he will take immediate steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I stated at the outset that I welcome this Bill for what is in it.  I am disappointed and dissatisfied with what is not in it and should be in it.  I trust that we will not delay it, and that we will very shortly have an opportunity of welcoming the Minister here with a Bill to compensate the people concerned for what is omitted from this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister on his first visit to the Seanad and also welcome this Bill, particularly Section 36, which provides for the payment of special allowances to medal holders.  It is to be regretted, as other speakers said, that circumstances do not allow the provisions being made to be more generous, but, with Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Carton, I hope that in time to come the Minister will be able to come back to the Seanad with a Bill which will at least go further&mdash;as this one does&mdash;to satisfy the need for justice in this regard.</P>
      <P>I should like strongly to support the plea which Senator Carton made for better provision for the private soldier.  I feel that if we are to have an Army and if the Army is to attract the best young men in the country who feel that they should make the Army their career, then we must offer better inducements than our best at the moment.  In regard to the retiring pensions for soldiers, I hope that in time to come, when circumstances permit, there will be an improvement in this direction, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill, and in particular in relation to the sections dealing with investigation of means, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the complaint of London members of the Irish Republican Army.  They have a serious grievance to the effect that officials of the British Government have been used in the investigation of claims.  I know that these investigations at home are not done by any officials of his own Department. As far as I can understand, they are done by a special officer and in regard to claims from across the Channel, I <Col N="649" /> see no reason why it is necessary, if it is a fact, that British officials or the services of any British agency should be utilised for any purpose whatsoever in connection with any pensions claim of an Irishman under his own Government.</P>
    <P>I should like also, in relation to the sections covering surgical and medical treatment, to advance the plea that the Minister and the Government would give consideration at some future time &mdash;I know it is not possible at the moment because of financial stringency &mdash;to the need for the establishment of a soldier's home here for disabled I.R.A. men and also for what one might call &ldquo;old sweats&rdquo; who have served their country in the Regular Army.  I feel that it is an amenity long overdue and well worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 1953 Act covering widows and dependents of soldiers who died on service, I understand that there are a few cases which were not covered by that Act because of inability to apply in time.  I wonder whether it would be possible to indicate if an extension of the time for an application under that Act could be made either now or in any other way in the future. I welcome the Bill.  I wish the Minister success in his efforts to make things as good as possible for old soldiers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with the previous speakers on this measure.  I will give the House an instance of what Senator O'Sullivan has just mentioned.  I have here a letter from the Cork I.R.A. Association.  In May, 1921, a volunteer was killed by Crown Forces.  To-day, his daughter is living on home assistance.  She is unable to work and is, therefore, unable to earn a livelihood.  She is supported by the ratepayers.  Is that not an appalling state of affairs in 1957?  Here is the only daughter of a man who gave his life for Irish freedom, living on home assistance.  That is something of which we should all be ashamed.  I ask the Minister to consider these cases sympathetically and to bring in some amending legislation to cover them. They are very few in number and they should not be allowed to continue.  In a few years, all these people will be dead.  We should err on the side of generosity where the Old I.R.A. are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House on the occasion of his first visit here.  I welcome the Bill, as far as it goes.  It is an essential measure for those concerned.  It is a pity, at the same time, that the allowances are so very meagre.  Undoubtedly, some improvements are being effected.  These special allowances have created a good deal of trouble.  The Minister mentioned that there are over 3,000 applications in the Department. That shows the extent of the grievances that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the difficulty arises because of the time limit inserted in every Act.  Senator O'Sullivan referred <Col N="651" /> to that aspect and there is a good deal in his contention that, if a man is entitled to some benefit now, then equally he should have been entitled to that benefit all along.  I know that that might lead to a tremendous amount of bother, particularly in relation to the special allowances.  There have been instances of two individuals with medals, one considered eligible and the other not, because of the date on which he received his medal.  I am glad this Bill will put an end to all that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the time limit, a number of Old I.R.A. were turned down for active service medals and that caused them to lose interest.  They never applied for the ordinary medal and in many cases they are actually unaware that they could get a special allowance.  They do not learn of that, until they reach the stage when they are practically destitute.  I have met several cases and, very often, when one gets them to apply, one discovers that the period in which to make application has lapsed.  That means they have to wait until amending legislation is introduced.  In practically every Bill of which I have had experience, the principal amendment was one to extend the time limit.  The situation seems to me to be rather ridiculous.  In the meantime, considerable hardship is suffered by people who are undoubtedly entitled to and deserving of all the benefits given under the various Acts.  I appeal to the Minister to do something to remedy that situation.  The time limit has led to an immense amount of trouble.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I understand it, merely makes legal certain action taken last year in relation to people with wound pensions, disability pensions and dependents of those who were killed. It is disappointing to find that it does not cover the Old I.R.A.  I made a protest in the Dáil on that issue when another Bill was going through that House.  I know the financial position is bad, but, at the same time, I do not think men like the Old I.R.A. men should have to wait two or three years, as distinct from other classes entitled to State pensions who are paid immediately. Added to that, is the fact that <Col N="652" /> these benefits are paid only from the date on which the Act comes into operation.  I want to make my protest against it.  Apparently it is becoming a habit.  I repeat what I said in the beginning, that, as far as it goes, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense, what this Bill is doing is what has been already done for other types of pensioners, and the measure of increase that is being given is of the same order.  I have already spoken in the House about the amount of such increases, the proportion allowed.  I am in agreement with those Senators who say that the increase does not seem to be either in time or enough. I notice that where a pensioner is getting up to £100 a year under Section 3, that amount is to be increased by 15 per cent.  Where a person is getting a little more than that, up to £125 a year, he is to get £15, and so on.  I find it hard to imagine how these pensioners exist on a pension of £100 or £125 a year, even with the increase of 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do realise that all these Bills mesh in together; they are tied up one with the other.  To put it very bluntly, if we have been niggardly towards other pensioners, we must apply the same niggardly standards to these.</P>
      <P>Now, in 1934 the cost-of-living index in this country had gone up from the 1914 base 100 to 152.  By 1947 that 152 had risen to 319.  In other words, by 1947 it had more than doubled since 1934.  It was then felt by the authorities perhaps that the figures were looking a bit too glaringly increased, so they decided to have a new base, the base 100 of 1947 and by 1956 that 100 had again risen by 34 per cent. to 134. It has risen again since then.  The Minister for Finance has told us that another 4½ points have been added to it by the new Budget, so that it is up to 138 or 139 or perhaps 140.  So that the cost of living between 1934 and 1947 doubled, and since 1947 another 40 per cent. has been added on to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against that background that I say advisedly that a miserable 15 per cent. added to the pension of a man who is getting £100 a year is grossly inadequate.  I know there is nothing <Col N="653" /> much we can do about it, particularly in the Seanad, because we cannot even put down amendments that would put an increased charge on public funds. Such an amendment would not be in order.  But we can at least voice a protest in the hope that this Government, encouraged by speeches of several of the Fianna Fáil Senators, might look again at all these pension rates and perhaps come back to us within measurable time and deal just a little more generously with these pensioners and with the others.</P>
    <P>I have adverted to the fact that we have not the power to amend this Bill in relation to finance, but it is also true that were we to pass an amendment here to-night, or to-morrow morning, the entire Dáil would have to be brought back to consider it, or else it would have to be left until, at the very earliest, October 23rd next.  All the pensioners who are to get these very small increases would then not even get them in the months to come until the Dáil had reconsidered our amendment.  Therefore, of course, we are very loath to propose any amendment to the Bill, and I feel that in a sense we as a Seanad are placed in an unfair position by the bringing in of such a Bill a this to this House after the Dáil has risen.  I admit that, in the circumstances, there are a number of Bills that simply have to be treated in this way and I am not making any special reproach, but I think I speak for all of us when I say that we do not like it.  We do not like the feeling that we must either pass this unamended, or else deprive these people of their increased pensions for three or four months.</P>
    <P>Several Senators have talked about amendments.  Senator Ahern, Senator Colley, Senator An Seabhac, all suggested amendments of one kind or another which they would like the Minister to consider, or perhaps to make in a new Bill and it is on that point that I should like to speak now.  I believe that there is a measure of dissatisfaction in this House and probably in the other House, and, I think, probably in the Government, with the terms of this Bill, and with its provisions, a measure of dissatisfaction such <Col N="654" /> as would warrant the bringing in at an early date of a new amending one-or two-clause Bill which would go through swiftly and which would iron out many of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>It has already been mentioned that the time limit under some of the preceding Acts was very short.  I think under the 1953 Act it was a time limit of only one year for application and it is a fact that grave injustice might have been caused in many cases by the placing of so short a time limit upon the application for pensions under the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>The 1953 Act is, in fact, amended in certain particulars by this Bill.  I would contend that it would be perfectly simple to have had a clause or section, even a paragraph, in this Bill which would amend the 1953 Act in relation to the extension of the time limit for application for pensions under that Act.  It would have been very simple to do in the Dáil.  It would have been relatively simple to do here had we the time, if this was not so near the end of the session.  That is the kind of amendment that I should have liked to put down, and I do not think it would have been ruled out of order on the ground that it would increase the charge on public funds, but I am inhibited from putting it down by the consideration that so to do, were it passed, would be, as I have indicated, to hold up the granting of pensions to all these people.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to mention names, but I have in mind a particular case, the widow of an officer who gave long years of service to our Army, and who was granted a pension under one of the previous Acts, a widow's pension of £112 a year, with certain small allowances for her children, none of whom had qualified at the university, two of whom have since qualified.  I would like to ask the Seanad to consider what was to be expected of such a widow then, or such widow now, granted such an amount, in relation to the education of her children?  How could she be expected on the money granted to her to give them a full education if their intelligence merited it?  Quite obviously, she could not.</P>
    <P>If she was a woman of intelligence <Col N="655" /> and courage, she might be expected to take a job and go out to work.  In the particular case I have in mind, she did so and&mdash;I think it is under the 1923 Act&mdash;a means test is applied to a widow under those circumstances, who tries to increase this £112 a year for the sake of her children's education. How can we tolerate such a means test on such a basis?  How can such a woman be deprived of the right to go out and work in such circumstances? How can we tolerate, if she does so, that the State can come after her and try to collect back money on the grounds that she has been working for a living when she could have been living in luxurious idleness I suppose, with her three children, on £112 a year?</P>
    <P>I would say that that particular case could be dealt with in one of two ways, either by an amending clause in this Bill to abolish that type of means test or by raising the basis of the level of calculation of such a means test. Again, it could in this case have been shown that the death of the officer in question was occasioned by the nature of the dangerous work in which he engaged, for the sake of the nation.  The case could have been dealt with by an application under the 1953 Act which would have been justified were it not for the Act that there was a time limit of 12 months.  That method could still have been used by putting a small clause in this Bill in order to be able to render justice to such a pensioner. I would just like to mention the fact that there is such a means test under which anybody earning more than a certain sum of money shall draw a reduced pension.  If the cost of living goes rocketing up, that certain amount of money, which might have represented a considerable sum in 1923, represents a very inconsiderable sum now.  Even there you have a big injustice involved.</P>
    <P>Before deciding, in view of all the difficulties, that we should put down amendments, and insist upon a Committee Stage, and if necessary hold up this Bill for three or four months, I would like an assurance from the Minister that he will not merely give <Col N="656" /> such a case consideration but, if he finds that such a case cannot be dealt with in justice and fairness under present legislation, he will promise us to bring in a further amending Bill within a short period of time, a one or two-clause Bill that could go swiftly through both Houses in order to meet the injustice of that particular case and any others like it.  I would plead with him, therefore to-night to give us his opinion on that and to give us, I hope, his assurance on that point, as I believe he is in possession of the facts in relation to at least one such case.</P>

      <P>Most of the criticism in connection with this Bill was not on what it does contain but rather on what it does not contain.  Senator Carton started off under a misapprehension.  As I explained in my opening statements, this Bill as far as it goes, deals only with increases in respect of disability pensions and wound pensions.  It does not deal with the case of service pensions to which Senator Carton was referring.</P>

      <P>No; that deals only with wound and disability pensions.  If the Senator looks at it more closely, he will see it does not.  Those pensions to which the Senator referred are dealt with in a different way by Defence Forces pensions schemes and there will be, in a short time, an amending scheme for Defence Force pensions. The procedure is that this amending scheme will have to be passed by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be able to have a fuller discussion on it on that stage. The question of raising pensions generally is a very big one and would have to get a great deal of consideration. This Bill simply does not deal with cases of that type at all.  Senator T. O'Sullivan, Senator Colley, and possibly some other Senators referred to the fact that in the case of special allowances, we were introducing a <Col N="657" /> further time limit.  Their attitude is that there should be no time limit at all, that a person should be permitted to apply for a medal, by virtue of which a special allowance might subsequently be granted, at any time in the future.  As time goes on, it becomes more and more difficult to verify whether people had the service that would entitle them to these medals.  Is it not wise to attempt to get all these applications in and dealt with now? Senator Colley said these people did not know of this until they were actually on the verge of destitution and then somebody brings it to their notice that special allowances may be granted on the basis of these medals.</P>
      <P>With all the publicity that has been given in the past to this matter and with the further publicity that will result from the introduction and passing of this Act, it should be fairly well known to anybody who had I.R.A. service that special allowances in certain circumstances may be granted to the holders of these medals.  On this occasion, after a further 12 months have been allowed, there should be no justification for anybody not applying for his medal within that 12 months.  We should attempt to get finality on this occasion, and get all the applications in while there are still people who can verify the applications.  With the 3,000 applications we have already on hand, and with the further ones which people will now submit, it will be possible to get them all dealt with while there are people still able to give the necessary verification.</P>
      <P>I think that neither Senator O'Sullivan nor Senator Colley would like to have us deal with applications for medals, to which special allowances are attached, on the basis of the applicant's own claims or evidence.  It is advisable when we are disbursing public funds that we should be certain that the people who are claiming these allowances are actually Old I.R.A. Therefore we must get verification and it is very wise to keep within this time limit of another 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to the section dealing with dependents' allowances.  I am aware of the particular case to which he referred, to <Col N="658" /> the hardship of a child not being considered a dependent.  Unfortunately I am not in a position yet to indicate what action I can take in that regard but the matter is under active consideration at the moment.</P>
    <P>He also stated that the former Minister alleged here that, at one stage, there was provision for a child of a deceased Old I.R.A. man to be regarded as a dependent but that it was taken out in 1932.  Actually, the provision was never there except in respect of children up to the age of 16 years.  What happened was that, in the case to which Senator O'Sullivan was referring, the child in question was born in 1916 and reached the age of 16 in 1932 and therefore in that year became ineligible to be considered as a dependent according to present legislation.  As I say, that is being considered at the moment and I hope a decision will be reached very shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullins reinforced the remarks of Senator Carton in regard to private soldiers and N.C.O.s.  As I have explained, that comes under a different scheme altogether which will come before the Seanad shortly when we can have a full discussion on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullins also referred to the question of British officials being used to verify the means of Old I.R.A. men who are resident in England.  That is a long-standing arrangment and it is only in very recent times that any objection has been raised to it.  These special allowances were introduced for the relief of destitution in these cases and there are very definite regulations laid down as to the circumstances in which they can be granted.  Therefore, there is a duty on the Department to ascertain whether an applicant for a special allowances is qualified for it under the various regulations or not.  I certainly cannot think of any other way in which we could ascertain the means of a person resident in Britain than by applying to the officers of the British Department of Social Welfare.  I do not think there is any reason to suppose that these officers would be in any way prejudiced against these people because they were Old I.R.A. men.  I do not know if there has been any allegation that such a thing has <Col N="659" /> happened, but I cannot think of any other way in which we could obtain this information which is required under the Act.</P>

    <P>Senator Colley also objected to the time limit, but I have dealt with that. I am convinced that a time limit is necessary, even if it is only from the point of view of verification.  He also made the case that the military service pensions and other allowances should be increased all round.  Of course, one point about that is that to do it would more than double the cost of the increases as far as the Department of Defence is concerned.  Special allowances were increased in 1953, and in addition to that the means test has been very substantially modified on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Senators are familiar with the modifications which were made and which were all to the benefit of the applicants.  The position has been considerably improved with regard to special allowances since they were first introduced.  The fact that must be borne in mind is that these special allowances were introduced only for the relief of destitution in these cases.  It is understandable that people should try to improve them still more.  The whole thing creates a difficult problem since the money must be provided, and no matter how much the allowances are raised there will always be a case for raising them still further.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the fact that these pensions are too small, in any case.  I should say, of course, that they were tied up with pensions generally.  The question of increasing the actual basic pensions generally is a very big one indeed. The whole position will have to be considered in a very general way.  I do not know whether Senator Sheehy Skeffington would like me to refer any further to the particular case he mentioned. What I did say about it was that it is a condition of the type of pension that the widow in question had that she should report any remuneration she was getting in respect of any job remunerated from public <Col N="661" /> funds, either from the State or from local authorities.  The form making such a return must be signed annually. This form was signed annually in this case.</P>
    <P>There is another type of allowance to which that restriction would not apply.  But, as the Senator said, she was late in applying for that at the time she did make application.  In the meantime, she was drawing this other type of allowance.  To get the allowance for which she appears to think she might qualify now, it is necessary for her to prove that her husband's death was due to a disease contracted as a result of his service during the emergency.  Whether that could be proved in this case or not is problematical. I shall consider the possibility of extending the date for making applications in this respect.  When a person makes the application, of course the evidence must be produced to back it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question arising from that?  He has referred to this widow as drawing &ldquo;another type of allowance&rdquo;, which was paid out of public funds.  In fact, she was being paid a salary for work done, a very different matter from a free grant.</P>

It was signed in this case stating that no such money was being drawn from such funds in respect of her position with the public body concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that deals with all the points that were raised.  I would, therefore, ask the Seanad to pass the Bill as it stands in order to give us authority <Col N="662" /> to pay the increased pensions and allowances which are being provided for here, and also the authority to extend the date for applications for medals by virtue of which special allowances are granted and for the other matters coming under this Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides that service pensions and disability pensions payable under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts, 1936 to 1953, shall be increased by 15 per cent.  This is the percentage appropriate to pensions not exceeding £100 under the scale of increases generally applicable in respect of other classes of State pensions.  In no case do pensions affected by this Bill exceed £100.  It is not necessary therefore to set out a scale of increases.</P>
      <P>The increases became effective from 1st August, 1956.  They are being paid since that date on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions approved on the 25th July, 1956.

      <P>I just wanted to explain the exact meaning of the point I made the other night about the currency and financial system.  I could have referred simply to the currency system, but anybody might well have replied that the currency system was working admirably, that people could pay debts and take payments without any difficulty.  It was the effect of the present currency system on the commercial banks that I was concerned about.  The fact that the commercial banks have to make this payment in cash in London for the ordinary notes that circulate in this country is gradually putting the commercial banks into an impossible position from the point of view of their liquidity ratio.  By a coincidence, the Central Bank Report came to us the morning after I raised the point.  By far the most interesting paragraph in it relates to this matter.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain.  The number of legal tender notes and coin in circulation in March, 1957, was £78,500,000.  In the middle of March, the amount of cash was £19,000,000. That is the cash in the banks within the State.  Out of the total amount of money circulating amount the country, there was only a sum of £19,000,000 in the banks themselves.  The rest was in the pockets of the people, in the tills of the merchants and in the homes of the farmers.  That was a fairly good period to take, unlike, say, Christmas, when the banks go in for a certain amount of window-dressing, when they are preparing their statements to make them look a bit better.  In that respect they are no different from anybody else.</P>

    <P>The fact that there was a sum of £78,000,000 in circulation as compared with £42,000,000 ten years ago, that the ratio is only one to four, means that if we have another period of inflation within the next few years&mdash;and it seems to be hinted at&mdash;the banks will again have to put up £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 in London.  In the normal course, that will result in their having £1,500,000 cash in their own tills here; <Col N="666" /> the other £3,500,000 is lost out through the community.</P>
    <P>Despite some of the reports, I was not concerned to condemn in any way the commercial banks.  In actual fact, I have great sympathy with them in this matter.  It surprises me that they have not raised it already.  Maybe they have done so with the board of the Central Bank.  We are coming to the end of the road in this matter because of the way it ties up the credit system within the community and because of its effect on the banks and business generally.  These notes have to be paid for in cash in London.  This cash is got by exports.  Your previous savings have to be disgorged by the banks and passed over by the Central Bank.  The banks do not have the money themselves. They have about a quarter of it.  The amount varies at certain times of the year, but roughly it is a quarter or one-third.  Accordingly, they are not in a position to make loans within the system here.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point to-day&mdash; a good point&mdash;that if you have too many loans, you have increased imports, but I think you can have within the system itself an expansion of credit which would not involve imports.  This is too late in the night to argue that discussion, but I am convinced you could have it.  That is a matter on which there would be two opinions.</P>

      <P>I want to explain, because of the fact that my reference to the currency and financial system was primarily that the system of currency was creating difficulties for the commercial banks in relation to the internal credit system here.  I want to emphasise that I feel that the currency system is out of date.  This is confirmed by paragraph 58 of this year's Report of the Central Bank, where, in relation to the bank's duty to provide for the integrity of the currency, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No difficulty has arisen until recently to impede the discharge of this duty because the commercial <Col N="667" /> banks have hitherto had at their disposal ample external reserves to purchase from the Central Bank Irish currency as required and to meet the demands of their customers for external finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The two are competing against one another.  I am not so much concerned about that.  What I am concerned about is the effect it has had upon our financial system here.  That was what I meant primarily when I said it was out of date, although I know it is out of date in other respects also.  I want to thank you, Sir, for allowing me to clarify the matter.</P>

      <P>I just want to make two short references to what the Senator has said.  Firstly, if our balance of payments were right and if we were sure it would keep right, we could take a chance; but we would want to watch the situation.  Secondly, I quite agree that under certain circumstances more loans could be made without any danger.  For instance, if a loan is made for productive purposes, it would not have an inflationary effect.</P>
