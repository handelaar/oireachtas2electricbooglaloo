    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Bill, 1957&mdash;Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Government amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 3, to delete lines 26 to 35 and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Where a lease is for a term of not less than 50 years, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the buildings on the land demised by the lease were erected by the person who, at the time of their erection, was entitled <Col N="1102" /> to the lessee's interest under the lease if&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  in the case of a lease granted before the 1st day of January, 1914, the rent reserved by the lease is less than three-fourths of the rateable valuation of the land thereby demised together with the buildings thereon as first fixed or revised subsequent to the date of the lease pursuant to the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, as amended and adapted, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the case of a lease granted on or after the 1st day of January, 1914, the rent reserved by the lease is less than that rateable valuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that in the case of a lease executed before 1st January, 1914, it shall be presumed that the lease is a building lease if the rent is less than three-fourths of the earliest rateable valuation of the site and the buildings on it.  This is a compromise between the existing provisions of the Bill, which follow the relevant recommendation in the Conroy Report, and a suggestion by Senator O'Brien on the Committee Stage that the presumption should only arise where the rent is less than half of the rateable valuation. I made that suggestion last week and this amendment gives effect to it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 43, to delete &ldquo;granted to him&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;executed by his immediate lessor, and such (if any) superior lessors as may be necessary, in terms agreed upon between the parties or settled by the court.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to make it clear that the tenancy conferred on a lessee by sub-section (1) will terminate as soon as the lessor executes a reversionary lease in terms agreed upon between himself and the lessee or settled by the court.  Even as the sub-section <Col N="1103" /> stands, there is no possibility, I am advised, of a tenant being enabled to remain in possession indefinitely under the terms of the old lease merely by the device of applying for a reversionary lease and then refusing to take any further steps.  Any doubt there may be should be removed by this amendment.  Senator O'Brien suggested that there was a doubt and I have had that clarified, to my own satisfaction anyhow.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> Government amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 8, Section 18, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(6) The Minister may make regulations for offices or for any class or description of office requiring that provision be made for fire preventive facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should explain to the Seanad that I did not provide in the original Bill for regulations relating to the provision of fire preventive facilities because I was aware that, under the Fire Brigades Act, a local sanitary authority has power to survey premises, used as offices, within its jurisdiction, and to make orders regarding buildings which are considered to be potentially dangerous from the point of view of fire hazard.  I was anxious to ensure there would be no overlapping of functions and I felt that giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to make regulations requiring the provision of fire preventive facilities would involve some conflict with the functions of the sanitary authorities under the Fire Brigades Act.  However, I think there is no inconsistency in putting this provision in the Bill, but I want to make it quite clear that I do not propose to make any regulations in respect of any matters which fall within the sphere of local sanitary authorities under the Fire Brigades Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  I notice the wording is: &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations for offices or for any class or description of office requiring that provision be made for fire preventive facilities.&rdquo;  Would that cover offices not covered by the Act itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not think so.  The intention is that regulations may be made for all offices generally, or only for offices of a particular kind where there might be a serious necessity for special regulations, such as offices which would be associated with factory premises.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking of offices where five or less workers are employed, which are specifically excluded, and classes of premises which the Minister has power himself to exclude.  The very comprehensive wording says &ldquo;for any class or description of office.&rdquo;  That might seem to imply offices not covered by the Act. I think it would be better to say &ldquo;any offices for which provision is made in the Act.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Act, sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) In this Act &lsquo;office&rsquo; means any premises, room, suite of rooms or other part of premises in which persons are employed on clerical work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of the same section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) This Act does not apply to an office in which the number of persons employed on clerical work does not exceed five...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 32 and 33, to insert:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) There shall be provided and maintained, for the use of all employed persons whose work is done standing, suitable facilities for sitting sufficient to enable them to take advantage of any opportunities for resting which may occur in the course of their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was discussed on Committee Stage when I suggested that the Parliamentary Secretary might take another look at the section as drawn up.  The inference appeared to be that seating would be provided if the work was done sitting.  The purpose of the new sub-section was to clarify the fact that, where it was reasonable that the people concerned could sit during working hours, seating facilities should be provided.  I wonder could the Minister clarify whether in fact this amendment is necessary in order to provide what the trade unions <Col N="1106" /> interested in the problem think is necessary?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would make no practical difference whatsoever. The vast majority of clerical workers would have reasonable opportunities of sitting without detriment to their work.  If there is one type of clerical worker who must stand all the time at his work, it is hardly necessary that the Bill make provision for him.  My view is that if there is any necessity to provide something more than is provided in the section as it stands, then it is a matter to be dealt with by regulations.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 30, to delete &ldquo;all or&rdquo; and in line 31 before &ldquo;any&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save those in respect of cleanliness, overcrowding, sanitary conveniences, fire escape, drinking water, first aid and washing facilities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, again, was discussed on Committee Stage.  As the Minister may know, it was rather to tie the hands of the enforcing authorities in the exemptions they could provide.  A discussion we had brought to light another problem, the fact that we have now a variety of enforcing authorities under the section as it stands.  Those authorities would have the right to exempt completely, if they so wished, all and every office under their authority without reference to the Minister, without even advising the Minister and without seeking the advice, or indeed, informing the Advisory Committee.  We pressed the Parliamentary Secretary to have a particular look at that aspect of it.  I think it was felt on all sides of the House that, in spite of the fact that there is a qualifying period, it was hardly the intention of the legislation that the enforcing authority should have such wide powers without any reference to the Minister or the Advisory Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the amendment is all the more necessary, in my view, because <Col N="1107" /> of the fact that no Government amendment has been brought forward to cure what we thought was a slip in the Bill.  I would ask the Minister whether he could not accept the change which would in some way curtail the power of the enforcing authority in regard to giving exemptions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there has been any slip in the preparation of the Bill.  The section has a very definite purpose.  If it is not accepted as it is, the powers in the section could lead to widespread difficulty.  In order to comply with certain of the provisions of the Bill, it will be necessary in very many cases, perhaps, to have premises reconstructed or extended, or to have plumbing or other services installed.  It would be unreasonable not to make statutory provision so that an adequate period of grace can be allowed in such cases.</P>
      <P>The power of exemption was fairly widely provided in the Factories Act. So far, the need for the exercise of it has not arisen very frequently; but the need has arisen in some cases and serious difficulty would have resulted had the power of exemption not been put into effect.  Therefore, our experience in the operation of the Factories Act would indicate the need for a similar power of exemption for a period in this Bill.  The exemption, as the Bill stands, is limited to a maximum period of three years after which any benefits suspended must be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there should be reference to the Advisory Committee in a case of this kind.  The application for exemption may involve the disclosure of confidential information concerning the business of the firm.  One reason a firm may not be able to do the work within the time specified is that they have not the money and they may not want to advertise their financial situation in a case like that.  It would be wrong to require in the Bill that cases of that kind should be referred to the Advisory Committee.  There is no point at all in referring it to the Minister because he has no means of carrying out the investigation necessary to <Col N="1108" /> decide whether exemption was required or not.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 16 to 23 and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(f) with respect to any matters under this Act, to question, and to take in writing a statement from, every person whom he finds in an office or whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be or to have been within the preceding two months employed in an office.</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed on Committee Stage and it is not necessary to go into the arguments advanced in support of it.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated, and I quote from Volume 48, column 987 of the Seanad Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the enforcement of the Bill as an Act would not be prejudiced in any way by the removal of this, I do not think the Minister would have any great objection to it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He undertook to bring the matter back for consideration.  The real point in relation to a measure such as this is that in a measure which it is not anticipated there will be any difficulty in enforcing, the powers are rather wide and are open to certain objections. They can be used in a way that would not commend itself to members.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to indicate he is accepting this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair will allow me to make some general observations arising out of certain discussions which took place in the Seanad on this and other Bills.  It is obvious that objections&mdash;both reasonable objections and other kinds of objections&mdash; can always be put forward to proposals which give powers to inspectors responsible for the enforcement of Acts of the Oireachtas; but, in my view, there is little point in enacting legislation to bring about certain desirable situations, if the powers of the officers who are responsible for enforcement <Col N="1109" /> are watered down to a point where offenders can readily evade their obligations or evade the requirements of the legislation.</P>
      <P>In practice, little or no enforcement is required at all in the case of a good employer.  The good employer will normally seek to obey the law and will be conscientious in making arrangements to ensure that there will be no departure from the letter of the regulations in matters under his control.  Other employers may be indifferent and careless. They can generally be brought into line by the mere issue of a warning notice.  But there will be always a minority group who will not comply with the law, if they think there is the slightest chance of evading it.  It is in fairness to all employers affected by legislation of this kind that provision must be made to ensure that enforcement will not depend on the goodwill of an unco-operative minority.  For that reason, it is always desirable to draw the relevant sections of Acts of this kind in such a way as to ensure that the intention of the Oireachtas will not be defeated in the very small minority of cases where the desire of the individuals concerned is not to obey the law and to avail of any loophole the Act gives them of avoiding obeying it.</P>
      <P>In this case, the changes which the amendment suggests should be made in the paragraph of the section are, I think, undesirable, particularly in so far as it is sought to remove from the inspector the power to require persons to make a declaration of the truth of the statements made.  Perhaps it is hard to visualise the circumstances under which the enforcement powers of the Office Premises Bill will be called upon; but we have some experience in the administration of factories legislation and it was decided to frame the Bill in as close conformity as possible with the Factories Act.  The same enforcing officers will be operating in many cases and in any event the only experience we have to guide us is in the administration of the Factories Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is realised that under the Factories Act, circumstances may arise where court proceedings may well follow upon an accident which might involve loss of life and an accident <Col N="1110" /> might, in certain circumstances, lead to criminal proceedings in court.  In these cases, it is necessary that the inspector should have power, not merely to question people for the purpose of getting information, but to require people who make statements to him to sign a declaration of the truth of the matters to which they have testified.</P>
    <P>It would be most undesirable to take that power out of this section, even though I recognise that, in the case of offices, it is not likely that the circumstances which arise in factories will arise very often.  Apart, therefore, from the desire to keep the legislation relating to factories in as close conformity as possible with the legislation relating to offices, I do not think we should attempt to weaken the enforcement provisions in this Bill, having regard to our experience in the enforcement of the corresponding provisions of the Factories Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 14, Section 39, to insert before sub-section (2), line 15, a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2) An offence under this Act alleged to have been committed by the owner or occupier of an office may be prosecuted by a person employed in that office or by an official of a trade union of which that person is a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is different in many respects from amendment No. 9.  I want to make it quite clear that while I have no objection to giving persons employed in an office, or an official of a trade union of which such a person may be a member, the power to institute proceedings in respect of an offence committed by the employer of these persons in respect of the offices in which they are employed, I could not contemplate a situation in which a worker might prosecute a colleague for the breach of some section which imposed an obligation on the employed person.  I could not contemplate a situation in which a person employed in one office could prosecute the owner or employee of another office.  I <Col N="1111" /> think it would be most undesirable to provide that prosecutions could be taken only in the case of the neglect of the enforcing authority.  I think the section meets the main point the movers had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that the amendment put down by the Government largely meets the point of view expressed in the next amendment. Would the Minister, however, clarify one little point for me?  There is reference in the amendments to an official of a trade union.  I should imagine that it would be the trade union, as such, that would take the action and not the official as an individual.  Has the Minister given thought to that aspect of the matter?  I should imagine that the trade union would be the people concerned.  Its members would take the legal action and not an individual official of the trade union itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be dangerous.  The only definition of a trade union that I know of is contained in the Trade Union Act of 1913 which describes a trade union as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;trade union&rsquo; for the purpose of the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1906, and this Act means any combination, whether temporary or permanent, the principal objects of which are under its constitution statutory objects.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is far better to give this power to an official of the trade union and thus avoid any legal argument arising on that point.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question which relates to terminology. I feel sure that this is along the usual lines and in the language usual in these cases.  I notice the phrase&mdash;it occurs also in another section&mdash;which says &ldquo;any offence under this Act may be prosecuted&rdquo;. To the layman it would be more normal to say an offender should be prosecuted.  Is the phrase I have referred to a set phrase?</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a definition of a trade union under the Trade Union Act, 1913, but a number of offices covered by the Bill would have people employed who might not be members of a trade union of the kind the Minister described.  There are workers in the smaller types of offices, the kind of workers more in need of protection, and they would not be in a trade union.  Does &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; in this amendment include staff associations?</P>

      <P>This is an important Bill to those people interested in the campaign to improve office conditions. The Bill, as such, is not as good as some of us would wish it to be, but it is certainly much better than the Bill we got from the Dáil.  I should hope that the Advisory Committee would be appointed quickly, and that they would tackle their job immediately.  I hope they will meet with all success.  I know that is the wish of the people concerned with the organisation of office workers that the job should be taken in hands immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one final point I want to make.  The fact that this Bill is much <Col N="1113" /> better than the Bill we got from the Dáil is due largely to the patience and, indeed, the skill of the Parliamentary Secretary.  We gave him a very tough day here last week and he certainly impressed us all with his patience and skill in dealing with the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask leave to raise a matter before we come to consider the Report Stage of the Prices Bill.  It is a matter I mentioned to the Chair before the House assembled to-day.</P>

      <P>It is a point of explanation.  While we were debating this Bill the last evening reference was made to it in the Dáil&mdash;I refer to Volume 164, No. 10, columns 1733-1734, of the Official Dáil Debates&mdash;in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;General Mulcahy: In view of the fact that the Dáil will be reassembling to take an amendment from the Seanad probably next week, perhaps this debate could be adjourned and the debate continued when the Dáil assembles to take that amendment.</P>
      <P>An Tánaiste: The Deputy is incorrect in that.  The Bill has not been completed in the Seanad and the Report Stage has been fixed for next week.</P>
      <P>General Mulcahy: But amendments will be coming to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Mr. MacEntee: The Opposition can carry on its own shoulders the responsibility for removing price control.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that the imputation that the responsibility for any gap between the ending of the Supplies and Services Bill and the coming into operation of this Prices Bill would be on the shoulders of the Seanad is not in accordance with the facts.  Most Senators will remember what occurred, but I will quote for the <Col N="1114" /> benefit of those members of the House who may not remember.  In Volume 48, No. 12, column 1036, of the Official Seanad Debates, Senator Hayes made the following offer, speaking of the Parliamentary Secretary on amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let him accept this amendment and the next amendment, No. 5, and we will give him all stages of the Bill to-night.  It can be brought back to the Dáil then and I am sufficiently experienced in the Dáil to know that the Dáil can suspend its proceedings for half an hour, or whatever it is, to consider these amendments.  They would require only about two minutes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Several Senators supported that offer. I myself said in the following column, 1038:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the offer made by Senator Hayes is a good and reasonable one, and I would support it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When it finally came to be decided as to whether we should take all stages that night and pass the Bill immediately back to the Dáil or delay it for another week, the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, at column 1053:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the next stage, what does the Parliamentary Secretary himself desire?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary indicated, in column 1054&mdash;I may as well quote his words for fear of misquoting or misinterpreting them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to meet the Seanad because it has been borne forcibly home to me that the Seanad does not want any of the stages of any Bill dealt with in a rushed, unsatisfactory and insufficient fashion.  I am in agreement with the Seanad there, and it seems to me there is a feeling that there is not going to be a rampage of profiteering next month simply because this Bill will not be in force.  For that reason, I am prepared to follow the ordinary course.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only point I would wish to make now is that we put ourselves in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary, and were prepared, if he had so desired it, to take all the stages the <Col N="1115" /> other evening, and, consequently, it is not in accordance with the facts to suggest that the Seanad, or any section of the Seanad, should be blamed, or have it said that it is on its shoulders if price control ceases.</P>

      <P>There is something rather astonishing about the quotation that Senator Sheehy Skeffington has read out.  I have not seen it yet but, if my recollection serves me right, the arrangement suggested by Senator Hayes was in relation to the first amendment incorporating the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.  It was only afterwards that the division was taken on a subsequent amendment. I do not see how, at that stage, there could have been the words ascribed to Senator Hayes that Senator Sheehy Skeffington has just read out.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has quoted from the Official Report and that disposes of the matter.</P>
      <P>There are three amendments to this Bill on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 1 clearly hinges on amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  Perhaps it would be advisable, if the House would agree, to recommit the Bill in respect of amendments Nos. 2 and 3 and, if the necessity arises, then amendment No. 1 could be moved on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendments Nos. 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>The Seanad went into Committee accordingly.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, Section 24 (1), (d), line 35, to delete &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; inserted before &ldquo;require&rdquo; in Committee by Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to have been some belief amongst members of the Seanad that the omission of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; before &ldquo;require&rdquo; in paragraph (d) of this section was accidental.  I want to assure the <Col N="1116" /> Seanad that that was not the case.  In paragraph (d), and again in paragraph (e), the relevant provisions relate to entries in books, and so forth, and other information.  Firms may from time to time claim privilege in respect of manufacturing formulae and similar information and it is important that they should continue to be in a position to claim privilege in respect of information of that kind, at least in cases where that claim is well founded and is, therefore, reasonable. That is the reason the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; appears in these paragraphs.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it must be presumed that it is reasonable for an authorised officer, acting for the purpose of obtaining any information which the Minister may require to enable him to exercise his function under the Act, to require information regarding persons carrying on the activity which is under inquiry because otherwise he could not pursue the matter at all.  It was, therefore, quite definitely desirable that the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; should not appear in that paragraph and there was no question of any oversight or omission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a claim to withhold information is reasonable, then the information can be withheld and in the respective paragraphs relating to certain types of information the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; appears.  An authorised officer seeking the type of information referred to in paragraph (d) must be presumed to be acting reasonably and, consequently, there is no need to make that provision there.  It may be said that the insertion of the word makes no difference but, apart from any desire to do a clean job in legislation of this kind, it is clear that the insertion of the word unnecessarily, because it would make no practical difference in the operation of the section, would have the undesirable effect of delaying the enactment of the measure and would also bring Section 24 of this Bill out of line with the corresponding sections of other Acts.  I do not know, again, if that would make any practical difference but it may be assumed that the authorised officers who will be operating under this Bill, to the extent that they ever have to operate, will be the same individuals as may be operating <Col N="1117" /> on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under other somewhat similar measures.</P>
    <P>I would urge that the word be deleted.  I want to assure the House that their amendment did not rectify an omission.  It is considered preferable that the presumption that the officer is acting reasonably in requiring this information should be maintained and, if he is not entitled to get that information and entitled to get it without question, then he might as well not be acting at all because he can do nothing else to enforce his powers under the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>As the original proposer of this amendment, I should like to remind the Seanad that this was not an amendment passed by a vote of the Seanad, but agreed to by the Parliamentary Secretary and agreed to unanimously by the Seanad. The Minister has told us that it must be presumed that officers seeking information of this kind will be acting reasonably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that it is reasonable to seek this information in paragraph (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>That in seeking such information they would be acting reasonably.  I feel the Minister's case would be much stronger if the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; were not included in paragraphs (a), (b) and (e), which paragraph (e) follows paragraph (d).  In paragraph (a) we are told about all &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; times.  In paragraph (b) it is felt necessary that the inspector be allowed to require the person to give him &ldquo;such information as he may reasonably require.&rdquo;  It is felt necessary to say &ldquo;as he may reasonably require&rdquo;.  The Minister does not feel that in that case we may &ldquo;presume&rdquo; that he will ask only for information that he may reasonably require. He feels it absolutely necessary to specify here that he may require only such information as he may reasonably require.  Similarly in paragraph (e), which comes after the paragraph we have amended, it says &ldquo;require such person to give him any other information which he may reasonably require.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> The submission I would make is that the very presence of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in the other paragraphs, and the omission of it in one paragraph, leaves a very strong presumption that you are asking for wider powers under this paragraph than under the paragraphs, where you have felt it necessary to say that he shall ask for only what might be reasonably required.  In other words, were it not found necessary in the other paragraphs to bind him by the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;, the Minister's case might be stronger, but it has been felt necessary in relation to paragraphs (a), (b) and (e) to restrict the officer to requiring only information that may be reasonably sought and from that restriction he would be liberated in paragraph (d) by the omission of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  I think the Senator may have misunderstood my point.  Paragraph (a) does not matter.  It is only a limitation on the times at which an inspector may seek entry into premises where any business is being carried out. Paragraphs (b) and (e) are the paragraphs the Senator has in mind.  I think it is desirable in that case to provide that the proprietor of a business may withhold information where there is a good reason for doing so and where it is reasonable to expect him to withhold it.  I give an illustration&mdash; books, documents or records related to a manufacturing process which the proprietor did not wish to have disclosed outside the limits of his own business organisation.  It would be reasonable to withhold that information. Consequently, it is stipulated here that he can withhold the information because it is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph (d) we are up against a different position.  An inspector asks: &ldquo;Who is carrying on the business?&rdquo;  It is not reasonable to withhold that information.  It is reasonable for the inspector to seek it.  It must be presumed to be reasonable to seek it.  One cannot conceive circumstances in which that information, in the context of this section, could reasonably be withheld. If the inspector cannot get that information, he may as well go home <Col N="1119" /> because that is the point at which his inquiry must start.  It is the presumption that it is reasonable that the inspector should get that information that I am anxious to protect.  To insert &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; there would suggest that there would be circumstances in which it would not be reasonable for the inspector to get that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We must go back to the limiting words at the beginning of the section &ldquo;...for the purpose of obtaining any information which the Minister may require for enabling him to exercise his functions under this Act, ...&rdquo;  That is the overriding condition. It must be information which has definite relevance to the Minister's function under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph as it is framed, while it may be aimed at finding out the identity of the persons, mentions one or two cases in which that may occur in practice, but it is not exclusive.  The paragraph, as it is at present framed, does not refer to the identity of the persons but, in fact, the words are &ldquo;...any information he may require in regard to the persons carrying on such activity...&rdquo; It seems to me that the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspector cannot ask him if he had backed a winner at Baldoyle on the previous Saturday.  It must be information required by the <Col N="1120" /> Minister to enable him to exercise his functions under the Act.  He would not need to know, for example, if the person had backed a winner at Baldoyle on the previous Saturday to enable him to exercise his functions under this Act.  It is in that limited context that the inspectors may ask for information&mdash;the names of all the persons carrying on such activity or the persons employed in it.  The reason why the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; does not appear there is because it is desirable to have it presumed to be reasonable that the inspector should get that information and that there should be no question about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me refer to paragraph (b) where there is a similar presumption&mdash;that it is only information required by the Minister.  Yet there it is felt necessary to say &ldquo;...and to give him such information as he may reasonably require...&rdquo; It is not felt that the wording of the earlier part of the section, which says it is for the purpose of &ldquo;any information which the Minister may require,&rdquo; is protection enough in paragraph (e) but it is so thought in relation to paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be circumstances in which it would be reasonable to withhold that information.  For instance, suppose there is a question of an Order fixing the price of bread and somebody charges more.  He argues: &ldquo;My bread is better than that made by others.  It has ingredients that other bread has not.&rdquo;  He can reasonably refuse to disclose those ingredients if he thinks he is giving away a trade secret.  Such a situation is not likely to arise.  I do not recollect that any such situation has ever arisen but I can see circumstances in which an inspector may ask for information of that kind which the business proprietor could in reason be entitled to withhold because of the possible effect it would have upon his business. If any question as to whether the proprietor was reasonably entitled to with hold the information should arise the matter could be contested and ultimately it would have to be settled in the court.  The right to withhold <Col N="1121" /> it, in reason, should be presumed. That does not apply where the inspector starts off to inquire as to the identity of the persons carrying on the business.  The inquiry should start there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I am making the same point myself.  If we insert &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; we imply that there are circumstances in which he need not disclose that information.  I do not want that implication.  I want it presumed from the start that the inspector is reasonably entitled to the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most interesting debate I have ever heard. The Minister has stated quite clearly that the insertion of &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; here&mdash;which, by the way, was inserted unanimously in the Seanad and accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;makes no practical difference except from the point of view of delay. <Col N="1122" /> If it makes no practical difference, I do not see why it should not be inserted.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything in the Minister's argument that, under paragraph (d), he requires information about the personnel of an unincorporated body of persons.  If that is what he wanted, he would have told the draftsman to say so in the paragraph. In fact, he has told the draftsman to say that the inspector can require that information.  He may require information in regard to the persons carrying on such activity&mdash;&ldquo;...(including, in particular,...).&rdquo;  The Minister knows better than I do, because he has had more experience of government, that that expression &ldquo;...(including, in particular,...)&rdquo; is put in there so as to leave room for other information to be given.  Is that not correct? There is no doubt about it&mdash;&ldquo;... (including, in particular,...)&rdquo; without taking anything from the generality of the foregoing.</P>
      <P>He wants information.  If the Minister's point were correct, then this paragraph would be differently worded. It would require the person to give any information which may be required about certain things which would be defined.  The paragraph is differently worded.  It is worded that you have to give any information that may be required&mdash;not reasonably required but that may be required&mdash;about a lot of things but particularly including these. Surely there is no validity in the Minister's argument.  If the Minister is right in saying there is no practical difference then the simplest thing to do would be to leave the word in and get on with the business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my point. My first point was to establish the contention that the omission of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in this section was not accidental but was very deliberate. Does it make any difference if we put it in?  I suppose that no case would arise in 100 years where it would make the slightest difference: nevertheless, I suggest it is a cleaner job to leave it out because of the considerations which I have mentioned.  Certainly there is no point in putting in an unnecessary <Col N="1123" /> amendment which will make no practical difference, if that is the case made, merely if by doing so we will cause delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps some members of the Seanad need a little instruction upon a point of law upon which I have taken instruction myself in the course of the past week.  Communications between a solicitor and client made in the course of, or for the purpose of, the professional employment of a solicitor are, with certain qualifications, protected by privilege not only from disclosures in a court of law but from any disclosure whatever.  The privilege is that of the client and not of his legal adviser.  Such communications are as privileged in the hands of the client as in the hands of his legal adviser.  The section of this Bill to which the amendment was inserted by the Seanad is not intended to defeat or limit the existing privilege by changing the law so as to require production by the client or solicitor of any confidential communications which would carry that claim to privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraphs (b) and (e), a person is required to give information and documents reasonably required by an officer.  It would not be reasonable for an officer to insist on disclosure of privileged communications.  If it was <Col N="1125" /> intended to defeat a so well recognised provision of the law, express provisions would have to be made and accordingly no amendment of this Bill is needed to save it from invading the privilege mentioned therein.  It is therefore clear that this amendment is not necessary for the purpose of protecting the right to privilege or the privilege attaching to communications between client and solicitor.  It is also clear that the retention of the paragraph in the section would make the whole section inoperative.  If a person interrogated by an advisory officer merely stated he was claiming privilege or refused to reply because by replying he might incriminate himself there is nothing the authorised officer could do except to bring legal proceedings in the High Court.  I have already given my view that in the majority of cases there will be a ready and willing compliance with the law. In a minority of cases, the law will be complied with when the need to do so is brought to the attention of those people.  Amongst a small minority, there will be a desire to evade the law and if members of that minority, who will deliberately and consciously try to evade the law, are given a loophole of this kind, it is to be assumed that they will avail of it.  The only purpose in keeping this sub-section in the Bill would be to undermine and nearly destroy the powers of the authorised officers when dealing with those people who will seek means of evading the law.  It is not necessary for protecting any right to privilege which now exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage last week, I gave some of the reasons why I thought this amendment should be incorporated in the section.  Nothing that the Minister has now stated leads me to believe that it is not necessary. There are two points involved in this sub-section which has been inserted. First of all, there is the question of compelling people and it amounts to compelling them under threat of penalty to make statements and give evidence which would incriminate themselves.  The second is the question of privilege between a person and his legal adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> On the earlier Bill to-day, the Office Premises Bill, the Minister adopted the attitude, in relation to the amendment put down by me, that the section which I was seeking to amend was common form in legislation of this kind.  I accept that that is the position. I have looked up a number of statutes and find it is common form where it is sought to have inspectors and authorised officers carry out investigations.  It is necessary to give them wide powers and the Oireachtas has recognised that in a great number of statutes which have been enacted over the years; but even though those powers are wide and necessary, the Oireachtas in its wisdom has always imposed certain limits and has said to the inspectors: &ldquo;This far shalt thou go and no further&rdquo;.  It always stopped at the point where it does not require anybody to give any information or make any statements which would tend to incriminate himself.</P>
    <P>That saving sub-section in these various sections is merely an enactment of the common law and the common law is something which we have inherited here and which has been well established over the years.  In particular, that aspect of the law applies to people about to be charged or suspected of being involved in criminal matters.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when speaking here the other night, referred to the Factories Act, and said that in Section 24 (2), where inspectors were invested with these wide powers, there was the provision which is shown in the first part of the sub-section which has been inserted that no one shall be required, by virtue of paragraph (f) of this sub-section, to tender evidence which would incriminate himself.</P>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Act of 1952, Section 49 (4) there is a similar power vested in authorised officers of the Minister for Social Welfare.  It goes on, in sub-section (4), as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...but no one shall be required under this section to answer any questions or to give any evidence tending to incriminate himself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Holidays (Employees) Act of <Col N="1127" /> 1939, in Section 16 (1), paragraph (d), it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...to have been a worker or the employer of any worker and require such person to answer such questions (other than questions tending to incriminate such person)...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Control of Prices Act, 1937, which is being repealed by this Bill.  In that Act there were powers conferred upon inspectors but again, in that case, there was not, and is not, a clause equivalent to paragraph (e) in this sub-section.  There is similar provision safeguarding people from the liability of incriminating themselves in the Insurance (Intermittent Employment) Act of 1942, Section 49.</P>
    <P>I have gone through a number of statutes and I find that in all these cases where powers are given to inspectors they are cut down in the respect that persons are not obliged to incriminate themselves.  This, of course, is a measure designed to protect the public from people who would fleece them by overcharging where prices have been fixed, but I would direct the attention of the House to the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Second Stage of this Bill in the Dáil, reported at column 125 of Volume 164 of the Official Report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to present this Bill to the House as a measure of major importance.  It is not and I do not want to regard it as such.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Reported at column 117 of the same volume, the Minister said that the Government had contemplated allowing the Supplies and Services Act to lapse on the 31st of this month and not to introduce any legislation at all, but that they had decided against that course though it had certain attractions.</P>
    <P>I think that view of the Minister on this Bill is relevant in so far as the Bill, not being a measure of major importance, is seeking powers which, in my view, are extraordinary powers and for which there is no precedent in any legislation enacted by the Oireachtas to date.  I should like to qualify that by saying &ldquo;legislation of a peacetime <Col N="1128" /> character&rdquo;, or legislation which does not deal with matters affecting the security of the State such as the Offences Against the State Acts or the Treason Act.  But in legislation of this kind I think it would be very wrong of the House to agree to a provision of this kind which will establish a new situation where people will be obliged, under the penalty of imprisonment or fine not exceeding £100, to make statements which would tend to incriminate them.</P>
    <P>Even erring business people have rights.  They are citizens and I think it will be accepted by the House that it is the distinction more or less between the way of life under democratic régimes and under totalitarian régimes that people are to be compelled by law to make public confessions through which they can be brought before the courts and imprisoned or fined.  That is the issue that is involved in the first part of this sub-section.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the case of someone in a small town, some small shopkeeper who is trying to make what he regards as an honest penny.  I do not want to be taken as holding any brief for overcharging.  I am taking the case of a simple person in a small town in the country.  An inspector comes in from the Department and announces himself as such and, if necessary, produces his authorisation.  That situation immediately places the individual citizen at a great disadvantage.  The citizen in many of these cases has very poor resources, perhaps mentally and possibly financially, to meet the charges that can be laid against him by the great machine of State.</P>
    <P>In dealing with legislation of this kind we should have regard to the fact that in many of these charges you have the great machine of the State, with all its resources, being brought to bear upon some person who may, even with these powers, be found to be not guilty by the courts.  I think that every fairness should be shown to ordinary citizens going about their way of life when it comes to questions of bringing them before the courts with the possible result of a heavy fine or a term of imprisonment.  As far as my information <Col N="1129" /> and experience on the matter go, even when a person is brought before the courts under legislation of this kind and where he has been found to be quite guiltless of the charge of which he is accused, he always faces the odium in public eyes of having been charged with a breach of the prices regulations and also suffers the costs involved in that kind of litigation. As far as my knowledge goes, where the State takes prosecutions against a person like that, even where the person is found to be guiltless, the courts never award costs against the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given the House the benefit of his information on the position with regard to privilege, which comprises the second leg of this section. I do not dissent from the general statement as to the legal position with regard to privilege, but I do dissent from the view expressed by the Minister that if this legislation is enacted, because it does not specifically take away the immunity which a person now enjoys in relation to confidential communications between him and his legal adviser, it necessarily follows it is not taken away by the Bill.  There is a similar section in the Income Tax Act of 1918 where solicitors may be obliged by the Revenue Commissioners to disclose information which they have got in their character as legal advisers.</P>
    <P>That section has been subject to constructive argument not in these courts but in courts where they have legislation of a similar kind and I would certainly dissent from the Minister's view to the extent that it is questionable whether or not this section does take away from people the rights which they already enjoy in regard to confidential communications.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is satisfied that it does not interfere with the confidential communications passing between solicitors and clients, I think he ought to have no objection whatever to inserting it in the Bill.  That would put them beyond any doubt and it is desirable, in view of the fact that legislation of this kind always is an invasion of the rights of the people, that long established rights and rights which <Col N="1130" /> have been upheld by the courts on grounds of public policy, should be specifically safeguarded in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Quigley's reference to totalitarian régimes is both unjustified and offensive. There is no one seeking in this section to take away anyone's rights. References to the Income Tax Act of 1918 are quite irrelevant.  No one is proposing to invade in the slightest the privilege attached to communications between solicitor and client.  I want to make it quite clear that this section does not mean, in the form in which it was originally framed in the Bill, any such invasion; and to insert an amendment of this kind in it would be stupid.  One might as well insert a section saying that a person questioned by an authorised officer does not have to stand on his head when answering the questions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rest of the section, I think a complete misunderstanding exists about the provisions of the Bill.  There is no analogy whatever between the functions of an authorised officer under this Bill and an inspector under the Factories Act&mdash;or the Office Premises Bill, for that matter.  An inspector under these other measures acts in a quasi-judicial capacity.  He can require the confirmation of any statement made in writing and he may be investigating an occurrence arising out of which court proceedings under other enactments may be taken, or a fatal case, where there certainly would be an inquiry by a coroner's court.  The functions of the authorised officer under the Prices Bill are entirely different. Nothing happens at all, automatically, in consequence of a refusal by a person to answer the questions of an authorised officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley referred to other enactments where the same provisions were inserted relating to what he called the various sub-sections of this section.  His amendment relates only to one paragraph, that is (e), and it is seeking to confuse the Seanad as to its significance to try to relate it to other provisions of the section.  I have said already that we can have prices legislation <Col N="1131" /> which is no more than a demonstration, or we can have that which can be made effective.  I do not intend that this Bill will ever be utilised except in circumstances which quite obviously require its utilisation; but if there is need to control the price of bread, butter, sugar or some other essential commodity, then we should be concerned to ensure that the control will be effective and that those who want to evade the control and charge excessive prices for those commodities should not be given, not a loophole but an avenue, to avoid prosecution as is proposed in this section.</P>
    <P>I have to take the Senator's word for it that he is anxious to preserve price control, but the effect of his amendment would be to make price control ineffective, because it would give that excuse to any person who wanted to evade an investigation being carried out by an authorised officer, following the making of price control Orders, which would make that investigation ineffective.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out already, the only people against whom the powers of an authorised officer will have to be used are those who are deliberately trying to evade their statutory obligations.  I want to make it clear that I could not, under any circumstances, accept this amendment and if the Seanad insists on its insertion in the Bill I shall have to ask the Dáil to delete it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really no necessity for the Minister to lose his temper about this.  I do not see anything sinister at all in Section 24 or in this paragraph (e).  There is nothing else in it but the ordinary desire of every Government Department, under every conceivable Minister, to make provision for everything.  Look at this. The Minister can say, if he wishes, that I am not in favour of price control or that I am all for high prices.  Of course I am not, any more than the Minister is.  I grant that he is perfectly <i>bona fide</i> in this.  However, I think the Seanad could do a very useful work in getting these Bills drafted in rather a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> In order to clear up this point about paragraph (e), could we not look at the whole of Section 24?  It allows the authorised officer to do certain things. Now, the paragraph and the section are very intelligently drafted.  Paragraph (a) gives the authorised officer power to enter he premises.  That is granted at once.  Paragraph (b) gives him power to compel the production of all kinds of books, records and documents.  I grant that to the Minister, too.  Paragraph (c) goes a step further and says that if, having looked at any books, records, or documents, he wants to make copies, he may make copies.  Paragraph (d), about which we have just had some discussion, gives further power to the authorised officer&mdash;in pursuance of the objects of the Bill, of course&mdash;to get information about the personnel, about everybody working in the place, about people who may be directors, about anybody connected with the company or the firm, whether it is an incorporated body or not.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) then comes along and it requires the person to give any other information which may reasonably be required.  Why?  What else is there to be got in the circumstances for these purposes&mdash;except an inspection of premises, of the books, the making of copies of anything in the records and full information as regards the personnel and those who control the firm and who work in it?  What other conceivable information is there? This paragraph (e) has nothing sinister in it.  It is not totalitarian.  The Minister has no intention of walking upon anybody's face, I quite agree, but intelligent people, like, for example, the Incorporated Law Society, believe that this paragraph (e) might have a very wide effect and I must say that on reading it&mdash;and having read a fair amount of legislation&mdash;it seems to me an enormous power.  I do not say it will be exercised, but what use is it or why should it be there at all? Surely the power given under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) is sufficient for the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Instead of making the proviso which Senator O'Quigley has pointed out to <Col N="1133" /> me is to be found in other legislation, the proviso that a person need not incriminate himself or disclose matters arising between himself and his legal adviser, the Minister, if he wishes, can take this paragraph out.  The Minister told us on a previous amendment that he was anxious to have clean and tidy drafting.  I suggest it would be a great improvement to this section and would make for clean and tidy drafting, if he deleted paragraph (e), which cannot be of any use to him. Then, of course, that would involve the deletion of the amendment which we inserted.</P>
    <P>Without losing one's temper and without charging the Minister with anything, the truth is that this kind of drafting&mdash;for which the Minister is not particularly responsible himself&mdash; ought to be stopped.  While making provision, you add an omnibus section or paragraph which brings in everything. If you want an officer of the Department to go to Drumcondra by bus, you provide that he may travel by air, road, rail or sea and by any public conveyance, whether owned by the State or otherwise, as he may require.  I suggest that paragraph (e) is not necessary.  People who are not stupid&mdash;the Minister said that people who talk like this are stupid&mdash;and who are making a very good living in the law do not agree with the Minister as regards what (e) means.  I know that, on legal matters, there is always room for two opinions.  I have seen three and four opinions on the same question, but there is no use saying that people who object to this provision are stupid. They are not stupid, but they are not Ministers.  That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister has all the powers he wants in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d).  If we stop putting in this omnibus provision to deal with things which may possibly arise, to use the Minister's own words, the Bill will be much cleaner and much tidier.  I suggest the proper thing to do with paragraph (e) is to take it out, and then everything else follows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Quigley, I hold no brief for those who would profiteer or charge unduly <Col N="1134" /> high prices, but that is not the issue here.  Last week, we decided it was right and proper that people being investigated under this section should not be obliged to incriminate themselves; in effect, they should not be obliged by statute to confess their sins to an inspector.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that the authorised officers under this section are different from inspectors operating under the Factories Acts and other Acts.  He said that he latter acted in a quasi-legal capacity&mdash;I think that was the expression he used. I believe he is wrong in that and somewhat off the point because, if one looks at the section as a whole, one finds what exactly an authorised officer is and what he will do.  He will investigate something for the purpose of the Minister, the Minister exercising his function under the Act.</P>
      <P>In line 16, there are the words: &ldquo;to exercise his function under this Act.&rdquo; The investigating officer is collecting any information necessary for the Minister to exercise his function under the Act, and one of the functions of the Minister is to prosecute.  He is in somewhat the same position, therefore, as a member of the Garda coming to someone who is believed to have committed an offence and asking questions. As the provision stands, we are providing in law that the person questioned must make open confession of any offence he may have committed.  If that is to be the law, the possibility is that we may all find ourselves in an embarrassing position at some time. Fortunately, it is not the law at the moment.</P>
      <P>Under this section, if this amendment is not accepted, it seems to me as a layman, that the position in law will be reversed.  I can accept that the Minister would never wish to exercise his rights in that way and authorised officers would not attempt to do that; but, if that is so, then there can be no real objection to the amendment.  I do not know about privilege.  I am not expert in that, but I think the other part of the amendment is important and it should be incorporated in this measure.</P>

      <P>The second sub-section of this Section 24 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any person obstructs or impedes an authorised officer in the exercise of his powers under sub-section (1) of this section or does not comply with a requirement of an authorised officer under the said sub-section (1), that person shall be guilty of an offence under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unless we amend the Bill, as was suggested by the Seanad, we shall create a new offence indictable under sub-section (2) of this section.  Anyone refusing to give information to an authorised officer on the grounds, recognised as legitimate in common law, that to do so might incriminate himself, can be brought to court and charged under this provision, unless the amendment is accepted by the Government.  If a court is asked to decide as between common law practice and a section in a new Act, it seems to me that the court, while recognising that an &ldquo;offence&rdquo; has been committed, will very probably dismiss the case under the Probation Act.  The Minister is asking for powers that no court will uphold, because I doubt very much if our courts would in effect hold that common law practice can be violated by a simple section in a new Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be happier about this section as amended last time if the matter in brackets were left out, and if the section were to read: &ldquo;no one shall be required by virtue of paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of this section to answer any questions or give any evidence tending to incriminate himself or in respect of which he would be entitled to claim privilege in the High Court&rdquo;.  The suggestion in the present wording is that the only grounds upon which he could claim privilege are grounds where the matter might be a &ldquo;matter of confidence between him and his legal adviser.&rdquo; The brackets rather weaken the section, and the section would be even better if the matter in brackets were left out altogether.  The first portion of the section is essential.  If the Minister insists on asking for power to compel <Col N="1136" /> people to give information which might incriminate themselves, and his officers prosecute such people for refusing to give such information, I believe that the Minister's officers will be laughed out of court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me this amendment raises a point of the highest constitutional importance.  It has always been accepted in common law that nobody is bound to incriminate himself in a court of law, much less in reply to a police officer or an official of the Government.  This Bill sets out a whole new apparatus for doing something with which we are all in agreement in a sense, namely, controlling prices.  But this new apparatus is one of administration.  A new type of official is given new powers to do things under this section, things which a judge could not do, things which a district justice could not do and things which a police officer could not do.  That seems to me to offend against every instinct of anybody who has any feeling for the freedom of the individual.  It is a perfect example of administrative law, without due safeguards for the citizen.  It is the duty of the Seanad to put a curb on this sort of administrative law.  In every country in the world, this type of administrative procedure sooner or later lapses into grave injustice and it is the duty of the Legislature to prevent sections of this kind becoming a blot on our Statute Book.</P>

      <P>I do not know who holds <Col N="1138" /> the doubt.  You can take it from me that that is an authoritative opinion. What we are concerned with is a provision which says that a person need not incriminate himself.  No doubt it is desirable in the instance&mdash;I am dealing with the only possible case that could arise&mdash;of somebody selling stolen property at an excessive price who refuses to disclose the name of the thief. That is how the question of incriminating himself arises in this connection.  I concede that an entirely different situaton arises in connection with certain other amendments where there was good reason to impose that limitation on the powers of inspectors operating under these other enactments, but it does not arise here.  Let us strip this discussion of the debating society atmosphere and get down to realities. Everybody knows the Supplies and Services Act will lapse on the 31st December and there is nothing we can do about it now.

I will not say for the sake of holding it up but inserting unnecessary amendments which will have the effect of holding it up, preventing the completion of this measure and the substitution of other powers of price control in place of those that are lapsing on 31st December.</P>
      <P>One amendment has been passed. There is nothing we can do about that now.  We had a most futile argument here and the net result was that it makes not the slightest difference. There should have been a greater sense of responsibility, a disposition not to make an unnecessary change knowing what the effect of that change would be.  We now have another amendment, which is perhaps of a more serious character, because the effect of inserting this amendment in the Bill is to make ineffective the powers of the authorised officer.</P>

    <P>I again urge Senator to face this <Col N="1139" /> thing realistically.  If circumstances arise under which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to use his power to make an Order fixing a maximum price for bread, butter or some of other essential commodities in respect of which he can act without a preliminary investigation, it is to be assumed that the great majority of traders will obey the law.  It is to be assumed also that some will try to evade it and it is in relation to that minority that we must have whatever powers the inpectors enforcing the Order may require.  If you put in a section here saying that anybody can refuse to give information to an inspector and refuse to answer because he might incriminate himself, what can the inspector do about it?</P>

      <P>It is my experience&mdash; and I think I have more experience than most in this connection&mdash;that most Orders made by a Government, even Orders which are difficult to observe, Orders made in exceptional times, are nevertheless respected and obeyed by the great majority of citizens and that the powers of enforcement are never called upon in relation to the great majority.  But there is a minority who will seek to evade these obligations, to evade them for their own profit.  It is in relation to that minority that some powers of enforcement must be required.  We can express a hope that people will obey this Order or else we can give some authorised officer the powers necessary to see that its requirements are obeyed.  Which do you want?  My argument is that putting in the first part of this amendment would just open an avenue by which the individual who is, in fact, breaking the law in that regard can nevertheless hope to evade the penalty. The second part of the amendment is not necessary at all.</P>
      <P>I confess I thought for a period whether we could, in present circumstances, do without price control legislation altogether.  I decided that circumstances could arise in which we needed it and if those circumstances did arise the situation must be dealt with effectively.  Which do you want to accept, legislation to give effect to Senator O'Brien's theoretical point of view or effective legislation based on the practical point of view I am putting before you?  If you are going to have price control Orders and those Orders enforced by inspectors, inspectors must have these minimum powers which will enable them to function properly.  I expected Professor O'Brien to be on that side, but there are quite a few people whom I am astonished to see in his company on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill contained certain amendments inserted by the Seanad.  In view of what the Minister has said, I should like to say that those who supported these amendments made no effort whatever to delay the Bill. <Col N="1143" /> Perhaps I would be allowed to point out that, speaking here on the 5th December, as reported at column 1036, I said, alluding to the first of the two amendments carried in the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any event, in the situation in which the Parliamentary Secretary finds himself now, I will make him this offer.  Let him accept this amendment and the next amendment, No. 5, and we will give him all stages of the Bill to-night.  It can be brought back to the Dáil then and I am sufficiently experienced in the Dáil to know that the Dáil can suspend its proceedings for half an hour, or whatever it is, to consider these amendments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I made him an offer to finish all stages of the Bill last week while the Dáil was still in session.</P>
      <P>I think it is necessary to say this because certain suggestions have been made&mdash;indeed the Minister has made two suggestions.  One is that the people who supported the amendments now in the Bill are against price control and want to help the minority of people who would object to regulations made under the Bill.  The other suggestion is that we deliberately delayed the Bill.  Neither suggestion has any truth or foundation.</P>

I did not put a pen or pencil to any part of the report.  This is exactly as the reporter took it with no emendation of any kind from me.  I know sufficient about parliamentary procedure and I did intend to facilitate the Parliamentary Secretary, by allowing him go back to the Dáil and, if he could get accommodation from the Dáil, have his amendments either passed or rejected.

      <P>I should like to speak on this Bill just very briefly and to express the hope that the Minister will use the powers that are being given to him under Part II&mdash;power to set up prices advisory committees in relation to various commodities.  It has been suggested that it would be a good thing if this Bill could be enacted quickly.  I should like to hope that the Minister, once he has got the power, will in fact use it quickly.  It would be a pity if we were to be told &ldquo;I must have these powers quickly&rdquo;, and if we then found that six months or a year passed and the Minister did not, in fact, use the powers to set up these prices advisory committees which he is entitled to do under the terms of the Act now passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prices advisory committees to be set up under Part II will confirm the Minister's powers and the powers of <Col N="1145" /> the Fair Trade Commission to inquire into restrictive practices, price rings and so on.  I should like to express the hope that, this time, the Minister will act on the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission when they report to him that there is price rigging, that prices are artificially high, that certain commodities cannot be bought at competitive prices, and so on.  It is in the spirit of that hope, that not merely will this Act not remain &ldquo;on the shelf&rdquo;, as the Minister suggested it might in the Dáil, but that it will actually be implemented, that I make these final remarks on the Bill as it passes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the point made by Senator Hayes, I think I should make it clear that the Parliamentary Secretary, who was in charge of the Bill during the Committee Stage in the Seanad, did not understand Senator Hayes to be making an offer in relation to any other amendment except the first amendment which was accepted by the Seanad.  Anybody who reads the report of the remarks in the Official Debate attributed to the Parliamentary Secretary will see it is quite clear what his understanding of the position was.</P>
      <P>As far as I am personally concerned, although I consider the amendment trivial, stupid and unnecessary, I was prepared to accept it rather than hold up the Bill.  If that amendment alone had come from the Seanad, the Bill would now be law.  But when there was a second amendment, which I thought was still more stupid, adopted by the Seanad, I could not go that far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objection to the second amendment is that it does, in effect, mean that the powers of the authorised officers, officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, who will be responsible for the operation of the Bill, are considerably undermined and made almost ineffective.  Senators who consider that that amendment was justified can, of course, give their reasons for it.  I do not propose to try to interpret the motives of those Senators.  I suggest that some of those who voted for the amendment were animated by no higher ambition than <Col N="1146" /> to appear to score a victory over the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I want to draw a distinction between the possession of powers and the use of powers. The fact that the Government has power to prevent undesirable developments often means they never occur.  I should hope that after the enactment of this measure, when the more unreasonable of these amendments has been eradicated from it, it will not be necessary to resort to it with any great frequency.  Indeed, my view is that it is desirable to keep official control of prices to a minimum and to exercise it only when there is clear and established justification for it.  I am not one of those who argue in favour of an official control of prices to prevent a rise in the cost of living when economic forces are pushing them up.  It is rather surprising that those who would argue along those lines were amongst those who now appear to be least concerned about the speedy enactment of this measure.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's remark that I should undertake always to act upon the report of the Fair Trade Commission, I give no such undertaking.  I refuse to part to anybody with the right to exercise my own intelligence.</P>

    <Title>Gas Regulation Bill, 1957&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not dissimilar from the Bill we have just been discussing.  The only reason why the provisions of this Bill were not incorporated in the Prices Bill is that it was deemed to be desirable to keep legislation relating to the control of gas prices in a separate statute because there is quite a code of law in <Col N="1147" /> existence dealing with the regulation of the price and quality of gas.</P>
      <P>The Bill is, otherwise, however, identical in most respects with the Bill which has now passed from the Seanad.  It provides for the introduction of control of gas charges in certain cases in certain circumstances, either when a committee has reported that gas charges are unduly high for reasons within the control of the sellers of gas or when temporary supply difficulties create the risk of the public being exploited in respect of gas charges.</P>
      <P>I should explain that gas charges are at present controlled under the Supplies and Services Act, which will, as I have already said, lapse on 31st December.  Before the war, there were a large number of Acts relating to gas charges&mdash;some applying to gas charges generally and others applying to the charges of individual companies.  Some of these Acts provided for control on the basis of fixing maximum charges and others for control on a sliding scale arrangement which related the price of gas to the dividends paid to the shareholders. These Acts provided that, when the price went up, dividends had to come down.  These Acts became completely inoperative and difficult, due to the circumstances of the war and the low quality of the coal.  The problems of that day made regulations on that basis impossible.  Consequently, control was exercised under the war-time emergency legislation and has up to now been exercised under the Supplies and Services Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that Act has lapsed, unless this Bill is enacted, these old Acts will come back into question, and, while I do not want to deprive the Seanad of its power to insert amendments, I should point out that, if they do so, these Acts which relate the price of gas to the profits taken by a company will be back in operation and these companies will, I think, have to remain out of production until the necessary changes in legislation have been made, although it would not be beyond human ingenuity to find a way out of that problem.  I am proposing in this Bill that control shall be exercised in the future only in relation <Col N="1148" /> to the larger undertakings which are in private ownership.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of small undertakings which supply gas to the smaller towns which I am not proposing to control at all, because most of them are continuing in business only with great difficulty and their problem is not so much that they want to increase the price of gas, but that they cannot get for the gas they sell in competition with other sources of energy and heat a price that will enable them to cover their operating costs.  It would be rather futile to talk about control in their case.  Nor do I purpose control in the case of undertakings owned by municipal councils.  There are a number of such undertakings in this country.  If they are presumably managed, conducted and operated in the interests of the ratepayers of the locality, the representatives of the ratepayers on the council can exercise all the control necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, is limited in its operation to the undertakings which are listed in the First Schedule.  These are privately-owned undertakings engaged on a larger scale of operations than the remainder.  The principles of control are the same&mdash;no control at all, unless a temporary position of scarcity arises, or unless a committee has reported, on investigation, that circumstances which are capable of being remedied and which are within the control of those engaged in the undertaking are operated to cause charges to be unduly high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shown us that this Bill is necessary by reason of the automatic lapsing of the Supplies and Services Act at the end of the year.  He has told us also that the control of the price of gas is also due to the fact that the terms of the previous legislation were completely inoperable during war conditions. He mentioned just now and in the Dáil also that one of the provisions of the pre-war legislation in relation to the price of gas was a simple one: if you wanted to raise the dividend rate, you had to lower the price.  There was, in fact&mdash;I think I am correct in saying this&mdash;an actual proportion laid down which was that for every one-eighth of <Col N="1149" /> 1 per cent. you wanted to raise the dividend, you had to reduce the price of gas one-fifth of a penny per therm.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that that kind of thing was quite impossible during the war.  He did not explain why it would be quite impossible now.  I am not prepared to say it would be possible, but if I am to be told that it would not be possible now, I should like to know why.  What are the circumstances which would make it absolutely impossible to relate the price of gas to the dividend rate?  It seems to me that although the pre-war figures, percentages and so on, might not now be operable, the idea was a good one, for if the gas company, by its efficiency, was enabled to pay an increased dividend, it was asked, before doing so, to reduce the price.  In other words, the results of increased efficiency went partly to the shareholders and partly to the consumers.</P>
      <P>Whether or not such a regulation would now be operable, I should like to ask the Minister whether, in his view, it would be a good thing if the principle inherent in that legislation were borne in mind by the advisory committees which may be set up. In other words, does he contemplate that there shall be in the minds of the members of the committees some kind of basic relationship between the dividends being paid and the charges being recommended by the advisory committees?  I think it is quite a good principle, particularly with a monopoly enterprise, to relate the price of the commodity, in so far as you are attempting to fix it, to the dividend rate; and we must recognise that these are monopoly enterprises and that, consequently, the State, in assuming the right to regulate the charge, might bear in mind the kind of profits being made, the kind of dividend that is being paid, arising out of those charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also suggested&mdash;I hope I am not misinterpreting him&mdash;that unless we pass this Gas Regulation Bill through all its stages to-day, or at any rate before the end of this year, the gas companies will not be able to operate.  That was the horrible picture that he held up before us.  Now, this <Col N="1150" /> Bill went through the final stages in the Dáil only on 5th December.  To-day is 11th December.  The Minister comes in here on 11th December, having piloted his Bill through the last stages in the Dáil on 5th December, and tells us that if we do not pass every stage here to-day, all these poor towns will be completely without gas, with the implication that it will be our fault.</P>
    <P>I should just like to make the point that, if it is anybody's fault, it is the fault of whoever is responsible&mdash;I am not suggesting that it was necessarily the Minister&mdash;for not bringing us this Bill in time at least to allow for theoretical amendments.  I do not suggest that any amendments are necessary, but it is wrong for a Minister to assume that any Bill coming to this House is incapable of useful amendment.  If any Minister has got it into his head that that is so, he is making a mistake, and that impression should be corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make it quite clear that I did not suggest at all that it was necessary to pass all stages of this Bill to-day?  What is necessary, if the pre-war statute is not to come back into operation, is that it should have passed all stages before 31st December.  The effect of not having it passed by 31st December would be to bring back into operation the statutes relating to gas prices which were suspended by Orders under the Supplies and Services Act.  That would not prevent any gas company from selling gas, but, in respect of those companies which were subject to regulation on that sliding scale principle, it would force them to bring about such a reduction in the price of gas that it is unlikely that they would be willing to sell it, unless they were given relief in that respect.</P>

Prices have run on to the top of the scale fixed by any of these Acts and, even on the basis of paying no dividends, a substantial reduction in <Col N="1151" /> price would still be in force.  I do not think it would be desirable to try to reintroduce control of gas prices on that principle again, even by amending the statute so as to relate the price to present day values.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to make it clear that I am not proposing to exercise any control over the price of gas, unless in the circumstances I mentioned, of some situation arising which would cause a scarcity or an advisory committee, having conducted an investigation, reporting that unduly high prices are being charged for a reason within the control of those operating the undertaking.  If, therefore, control is reintroduced in any particular case, it will be either a temporary control to deal with a temporary situation or a penal measure designed to force rectification of the circumstances which cause prices to be unduly high.</P>
      <P>Another consideration in that regard is that these Acts were passed when gas was practically the only means of lighting, heating and cooking available to urban dwellers and that monopoly situation of the gas undertakings has now been undermined very considerably. They are now engaged in vigorous competition with electricity and oil and consequently there is now, I think, no real danger of their position being exploited unjustifiably in the sense that people would be forced to pay an unnecessarily high price for gas, with no alternative to the use of gas.</P>
      <P>In any case, having regard to the number of companies to which this Bill will apply, that is not likely to be their problem.  The problem is that they are incurring increased costs because of increased prices for coal and increased operating expenditures and are finding it difficult to recover those increased costs in their charges by reason of the competition they are encountering.  I do not think, therefore, there is any real danger of a position of de-control being exploited, but, if that danger does arise, then the procedure of the investigation and statutory Order will be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> I think, therefore, it is far better to work upon the principle of a simple maximum prices Order rather than bring back into operation, in amended form, a system of legislation which was certainly complicated and which envisaged control as a permanent arrangement.  I do not envisage it as a permanent arrangement at all.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>

    <Title>Tourist Traffic Bill, 1957&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with what is probably correctly described as the most important aspect of the tourist industry, namely, accommodation for tourists.  It provides for the renewal of the powers of the Miniister for Industry and Commerce to guarantee loans for the expansion and improvement of hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation and for the development of tourist resorts.  That power, which was given by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, expired early this year.  It is necessary to renew it if it is to be exercisable in the future.</P>
      <P>Our investigations of the possibilities of expanding the country's tourist trade indicate that hotel accommodation continues to be the main limiting factor and that it is necessary to induce substantial private investment in the hotel business if this country is to be put in a position to cater for the growing volume of tourist traffic which is anticipated over the next few years. The tourist traffic of the world has undergone a very big increase since the end of the war and it is still growing very rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimates which have been made by the international bodies that study these matters and publish the results of their studies are that the tourist trade of Europe will grow at the rate of 10 per cent. per year and, in the case of tourist traffic from <Col N="1153" /> across the Atlantic, these experts predict that the technical improvements in the means of travel, particularly the advent of faster and larger airliners, will provoke a substantial increase in the number of American visitors within the next few years.  It is anticipated that that increase will be noticeable next year, particularly because of the coming into operation, as from early in the year, of new lower tourist fares on all the airlines operating on the Atlantic route.  It is most important, in relation to the economic problems of the country, that we should get our share of these expected increases in the total tourist traffic, but we cannot hope to do that unless we organise our facilities to cope with the anticipated expansion.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady increase in hotel accommodation in this country within the past few years.  I am afraid I have to say, however, that the rate of increase was not nearly sufficient to meet our requirements.  The problem is one which calls for energetic action, as well as for courage and enterprise, on the part of private interests concerned with hotel developments.  So far as the Government are concerned, there is full appreciation of the urgency of the need for energetic action.  We are aiming to do all that can reasonably be expected of a Government to facilitate hotel proprietors and other interests in their efforts to expand and improve hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation.</P>
    <P>The guaranteeing of loans raised for the purpose of improvements and extensions is the most effective and the most practical method open to the Government to facilitate private investment. Accordingly, under this Bill, it is proposed to extend that power of guaranteeing loans for a further period of five years.  That alone is, I think, not sufficient.  The Hotel Loans (Guarantee) Scheme introduced in 1952 has not resulted in the expansion which I then anticipated and indicated to the Houses of the Oireachtas as likely.  The scheme, for many reasons, has been less productive of results than I had hoped for.  Nevertheless, loans totalling £250,000 have been guaranteed.  We contemplated a <Col N="1154" /> much higher target in 1952, but even that expenditure on hotel expansion and improvement represents some progress.</P>
    <P>I do not think progress at that rate will help to solve the problem of inadequate hotel facilities within reasonable time.  We must now try to get a considerable acceleration of the rate of hotel construction, if we are not to miss the opportunities which are likely to present themselves during the next four or five years.  We have given consideration to that problem and, in so far as it is one that calls for legislation, this Bill achieves that result, but I think that as much more can be done by administrative action without any change in the law.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this Bill to increase from three years to five years the period during which An Bord Fáilte can make grants to hotel proprietors to cover the interest payable on guaranteed loans. That, I think, will induce greater resort to them.  The feeling that the loans raised in that way for the extension of hotel accommodation will not involve any burden of interest for the first five years of the loan must have some effect.</P>
    <P>The second step&mdash;which is, I think, equally important&mdash;is to enable An Bord Fáilte to guarantee loans raised for that purpose&mdash;the extension or improvement of hotel accommodation otherwise than under ministerial guarantee. Again, the period for which such grants can be given in respect of interest is five years.  It is known, I think, that the procedure necessarily involved in the consideration of applications for State guarantees for loans, and in deciding and implementing decisions on such applications, is fairly lengthy.  That protraction of procedure has operated, I think, to discourage resort to the scheme.  When An Bord Fáilte has the power to guartee loans raised otherwise, that delay can be avoided, if the loans can be raised otherwise&mdash;and in many cases hoteliers can get that accommodation from their bankers or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the past, if they sought to get accommodation outside the guaranteed loans scheme, they could not get the benefit of the interest grants.  Now they can get that benefit, no matter <Col N="1155" /> how they raise the money, provided the money is raised for a purpose which is approved by An Bord Fáilte.  I am arranging to have a review made of the administrative procedure, to see whether it is possible&mdash;I believe it should be possible&mdash;to speed up the consideration of applications and reduce the formalities which have to be complied with, even where the decision is favourable.</P>
    <P>Other incentives, numerous and varied, have been offered to hotel proprietors to exert themselves to derive the maximum advantage from the present situation.  In addition to these provisions for State guaranteed loans and grants in respect of interest on loans, improvements to hotel premises qualify for a remission of two-thirds of the local rates attributable to the improvement, and there is also now the concession that 10 per cent. of the capital expended in any year on the extension and improvement of hotel accommodation is allowable as a deduction in computing profits for income-tax and corporation profits tax. Hoteliers, of course, derive benefit from the sums given by way of Grant-in-Aid to An Bord Fáilte, which can amount to £500,000 a year.  These moneys are available for the publicising of holiday resorts and other tourist development activities.</P>
    <P>I should say again that all the concessions and advantages which are at present available should be regarded as temporary in character.  It is necessary to say that there can be no guarantee that they can be continued indefinitely.  Therefore, it is in their own interest that hotel proprietors and others concerned with aspects of the tourist trade should take advantage of the opportunities while they are there and put in hand as quickly as possible their plans for the construction, improvement and extension of their premises.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of this Bill, though perhaps less important than those to which I have referred, are nevertheless of interest.  Section 5 provides for the registration of motor hotels by An Bord Fáilte.  These institutions, which are now developing <Col N="1156" /> in most countries, are called by a variety of names&mdash;motels, motor courts, and so forth.  It is a form of accommodation which was developed first in the United States but has become increasingly popular on this side of the Atlantic.  There are many indications that a growing part of our tourist traffic will take the form of motorists travelling around the country by car or availing of car hire or bus services, for whom that type of accommodation is particularly suitable. It is possible, therefore, that that type of accommodation will tend to develop here; and that being so, it is desirable that An Bord Fáilte should have the same rights of registration, the same control over the use of those names and the same powers of inspection in regard to it, as they have at present in regard to hotels. By bringing this type of premises within the scope of this Bill, they also qualify for the State guaranteed loans scheme and for the interest grants.</P>
    <P>The experience of An Bord Fáilte has been that quite a number of visitors come to this country and stay with private families or in boardinghouses, in premises of a kind which is not required under the existing law to be registered with An Bord Fáilte. They have been frequently asked by visitors for information concerning accommodation of that kind that may be available.  The board desire to publish a list of persons willing to take visitors on that basis, giving particulars of the accommodation available, whether that accommodation is accompanied by full or partial board. It is proposed to empower the board to collect that information and publish it.  There will be, of course, some preliminary examination by the board of the suitability of the premises for listing by them.  Of course, no premises will be included in their list except on the application of or with the consent of the proprietor of the premises.  It is thought that that facility, available for the type of visitor requiring that kind of accommodation, will help to give satisfaction to them and perhaps increase their numbers.</P>
    <P>There are some minor amendments being made in the law relating to <Col N="1157" /> registration of hotels and guest-houses. They are dealt with in Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Bill.  None of them is by itself important.  All of them arise out of the board's experience of the operation of the original Act.  Perhaps I should make it clear that the enactment of this measure does not involve any increased expenditure by the Government. An Bord Fáilte is financed by way of Grant-in-Aid and it is within the limits of the Grant-in-Aid that they will carry out any additional responsibility or functions they are given in this measure.</P>
    <P>I have frequently expressed my view that a very substantial increase in the present level of tourist income can be secured by exploiting the potentialities of this country as a holiday centre.  Senators are no doubt aware of the fact that we have been advised by external experts who investigated the position, that we can quite confidently hope to double our present tourist income, provided we tackle the enterprise with the necessary skill and enthusiasm.  An increase in tourist income would, of course, react very favourably upon our whole economic position and would benefit many sections of the community other than those who are directly engaged in any branch of the tourist industry, or even those who are interested in the supply of goods and services to tourists.  The enactment of this Bill will facilitate progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should explain that I have a number of proposals and suggestions relating to the development of the tourist industry under consideration. I would have preferred to have come here with a more comprehensive measure giving effect to such of those proposals and suggestions as I think would be worth while.  I was, however, anxious to proceed with this Bill without delay, by reason of the fact that the power to guarantee loans has expired.</P>
    <P>While I do not think that up to the present An Bord Fáilte has been impeded in its consideration of applications because of the public assurance I gave that a Bill to continue that <Col N="1158" /> power would be presented to the Oireachtas, nevertheless the Bill should not be delayed further.  Problems would arise if the completion of the enactment of the Bill were to extend into the next financial year.  That, I think, would almost be certain if I were to attempt to delay it in order to incorporate some of the proposals to which I referred.</P>
    <P>It is therefore to be considered as very likely that other proposals embodied in, and taking the form of, legislation will come before the Oireachtas probably before the next financial year.  I should perhaps make it clear that they will not alter in any way the provisions contained in this Bill relating to guaranteed loans and similar matters so that nobody need hesitate to avail of these provisions now in anticipation that more generous proposals will come later.  The proposals we have under consideration deal with other matters and, while they are important, they will not necessarily have the same impact on problems of extending hotel accommodation and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I very much welcome this Bill.  It is, I think, tangible evidence of the State's encouragement of the hotel and tourist industry.  We all know that tourism is probably one of our most hopeful industries to which we may look in the future for the bringing in of much needed money, to give us additional invisible imports.  It is the industry which, after agriculture, is most capable of expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we are facing a position in which tourism is the most expanding industry in every country.  One has only to travel to countries like France and Italy to see the swarms of tourists of all kinds, from the wealthy tourist who was most in evidence in days gone by to the ordinary man in the street who now travels as well as the wealthier man.  It is very important that we in this country should equip ourselves to handle this expanding <Col N="1159" /> industry.  We must endeavour to do it in a business-like and scientific way.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I should like to say at the beginning that Bord Fáilte has been a great success.  My own experience of Bord Fáilte, in the many contacts I have had with it, both as a businessman and as a member of various committees, is that in that body we have something which is of immense help to this industry.  Therefore, I am glad that in this Bill the board are being given extended powers to help them to extend the industry in every way.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the Bill in the Dáil&mdash;I do not remember whether he said it here or not&mdash;he referred to a bottleneck, the bottleneck being that we have not enough accommodation here for the number of tourists we would like to put up.  From that, he went on to say he was disappointed, as we all are, with the response which was forthcoming to the offers of help.  Of the £5,000,000 offered, only £250,000 has apparently been utilised.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there are these bottlenecks.  However, I think there is something which may be responsible for the first bottleneck, that is, that while I do not think hotel traders in this country are bad businessmen or unenterprising, they are up against a certain difficulty.  If one is to utilise money and put it into expanding hotels and restaurants, or into building new hotels and restaurants for customers, one must have a reasonable expectancy that those customers will arrive in sufficient numbers to render the expenditure productive.  I think one of the bottlenecks responsible for this feeling among hoteliers and people who are expected to spend money in connection with the tourist trade is the means of travel in and out of the country, by air and by sea, and the fact that the facilities here compare badly with other countries.  We know, for instance, that Aer Lingus has been a great success, but even working at full capacity, it is not able to carry anything like the number of people who wish to travel in or out of the country.  That applies nearly all <Col N="1160" /> the year round and not only at the height of the season.</P>
    <P>The boats which ply between here and England are also a problem.  Frequently it is difficult to get comfortable accommodation on these boats when coming to Ireland and it is almost impossible to get back, when one wants to get back.  There is a definite bottleneck in this matter and it is one of the problems we must face if we want to expand our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>A possible solution is to extend the season to times of the year when these means of travel are not overcrowded. An Bord Fáilte has given attention to that aspect of the problem by encouraging people to come to festivals and to hold conventions here at off-season times.  In that way our travel facilities are being used to greater advantage and with greater spread-over throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The quality of the transport available to and from the country does not really stand up, even reasonably well, in comparison with transport facilities available for the Continent both as regards price and comfort.  I think something should be done about that. The comparison between getting a motor-car from England to Ireland and from England to the Continent is very unfavourable to us.  This is so in regard to price&mdash;we know it is a longer sea journey but even allowing for that I gather the fares are very much out of proportion.  It is also true in regard to the methods of handling motor-cars coming in and going out of the country. This is a very important factor nowadays when nearly everybody has a car. The methods employed in the case of this country are very much out of date. There is far too much delay in getting a car off the boat and anybody who has experience of sending a car backwards and forwards between Ireland and England finds, I would say in almost 50 per cent. of the cases, some damage is done to the car, to the wings or to the bumpers or some other part of it indicating that the cars are being manhandled.</P>
    <P>This is a very common complaint and if we are to have the tourist trade that we should have, it is time we got some sort of boat such as is used between Dover and Calais where the <Col N="1161" /> cars are run straight up a ramp on to the boat.  In fact you drive your own car on and off practically without anyone else touching the car from one side to the other.  These are matters that must be taken into consideration if we are to invite tourists here.</P>
    <P>There is another type of tourist, the ordinary man-in-the-street, who has not got a motor-car but who likes to travel.  I am glad that in future we shall allow buses in here carrying people who have not got private cars or who do not want to take their own cars over here.  Henceforth, they will be able to come in here in buses.  They will be taken from their own doors, brought over here, taken round the country and brought back home again. Many people like to do that because it is a comfortable form of travel, mentally and physically.  There is very little worry attached to it.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has travelled on the Continent has had experience of the immense bus traffic through France and Italy.  There are swarms of buses carrying tourists from Germany to France, from France into Germany, from Sweden into Finland.  I have seen as many as 20 buses lined up alongside the Finnish boat in Stockholm this year waiting to take tourists through the country.  That is the kind of traffic to which I referred earlier, vitally necessary to our hoteliers because its very volume makes them feel that it is worth while improving their hotels and providing proper amenities.  After all, unless the flow is there it is not an economic proposition to spend money.</P>
    <P>On the question of bringing in people in sufficient numbers, I should like to refer to one matter, though, if it is taken in the wrong way, it may not be a very popular matter.  I refer to the bringing in of air traffic through Shannon.  We all know that a great deal of money has been put into Shannon.  It is a splendid airport and one of which we are all very proud. On the other hand, we have a very fine airport in Dublin, one of the finest in the world.  It is fog free; it has ample landing space; there are very few houses around it; and it is a very safe and up-to-date port.  Steps should be <Col N="1162" /> taken to permit a reasonable number of planes to fly non-stop to Dublin from America.  Some of the travel agents in the airlines have told me that a far greater number of people would come here, if they were allowed to fly direct to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Shannon will probably always be necessary and used for a large volume of air traffic coming into Ireland and going on to the Continent; but many people would come to Dublin if they could fly direct to Dublin.  It is not enough to bring tourists in here.  We want to get money from them and they will not spend money around Shannon. One may get a few hundred pounds out of them, but that is not what we want. Air traffic should be encouraged to fly straight into Dublin.  It is a shortsighted policy to force your customer into a shop into which he does not really want to go.  Those who want to come to Shannon should be encouraged to use Shannon; those who want to come to Dublin should be allowed to come to Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a double motive involved. It has been forecast that there will be a loss of something like £100,000 on Dublin Airport this year.  If that be true, it seems a rather shortsighted policy to prevent traffic coming in there, traffic which would make it a paying proposition.  Not only would the airport be rendered solvent but an enormous volume of money would come into Dublin through the tourists.  I make no secret of the fact that in my own business this year, if it were not for the American tourist trade, my business would have been considerably down on last year.  We have held our figures this year because of the dollars we took.</P>
    <P>An interesting point is that the tourists this year were not of the Irish-American type.  We had tourists this year, many of whom had no connection with this country whatsover.  They came here solely because they thought it was a good place to which to come. They said we gave them very good value in all sorts of ways.  I was rather surprised to discover they liked our climate.  When we apologised for the rain, an American tourist told me not to mind about that; they were <Col N="1163" /> coming here to get away from the sun. They liked the shops.  They liked the people and they found Dublin an attractive place in which to holiday.</P>
    <P>If we could bring more people to Dublin, we would bring more money to Ireland.  Oddly enough, there seems to be an anti-Dublin complex amongst some elements at any rate. Some would almost prefer that we had no tourists at all rather than that they should visit Dublin and spend their money there.  That is wrong.  No matter where we get the money, it is important that we should get it.</P>
    <P>We should not bring tourists here merely to show them our beautiful scenery.  The real object is to get them to spend money.  It is all very nice to bring them to see Glendalough and let them go home with a good impression but, while they may go home with a good impression, we want to see a good impression of their money in our banks and in our businesses.  I shall give an illustration of what I mean.  We have had several liners calling here in recent years.  One luxury liner calls every year.  Large numbers of tourists are brought in under one auspice or another.  Very often, our travel authorities think they are doing a wonderful thing by putting these tourists into buses and whisking them off on the only free day they have down to Glendalough where they spend 2/4 on postcards of St. Kevin's Bed, or whatever it happens to be, and they are given very little chance of spending money where it might do more good.  Now, the French will always bring you to a place where you can spend money in every possible direction.  They will bring you in buses to Versailles and, if you want to go somewhere else, the buses will not take you there; you will have to engage a taxi and the taxi will cost you 2,000 francs.  Incidentally, you get the very worst rate of exchange when you are changing your English money into French francs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as suggesting that we should exploit tourists.  We must not exploit our tourists, but we must get as much as we can out of them and, in return, we <Col N="1164" /> must give them the best value we can for their money.  That aspect should be carefully studied.  It may surprise people to know that tourists find Dublin a very attractive city.  They find our shops attractive, with a far wider range of better goods at lower prices than elsewhere.  There are many commodities here which are astonishingly cheap as compared with the Continent.</P>
    <P>Some may think that I am over-emphasising Dublin.  When I speak of Dublin, I am really speaking of the other cities and towns also to which tourists normally come, where goods are attractive and cheap and can compare with practically any part of the world.  I have had proof of that in my own business because of the number of Americans and British who are now regular postal customers of ours.  I know that applies, too, in other businesses, especially those businesses which cater for tourists and specialise in that particular trade. Tourism is something which has to be dealt with in a special way.  Goods must be bought specially for the tourist trade and they must be presented and publicised so as to attract tourists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like it to be said that I was advertising Dublin only.  My remarks apply equally to Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and all our other cities and towns. There have been complaints that our hotels have not availed of the money provided under this Bill, but I should like to pay tribute to some of the hotels which have been set up here in recent years and to the improvements that have been made in others.  The same applies to Cork.  Cork has a number of hotels which are second to none.  That has all happened in the past few years and is greatly due to the activities of Bord Fáilte and Bills such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to speak on anything in connection with the tourist industry without mentioning something that we very often forget to mention. <Col N="1165" /> I refer to our museums and other institutions of different kinds, such as our National Gallery, which is known all over the world as a first-class gallery.  It has a small but first-class collection.  We also have the Municipal Gallery.  The only tragedy about these places&mdash;I have in mind also the museums in Waterford, Limerick and Cork&mdash;is that we do not refer to them often enough.  In every country in the world, one of the main attractions offered to tourists is the visit to the local museum, and so on.  Very often, our tourists are not even informed that such places exist in Dublin, although we have institutions that can take their place with those in every city in the world.</P>
    <P>On the question of hotels, if we are to bring people here, there is plenty of room for improvement in the country and city hotels.  One of the curses of our country is that the emphasis in our hotels is on the bar. We have first-rate bars and lounges, but you will find that the rest of the house is on a declining scale, ending up with the lavatory which is very often, I am sorry to say, the worst feature of the house.  It is a very bad reflection on any country that its toilet amenities are not good and I suggest that there is great room for improvement in that branch of our hotel business.</P>
    <P>Further in relation to our hotels, although again we have the best food in the world in the form of meat, potatoes and vegetables of all kinds, very little care or taste is shown in the presentation of that food.  I was astonished to go down to a country hotel in a well-known tourist area last year and to find that, in the middle of the vegetable season, we were offered tinned peas which were the only vegetable on the menu.  I had some English people with me and we were looking forward to the very nice fresh peas we were going to have.  Incidentally, one Friday, I was in another well-known hotel&mdash;I will not mention what part of Ireland it was but it was not Dublin &mdash;I was with some English people again and they said: &ldquo;Now we are at a seaside place.  I am sure we can get lovely fish.&rdquo;  They asked me would I find out from the hotel manager what <Col N="1166" /> fish was being served that night.  We were visualising lobster, and so on. When I went down, the hall porter said: &ldquo;There is plaice.&rdquo;  That is all there was.  They may seem little things but they are big things.  We all know when people are on holidays one of the best things in the day is the meal. They look forward to going into a lunch or dinner to find out what is on the menu.  If they find that it is plaice or tinned peas, that is a bad mark for us.  It takes very little energy or imagination to improve that situation.</P>
    <P>Another fact is that we do not sufficiently advertise our sporting events to our visitors.  If there is one thing we have in this country, it is a great variety of sporting fixtures in every part of Ireland every Saturday and practically every other day as well.  We need not mention racing because it is known, but in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and many other places there are thousands of sporting events every Saturday afternoon, and I think I am right in saying that if you go into any Dublin hotel or any hotel in the country, you will not see a reference to a single sporting event on any of the boards for the benefit of tourists.  That is something which could be very much exploited.  The one thing which people complain about when they come to Ireland is having nothing to do.  There is plenty to do if we would only bring it to the people's notice.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the matter of souvenirs.  Souvenirs have improved greatly in recent years.  Instead of looking upon souvenirs as being a little present from Tramore, made in Japan, or even made in Ireland&mdash;a babóg&mdash;we have come to realise that there is big money in other goods.  We are now purchasing boxes full of expensive linen, sheets, and so on, and presenting them in a souvenir manner. There is practically nothing we make in this country that could not be presented as a souvenir.  Instead of thinking of souvenirs in terms of little &ldquo;diddley&rdquo; things, we have come to realise the real potentialities of this business.  Some of our Irish manufacturers are already packaging their goods with a view to attracting tourists. If that becomes more widespread, not only will we sell goods to the tourist <Col N="1167" /> trade, but we will be able to build up further export trade from follow-up orders not only from people who have been visiting here but from the people to whom they show these goods at home.</P>
    <P>I feel the State is doing its best in regard to tourism and it is up to the people in the tourist business, both private enterprise and the local authorities, to take full advantage of this Bill to improve the amenities offered to tourists and to avail of the opportunities thus created of earning money from these tourists.</P>

      <P>The field covered by this Bill is strictly limited and I shall endeavour to confine myself, as far as possible, to it much as I should like to wander over the whole field of tourist development policy because I am very interested in it.  I welcome this Bill.  I am very glad that the Minister did not wait to include in it all the other ideas, to which he referred during his address here to-day, because there are enough provisions in this Bill to get the hoteliers, the people generally concerned, interested and to waken them up to a realisation of the valuable aid which the State is giving to make the tourist industry the best money making industry in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there are a big number of applications for these grants awaiting decision and, therefore, I regard the Bill as one of some urgency. The guaranteed loan scheme, to which the Minister referred, is certainly one of the best features in the Bill and the extension of the period is very welcome.  However, I think the most satisfactory part of his speech was his expressed intention to review the administrative procedure, to see whether decisions on these applications could not be speeded up and red tape eliminated.  I am afraid the failure of hoteliers to take advantage, to a greater extent than they did, of the money available may, in one way, have been due to the feeling that got abroad that it was a tremendous job to break through the administrative barrier before one could get to the actual cash. <Col N="1168" /> When the Minister is reviewing the administrative procedure, the aim should be to make it as simple for a solvent business man to get one of these loans, as it used to be for a solvent business man, at one time, to walk into a bank and get an overdraft.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire referred to the bottlenecks.  One of the greatest bottlenecks is the short duration of our tourist season.  It is really only a ten weeks' season at present&mdash;July and August the peak period with the last week in June and the first week in September tailing on at both ends.  A tribute is due to Bord Fáilte, and to its promotions branch in particular, for their efforts to bring international conferences here during the off-season. Senators who have received their <i>News Letter</i> and read it will have been as pleased as I was to note that of the ten international conferences announced so far for 1958, nine are scheduled for April, June and September, which might be described as the off-season period.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is doing a good job but it can do better.  It should devote particular attention to the encourment of spring and late summer holidays. In this connection it has always struck me that a system which obtains in many parts of England is worthy of investigation by Bord Fáilte.  We can undoubtedly profit from the experience of our nearest neighbours in that regard.  In England a large trade has been built up by various seaside resorts, many of them in the South of England, which have special holidays covering April, May, June, September and up to October.  They cater particularly for one class of people, those on fixed incomes, whose purses are limited, but who can go on holidays at any time and who can make a big difference between the high season trade of July and August, when many civil servants and business executives have to take their holidays.  That is the difference between this type of trade which English seaside resorts have capitalised and the type I am referring to now.</P>
    <P>The English people are friendly. They are anxious to come to a country like this here where they can get <Col N="1169" /> good food, good accommodation at reasonable rates and where they can see happy, smiling people.  I have no doubt that, with an effort, we can get a good slice of this trade, provided the board can arrange for a greater cut in hotel charges, transport and entertainments. This is not as revolutionary a proposal as it sounds.  I should like to illustrate this point by a scheme which came to my attention which is operating in the South of England, from May 2nd to June 13th, and from September 13th to October 4th.</P>
    <P>It is operated by an hotel, guest house and caterers' association of a southern municipality.  There is a fixed charge in all establishments participating in the scheme.  It is not confined to guest-houses.  Many hotels are listed in this scheme.  The starting rate for accommodation during the first fortnight is £3 15s. per week. That is a considerable cut.  It is £4 a week in the second part and £4 to £5 in the first week of June.  From September the 13th to September the 20th the fixed charge is £4 5s. per week and for the last fortnight in September, and up to October, £3 15s. per week.  This charge includes accommodation, with three meals comprising breakfast, midday dinner and high tea.  It is a co-operative effort in this municipality and it has paid good dividends in the off-season.</P>
    <P>The town council has co-operated to a great extent, putting on special entertainments for these people, giving reduced rates for deck chairs for concerts and arranging tours with local bus companies.  They have gone out of their way to make things pleasant for this class of people, to make them feel welcome with their limited amount of money.  Since they have a limited amount of money, this town wants to get as much of it as it can.  The proof of its success is that the numbers visiting this resort in spring and autumn have steadily increased each year since the inception of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we can get a good slice of this trade though I fear the low rates I have quoted may be received with disdain by some people who think a successful business cannot be operated on a small margin of <Col N="1170" /> profit.  This municipality and this hotel, guest house, and caterers' association have demonstrated for a number of years that it can be done. All the income which this town gets from this scheme is definitely additional income and it would make a substantial contribution to our tourist revenue if we could attract some of it here during the period I have mentioned. Hoteliers, guest house owners, cinemas and C.I.E. would get an extra profit, no matter how small, and the country would benefit by the free publicity which these people would give to it when they go home.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire also referred to another bottleneck which, I think, is one of the outstanding causes of our failure to extend the tourist season in May and June.  There is no doubt whatever that anybody who knows the Midlands of England, and who has contact with the workers there, knows that the lack of a day boat on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route has been the gravest handicap to the extension of the tourist trade from that area in May and June.  While I am very enthusiastic about getting all the Americans we can get, and while I believe there is a big potential to be developed in the United States, and probably on the Continent as well, we must remember that there is a market at our doors not tapped to the extent it should and could be.</P>
    <P>We must remember also that 70 out of every 100 people coming to this part of Ireland come by boat.  They do not all travel by air.  The dreadful ordeal of having to get into that boat in Holy-head in May and June, after travelling eight hours from Euston, maybe five hours from Manchester or six hours from Sheffield, has been instrumental in keeping quite a number of the people about whom I spoke&mdash;older people who could take their holidays at any time&mdash;away from here during the off-season.</P>
    <P>Another thing I have heard in talks with the proprietors of hotels is that every year they get a considerable number of bookings for June, and when the prospective visitors, particularly from the Midlands of England, learn that the day sailing does not begin until July, they usually ask for a later date. <Col N="1171" /> They cannot be accommodated, so the booking is lost and another room becomes available in June.</P>
    <P>There is another class of people who could also be catered for under this idea of extending holidays in June. Those are the people who want to avoid the peak rush during July and August.  We are certainly losing quite an amount of that traffic by the absence of the daylight sailing of which I spoke.  There are daylight sailings, two sailings a day, from Liverpool to Landudno, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay and Bangor beginning on Easter Sunday every year.  It beats me why the British Railways people insist that they cannot put a day boat on here from the 1st May and that it would not pay.  There are also daylight sailings from Liverpool and Heysham to the Isle of Man beginning in Easter and winding up in October.</P>
    <P>Before any real extension of the tourist season into May, June and July is achieved on a permanent basis, this transport question will have to be tackled.  The reason I am so insistent on concentrating to a great extent on the English market is that, from a study of the statistics of visitors here and from speaking to a large number of them during the summer season, I estimate that the average English visitor spends from £20 to £25 during his holiday period here, and that is in cash, independent of travel and accommodation. I am quite satisfied that people would much prefer to come here than to go to the Continent where all types of difficulties have arisen for them, as anybody who reads the complaints in English Sunday newspapers will see.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious bottleneck, to which the Minister and Senator McGuire referred, and that is the inadequacy of hotel accommodation. Although great strides have been made in the last five or six years, particularly since the end of the war, we have not got the number of bedrooms which would enable us to become a real tourist playground on the same lines as Switzerland, Norway and Belgium.</P>
    <P>There is one serious matter to which <Col N="1172" /> Bord Fáilte should devote attention. It is the question of single accommodation. The demand for single accommodation in this country, and in England, too, incidentally, is far in excess of the rooms available.  While a hotelier will give a double room during the early and late season, he has to refuse in the high season.  Thus, for about ten weeks, this big tourist potential has to go elsewhere, and by elsewhere I mean some other country.</P>
    <P>If the hotelier builds single accommodation, he is faced with the cost of furnishing, which is the same as for a double room, and he gets only half the income.  Worse than that, he gets a rating increase from his local council which takes no account of the short period during which the single room will be in use.  I am convinced that if we are to get a grip on the young men and women who want single rooms and on the older people who want to be accommodated here, something must be done to remedy this position and to encourage hoteliers to add single room accommodation to their premises.</P>
    <P>I do not know what inducements could be given.  Perhaps under some later Bill the Minister may be able to provide for it.  I would certainly suggest that the possibility of a special rate on extensions of hotels devoted solely to single accommodation should be considered to see whether it is possible to induce hoteliers to fill that void which exists at present and which, as I say, is depriving us of this tremendous potential of single people in June, July and August.  I feel that this 50 per cent. rate cut, for instance, if it could be arranged with local authorities, for buildings devoted solely to single accommodation would help the local authorities in this way. Although they would only get half a loaf instead of none, still the hotelier would get an inducement to provide for an assured trade of young people who want to come here and who will get an opportunity of paying us a visit which is denied to them now.</P>
    <P>One hotelier to whom I spoke told me, for example, that all his single accommodation for the season was <Col N="1173" /> booked up in February and that a large number of applications from that on had to be turned down.  He told me that this involves the loss of a double and single room in many cases because many applications were from a couple with an adult son or daughter.</P>
    <P>I think I have gone pretty wide in referring to these matters but, before I conclude, I should like to mention Section 9.  This provides that Bord Fáilte will now produce a list of guest houses which are not registered and are not in the official list of guest houses in the book issued by the board each year.  I am very seriously perturbed about this proposal because the Bord Fáilte booklet has gone all over the world.  Because of its veracity and because of the intensive examination and effort made by the board to ensure that premises are up to standard, it is now accepted, particularly by English visitors, as a sort of bible. If there is to be another and separate list issued by the same board, containing guest houses which are not up to the standard of those contained in the book, I am afraid that, no matter what precautions are taken by Bord Fáilte or the Minister, there will be confusion and there will be doubts cast on the <i>bona fides</i> of the real book.</P>
    <P>I think Bord Fáilte would be well advised not to go into this but to adopt the procedure adopted in many cross-Channel and continental resorts where a municipal council gets out a list of approved guest houses and lodging houses which they have examined. This list may be obtained from the municipal council of the town concerned, not from the official tourist board, as far as I can make out.  If that were done, it would ensure that people who write to Bord Fáilte for their annual book containing the names of accredited and registered hotels would have no more doubts in the future than they had in the past. I hope that serious consideration will be given to that before the board finally decides to adopt it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to join in welcoming this Bill.  I note with <Col N="1174" /> particular interest the statement by the Minister that he is considering further proposals and that this may give rise to future legislation.  I should hope that, perhaps, the Seanad might in some way or other be able to set up a Select Committee to help on this.  We would be far more helpful to the Minister as a Select Committee. Those of us who are new to the Seanad feel we would like to make some positive contribution.  We have heard of the great work done by house committees, both in England and in America, and perhaps we here in the Seanad could do something like that. It does seem that a general review of the tourist position is called for and I think there is sufficient ability in this House to make a positive contribution on that aspect.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Bill itself, I note that the amount of interest provided is £75,000.  That, according to my calculation, means a capital expenditure of, at most, £1,500,000.  That seems remarkably little, considering the prize at which we are aiming.  Tourism is to-day our second industry and the income from it was estimated last year, I think, at £30,000,000.  We are all in agreement with the Minister when he says that could easily be doubled, if we made a determined effort.  If we are shooting for a prize of £30,000,000 a year, an investment of £1,500,000 is very little.  Also, the number of loans guaranteed by the Government over the past five years amounted to only £250,000.  That seems a pitiable sum.  In other words, it does seem that if this is a big money business, we will have to expend big money to get big money.</P>
      <P>Then, of course, tourism, being our second industry, we have got to be unique.  We have got to do something that our competitors cannot do.  It is not sufficient just to copy what they do in other parts.  Right here, I think we can wed our major industry, agriculture, to our second industry, tourism, and let them both help each other along.  We have got to be unique.  We have got to do something imaginative in both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that at present we are having difficulty marketing some of <Col N="1175" /> our agricultural produce, but we will have far more surpluses, we hope, in agriculture in the future and, therefore, our marketing difficulties will be so much greater.  Why not then run some type of sweepstake on our Irish produce sold abroad, the prizes to be free holidays in Ireland?  These could very largely be directed, as Senator Mullins suggested, into the off season periods.  Every lb. of produce sold abroad, a pound of bacon or whatever we sell, could very well carry a number. You could have regional draws both in England and elsewhere and let the prizes be holidays in Ireland, and not holidays for one.  We should strive for family tourist parties and let the holidays embrace the whole family. We could spend big money on that and it would serve to popularise our agricultural produce and help considerably to expand our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>In relation to our tourist industry, I believe we have got to be unique.  We have got to strike out and examine what are our characteristics here.  We find that, as a nation, we are a family people with a very strong Christian heritage of which we are proud.  Has any real effort been made, in our approach to tourism, to capitalise on those assets, to appeal to the family groups?  There are several types of tourism we would not welcome here, but we would do a service to ourselves and the world at large by concentrating largely upon family groups.</P>
    <P>We have another asset here as well. We are a rural people.  We have our farms.  We can examine the tourist picture in America where we see they put up mock farms&mdash;what they call &ldquo;dude ranches&rdquo;.  In those places, they have their tourist attractions for the tired city people.  They rank as major attractions in the United States to-day.  We have our farms here and we have a great increase in amenities, due to the spread of rural electrification, the provision of running water and other amenities.  The time is ripe for launching out on a full-scale development of family farm holidays, because, after all, a short season does not affect the farm.  In fact, May and September in many ways are the most <Col N="1176" /> delightful months on the farm.  There is nothing for the young child to compare with the magic of the animals he can find on the farm.  I have seen that illustrated in the case of relatives of ours who came for holidays at Easter from London.  It was almost impossible to get them to go back.  I am sure that they in turn will speak of that to their children and create the type of chain reaction we want to boost our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>In addition, the development of family farm holidays would, perhaps, go a long way towards solving another pressing problem we have on the farm at present, that is, providing something to do for the young girls at home. Modern agriculture is pushing the young women largely back into the homes.  The result is that, having little to do in the homes, they are leaving the land and, consequently, it is very difficult for young farmers to get wives.  I believe that type of thing could be developed, the industry that would be primarily the industry of the farmer's daughter, an industry which would encourage her to learn everything about housekeeping and which would give her that exactness and precision which would do much for the success of the farm afterwards.</P>
    <P>I do believe the time has come when, if we want to get into the tourist business, we have got to be imaginative. Remember always that if you aim at the ditch, you will always get the ditch, but if you aim at a star, you may go miles higher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small Bill but it is of major importance and should be so regarded by the House and the country.  There is a good deal that is psychological in trying to make this country a tourist resort.  The majority of people generally have doubts about it.  They have come down on neither one side not the other as yet.  The idea has to be sold to the people of Ireland as well as abroad.  Undoubtedly there is much in this country to commend itself to the taste of the tourist.  The Minister's proposals in this measure can vitally influence the position in regard to tourism in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> I want to say a word or two about the proposals in regard to loans for reconstruction or building in connection with the provision of accommodation for tourists.  I have not a great deal of experience of this matter.  I have just a little.  I would suggest that, to make a success of tourism, it is vitally important to interest young people in providing the accommodation required and every possible facility should be placed at their disposal, if young people are prepared to embark on the enterprise of selling a service to tourists.</P>
    <P>When applications are being examined, the character and the industry of the people who will embark on this enterprise should be investigated. That is a far greater security for the repayment of loans than the size of the building, the amount of the original capital spent, or anything like that.  We really want the young people to engage in this enterprise because they will bring fresh minds into the business and are not tied to old, orthodox practices.  Their minds are open and they would be prepared to embrace new ideas borrowed from abroad or developed out of practices at home.  I would strongly urge on the Minister that the character of the borrowers should be a major consideration. People who are prepared to cast their bread on the waters and to borrow, if they are able to get security through the Minister's administration, should get the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The people of the country can make a major contribution to the development of this industry.  In any country there is nothing more interesting than its people.  Foreigners say that the people of Ireland are more interesting and more attractive than the people of most other countries.  That is because our people are simple and natural and have no artificial airs or graces.  If they can be their intelligent selves, they are very attractive to the foreigner.</P>
    <P>In certain quarters and by certain individuals there is a desire to decry the country.  I think that is awful. We have our faults.  There are quite a number of things wrong with the country that we have been unable so <Col N="1178" /> far to set right but we should look at the rest of the world and ask ourselves how much better it is.  We shall find it is not half as good.  We ought to emphasise that point instead of grumbling and complaining.  One thing people should learn to do is to stop talking about the rain.  Whenever one meets an Irish man or woman and says anything about the weather, the answer is: &ldquo;I hope it will not rain.&rdquo; That is a complex than can be created for the foreigner who may come from a part of the world where rain is not so unacceptable.  That is a very important consideration.  I am sure Senator McGuire will agree with me.</P>
    <P>People who come to this country and who drive in buses or cars along our highways, which can compare very favourably with those anywhere else, should be able to see what is across the hedges.  I would urge of members of local authorities here and on the Minister to try to impress on local authorities the importance of letting the tourist see the field behind the hedge.  There is a conspiracy on the part of thousands of farmers in this country to ensure that nobody will see beyond the ditch along the road.  That is a great mistake.  It is only in this country that that happens. It certainly is not permitted in any country on the Continent where I have been.  Even from the point of view of the farmer, it would be a good thing to cut down the hedges and allow the wind and the sun in.  It would be enlightening also for foreigners if they could see more of our green countryside.  I am sure everybody will welcome the Minister's proposals and wish him success in his efforts.</P>

    <P>I have not very much to say in connection with this Bill, after all that has been said by the other speakers.  As Senator Baxter pointed out, it is not a large Bill but it is important from the point of view of continuing the policy of making money available to people engaged in our tourist industry&mdash;to hoteliers and such people to provide the necessary accommodation for visitors. The difficulty I see is that it is rather difficult for An Bord Fáilte to deal with individual hoteliers with a view to getting the necessary accommodation. It might be a good idea if An Bord Fáilte had some authoritative bodies such as a local committee with which to deal in connection with the provision of improved hotel facilities for visitors.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that community effort generally produces better results than individual effort.  I rather think that if An Bord Fáilte could have the people in the tourist centres organised through local committees it might be a good way of getting the business done. A civic pride would then be awakened in these places.  People would become more aware of their duties as regards the improvement of tourist centres from the point of view of hotel accommodation and amenities generally.</P>
    <P>As I am referring to An Bord Fáilte, <Col N="1180" /> I might say that I consider that that body should be highly commended for the way in which they have tackled the business so far.  Furthermore the manner in which they get out this type of brochure from time to time is indicative of their imagination and business acumen.  They have done it very well. If they got more co-operation from people engaged in the tourist industry I think better results would follow. They have given a very good slant to the publicity end of the tourist business.</P>
    <P>Many things have been said and many suggestions have been made here as to how our tourist industry can be improved.  I suppose there is room for improvement but, at the same time, we must remember that, in comparison with outside countries&mdash;countries on the Continent of Europe such as Switzerland&mdash;we have a lot of leeway to make up.  That is understandable because Switzerland and other countries were in a position to organise their tourist industry during the past couple of centuries when we had no such opportunity.  This State is comparatively young and it is only as the years go by that we shall learn from experience how to improve our tourist industry. It is capable of much improvement, but we cannot expect to do things too quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter suggested that we should present ourselves to outsiders as we are.  That is right.  We should show visitors that we have a language and a culture of our own.  That would be a very good policy and I should be very much in favour of it.</P>
    <P>When opening the debate, the Minister said that the most important aspect of tourism is hotel accommodation. There is no doubt about that. Not alone is hotel accommodation a very important aspect of this matter but there is also the question of the attention given to visitors.  A lot depends on that.  Every visitor is a publicity agent for this country.  Unless he or she gets proper treatment when he or she comes here then it is just too bad.  I realise that the position has greatly improved from bygone years.  An Bord Fáilte has done a very good job.  Let us hope that, with <Col N="1181" /> the co-operation of the people engaged in the tourist industry, they will be able to do an even better job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill before us is, one might say, financial.  It is to extend the period of interest-free loans to five years so that no interest is paid by a borrower for that period on a guaranteed loan through any insurance corporation, bank or direct from An Bord Fáilte itself.  That is an admirable and welcome extension of the financial facilities available under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>This debate has broadened out and included some other matters which are not strictly relevant to the Bill.  In particular, mention was made of the importance of extending the tourist season.  I want to refer to one particular aspect in that connection which could be encouraged by An Bord Fáilte and which, to a certain extent, is being encouraged.  I refer to improving the shooting and fishing facilities available to tourists.  In that respect, I should like to compliment the sporting section of An Bord Fáilte. They have been doing a very good job of work in recent years in co-operation with the Inland Fisheries Trust.  That section of An Bord Fáilte has done considerable work along the River Shannon and its tributaries in encouraging the coarse fishing business which has a tremendous potential.</P>
      <P>It was estimated that, last year, about 10,000 English working-class visitors came to this country and spent anything from £30 to £50 each in fishing for pike, perch and roach in the coarse-fishing areas of the Midlands. That works out, already, at an industry worth from £300,000 to £500,000.  That coarse-fishing development (1) extends the season at each end&mdash;it can operate from April to October&mdash;and (2) is not dependent on the weather.  Such visitors are not concerned about sunshine but about fish.  They are not a very fussy type.  I am inclined to think that Section 9 of the Bill has that type of industry in mind, when it mentions that the board may publish lists of unregistered premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would imagine that what is intended <Col N="1182" /> in that section is that a list of boarding houses and houses with modest but reasonably clean accommodation, could be furnished to the board by local development companies and local authorities and would be available by the board for any body of anglers in Britain who may have need of such accommodation, in small towns such as Ballinasloe, Athlone or Banagher, and they would be able to partake of the boarding house facilities during their stay.  That is a very admirable scheme of development, which the sporting section of an Bord Fáilte has concentrated on in recent years and which has proved very remunerative. That development, along with the development by the Inland Fisheries Trust, improving other lakes for trout and salmon fishing, is a very good one.  We could have luxury tourists for the salmon and trout fishing in the West of Ireland for a period of six months extending the tourist season beyond the months of July and August.</P>
    <P>In that connection, there is something undesirable in the fact that many of these big salmon rights in the West of Ireland, in Mayo and Galway, have recently been passing from one private millionaire's hands to another private millionaire's hands.  There is no statutory provision for the State to interfere and acquire such salmon rights, to develop them in the national interest. I think they could be developed considerably and restocked and improved, and facilities made available for the encouragement of the luxury type of American tourist, in particular, who is very keen on this type of salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>Another type of sport is shooting, which is even better, since it operates for the six non-season months, all through the winter months, roughly from August until the following March. At the moment in this country there is no body available, no statutory body which gives any assistance towards the preservation of game, the clearing of vermin or anything of that nature. Any work which is done is done entirely by voluntary gun clubs up and down the country, who receive no assistance whatever.  There are large areas of shooting rights in the hands <Col N="1183" /> of the Land Commission which are completely neglected, and no attempt has been made to develop them by advertising them as something which could be utilised by tourists here.</P>
    <P>Similarly, no attempt has been made to assist these gun clubs to improve and preserve ordinary private shooting rights.  As I have said, the Inland Fisheries Trust and An Bord Fáilte have set an admirable headline of co-operation in the development of trout and salmon fishing.  It is an ideal working arrangement in that the Inland Fisheries Trust operates as a subsidiary to local organisations. There is no such thing as that available in the case of shooting.</P>
    <P>I mention those two sports, shooting and fishing, and I divide fishing into luxury fishing and rough fishing, as a desirable type of development which would attract tourists from outside beyond the months of July and August. There is really scope in that direction and the type of tourist we would bring by virtue of such development would be the tourist who would not mind any shortcomings in our weather and who would not be a very fussy tourist.  He would be primarily concerned with his sport and if we had the sport he would come.  I know that is outside the ambit of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will make a move in one rather unfortunate matter, in that only £250,000 was borrowed over the past years under the facilities offered by the Tourist Traffic Act of 1952.  I hope the smoothing of the administrative procedure by which loans are made available and the increased attractiveness of them, will operate as an inducement to our hoteliers to make greater avail of the provisions under this Bill.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister and of the board, that is, that many of our small towns and villages along the cost have not yet installed water or sewerage schemes.  Where they are about to be installed, the Minister should use his influence with the Departments concerned to hurry up those <Col N="1184" /> schemes.  As everybody is aware, they are indispensable to tourism.  Many such schemes are being initiated at present by the local authorities and I hope they will get some priority when the occasion arises.</P>

      <P>Senator McGuire referred to the museums as a valuable asset in encouraging tourists.  He is quite right, of course, there.  He said that the only tragedy with regard to those museums was the lack of publicity about them.  I wish that were so.  Unhappily, there is another tragedy and a very serious one, which perhaps will be referred to later on in this House in subsequent sittings, that is, the tragedy of the present state of the museums in the capital city of Ireland. I know this is not the place or the time to develop that, but I should like to draw the attention of the Minister, who is a progressive statesman in these matters, to the fact that these two great assets of our tourist traffic in Ireland, the Natural History Museum and the Archæological Museum, are not worthy of our capital city.  That applies in particular to the Natural History Museum.</P>
      <P>We had a very large conference in this city last September, that of the British Association; and it was very sad for many of our scientists in Dublin that when members of that great and influential association went to see our Natural History Museum, they were bound to be gravely disappointed. I am not going to embark on this theme at this stage&mdash;I hope to do so later on&mdash;but I will say that I hope that the Minister, who has a genuine interest in promoting the tourist trade, if he has any say in the ultimate decision about our museums &mdash;which will have to come very soon&mdash; will be on the side of progress in this matter.  It is very sad, indeed, that our museums at the moment, especially the Natural History Museum, are in a very much worse state than they were 40 years ago.  I simply appeal to the Minister, in the interests of tourism, to support an improvement in those tourist aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say something on this last point <Col N="1185" /> first, that is, that, in thinking about the Natural History Museum, we might recognise that these Houses of Parliament of ours are largely responsible for the cramped conditions in the museum.  By force of circumstances, we have encroached upon space which could all have been well used by them. I am afraid we have had to link their problems rather with the problems of our own space economy in our own building here.  In that sense, we are doubly responsible, and therefore we ought doubly to support what Senator Stanford has just said.</P>
      <P>On the whole tourist traffic, I think we all must be acutely aware of the big contribution made to our economy by tourists.  We are familiar with the figures, and we realise that we would find it very hard to get on without this revenue.  The contribution is enormous, and perhaps even bigger than what can be measured.  Nevertheless, I should like to strike a note of caution, to some extent, because I do not think we ought to get ourselves into a frame of mind where we are laying proportionately too great an emphasis upon Ireland as a tourist industry centre.  The tourist industry should always be regarded as an adjunct, and should never get itself into the position of being regarded as a central industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Welcoming and preparing for tourists, taking them around the country and so on, is in a sense, on the national scale, like taking in lodgers.  I do not think that taking in lodgers on a national scale is the sort of thing, no matter how beautiful our country, that we ought to regard as being permanently one of our major industries. because essentially, of course, it is rather an unproductive industry.  I feel that our other industries and our agriculture will make a more real contribution to the good of the community than by taking in lodgers on a national scale. The effect on our economy of Ireland's becoming a kind of gigantic lodging-house would not be good.  It would encourage a number of artificial values and perhaps inflate unduly the importance of certain aspects of our life, if we tended too much to gear our economy towards the satisfaction of holiday needs and holiday tourist demands. <Col N="1186" /> Agriculture and industry, industry in particular with a very high skilled-labour content in our commodities, seem to me to be the two points upon which we should lay major emphasis, rather than upon what ought to be regarded always as an ancillary trade, the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>I realise, as I said at the beginning, that we could not at present do without the tourist trade.  I think we ought to ask ourselves: in what direction is it going?  I do not think anybody here would like to see us turned into one gigantic Coney Island to attract tired businessmen and their luxury seeking, many-dollared friends from across the water.  I do not think we want to become one gigantic amusement resort for the jaded rich of the world, no matter how much &ldquo;we want their money,&rdquo; as has been said.  In fact, I would stress the point that one of our major assets is that, so far, we have not been spoiled by tourists.  We are all familiar with the praise given by visitors from abroad about such and such a portion of Ireland, that it is &ldquo;unspoilt&rdquo;, and that word unspoilt means that so far it has succeeded in not being overrun by tourists.  I think we ought to be careful not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs by endeavouring so much to please the tourists that the discriminating tourist will eventually turn aside from us, as they now turn aside from garish resorts in other countries.</P>
    <P>It was said frankly by one Senator here that it is their money we want. One effect of attempting to attract the tourist with the big money is that home prices will go up.  I do not think there is much question about that.  The increased prices demanded for many commodities will mean, in fact, that in many ranges of consumer-goods home prices go up.  The experience throughout the world is that if you hold, for instance, a world exhibition or a world fair in any big town the effect on that town is a rise in prices.  I cannot help feeling that if our tourist market here were to be over-developed, we might be thrown off balance.  We might find ourselves being affected in our home trading by standards and commercial values which would be imported with <Col N="1187" /> the tourists rather than what might suit ourselves.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise, as several Senators have, that the way in which we can attract the kind of tourists we want to attract, is by being ourselves, by laying emphasis, as Senator Baxter and Senator Lenihan said, on the things we can do ourselves, rather than by trying to imitate the countries from which these tourists come.  Just the other day I had an inquiry from young friends in England who want to come here for six weeks' holiday in the South, and who want to bring their horses with them and ride across the South of Ireland as far as Kerry. It is not a very usual type of holiday, but they told me that in England there was an organisation called &ldquo;Highways and Byways&rdquo;, I think, which will give them maps of the bridle paths and byways to enable them to plan such a holiday in Britain, and also give them all information as to how to make arrangements for the transport of their horses to a particular point.</P>
    <P>In relation to Ireland&mdash;this is why I mention the point&mdash;they have so far found it exceedingly difficult to get information (a) about the transport of such horses to this country, and (b) the paths and byways in which they are principally interested for traversing this lovely part of our country.  I mention this as a way of holiday life potentially quite natural to Ireland, but information about which might at present be difficult to get.  It is the sort of thing on which a section of An Bord Fáilte or other organisations might concentrate some attention, the development of the simpler forms of tourism, not for the tourist with the high-powered car, and not necessarily even for travellers on horse-back, but for the cycling and walking tourist, for whom we are eminently equipped to cater.</P>
    <P>I cannot help thinking also of boating. One of my regrets is that this city of ours is traversed by a very nice river and yet that for long stretches navigable for small craft it is inaccessible to the ordinary public, who cannot go up on those magnificent stretches above the city, where there ought to <Col N="1188" /> be restaurants, pleasure gardens, and so on.  One ought to be able to hire boats there and be able to go boating on the summer evenings, but as things are it is just impossible to do that. This is true of many rivers in Ireland: they are not available to the ordinary public for large stretches of their waters as they would certainly be in Austria, Germany, Holland and Denmark.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see us aiming more at what I would term the working-class tourist.  We get quite a number of them particularly from Northern England, Yorkshire and Lancashire, and I should like to see us setting ourselves out more to satisfy them.  I think one thing which is lacking throughout the country, and even in this capital city, is a series of really big and well-run restaurants at moderate prices.  There are a number of first-class and excellent restaurants in Dublin, but they are expensive.  There are also a number of restaurants with moderate charges, but they are small. I feel that we do not do enough to cater for the not quite so moneyed classes, and it is to make a plea for them, both home and foreign, that I should like principally to speak on this Bill to-day.</P>
    <P>I think it is true, too, that in aiming to produce any commodity for export it is obvious&mdash;as we have been told again and again&mdash;that the best basis for a sound economic export trade is a well-developed home market. If you can sell your product at home and sell it well and economically, then you have a basis upon which to build an export trade.  I should like to suggest that there is an analogy here for the tourist trade, and that the real basis for a tourist trade here is to set ourselves out to cater far more than we do at present for holidays for our own not-so-moneyed people.  I am not sure that we as a people indulge sufficiently in the going-away-for-the-holidays practice.  I do not think the ordinary Irish holiday-maker is sufficiently thought of by our various tourist mechanisms.  I believe if we set ourselves out, without having any feeling of shame about it, to satisfy our own holiday-makers, in simpler ways and simpler places, without extravagant <Col N="1189" /> devices, then I believe we will have a basis for the satisfaction of a larger number of our own people and of tourists from abroad.  In other words, if we can contrive more widespread holidays for satisfied Irish people, it would provide an intelligent basis for satisfactory holiday amenities for tourists from abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of suggestions were put forward by Senators during the course of the discussion which will be brought to the attention of the Tourist Board which, with its advisers, will be able to assess their value and practicability.  I think most Senators were correct in their conclusion that the three main matters to which we have to give attention, if we are to secure substantial expansion of our tourist trade, is the development and extension of hotel accommodation, the improvement of transport facilities throughout the country and the lengthening by the measures which are open to us of the tourist season.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to offer inducements to the extension and improvement of hotel accommodation. The other matters are all within the sphere of activity of Bord Fáilte, and in relation to them, as the House is probably aware, certain measures have recently been announced.  With regard to some specific observations made by Senators relating to the proposals in the Bill regarding hotel accommodation, I think it is true that there are a number of applications for guarantees for loans awaiting implementation, as Senator Mullins said, which will, I hope, be disposed of quickly after this Bill has been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with him fully, and have already said, that the protracted administrative procedure involved in the consideration and the disposal of applications has been a deterrent to hotel proprietors in seeking to avail of the facilities of the earlier Act.  I am hoping we will be able to shorten and simplify the procedure, without unduly exposing the Exchequer to the risk of loss.  Apart altogether from the administrative changes of that kind that can be made, I believe that the <Col N="1190" /> provision in the Bill which permits of Bord Fáilte giving the grant in respect of loans raised outside the guarantee system will itself operate to secure a far greater utilisation of these aids in the future than in the past.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Quinlan misunderstood the reference to £75,000 in subsection (2) of Section 3.  That is the limit fixed to the amount which may be given by way of grants in respect of interest in any one year by Bord Fáilte, and, while it is possible to calculate that an investment of £1,500,000 a year would represent a considerable development, of course it is not to be assumed that loan capital will be the only source of new investment in hotel accommodation.</P>
    <P>With regard to transport facilities, I agree strongly with Senator McGuire about the importance of improving the arrangements for the transportation of visitors who wish to bring their own motor cars with them.  I have said already that the motoring visitor is going to be a far more significant feature in our tourist statistics in the future than in the past.  Many of them will avail of the car-hire facilities which are now being developed, and I think it is possible that the motoring visitor may more frequently be driving a hired car than his own car transported to this country.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is true we do lack adequate facilities for the bringing in of visitors' motor cars by sea or air. The operation of an improved car ferry service, either by sea or air, or both would be very helpful.  The matter has received consideration, as far as sea transportation is concerned.  It is quite obvious that substantial undertakings would be involved in the provision of an improved sea transportation service and that speedy results could not be gained, but some arrangement of a temporary kind can be initiated and is being urged.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire raised one matter of very considerable importance to which a great deal of thought has been given&mdash;the possibility of securing a substantial increase in American tourist travel by air, if air services were operated into Dublin rather than into <Col N="1191" /> Shannon.  There are many questions of policy involved in that suggestion.  The House is probably aware that this country spent a great deal of money on the development of Shannon as a transatlantic airport and in maintaining that airport up to the highest standards required by international authorities.</P>
    <P>That airport has been maintained in the main by transit traffic.  In other words, most of the planes landing with passengers proceed on again to other destinations.  Of course, terminal traffic at Shannon has increased considerably, but it is true to say that 90 per cent. of the passengers who arrive at Shannon are transit passengers.  It is not easy to foresee what the future may be in regard to that.  It is to be anticipated that, with the advent of the new tourist fares next year and the operation of services on a tourist basis, when economy will be a predominant feature, the utilisation of Shannon is likely to be increased, but with the subsequent development of the larger jet aircraft, the position is inclined to be obscure.</P>
    <P>In order to deal with that situation, as Senators will have seen, we have set up a promotional authority with Mr. O'Regan, the Chairman of Bord Fáilte and Comptroller at Shannon Airport, at its head to promote the development of Shannon Airport, both by improving the tourist amenities at the airport and in the vicinity of the airport as well.  I am fairly confident that that promotional effort will have substantial results at Shannon.  If one could secure the future of Shannon in respect of passenger and freight services, it would be easier to contemplate the operation of transatlantic services into Dublin, either direct or via Shannon, with Dublin as the terminal point of the service, but it is clear that it would be necessary to be certain that the operation could be so controlled and regulated that the development of Shannon would not be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>I think it is extremely likely that with the improvement of holiday facilities in the West of Ireland the coming of the faster and larger aircraft <Col N="1192" /> will also increase traffic to the West of Ireland, particularly from across the Atlantic, and that we will be able to sell holidays in Ireland to people from America and Canada in increasing volume, by reason of the improvement in air services through the shortening of the time of the journey and so on. That idea is being explored and this promotional effort has already been initiated, and future policy in that regard must depend on our views as to how that promotional effort will work out.</P>
    <P>May I say to Senator McGuire that he is wrong in one figure he gave?  He mentioned a figure of £100,000 as the anticipated loss on Dublin Airport.  As far as I know, there is no deficit anticipated on the operation of Dublin Airport and what I think he may have in mind is a statement issued by Aer Lingus as to a possible deficit on their revenue account this year.  I do not know if that is so or not, and, if there is that position, it must be looked into.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the possible operation of transatlantic air traffic into Dublin is quite the reverse.  It would necessarily involve some capital expenditure at Dublin airport.</P>
    <P>May I assure the Senator that if American visitors arriving in Dublin by boat are taken by bus to Glendalough rather than visiting the much more important attractions in Dublin, that is done by commercial agents who organise such tours, and not by An Bord Fáilte?</P>
    <P>References were made to the improvement of the shipping services and these are all important.  There is no doubt that we could have a substantial addition to our tourist traffic, particularly from Britain, if extended and improved shipping facilities could be provided and these matters are being considered, but the practical difficulties are obvious.  Quite considerable improvements have been made in recent years in the shipping services and in the arrangements for the handling of peak traffic which tended to concentrate on one or two days every year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of improving the tourist season, I think that must be considered in two parts. <Col N="1193" /> So far as hotels outside the cities are concerned, the best prospect is along the lines suggested by Senator Lenihan, the development and improvement of our sporting facilities, the opportunities for fishing and shooting and types of sporting holidays.  In the case of city hotels, the development of conventions and festivals is recognised to be important and An Bord Fáilte will, indeed, help financially and otherwise, people who are organising such functions outside the normal tourist season.  The initiation of An Tostal was intended to be an effort in that direction, and while it is still an important part of the whole tourist effort, Senators will have noticed that it has changed somewhat in character and is now taking the form of a series of separate festivals competently organised in the main centres of population, rather than as a nation-wide activity.  That is all to the good, and in these matters we can always learn by experience and our experience of the operation and results of An Tostal in recent years has tended to promote that change.</P>
    <P>I would agree fully with those Senators who talked about the importance of museums and cultural institutions as tourist attractions.  I am sure most of us had the experience that when we travelled to cities abroad, we generally occupied part of our time visiting museums and similar institutions open for inspection in these cities.  We must assume that visitors coming to Dublin, Cork and other Irish cities wish to do the same thing.  I would agree fully with Senator Stanford that a great deal of money could be spent on the improvement of our museums in Dublin, but that money is not there.  If he happens to know of a millionaire who would like to bequeath one or two million pounds for that purpose, we would be very glad to have it.  I cannot, however, promise that the Government would be able to find much money for that purpose in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington's interjection. If I am not misinterpreting him, he seemed to think that the <Col N="1194" /> tourist business was not quite the business for gentlemen and that if we go into it at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that selling holidays to visitors from abroad is just as respectable as selling them steaks or whiskey or anything else and there is no reason why we should not go into it enthusiastically as a national contribution to the development of our people and the well-being of our country.  It is far too soon to worry about problems that may arise through over-development in tourism.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly true that the tourist trade is more susceptible to changes in the political climate of the world than other trades.  People will always want to buy whiskey and steaks, but they tend not to want to buy holidays abroad, if any suggestion of international friction appears in the newspapers. To that extent, it is a trade that is liable to fluctuate according to conditions from one year to another. I think, however, the kind of tourist trade which we are selling in this country, a holiday secured by way of relaxation, is less susceptible to these conditions than the holiday based on different types of enjoyment.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I say that while the development of water and sewerage schemes in small towns is, no doubt, important from the point of view of the tourist trade, it is not a function of An Bord Fáilte or the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  All I can say is that my information is that there are now no outstanding applications for loans awaiting sanction.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom, ar dtúis, cuntas garid a thabhairt ar stair na dtionscal tuatha atá i gceist faoin mBille seo, le cabhrú le Seanadóirí tuiscint soiléir fháil ar chuspóirí an Bhille.  Síad na tionscail tuaithe atá i gceist ná tionscal an bhréidín, an tionscal cniotála agus bróidnéireachta agus tionscal na mbréagán.  Bé Bord na gCeantar gCúng a bhunaigh na tionscail seo, ach amháin tionscal na mbréagán den chéad uair mar chuid de na hiarrachtaí a bhí á dhéanamh acu chun saol geilleagrach na gceantar gcúng a fheabhsú.  Chuir an bord rómpu tionscail bhaile nó tionscail teaglaigh a chur chun chinn trí dheontais agus iasachtaí a thabhairt agus teagascóirí a chur ar fáil.</P>
      <P>D'éirigh go réasúnta maith leis na tionscail seo, go háirithe i rith an chéad chogaidh mhóir, i gcás an bhréidín.  De dheasca na ndeacrachtaí a tháinig ann tar éis na bacanna agus na coscanna a bhí i bhfeidhm ar an tionscal thall i Sasana i rith an chogaidh a bheith scaoilte, tháinig meath orthu timpeall na bliana 1920. Cuireadh deireadh le Bord na gCeantar gCúng sa bhliain 1923, agus socraíodh go roinnfí na dualgais a bhí á gcoimhlíonadh acu ar Ranna éagsúla. Faoí Ordú a rinne an Rialtais i mí Dheireadh Fómhair, 1956, do haistríodh na tionscail tuatha go léir ón Roinn Tailte go dtí Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Nuair a cuireadh Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ar bun sa bhliain 1925, rinne siad socrú maidir leis na tionscail tuatha agus mhol siad go mba chóir Lár-Ionad Margaíochta a chur ar bun chun cúrsaí díolacháin d'fheabhsú. Mholadar freisin go mba chóir tabhairt faoi aithbheochaint tionscail an bhréidín.  Ag éirigh as na moltaí sin, do cuireadh Lár-Ionad Margaíochta ar bun i mBaile Átha Cliath agus tugadh an t-ainm &ldquo;Gaeltarra Éireann&rdquo; air.

Tugaim anseo cuntas gairid ar gach tionscal ar leith ón uair a cuireadh an Lár-Ionad Margaíochta ar bun.</P>

Ní raibh eagraíocht ar bith ann chun bunabhar nó cumraí a chur ar fáil nó chun an bréidín a dhíol.  Shocruigh Seirbhísi na Gaeltachta ar mhuileann sníomhacháin a bhunú i gCill Chártha agus eagraíocht margaíochta a chur ar bun. Cuireadh ranganna ar bun chun tuilleadh fíodóirí d'oiliúint agus cuireadh cumraí nua ar fáil.  Mar thoradh ar obair na mblianta ó shoin i leith tá moharcha curtha ar fáil anois i gCill Chártha inar féidir gach gné den obair a dhéanamh idir sciúráil, meascadh, cárdáil, sníomhachán, fisiú agus críochnú, agus ina mbíonn breis agus céad oibrí fostaithe ó cheann ceann na bliana.</P>

Tá diolacháin bréidín méadaithe ó £18,075 sa bhliain 1935-36 go dtí £276,810 sa bhliain 1956-57.  Díoltar 50 per cent. den bhréidín seo thar lear.</P>

    <P>Cuireadh an tionscal seo ar bun ag Cuan Éilí, Co. Mhuigheo, so bhliain <Col N="1197" /> 1938.  Do hosclaíodh monarcha eile ag Croilí sa bhliain 1940 agus sa bhliain 1949, hosclaíodh monarcha eile sa Spidéal chun páirteanna bábóg a dhéanamh.  Chomh maith le bréagáin, déantar málaí siopadóireachta ins an tionscal seo.  Sé luach na n-earraí a díoltar sa bhliain ná timpeall £70,000. Tá tuairim 130 oibrí fostaithe sa tionscal seo.</P>
    <P>Is léir mar sin go bhfuil athrú mór tagtha ar chúrsaí na dtionscal ón uair a bunaíodh iad mar thionscail teaghlaigh ag Bord na gCeantar gCúng. Chomh maith leis an obair sa mbaile, tá obair ar siúl i monarchanna agus in ionaid anseo agus ansiúd ar fuaid na Gaeltachta.  Tá an cur-amach méadaithe go maith agus tá na tionscail anois ag braith cuid mhaith ar mhargaidh thar lear chun obair a choinneál leis na hoibrithe, go mór-mhór i dtionscal an bhréidín.</P>
    <P>Ag féachaint don bhfás mór atá taréis teacht ar na tionscail le roinnt blian anuas agus don bhfíor go gcaithfidh siad bheith i ndon seasamh i gcoinne coimhlinte, go mór-mhór ins na tíortha thar lear, socraíodh go mba chóir a mheas ar cheart eagraíocht tráchtála a chur ar bun chun na tionscail a stiúradh agus gan iad a fhágáil ag obair go díreach faoi Roinn Stáit. Taréis dul isteach san scéal go mion is go cúramach, táim sásta nach bhfuil módh oibre na Stát-Sheirbhíse oiriúnach chun gnó tionsclaíochta den tsaghas seo d'oibriú go héifeachtúil.</P>
    <P>Ní chuig obair den tsaghas seo a ceapadh módh oibre agus rialacha na Stát-Sheirbhíse.  Ionas go mb'fhéidir na tionscail a fhorbairt níos fearr fós, tá sé fíor-riachtanach im thuairimse eagraíocht tráchtála i bhfoirm Boird, mar a léirítear sa Bhille, a chur ar bun agus na tionscail a chur faoina chúram.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur gá dhom dul isteach ró-mhion i bhforálacha an Bhille féin mar is dóigh liom go bhfuil siad ion-tuigthe ionntu féin.  Tá an soláthar ins an mBille seo ar aon dul go ginearálta leis an soláthar a rinneadh i mBillí a ritheadh cheana féin i leith Boird Reachtúla.  Go hathchomair, tá beartaithe bord ar a dtabharfar Gaeltarra Éireann a chur <Col N="1198" /> ar bun agus na tionscail tuatha a chur faoina gcúram.  Tá sainmhíniú tugtha sa Bhille ar chomhachtaí agus dualgaisí an bhoird.  Ina thaobh seo ní miste liom a rá anseo gur ghlac mé sa Dáil le leasú ar Alt 4 a chur fo-alt a dó nua ann, faoin a leagtar síos gurab é dualgas an bhoird cabhrú le caomhaint agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá sé leagtha síos chomh maith an dóigh ina gceapfar baill an bhoird agus na coinníollacha a bhaineas leis na ceapacháin.  Aistreofar sócmhainní agus dliteanais na dtionscal tuaithe chuig an mbord nua.  Cuirfear airgead ar fáil don bhord faoí Alt 25 mar dheontas chun gná-chostais d'íoc agus faoi Alt 26 cuirfear airleacain inaisíoctha ar fáil le haghaidh caiteachas caipitil an bhoird.  Fé mar is gnáthach, cuirfear mar dhualgas ar an mbord cúntais a choinneál ar a n-ioncam agus ar a gcaitheachas, agus na cuntais a chur faoí bhráid an Aire.</P>
    <P>Beidh ar an mbord, freisin, tuarascáil a thabhairt ar a gcuid imtheachtaí gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar san mBille&mdash;altanna tríocha haon agus triocha dó (31 agus 32) go bhfuighidh an Dáil agus an Seanad Cóipeanna de na cuntais agus de na tuarascála a chuirfidh an bord ar fáil agus coinneofar Seanadóirí ar an eolas san dóigh sin ar conus mar atá obair an bhoird ag dul ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Ceist ana-dheacair ar fad é cúrsaí geilleagrach na Gaeltachta fheabhsú. Fiú leis na buntáistí atá curtha ar fáil faoi reachtaíocht eile maidir le tionscail a bhunú nó a leathnú sna duthaigh is fuide siar sa tír, is leasc le tionsclóirí dhul isteach in áiteachaí iargcúlta.  Caithfimíd, mar sin, aire faoi leith a thabhairt do na tionscail atá againn cheana sa Ghaeltacht, agus iad a chur chun cinn agus a leathnú chomh maith agus is féidir.  Faoi'n mBille, beidh deis ag an mbord freisin tionscal nua a chur ar bun, a bheas oiriúnach don Ghaeltacht agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Táim lán-tsásta go rachaidh forálacha an mBhille seo chun sochair go maith don Ghaeltacht agus molaim é don Teach seo dá réir.</P>

      <P>I dtosach, is dóigh <Col N="1199" /> liom go bhfuil an Bille seo le moladh agus, as sin, is dóigh liom go bhfuil an tAire le moladh faoi'n obair atá a déanamh sna tionscail.  Is dóigh liom fosta go raibh an ceart ag an Aire gan dul i bhfad isteach in altanna an mBille mar is gnáthach san dara léamh. Dúirt sé, agus bhí an ceart aige, go raibh ana-chuid deacrachtaí ag baint leis an scéal.  Tá ag teastáil uainn daoine nach mbeidh i seirbhís an Stáit, daoine dúthrachtacha a bhfuil eolas acu ar an tionscal, a bhfuil baint acu le intinn agus aigne na Gaeltachta agus a bhfuil a gcroí i mbeatha mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is deachar an dá rud d'fháil san duine chéanna.</P>
      <P>Níor mhiste a rá gur daoine maithe iad séirbhisígh an Stáit agus go ndearnadh sár-obair sa Ghaeltacht roimhe seo faoi Bhord na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng.  Acht tá ranna sa Stát-Sheirbhís nach bhfuil oiriúnach chun tionscail a bhunú, chun margaí d'fháil, chun ceannach agus díol a dhéanamh, nó chun tionscail a stiúrú.  Maidir leis na daoine a ceapfear mar bhaill den bhord, mar dúirt an tAire is deacair daoine d'fháil a thuigeann na cursaí seo, agus a thuigeann cursaí na Gaeltachta chómh maith.  Sin é an fhadhb.  Caithfear na daoine seo a chur ar fháil, daoine a mbeadh fhios acu conus an gnó a dhéanamh, daoine a thuigeann conas an bun-abhar d'fháil, conas na hearraí a chur os comhair an phobail le ceannach, agus mar a dúirt an tAire, daoine a bhfuil tuiscint acu do mheon agus deacrachtaí na Gaeltachta&mdash; deacrachtaí a bhfuil stair an-fhada taobh thiar díobh.  Ní bheidh sin fuarasta a dhéanamh.  Ní dóigh liom go raibh an obair seo á cur chun chínn comh maith is ba mhian leis an Aire, agus mar is gá agus is riachtanach chun cúrsai na Gaeltachta d'fheabhsú. Sílim go bhfuil cabhair an-mhór tugtha chun an dá rud sin a dhéanamh in Alt 4 den Bhille.  Tá sé níos fusa é a scríobh sios i mBille na é a chur idir lámhaibh agus beidh an-áthas orainn go léir ma éiríonn leis an Aire san obair seo.  Ní ceist airgid atá annseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níor thug an tAire roinnt figiúraí dúinn mar gheall ar an mbórd nua atá le ceapadh.  Más féidir leis, ba mhaith <Col N="1200" /> liom fosta, ar Chéim Choisde an Bhille, dá dtugadh an tAire freagra orm&mdash;cá mhéid fear atá ag obair ins na tionscail ar fud na Gaeltachta?  Tá fhios againn go léir gur mná is mó atá ag obair iontu.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur gá dom a thuilleadh a rá faoin mBille seo.  Tá fhios againn go maith nach bhféadhfadh an Rialtas seo, ná aon Rialtas eile, a mhéar a leagadh ar dhaoine a bheadh oiriúnach don obair seo. Ainneoin sin, cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille agus tá súil agam go n-eireoidh leis an Aire agus leis an Roinn feabhas a chur ar an nGaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Mar tosach ba mhaith liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an Aire nua ar a chéad chuairt go dtí an Teach seo.  Is dóigh liom gur féidir liom geallúint a thabhairt dó go bhfaighidh sé cabhair an Tí seo chun leas a dhéanamh maidir le úsáid agus leathnú na Gaeilge, agus chun feabhas a chur ar shlí bheatha na ndaoine ins na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá fáilte againn roimis.  Tá rud againn annseo nach raibh riamh againn cheana, Aire ar leith don Ghaeltacht.  Is fada sin ag teacht mar rud ar leith agus is maith an rud é.</P>
      <P>Cad é gnó an Aire seo agus an Bille seo atá ós ar gcomhair?  Cad é an córas atá ceaptha chun leas na Gaeltachta?</P>
      <P>Tá sé sin luaite ann.  Laistiar de sin, sé ciall atá i leas na Gaeltachta, in aigne na ndaoine a cheap an Bille, ná leas na muintire gurb í an Ghaeilge an teanga ghnáthach a úsáideann siad. Sin é an ciall a bhainimse as agus is mó atá an chiall ag baint le daoine ná le límistéir tíre.  Is maith go dtuigfí go soiléir é sin.  Agus, ó thosach, go dtuigfí gurb é an príomh-chuspóir atá leis an ngnó ar fad ná go mbreiseofaí úsáid, sé sin labhairt na Gaeilge, ins na ceantracha ina bhfuil sí ag formhór na ndaoine.  Is trua nach bhfuil sé sin luaite sa chéad alt den Bhille, ach tá am go leor fós chun é a chur ann. Ionas nach mbeadh aon mí-thuiscint ar aon Aire a thiocfaidh nuair a bheas an Bille seo ina Acht, tá súil agam go gcuirfear é sin ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBille seo, baineann sé ar fad le tionscail áirithe.  Is maith é sin mar baineann na tionscail sin <Col N="1201" /> le cuid mhaith daoine ins na ceantracha go dtugamaid &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; orthu.  Má tá aon locht agam-sa ar an ngnó isé laighead líon na dtionscal atá ainmnithe.  Do luaigh an tAire trí tionscail agus d'fhág sé mar sin é, ach tá tionscail eile ar siúl ins na ceantracha céanna, tionscail is seacht mó ná an líon sin, agus is trua liom-sa nach mbeidh siad sin mar chúram ar an mbord ins na ceantracha ina bhfuil siad.  Tionscail mhonarchan atá ins na trí tionscail a luaigh an tAire agns tá a lán daoine ag brath ar tionscail eile mar iascaireacht, foraoiseacht, tionscail olna, feamainn agus mar sin de.  Tá siad sin á riaradh fé láthair ag Aireachtaí eile.  Sé cuspóir Aire na Gaeltachta leas na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh.  Tá sé intuighthe go scaoilfear leis na hAireachtaí eile a gcuid tionscal féin do chur ar aghaidh sa Ghaeltacht agus gan aon cheangal ná aon dualgas orthu i leith na Gaeilge. Ba cheart go mbeadh tionchar ag Aire na Gaeltachta ar ghníomhartha na nAireachtaí eile ins na ceantracha sin agus go mbeidis go léir ag obair as láimh a chéile do leas na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud an Bille seo mar thosach ach ní dóigh liom go mbeifear sa deireadh sásta leis an méid is féidir leis an Aire a dhéanamh leis an gcumhacht atá aige.  Ba cheart go mbeadh cumhacht i bhfad níos leithne aige chun an bun-chuspóir, leas na Gaeilge, a thabhairt chun críche.  Ní féidir an cuspóir sin a bhaint amach gan tionchar agus scóip na haireachta a leathnú.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán cumhachta ag na comhairlí condae ins na ceantracha ina bhfuil siad ag feidhmiú agus ba mhaith liom fios d'fháil ón Aire a bhfuil sé bearthaithe aon tionchar ag chur ar an mbord i gceantracha ina bhfuil Gaeltacht.  Tá dlú-bhaint ag gníomhú na seirbhísí sóisialta le saol pearsanta muintir na n-áiteanna sin.  Is dóigh liomsa gur ceart go mbeadh comhairle nó údarás éigin ag Aireacht na Gaeltachta ar ghníomhú na gcomhairle, na n-oifigeach agus na Ranna Stáit atá freagarthach sna gnóthaí sin.</P>
    <P>Ar ndó, níor thagair an tAire ach do na rudaí atá beartaithe san mBille seo.  Tosnú maith is ea é agus is maith san ann agus is maith b'hféidir, <Col N="1202" /> é sin a choimeád leis féin.  Dá mba ag labhairt ar son ghnáth-pholasaí nó mór-chuspóir na hAireachta a bhéinn, ba mhaith liom a lán eile a chlos uaidh i dtaobh cad é atá beartaithe nó cad tá le beartú i dtaobh cúrsaí sóisialta sa Ghaeltacht ach níl baint aige sin leis an mBille seo.  Beidh mé ag coinne le heolas d'fháil ón Aire uair éigin eile.</P>
    <P>Ní abróidh mé a thuilleadh i láthair na huaire seo ach a rá leis an Aire gur maith liom ar fad go bhfuil an tosach déanta aige; go bhfuil an Bille ós ár gcomhair; go bhfuil fonn air dul ar aghaidh leis; agus go bhfuil fonn air leas na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh.  Ba mhaith liom a léiriú dhó go bhfuil sé ag déanamh leas don Ghaeltacht fé mar a chítear don Rialtas é agus don phobal agus do na daoine úd a bhfuil dearcadh náisiúnta acu agus gur mian leo an Ghaeilge d'úsáid sa Ghaeltacht mar a bhfuil sí beo fós.  Níl san mBille seo ach tosach ar na nithe a caithfear a dhéanamh.  Fáiltím roimis an Aire agus guím rath, séan agus buaidh leis chun na gnóthaí sin do chur chun cinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on the Bill but interested as I am in the industrial life of the country, it would be wrong for me not to make some contribution.  I welcome the Bill as a praiseworthy effort to preserve and develop industry in the Gaeltacht thereby providing employment and helping to save the language.  The provision of employment and the preservation of the language appear to me to be two of the difficulties that will face anybody who is to work under this Bill.  They are both praiseworthy objects but it would seem that the primary object of the measure is to save the Gaeltacht and the language and give employment in order to keep our people at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people concerned have been brought up speaking the language and if they leave the Gaeltacht they are not likely to come back any more.  The board, under this Bill, are faced with a formidable task.  They have got to reconcile the two aims of which I have spoken.  We know that there exists <Col N="1203" /> private enterprise and it would seem that the first object of the Government ought to be to preserve what exists. From what I have read, it appears that there has been a certain amount of overlapping and even competition as between Gaeltarra Éireann and existing private enterprise industries in the Gaeltacht.  Quite obviously, this is not a desirable situation because everybody is needed in those particular areas.</P>
    <P>If private enterprise is working successfully, it should be allowed to work freely.  Anything that is done in those areas under Government sanction should be supplementary and not competitive. That is only common sense. It is to be presumed that anything established under the new board will not compete unduly or unfairly with existing private enterprise but that it will work in harmony with existing industries.</P>
    <P>Straightway, I should say that I do not envy the members of this board their task.  They have a very difficult job before them.  No doubt, if it is approached in a businesslike way progress can be made and something can be done to conserve and develop industries in the Gaeltacht.  The Government's job under this legislation is to change the subsidy aspect of the matter and turn it into something that can create self-supporting industries.</P>
    <P>The people in the Gaeltacht do not want anything in the shape of charity. They require industries of their own which can stand on their own feet. There is a certain element of charity in this legislation.  Products from the West of Ireland and from Donegal are well known but I think they are not well enough known.  From a purely business point of view, they are of good quality and ought to be better known.</P>
    <P>It is not very often understood by people who are not in business that it is easier to manufacture goods than to sell them.  That applies to the smallest article.  For example, it is easier to crochet a cosy than to sell it.  The selling of the product is a much more difficult matter altogether. <Col N="1204" /> That applies in a big way as well as in a small way.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;and let me here say that my remarks must not be taken wrongly&mdash;that he will be faced with the difficult task of reconciling a good businessman with a good Irish speaker.  You are, therefore, faced with a choice between the businessman and the language.  On this occasion I would suggest that emphasis, for the sake of the language and the Gaeltacht, should be laid upon the business element.  In other words, for the good of the language, it would be better to get a good businessman to manage what we propose doing here. It is desirable that his language qualifications should be good also but the emphasis should be on business.</P>
    <P>We have got good existing industries in the Gaeltacht areas.  The first duty of the board should be to conserve these and build them up.  We ought not to try too many lines.  The people in the Gaeltacht are famous for knitted goods and tweeds.  Instead of pursuing a multiplicity of lines we ought to develop the good existing lines and set up a good marketing system.  From my own experience in Dublin, I know that we can sell Gaeltacht products quite well.  I suppose we sell far more of the Gaeltacht products to strangers than to people at home.  The people at home are so used to seeing them that there is no novelty about them.  They utilise them only for hard wear, and if you are selling them only for hard wear, you will never make a fortune.</P>
    <P>In these products of the Gaeltacht, we have got something which is typically Irish and something of which Ireland can be proud.  We have little chance in the modern world of competing with mass-produced produce. Our factories set up under protective walls, producing, for example, stockings, exist only because we have tariff barriers.  If the market was wide open, we could not sell our goods; but if we develop the Gaeltacht articles, no matter what free market there is, no other country can make Donegal tweed.  I would suggest to the new board that if a stronger emphasis is put on marketing as well as making&mdash;<Col N="1205" /> in fact, more emphasis on marketing in the future&mdash;they will achieve success.</P>
    <P>Having conserved what exists and working with private enterprise without cut-throat competition, having developed what already exists in Gaeltarra Éireann, we should set up small industries making the same goods, but making them in quantity and having them properly marketed.  I would suggest that those are the right lines to adopt.  I think there might be a changed picture over there, if this idea of mine is put into action.</P>

      <P>Ar aon dul leis na cainteoirí eile, cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus fáilte roimh an Aire atá anseo don chéad uair mar Aire na Gaeltachta.  Is fíor gur Bille maith í seo.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an Aire agus leis an mBord atá le cur ar bun aige na rudaí atá ag déanamh buartha dúinn le tamall do bhaint amach, sé sin, an saol eacnamaíochta sa Ghaeltacht d'fheabhsú i bhfad níos fearr ná mar atá sé fé láthair agus an saol sóisialach d'fheabhsú chomh maith.  Tá na rudaí sin go léir fite fuaite le ceist aithbheochaint na teangan.  Sin í an bhun-cheist, aithbheochaint na teangan nó an Ghaeilge do chaomhnú ins na h-aiteanna a bhfuil sí fé láthair, na h-áiteanna ar a dtugtar an Fhíor-Ghaeltacht agus is baolach go bhfuil an Fhíor-Ghaeltacht ag cúngú i n-aghaidh an lae.  Is mór an díobháil é sin do cheist na teangan má thagann meath ar na h-áiteanna san ar a dtugtar an Ghaeltacht agus má bhíonn ar na daoine imeacht as na h-áiteanna san fé mar atáid ag imeacht fé láthair, fé mar a bhíodar ag imeacht go dtí seo.  Tá súil agam go leigheasfar an scéal anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>'Sí an imirce an rud is mó atá ag cur as don Ghaeltacht agus sé an chuid is measa den cheist sin ná go bhfuil daoine ag imeacht as an nGaeltacht agus gan súil le na dteacht thar n-ais. Is mór an dochar é sin ar fad. Deirimse gur cailliúnt náisiúnta na daoine a fhágann an Ghaeltacht agus a thugann an teanga leo.  Deirtear i gcónaí gurb í an Ghaeltacht fíorthobar na Gaeilge agus fé mar adúramar go minic cheana caithfimid <Col N="1206" /> féachaint chuige ná raghaidh fíorthobar na Gaeilge i ndísc.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist seo na Gaeltachta, tá sé ag déanamh buartha dúinne annso le tamall, sinne go bhfuil suim againn sa cheist.  B'fhéidir nach iad na tuairmí céadna a bheadh againn go léir mar gheall ar cad iad na modhanna nó na slite ba cheart chun feabhas a chur ar an scéal ach deirimse má táimid chun tionscail do chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht go dtosnóimid leis na tionscail is mó atá aca fé láthair.  Dhein an Seanadóir &ldquo;an Seabhac&rdquo; tagairt dóibh sin cheana.  Dhein sé tagairt do cheist na talmhaíochta agus do cheist na hiascaireachta.  Ag tosnú le ceist na talmhaíochta, sé an chéad rud ba cheart dúinn a dhéanamh ná teacht i gcabhair ar na daoine go bhfuil gabháltais talún aca.  'Sé mo thuairim go dtuigeann an tAire é sin go maith.  Tá fianaise aige cheana féin air sin mar tá sé le scéim a chur ar bun ar a dtugtar scéim na muc.  Tá sé sin bunaithe ar an talamh agus ar chothú na talún.  Is maith an rud é sin.</P>
    <P>Is mór le muintir na Gaeltachta na gabháltais talún atá acu agus teastaíonn cabhair uatha chun na gabháltais sin d'fheabhsú, agus má dheineann an tAire an méid sin den obair taobh amuigh de na tionscail eile a cuirfear ar bun sa Ghaeltacht beidh rud maith déanta aige gan aon agó.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán rudaí eile le déanamh maidir leis an talamh, na céadta slite in a bhféadfaí teacht i gcabhair ar na daoine sa Ghaeltacht maidir leis na gabhaltais talún atá acu.  Tá leasú na talún le chur chun cinn, leasú nach bhfuil déanta cheana, b'fhéidir mar ná raibh sé de ghustal ag na daoine féin é do dhéanamh.  Maidir le fertiliser do chur sa chré, teastaíonn cabhair uatha chun é sin a dhéanamh ach b'fheidir ná beadh an t-airgead aca féin chun é sin do dhéanamh i gceart. Agus tar éis tamaill níor mhór don bhord atá le cur ar bun dul isteach sa cheist sin féachaint cad iad na slite is fearr chun teacht i gcabhair ar na daoine sin maidir le ceist na talún.  Do dheineas tagairt cheana dóibh sin nuair bhí ceist Aireacht na Gaeltachta fé díospóireacht annso againn.</P>
