      <P>Ag caint dhom aréir, rinne mé tagairt dos na fáthanna atá le cabhair fé leith do thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Fé mar adúirt mé anseo ar ócáid eile, má theastaíonn uainn rud fónta a dhéanamh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus ar mhaithe leis na daoine a chónaíonn ann, ní foláir dúinn beith sásta íobairt a dhéanamh ar a son agus ní foláir go mbeidh muintir na tíre ar fad sásta an íobairt sin do dhéanamh&mdash;sé sin, má táimíd i ndáiríribh maidir le hathbheochaint na Gaeilge nó maidir leis an nGaeilge do chaomhnú agus do choimeád beo sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht agus ansin í do leathnú amach chun taoide na Galltachta do chur siar.  Tá fhíos ag gach aoinne go bhfuil an taoide sin ag rith in ar gcoinnibh le blianta anuas.  Muna gcuirtear taoide na Galltachta siar, tiocfaidh meath ar an nGaeilge agus, a gcionn fiche bliain, nó mar sin, is ar éigin a bheidh Fíor-Gaeltacht ann ar chor ar bith.  Dá dheascaibh sin, tá an Bille seo ana-thábhachtach, fé mar a bheadh aon iarracht a deinfí ar son na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt aréir, freisin, do sceim atá in aigne an Aire, Scéim na Muc.  Dúras gur cheapas gur scéim thairbheach í agus go mbeidh fonn ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta an scéim sin d'oibriú.  Acht 'sí an fá is mó go ndúirt mé gur ceart go n-éireodh leis an scéim sin ná go bhfuil sí bunaithe ar an talamh agus, freisin, ar dhúchas na ndaoine.  Tá fhios againn go léir gur ins an Ceanntair Chúnga is mó a bhí an tionscail sin mar thaca do na <Col N="1210" /> ndaoine, tionscail na muc.  Má leantar ar aghaidh leis an scéim sin, sílím go raghaidh sí go mór chun tairbhe na ndaoine ann.</P>
    <P>Molaim don Aire, friesin, machnamh do dhéanamh maidir le scéim eile a bheadh tairbheach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta bhféidir, sé sin, Scéim na gCearc.  Sílim go mb'fhéidir linn an tionscal sin do bhunú sa Ghaeltacht agus go raghadh sí chun tairbhe na ndaoine.  Leis na gabháltais bheaga atá ag na daoine sa Ghaeltacht, sílim go mb'fhéidir tionscail bheaga den tsaghas sin do bhunú ann.  Bh'fhéidir go mbeadh ar chumas na ndaoine teagascóirí ar éinlaithe clós do bheith acu a thabharfadh méar an eolais dóibh ar conus dul ar aghaidh leis an scéim.  Is fiú machnamh a dhéanamh ar sin.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an tAire eolas dúinn ar a smaointe 'ina thaobh sin nuair a bheas deireadh á chur aige leis an díospóireacht seo.</P>
    <P>Do mholas, freisin, gur cóir nuair a beifear ag machnamh ar cheist tionscail do bhunú sa Ghaeltacht, cuimhniú ar dhuchas áite do choimeád i gcónaí.  Ar a shon sin, rinne mé tagairt don iascaireacht. Tionscal bunúsach dúchasach is ea an iascaireacht agus is aisti a gheibheann a lán daoine sa Ghaeltacht a slí beatha.  Ní fheicim ó thalamh an domhain cad na thaobh ná beadh ceangal idir an tionscal seo agus an bord seo atá le cur ar bun mar gheall ar gur tionscal é atá ag na daoine sa Ghaeltacht leis na cianta.</P>
    <P>An fear mór-cháiliúil úd, Tomás Ó Criomhthain, a scríobh an leabhar úd <i>An tOileánach</i>, is as an tionscal sin a bhain sé a shlí beatha amach agus na daoine atá sa gceantar sin inniu is don tionscal sin atá siad ag gabháil agus is as atá siad ag fáil a slí bheatha.  Sin é an fáth gur dóigh liom gur ceart go mbeadh údarás éigin ag an Aire agus ag an mBord aire éigin a thabhairt don tionscal sin.</P>
    <P>Do bhí díospóireacht againn anso tráth bhí Aireacht na Gaeltachta dhá cur ar bun agus rinne mé tagairt don rud sin ach ba leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta an fho-Roinn sin.  Bhí an fho-Roinn sin ceangailte leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta.  Do mholas féin an uair <Col N="1211" /> sin go ndéanfaí an fho-Roinn sin den Roinn Talmhaíochta a cheangal le Roinn na Gaeltachta ach níor deineadh sin agus níor deineadh fós é.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfar é sin.  Ansan, ta tionscail eile ann a Juaigh an tAire agus tá cuid acu san, leis, bunaithe ar an talmh.  Tá tionscal na dtrátaí agus tionscal na dtithe gloine ann a cuireadh ar bun cúpla bliain ó shin.  Deirtear liom go bhfuil ag éirí leo go maith.  Sa Tuaisceart agus i gContae Mhuigheo measaim a cuireadh ar bun iad san.</P>

      <P>Níor cuireadh aon chuid díobh ar bun sa Ghaeltacht theas. Tá súil agam nach fada go dtí go gcuirfear ar bun iad sa Ghaeltacht theas. Tá slí ann dóibh.  Tá margadh ann do na torthaí a thiocfadh asta.</P>
      <P>Do léas cuntas le déanaí i dtaobh an mhéid airgid atá ag imeacht as an tír ar thrátaí agus in aon dá mhí amháin, i Mí Meithimh agus i Mí Iúil, do dhíolamar £200,000 as trátaí a tháinig chugainn on Ollóinn.  Taispeáneann sin go bhfuil margadh anso do na trátaí a thiocfadh as na tithe gloine. Is scéim mhaith í sin.  Tá suíl agam go leithnófar í.</P>
      <P>I gCiarraí féin tá dhá Ghaeltacht ann.  Tá Gaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne agus Gaeltacht Uíbh Ráthach ann. Ansan tá Gaeltacht Chorcaighe theas ann agus tá an-chuid le déanamh sa límistéir sin tíre fós.  Táim dá lua sin mar tá gá le tionscalú sna límistéiri sin.</P>
      <P>Tá an imirce ag cur as dóibh ansin leis na blianta fada anuas agus tá na daoine bocht ann.  Níl acu ach gabháltaisí beaga talún agus má tá clanna móra sna límistéirí sin is éigin dóibh a n-áit dhúchais d'fhágaint chun a slí bheatha do bhaint amach in áiteanna eile.</P>

      <P>Sea, líon na gcainteóirí dúchais.  Ní go Sasana ná go Meiriceá atá cuid acu ag dul ach go Baile Átha Cliath agus go dtí cathracha eile in Éirinn.  Maidir le tionscail teallaigh nó tuaithe, is maith liom a chlos ón Aire go bhfuil ag éirí go maith le tionscal na mbabóg agus na mbreágán.</P>
      <P>De réir mar chloisim, tá teacht isteach maith ag an muintir go bhfuil an tionscal sin acu.  Ní fheadar an bhféadaí iad san do leathnú mar tá margadh maith ann dá leithéidí.  Is dóigh liom gur féidir cuid acu san do dhíol thar lear&mdash;cuid de na bréagáin. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ard-mheas orthu sna tíortha thar lear sna háiteanna ina ndíoltar iad.  Más mar sin atá an scéal, más féidir margadh níos leithne d'fháil dóibh, ní fheicim cad na thaobh ná raghfaí ar aghaidh leis an tionscal sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an mbreidín.  tionscail maith é sin atá ar siúl sa tír seo leis na cianta.  Do réir an chúntas a fuaramar ón Aire, díoladh luach £276,000 den bhréidín sa bhliain 1956-57.  Díoladh leath an méid sin sa bhaile agus fuaireamar leath an méid sin airgid ar earraí bréidín sa bhaile. Rud an-mhaith é sin agus bhíos ag cuimhneamh go bhféadfar cur leis an tionscal seo ionas go mbeimíd in ndon níos mó bréidín a dhíola sa bhaile as seo amach.  Chun é sin a dhéanamh, caithfimíd a lán stocaireacht a chur ar bun, ag cur in iúl do na daoine chomh breágh agus chomh deas is atá an bréidín agus ag cur in a luí orthu gurbh fhearr i bhfad dóibh a gcuid airgid a chaitheamh sa bhaile seachas é a chur thar lear ag ceannacht rudaí eachtranacha. Sa chaoi sin, bheidís ag tabhairt obair dá muintir fhéin.  Ba cheart an scéal sin a chur abhaile ar na daoine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá fás mór tagaithe ar na tionscail sin agus ní mór eagraíocht nua a chur ar bun chun go mbeidís i ndon seasamh ar a mbonna féin i gcoinne coimhlinnt na tíre thar lear.  Caithfaimíd leis eagraíochta eile a chur ar bun seachas an eagraíocht le haghaidh na hearra <Col N="1213" /> atá luaite agam chun earraí eile a chur ar an margadh.  Aontaíom gur maith an rud an bord seo do chur ar bun.  Ba mhaith liom a rá, áfach, gur cheart daoine éifeachtacha a chur ar an mbord sin, daoine a mbeidh a gcroí san obair, daoine maithe gnótha. Caithfidh na daoine a bheas ar an mbord seo a bheith go dúthrachtach i mbun a gcuid oibre.  Sílim gur maith an rud go mbeidh saoirse ar leith ag an mbord ionas go mbeidís indon dul ar aghaidh leis an obair go luath.  Is maith an rud freisin go mbeidh ar an mbord tuarascáil a chur ar fáil gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Is iad Alt 25 agus Alt 26 den Bhille seo is mó le rá, mar is iad na haltanna seo a thugann an t-údarás don Aire chun an t-airgead a chur ar fáil agus is í ceist an airgid bun agus bárr na scéimeanna seo.  Tá sé curtha síos an Alt 26, is dóigh liom, go mbeidh suim áirithe curtha ar fáil ó am go ham agus sé an suim atá luaithe ná leath mhilliún púnt.  Níl fhios agam i gceart céard a chiallíonn an abairt sin &ldquo;ó am go ham&rdquo; nó cén caiteachas a bheas ann.  Is dócha go mbeidh ar an mbord obair dá réir&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ba cheart nach mbeadh bac airgeadais ar an mbord&mdash; go mbeidís indon dul ar aghaidh leis an obair gan a bheith ag cuimhneamh ar airgead ar feadh an ama.  Ba cheart nach mbeadh aon easpa airgid ann.  Ag tabhairt fén obair seo, tionscalú na Gaeltachta, ní mór dúinn a thuiscint nach ionann na coinníoleacha a ghabhann léi agus na coinníolacha a gabhfas le tionscalú ins na háiteanna sa Ghalldacht, mar a bhfuil níos mó daoine agus mar a bhfuil córas iompair agus gach rud mar sin in aice leo.  Tá mé ag caint faoi na háiteanna a tionnscalú ins an nGalltacht.  Is mór an deifríocht a dheineann sé sin agus sin é an fá go gcaithfidh an Rialtas cabhair fé leith a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is ar mhaithe le teanga na Gaeilge a déanfar é go mór-mhór.  Is ionann sin is a rá go gcaithfidh muintir na tíre uile obair a dhéanamh ar son muintir na Gaeltachta, mar is é cúram na tíre uile an teanga a choimeád beo <Col N="1214" /> agus a láidriú.  Caithfidh mé tagairt a dhéanamh an seo do scéimeanna eile bhfuil ceangal acu leis an mBille seo. Céard faoi Scéim na Muc?  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an scéim sin faoi na coistí talmhaíochta faoi láthair.  Is ag oifigígh na gcoistí seo atá obair na scéime sin agus measaim go mba cheart <i>liaison</i> áirithe a bhunú idir an bord nua agus na coistí chun an scéim sin agus a macsamhail a oibriú agus a chur chun cinn.  Baineann an rud céanna le ceist na hiascaireachta.  Má táthar le dul chun cinn a dhéanamh san tionscail sin ba cheart go mbeadh oifigigh ar fáil chun cabhair a thabhairt agus ba cheart go mbeadh na hoifigigh sin indon Gaeilge a labhairt.</P>

Dár ndóigh, má táimíd dáiríribh i dtaobh aithbheochaint na Gaeilge, ní bhéidh aon chorabhuais orainn mar gheall ar sin.  D'fhéadfaí a rá mar mhalairt air sin gúr dhein muintir na Gaeltachta obair ar son na hÉireann agus go bhfuilid á dhéanamh fós.  Mar gheall ar sin, níl san obair atámuid á dhéanamh anois ach aisíoc le muintir na Gaeltachta i ngeall ar obair atá déanta acu cheana. Rud luachmhar iseadh an Ghaeilge agus is fiú na costaisí.  Cuirim céad fáilte roimh an Bhille seo agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis.  Guidhim rath Dé ar an obair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to join in congratulating the Minister on his appointment and, coming as I do from the same town, I have a special pleasure in wishing him every success in his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as I understand it, is confined mainly to the establishment of a board to replace the existing Civil Service system of operating the rural industries.  A good deal has been said about the general position of the Gaeltacht and much reference has been made to many other matters which might engage the attention of the Minister.  Senator Ó Siochfhradha last <Col N="1215" /> night referred to forestry, fishing and agriculture and Senator Ó Ciosáin also stressed the importance of these matters.  However, it seems to me there is another way in which the prosperity of the people in the Gaeltacht could be increased, and increased both to their benefit and to the benefit of the Irish language itself, that is, by some scheme, of a wider character than seems to be in operation at the present time, for bringing more and more people into the Gaeltacht for the purpose of drinking from that well which has been referred to by Senator Ó Siochfhradha.</P>
    <P>If we established some kind of local tourist industry in the Gaeltacht areas, there would immediately be a good reason for people remaining in the Gaeltacht.  There would be the additional source of revenue not only from providing for holiday makers coming there to spend their holidays, but, more important still, from providing accommodation and the facilities especially for young people to acquire a knowledge of the Irish language through conversation.  That is a matter which certainly might engage the attention of the Minister. It does not arise strictly relevantly on this Bill, but I have allowed myself the latitude that other speakers have allowed themselves in departing from the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the products which are coming from Gaeltacht industries, I must confess I have had great personal satisfaction in seeing those products. On the Tourist Bill last night, Senator McGuire referred to the need for marketing our typically Irish products in an attractive way.  It gave me great satisfaction to see in my own home recently a product which was very attractive in itself and was packaged attractively.  I looked to see who was the producer to find it was a product of Gaeltarra Éireann.  That is something which will greatly assist in the development of these rural industries.</P>
    <P>I formed the view that not enough publicity has been given to the products of the Gaeltacht.  In going around the shops and seeing the <Col N="1216" /> variety of toys, and so on, I do not think I have noticed any distinctive tag which would identify the products of the Gaeltacht from those of other industries.  It might be no harm if these goods were marked in some distinctive way which would enable people who are sympathetically disposed towards the living conditions of people in the Gaeltacht to buy those products in preference to products which are manufactured elsewhere.</P>
    <P>From the figures given by the Minister in his speech last night, it is apparent that the Gaeltacht industries have been employing an increasing number of people and producing an increasing quantity of goods.  It would be wrong for us to expect that there would be any spectacular change in the situation merely by reason of the creation of this independent board.  Civil servants may not be the best business people, but they have been burdened with a great many commercial and industrial activities for a variety of reasons.  In the case of Gaeltarra Éireann, they have done very well in all the circumstances, but it would be wrong to repose too much hope in the mere establishment of a board.  Much will depend on the response and co-operation which the board will get in its activities.</P>
    <P>The main object, I take it, of establishing rural industries in the Gaeltacht is to keep as many people as possible productively employed in the Gaeltacht, so that, even though it is only a small well of Irish, it will always be there.  Recently, in answer to a parliamentary question in the Dáil, the wage rates of some of the workers in the rural industries were quoted.  It struck me that the wage rates were extremely low, much lower, I am certain, than would be sufficient to keep people in other industries in continuous employment.  There would be a great deal of trade union activity, I should imagine, if the wage rates in other industries were as low as they are in the Gaeltacht industries.  These low wage rates may be a difficulty inherent in the situation in which the Gaeltacht industries find themselves, but I certainly take the view that, unless the income of the people employed in these <Col N="1217" /> industries is considerably increased, the tendency, about which Senator Ó Ciosáin has spoken, of so many people to leave the Gaeltacht will continue and will continue proportionately as employment in other parts of the country is able to offer better wages, apart altogether from the attraction that wage rates in England provide for people as against employment in this country.</P>
    <P>That will be one of the great problems with which the board will be faced, to increase the wage rates in such a way as to give a fairly decent standard of living to people in the Gaeltacht.  People in the Gaeltacht have the same aspirations and desires as people anywhere else in the country and, merely for love of the language, they will not stay in the Gaeltacht and spend their time producing the different commodities which are being produced there at relatively low rates of wages.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters of importance in the Bill to which I should like especially to draw the Minister's attention. I understand that there are a number of people who have been employed at Gaeltarra Éireann as manageresses in the different industries and who have had long service.  If these people had continued under the present system, I imagine that in time they would become entitled to superannuation benefits.  I notice that there is provision in the Bill for the establishment of a superannuation scheme by the board, but the board may feel that it has not had these people in its employment for sufficiently long to warrant their giving such people credit for upwards of 30 years' service.</P>
    <P>People who have been so long in the employment of the Gaeltacht industries and who have rendered such good service should be very fairly treated in the matter of pensions, and the establishment of this board should not prejudice their rights.  I would ask the Minister to say if he has in mind any direction to the board which would make it obligatory on them to give a pension to these people who would, if this board were not established, be entitled to superannuation.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should like to mention to the Minister <Col N="1218" /> at this stage.  The members of the board will be appointed by the Minister and may be removed by the Minister.  I do not know whether that is common form in the case of boards established by statute.  If it is, I suppose it is very difficult to pull against well-established precedent.  I do think that in the case of boards of this kind, where there may be varied views on the best way of tackling various problems, differences may arise.  Even sharp differences of opinion may arise between the Minister&mdash;not necessarily the present Minister, but the Minister for the Gaeltacht of the time&mdash;and the members of the board, which might necessitate the Minister's removing such persons from office.</P>
    <P>I should be happier if there were some provision that members of the board would be appointed by the Minister but removed by the Government. Two heads are wiser than one, and on that principle, I suggest that the several heads, combined in Government, might take a broader view, than the particular Minister at the time, on the occasion of a difference or a sharp conflict arising between a member of the board and the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the existing employees of Gaeltarra Éireann.  The board is entitled to stand in the shoes of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who at present employs these people, and to continue their contract of service.  I think it is common form in the case of the establishment of statutory boards that there is always a special safeguard for people who have been in the employment of a board by giving them the same conditions of service, or an undertaking that their conditions of service will not be worsened.</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister in mind that it would be his direction to the board, or that his view would be expressed to the board, that these people should not have their conditions of service worsened and that they would be removed or discharged from employment only for reasons similar to those for which they could be removed or discharged at the present time.  It is customary, as I say, to preserve existing staff and present rights on a change-over such as is taking place on <Col N="1219" /> the occasion of the establishment of this board.</P>
    <P>One other matter to which I should like to draw attention is that there has been some disquiet raised in the public mind by reason of questions asked in the Dáil concerning certain operations of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the operations of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I pass no comment whatever, and offer no judgment, on any matters discussed in the Dáil, but if there is any ground for the disquiet that has been created, I recommend to the Minister for his consideration that he might postpone the bringing into operation of this Bill, until such time as these matters have been cleared up.  There is a motion at present before Dáil Éireann calling for an inquiry into certain matters affecting the operation of Gaeltarra Éireann. I think it would get the board off to a bad start if it began its activities with a problem, or with the idea that it had a problem, on its hands.  The new board, starting off on such important business as this Bill contemplates, should not suffer from any handicap that could be avoided.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the advisability of postponing the nominations on the appointed day, as he is entitled, until such time as these matters have been cleared up one way or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make what comments I have to make on this Bill in English because I regard the Bill as of great importance to the non-Irish speaking people in the country.  It is of just as great importance as it is to the Irish speaking people of the Gaeltacht whom it directly concerns because, in my opinion, the co-operation and the goodwill of all the people are essential, if the work to which we are putting our hands is to be a success.  As Senators who have spoken previously have affirmed, the Gaeltacht is contracting rapidly.  The clock is approaching midnight and there is not much <Col N="1220" /> time left.  This Bill is undoubtedly a constructive effort to halt the decay of the Gaeltacht.  It is a dual purpose Bill; it seeks to keep our people at home by giving them work and seeks also to save and to strengthen the language in the few remaining areas in which it is still the natural tongue of the people.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that while the expansion of home and fireside industries is an ideal way to cater for remote places, an effort must be made, a determined effort, to establish industries with a good employment content, giving wages and a standard of life as near as possible to those which workers in cities are able to achieve.  The board which is being set up by this Bill to manage the transferred rural industries, and to provide new industries and productive schemes of employment in the Gaeltacht, is being set a very tough job.  As Senator Ó Cíosáin said, it is not going to solve every problem and it is not going to accomplish miracles, but it can do a tremendous job of work; but to do it, as I said, it will need all the goodwill, co-operation and all the money it can get.  If it gets these prerequisites, it can be a tremendous factor in saving the Gaeltacht, in strengthening the language and in expanding its influence throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to appeal to the Minister, to the Government, and to Senators that we should not be mean or cheeseparing in this effort.  If we are to help to enact this Bill into law, let us go into battle with the determination that we are putting our hands to something good for the country.  Let us have confidence in the worthiness of the cause and be prepared to provide whatever money is necessary to make the effort a success.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Bill is the key section and I would direct special attention to sub-sections (2) and (4) which I regard as the vital portions of it.  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board to encourage the preservation and extension of the use of Irish as a vernacular language in the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> Sub-section 4 (a) says that the powers conferred on the board are in addition to those mentioned already for the following purposes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) To expand and develop in the Gaeltacht the rural industries and any industry or productive scheme of employment provided by it under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the two important matters to which we have put our hands and I am convinced that the board which is being set up, will, by its good example and continuous use of the Irish language in all its activities, by determined efforts in co-operation with An Foras Tionscal, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Lands and any other Department which can help, undoubtedly be able to assist in convincing the people who still have an inferiority complex about the country and about the capability of the Irish language as a modern business vehicle, that it can measure up to all the requirements of a modern language.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the suggestion made by Senator O'Quigley who suggested one way in which the board could bring, not alone more money to the Gaeltacht, but expand the use and influence of the Irish language among people from other parts of the country.  I entirely agree with him in that because I believe that the board can spread the use of Irish outside the Gaeltacht by, as Senator O'Quigley suggested, encouraging the development of the area as a holiday ground thus giving help economically to the people and putting more money in circulation.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it might be of interest to note the forthcoming production of a Gaeltacht holiday guide in Irish by the combined efforts of Roinn na Gaeltachta, An Bord Fáilte and Comhdháil Naisiúnta na Gaeilge. It should result in a big increase in the number of language students and Irish-speaking visitors to the Gaeltacht.  In addition to that it is good to note also the efforts made by Comhaltas Uladh in the North which has also launched a big publicity drive to induce school children and adults to spend their holidays in the Donegal Gaeltacht <Col N="1222" /> where, fortunately, there are six or seven summer colleges available to them.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Uladh is doing effective work and has gone to the trouble of circulating some 10,000 copies of a brochure to all schools, colleges and Gaelic League branches in Ireland and in many parts of Britain endeavouring to attract students, young and old, to the Donegal Gaeltacht.  This is a trend which I hope the board will do everything possible to encourage.  I think the co-operation of the new board will also be essential to make this idea a success because if they can persuade the people of the Gaeltacht who have suitable accommodation to accept holiday visitors of this type&mdash;and in order to do so they must, of course, fill in a form stating the accommodation they have available&mdash;they will be doing a very good job towards helping themselves.</P>
    <P>In connection with Section 5 I should like to emphasise in regard to the constitution of the board that it is, in my opinion, of vital importance that the members to be appointed should know the Gaeltacht and should be familiar with its problems and difficulties. Above all, they should have business experience and I hope some knowledge of export trends and marketing.  I take it they will work in close harmony with the other State bodies I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 7 also interests me because it deals with the superannuation scheme for board members and I am a little puzzled on one point in regard to that.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten me as to the definition of &ldquo;whole time members of the board&rdquo; who qualify for allowances, pension or gratuities on retirement.</P>
    <P>In Section 15, I welcome sub-section (2) in so far as it ensures the selection of competent Irish speakers as officers and employees of the board, but I am a little worried by the reservation relating to persons covered by Section 22.  I should like to know more about this exempted class and also about the persons who on the establishment day are carrying out duties in relation to the rural industries.  In other words, I want to know how many Irish speakers are involved and is there any danger <Col N="1223" /> of the new board being saddled with a substantial English-speaking group?</P>
    <P>Section 32 is a valuable part of the Bill because it gives the Dáil and Seanad information as to what will happen under the jurisdiction of the board in regard to the annual report. When that report is being prepared, I hope that the Minister will insist on a comprehensive statement about the steps taken by the board during the year to give effect to sub-section (2) of the section I have mentioned, Section 4, because that is of vital importance in the fulfilment of one of the main objectives of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel the rural industries which are being transferred to the board provide a good foundation on which to build and expand but I hope to see a big increase in the 1,200 or 1,400 people who are directly and indirectly employed and a great expansion in the export trade in their products.</P>
    <P>One matter to which both the Minister and the board should give consideration is provision for modern display and advertising in connection with these products.  Practically every large-scale manufacturer has proper showroom accommodation for his products. The only large-scale manufacturer that I know of who has no proper accommodation or showroom for products is Gaeltarra Éireann. Gaeltarra Éireann is located in a disused barracks.  It is an old building, completely unsuitable for displaying the type of products produced by our rural industries&mdash;tweed, linen, knitwear&mdash;and foreign buyers of these goods are at a disadvantage because of the lack of suitable display accommodation.  The proposed new board will have to give early and serious consideration to the need for adequate display space.  It may be essential from that point of view to consider also the possibility of either reconstructing this old building or getting a new building more suitable for the purpose we have in mind.</P>
    <P>Irish tweeds, especially Donegal tweeds, have made tremendous progress in the last ten or 12 years in colour, in design, in variety and in <Col N="1224" /> weight.  The sales of these cloths could be doubled or trebled with the help of some financial backing from the board.  According to the experts, our tweeds carry a greater variety of design, colour and weight than Scottish tweeds.  Yet, Scottish export sales from the statistics given are about ten times greater than ours.  We could do with something like the Harris Association in Scotland; Irish manufacturers might give some consideration to that.</P>
    <P>The Harris Association is based on a contribution by the manufacturers of 2d. per yard on production and the money is used to advertise Harris tweeds.  It is understandable that they are thereby enabled to take advertising space to a much greater extent than we are when one remembers that that 2d. per yard on production enables the Harris Association to spend over £100,000 in advertising.  If the board which we are setting up allocates a reasonable amount of money for market research in Western Europe, Scandinavia and the Middle East, that expenditure will pay handsome dividends in the space of a few years.</P>
    <P>I have referred to tweeds and I am glad to note that the Irish Hand-weavers' Association is directly represented this week at the Congressional Committee inquiry into the operation of the quota provision which has seriously hampered and restricted the import of Irish tweeds into the U.S.A. I hope, as does every Senator, that our American friends in the Government and in the trade unions will appreciate that the handwoven tweed which we export to the United States should not be classed with machine cloth under their import regulations. I sincerely trust that the efforts of our representatives from Córas Tráchtála and the Handweavers' Association will result in an understanding by both the American Government and the trade unions that, even if they allow our handwoven tweeds into the United States, imports will represent only a drop in the ocean as compared with overall American textile production.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the French market is also serious and we <Col N="1225" /> hope that the efforts of the French Government to remedy their situation at the moment will be successful and that France will quickly overcome her internal difficulties.  The French market is a big market.  It is a tweed-conscious market.  It was developing very rapidly and it promised to be very good.  I hope the efforts made to restore it will meet with success in the very near future. The new board should not be disheartened by temporary set-backs of this kind because our tweed exports are quality goods exports and there are other markets to be won where quality goods are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to one Irish citizen who has done more as a trail-blazer for Irish goods in the markets of the world than all the Government agents put together.  As a result of the efforts made, Irish tweed, Irish linen, Irish lace and Irish crochet are now discussed and bought in places that never dreamt of looking at Irish products not so very long ago.  I refer to Miss Sybil Connolly.  When the board gets an opportunity, I hope it will enlist the services of persons of her calibre and intelligence to push the products which the board will have to market.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  I join with Senator Kissane and others in congratulating him on the inauguration of Scéim na Muc and I believe that, in due course, Scéim na Muc will take its place side by side with Scéim na Tithe Gloinne as one of the most valuable contributions to the economic improvement of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Fé mar dúirt mé i dtosach cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus molaim an tAire mar gheall ar é a thabhairt isteach agus mar gheall ar an méid oibre a rinne sé.  Bille tábhactach an Bille seo agus tá sé soiléir do chách go dtugann an Bille cuidiú mór don Ghaeltacht.  Beidh fáilte ag muintir na Gaeltachta roimhe fósta.  Táim lánchinnte gur féidir an Ghaeltacht a shábhail fós agus an teanga a choimeád beo.  Níl mé in aon amhras faoi sin. Obair an-riachtanach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta atá anseo, agus cuideoidh sé le labhairt na teangan, an teanga dhúchais.  Is é sin príomh-ghnó an <Col N="1226" /> Oireachtas, príomh-ghno an Aire, agus príomh-ghnó an bhoird nua.  Tá dualgas orainn go léir agus má táimid dáiriribh faoi chás na Gaeilge caithfimíd leis an obair.  Do réir mo thuairimse is é seo an iarracht is éifeachtaí fós do rinneadh chun leas na Gaeltachta. Mar gheall ar sin, cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill from several points of view, principally because it seems to me to be a Bill which aims at giving practical aid to the people of the Gaeltacht, rather than being a mere expression of praise, pious hopes and more talk about the preservation of the language.  It should be quite obvious that you cannot preserve the language if the people are gone and the position in the Gaeltacht to-day is that the people are going very fast. The fact that they are good Irish speakers does not in any way prevent them from emigrating from this country at a rate which ought to frighten us.  I believe that this type of measure, with its emphasis on the economics of life in the Gaeltacht, is the sensible way to enable the people in the Gaeltacht to remain there and preserve their self-respect.  They do not want hand-outs, Government doles and grants because they can speak Irish, nor do they merely want to live on tourists and students going to the Gaeltacht.  They would far rather be given a chance to earn their own living, on their own land, through productive industries such as are envisaged by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do notice that in sub-section (2) of Section 4 it is felt necessary to place the first emphasis in setting out the objects of the board, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board to encourage the preservation and extension of the use of Irish as a vernacular language in the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that a case can be made for that. In fact, far more of a case can be made for the preservation of the language where it is the vernacular than can be made for what I regard as the misguided notion that it can eventually become the vernacular of the whole <Col N="1227" /> country again.  While it is obvious that it is by measures such as this that you can encourage the preservation of the language where it is still spoken naturally, nevertheless, I think we ought to put ourselves on guard lest the powers given to this board be interpreted as giving them power, under that very prominently placed sub-section, to give jobs to Irish speakers.  I do not think anybody, if they reflect on it, thinks of this Bill as being merely to give jobs to Irish speakers.  What it wants to do is to create productive jobs, to allow the people in the Gaeltacht to hold their heads up and to stand on their own feet in their own land.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it necessarily follows that the people who are to help them to do this, in organising industries, in organising marketing and production and so on, need necessarily themselves be fluent Irish speakers, or even, I should say, Irish speakers at all.  The point I want to establish is that the main objective is to get going and extend industries in the Gaeltacht which will allow the people there to live by productive work.  If we are to have a stupid, narrow idea in recruiting people to work for the promotion and development of these industries, and exclude people because of their lack of knowledge of the language alone, then I think we shall be acting against the main purposes of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of Miss Sybil Connolly.  I do not know what her knowledge of Irish is&mdash;it may be first class&mdash;but in deciding upon somebody who might give advice and help for the marketing of Irish products, if the name of Sybil Connolly were to be mentioned I do not think it would be relevant to ask her can she speak Irish.  It is quite obvious that where skill, ability and knowledge ought to be put in the scale, the abilities of such a person ought to be recruited for these industries and for this board, quite irrespective of whether she herself, or such a person, has a working knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Senator Mullins said it would be essential for people working <Col N="1228" /> under this board to &ldquo;know the Gaeltacht well&rdquo;.  Within certain limits that is true, but only within certain limits.  I could imagine people of ability, who could give a very real contribution to developing the kind of marketing and production that is envisaged, who might in fact not have any knowledge of the Gaeltacht.  I make these statements in order that we may guard ourselves against too narrow an interpretation of the qualifications we are seeking in choosing people to help in developing industries in these areas.  What we really want are people of imagination, people of ability, with knowledge of things outside the Gaeltacht, and, above all, people who are disinterested&mdash;people who are not in it for what they can get out of it.  The emphasis is on economics, giving the people of the Gaeltacht a chance to help themselves, and I am glad to note that this is a community effort.  This is a State effort.  It is a State appointed board, a State-sponsored undertaking.</P>
    <P>Here at least we are not misled by the stupid notion that the State can never do anything good, and that if the State organises anything, we are well on the road to Communism.  The State should be quite unashamed to put the strength of the community at the disposal of the individual.  That is precisely what is being done under this Bill&mdash;State enterprise, State initiative &mdash;and why not?  Why have we not a bit more of it?</P>
    <P>I notice that Section 6 refers to remuneration and expenses of members of the board.  It is very discreet; it does not say what they are likely to get.  I do not know if they are likely to get very much money or not.  I should like to ask the Minister what order of magnitude he has in mind for these fees?  While I recognise the managing director in such a job should be paid, and well paid, the question presents itself as to whether it is always necessary in this country to pay members of boards like this, boards which are set up for the community good.  I had occasion previously in the Seanad to refer to the two main voluntary health insurance schemes in Britain operated by the Western Providence and British United Providence Associations which are run by boards, <Col N="1229" /> the membership of which comprise highly skilled persons who receive no remuneration whatsoever, who give their services free in a service benefiting the community.  If that concept of public service is quite &ldquo;un-Irish&rdquo; I should be surprised to hear it.</P>
    <P>I should not be surprised if we got better service from a board like this, if the work were voluntary, and if it were not to be &ldquo;a job for somebody.&rdquo; All too often we find on boards like this friends of influential people who attend meetings, but who, in fact, do not pull their weight, owing to the fact that their being on the boards is due to their connections and not to their skill.  I feel that the number of such people appointed to such boards would tend to be smaller if they were not paid.  Why must Irish men and women always be paid for work such as this, to which we in the Seanad are all prepared to pay lip-service as work of national importance, but for which we have to get a wage?</P>
    <P>In asking the Minister what kind of rate of remuneration he has in mind, I would ask him to relate it to the sort of work and times of attendance expected of the ordinary members of the board.  I am not speaking about the managing director.  In other words, will it be a nominal fee, related to a not very onerous attendance at board meetings, or will it be a fairly fat salary related to quite a considerable amount of real work done by members of the board?</P>
    <P>I should like to come to another point in Section 4, sub-section (4) paragraph (a), which I am glad to see.  It provides that the board shall have power, not merely to expand and develop rural industries, but also any industry or &ldquo;productive scheme of employment.&rdquo;  We should welcome the fact that this Bill gives power to the board to encourage the starting, not merely of industries, but any productive scheme of employment.  I welcome this paragraph because of its wideness, and the power it confers to encourage a wide variety of practical ways in which the people of the Gaeltacht may be able to earn a decent living for themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> We hear a great deal about the development of our seaweed industry. Our west coast is almost entirely surrounded by it.  I am aware there are technical difficulties about depth, about the shelving of the sea bottom, and about the actual comparatively narrow strip under water in which certain of the valuable seaweeds grow, but I am distressed to notice that even in some of these well-developed seaweed industries in the West of Ireland the major benefit goes outside the country. All the sweat and toil, the heavy manual labour, the risky hard work in getting and collecting the seaweed, drying, handling, stacking and transporting is done on the west coast&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite in order for the Senator to refer to it, but I am afraid it is not something that can be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall conclude on this point by suggesting that it is a pity that the final processing and marketing of our seaweed have to be done in Glasgow.  I have the greatest admiration for Glasgow, but I feel that the Gaeltacht is the place where the final processing should be done.  We should not say that the west coast is too poverty stricken and that we have not got the laboratories there to do that kind of thing.  I feel we ought to do the processing, and I would suggest that, under this Bill, something more than the manual labour of collecting the seaweed might be done by the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to develop it, but the <Col N="1231" /> same idea applies to our fisheries and fishing industry.  It is not lack of skill that prevents the fishermen on the west coast from making a living; it is lack of capital, equipment, boats and gear, and also the marketing process.  It is a heartbreaking thing to see in the markets of Paris, for instance, Irish shellfish selling at enormous prices when you know that the home fishermen, who collect the lobsters, crayfish and other shellfish, have been getting a very minimal price for them.  There are far too many middlemen&mdash;not merely in this country but outside it too&mdash; attached to our fishing, and our lobster fishing in particular.  I am aware that &ldquo;gombeen&rdquo; is a good Irish word.  It is one of the words&mdash;at any rate in its normal connotation&mdash;that ought to be allowed to have only a minimal application in the marketing of the products of the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Anybody studying the question of lobster fishing and marketing will realise that the people who are making the big money are the middlemen, the dealers, not the primary producers.  I have seen in this House fishermen from the Maharees coming up here for the purpose of trying to get a grant in order to buy a boat for themselves. They never succeeded, of course, and most of them have emigrated long since.  That is the kind of heartbreaking situation which many of the fishermen on the west coast are up against. I feel that we do not do sufficient for them, and I hope that the powers under this Bill will be used to help them in these matters.</P>
    <P>The same applies to a number of other things, the production and marketing of early vegetables for instance, which can be done in quite a number of our west coast Gaeltacht areas.  I do not want to stress particular details. I want to make the point, however, that I hope this phrase, enabling the board to expand and develop in the Gaeltacht any productive scheme of employment, will be taken to have a very wide connotation.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn for a moment now to Section 8, which enables the Minister to remove members of the board.  It just says &ldquo;The Minister may <Col N="1232" /> at any time remove a member of the board from office&rdquo;.  I do not think that is a good provision.  It gives the Minister very arbitrary powers, and I hope the present Minister will forgive me if I suggest that some Ministers might remove the best member of the board under such a section, if he did not happen to be playing in with the particular policy of the Minister of the time.  I do not think it is right to give unqualified authority to the Minister to remove any member of the board at any time with no right of appeal, with no questions asked, and with no necessity to give any explanation.</P>
    <P>I made the same point in relation to the Prices Advisory Committees which we set up, under the Prices Bill, and I asked for an insertion in that Bill&mdash;as I propose to ask in this Bill&mdash;that the Minister should not have this power to act except on the recommendation of the committee and, here, on the recommendation of the board.  I was told, in relation to the Prices Bill, that this would be an appalling thing, that you could not possibly tie the Minister only to remove people when the committee recommended him to do so.  Consequently, I was amused when my attention was drawn by a fellow Senator to the fact that in the Agricultural Institute Bill just such a clause is inserted in the Schedule: &ldquo;The Government may at any time, on the advice of the council, remove an ordinary member of the council from office.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the Minister might well take good example from his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, in this respect.  I do not think it is a good thing for him to ask for, or for him to be given such unrestricted power in relation to the removal from office of members of the board.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would conclude by saying that what seems to me good in this Bill is the fact that it bases help for the Gaeltacht on local skills&mdash;local skills which admittedly need to be developed and to be given an outlet&mdash;for which I would hope, and I express the hope publicly, that a substantial portion of the final retail price will be paid to the primary producer, the worker in the Gaeltacht.  I should not like to think of this as forming a scheme whereby <Col N="1233" /> the people of the Gaeltacht get a little bit, but the middleman and others right down to the retailer get a far bigger whack than the primary producers in the Gaeltacht for whom this Bill is intended.  I would say furthermore: Let us not be afraid to spend money, but let us not lose sight of the primary aim which is to enable the people of the Gaeltacht to develop their own skills and to market the product of those skills, in a sound and, for them, lucrative market, which will guarantee that a large proportion of the value of what is produced by them will in fact be paid to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the previous speakers in welcoming this Bill as a practical approach to the problems of the Gaeltacht areas.  It is generally agreed that Gaeltarra Éireann as at present constituted is a rather cumbersome and unsatisfactory body.  That is not to say that it has been entirely unsatisfactory.  It has achieved a great deal in its time, but it is apparent that it is very restricted in its activities and this new board could be a great improvement on the present body.  It is possible that the restrictions on Gaeltarra Éireann at present may have been responsible for some of the very low piece rates which were paid to those who worked on some of the industries in the past.  When the new board gets into action and has had time to bring about more efficiency in some of those industries and, as a consequence, more profits, I hope they will not only be able to improve the conditions of those working for the board but to give more employment and pay more and better piece-rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important first step the Minister will have to take is to appoint this board.  I am sure he is aware that it is essential that he should appoint persons who will tackle the problems in an imaginative way.  He could not do worse than to appoint persons who feel it is their duty merely to carry on, with minor administrative adjustments.  This board has formidable and urgent problems to tackle.  To put it simply, there is the problem of transforming the depressed area extending nearly all along the west coast into a prosperous area.  They cannot do that merely by <Col N="1234" /> making small adjustments in what has been done up to now.  They must show imagination; they must not only produce new ideas themselves but they must receive any suggestions they get in the way of new ideas, new schemes or new industries.  No matter how startling they may appear at first sight, they should examine them and see whether anything may be made of them.</P>
    <P>There are many economic and other clichés about the Gaeltacht areas as to what can be done, cannot be done or should be done.  It is essential that the board accept none of these clichés. They should get down to the fundamentals and examine everything from its fundamental aspects, to see whether what has been held to be the truth, to be the facts about the Gaeltacht, is the truth, or whether they cannot be approached in an entirely new way.</P>
    <P>In five years' time, when the board looks back on its record and its achievements, I hope they will have on record a note of several failures in the things they have tried to do during those years, because I should like them to try things which will not necessarily be successful but which have some hope of success.  It would be much better for the board in five years' time to look back on 100 successful schemes and ten failures than look back on 50 successful schemes and no failures. They must experiment and take risks and, above all, try out new ideas, new schemes and new industries, if they are to turn this depressed area into a prosperous one.</P>
    <P>In referring to Gaeltacht problems in the past, the disadvantages have always been stressed and the advantages ignored.  People interested in setting up industries there talk of the difficulties of power and transport and of subsidiary services of various kinds. That attitude is largely a carry-over from 50 years ago, when it was assumed in the coal and steel area that no industry could be successful, unless it were near a coal-field and near steel and commodities of that kind.  Things have changed a great deal since then. Any part of the Gaeltacht now can get first-class power from the E.S.B., rural <Col N="1235" /> electrification having reached most parts of the area.  Most factories at the moment are run almost entirely on electricity.  From that point of view, there is no disadvantage there as compared with anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The same applies, although possibly to a lesser extent, in the case of transport. There may be some difficulty in the case of goods of a heavy nature, in getting raw materials to the Gaeltacht and getting the finished goods away.  On the other hand, the western parts of Ireland are as well served with good ports as any other part.  There are many products of a lighter nature which can be sent to places abroad by air. In that respect, Shannon is very convenient to most parts of the West.  A very good example of what can be done in that respect is the example of the export trade in lobsters to Paris, which were sent by air and which formed a very successful type of export.  As I have said, the disadvantages are stressed but they are not really as severe as they appear at first sight.</P>
    <P>One of the tasks which the board will have to undertake is to examine and emphasise the advantages which are present in the Gaeltacht areas.  There has been reference here to such things as fish and seaweed, both of which are of immense potential wealth; and the possible development in these cases is immense.  In addition, there is a temperate climate in the western area which is very suitable for growing certain kinds of flowers, vegetables and so on, and which is not found elsewhere in the country.  In addition, there is plenty of labour with a very high level of intelligence available, which is something that any industrialist will look for and be very glad to get.  Then there is the possibility of minerals of various kinds which are awaiting development. I do not want to go into a list of these but I do say that there are many, many advantages in these areas which, if they are concentrated upon by the board, will make it possible to achieve great development of industry, agricultural schemes and various other schemes which will bring prosperity to the areas.</P>
    <P>Part of the job of the board will be, <Col N="1236" /> not only to examine these potential advantages and to note them down for their own benefit, but to publicise these advantages, to sell the Gaeltacht areas, as it were, to those who might be in a position to contribute to the prosperity of the areas, to sell these advantages to industrialists and others who might establish industries there or develop schemes of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I presume the board will not have much to do with the tourist industry but, in so far as they have anything to do with it or can influence Bord Fáilte, they should make an effort to develop the tourist industry by providing more accommodation in these areas.  There are areas such as Connemara, which is one of the most beautiful places in the world, a place which lacks nothing so far as the tourist is concerned, except accommodation.  The provision of accommodation is very important, not only from the point of view of encouraging the people in the remainder of the country to visit these areas, learn the language and to have first-hand contact with the language, and so on, but from the point of view of getting people from abroad to visit these areas, people who at a later stage might contribute something towards the industry of the West.</P>
    <P>Any intelligent person who goes to the West of Ireland, sees the countryside and realises the various potentials that need development there is likely, if he is in a position to do so, to return, not merely as a tourist but as a person who is anxious and willing to play a part in developing the area.  The provision of accommodation with a view to the development of the tourist industry is important from two points of view.</P>
    <P>Possibly a thing that is more relevant to the work of the board is the manufacture of souvenirs for tourists.  We ought to be able to compete with Japan in the manufacture of Irish souvenirs and we can do so with comparatively little effort because the basis of that industry is already there.  There are many things of a very attractive nature made and of a type that appeals very much to tourists but we need far more of them and in some cases we need to have them produced at a more competitive <Col N="1237" /> price.  The Aran crios and various things like that are immensely attractive and, if developed, would fill the need of which I speak.</P>
    <P>In that regard I should like to advert to the references which have been made to Miss Sybil Connolly, who took products of this country which were relatively unknown and made them world famous.  There is a great lesson to be learned from what happened in her case because she did little or nothing to improve the product; she merely sold it, incorporated it in garments, publicised it and, by so doing, managed to sell hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of products which had been there all the time but which up to then it was extremely difficult to sell.  In regard to souvenirs, they are made in small quantities; they are very good in many cases but we need a campaign to publicise them and to sell them in a wider circle.</P>
    <P>I wish the board every success in their efforts.  They should have, and need have, no inhibitions in the manner in which they tackle this problem.  They will not be restricted by red tape or by precedents because they will be a completely new board and they will have in the present Minister a man who will encourage them to approach things in a new and imaginative way.  They will have a splendid opportunity of bringing new life to the western areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill, which was prepared and framed by the previous Government and there are very little changes in it.  As a matter of fact, the promise to set up a board was first mentioned by the exTaoiseach, Deputy John Costello, in a speech in October, 1956.</P>
      <P>It is a very good idea to set up a board, especially if it is to be an independent board, divorced from Party politics.  I hope the board will be as successful in dealing with the problems it has to face as the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna have been in dealing with the problems that confronted them 20 to 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people in this country, even people who are enthusiastic about the Irish language, who are not satisfied with the work that has <Col N="1238" /> already been done and many people who claim that the taxpayers have not got value for the money that has been spent in the past.  There are many people who are devoted to the Irish language who claim that the Irish language is dying fast and that the Gaeltacht is dwindling.  Those facts cannot be denied.  That is the position despite all the millions of pounds that have been spent on the Irish language and on the Gaeltacht over the past 30 to 40 years.</P>
    <P>At the present time, as regards the Irish language and the nation, we are at the crossroads and it is time that we examined the position and discovered where we intend to go in future, review what has happened in the past and ask ourselves if it has been a success or a failure and, if we think that certain things have failed in the past, plan for the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the board, I agree with Senator Mullins that there should be a certain number of members who know something about the Gaeltacht. There should also be men on the board with business experience, as he stated, men who know about export markets and market research.  Above all, there should be on the board men of ability, integrity and independence, men who will be prepared, no matter what Government is in power, to make decisions and, if they consider that a thing is right, to go ahead and do what they think is right and put their policy and their programme into operation.</P>
    <P>This board also should devote attention to the home market and try to initiate a &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign to encourage people in this country to buy materials and goods that have been made in the Gaeltacht.  If one goes into shops in Dublin, one sees Christmas presents and toys bearing the inscription &ldquo;Déanta in Japan.&rdquo;  That is deplorable in a country like this.  This board should set out immediately to remedy that situation because all these things can be made in Ireland and could easily be made in the Gaeltacht. The board should also try to get Irish people, especially the ladies, more interested in wearing Irish tweeds and Irish woollens.  That would develop the home market, would give much-needed <Col N="1239" /> employment and keep many people from emigrating from the West of Ireland.  We should initiate a campaign to get more of our own people to spend their holidays in the Gaeltacht or else at home in Ireland.  They should do that if they are nationally-minded.  In the past, people in this country were prepared to lay down their lives for freedom.  Surely it is not too much to ask them to put their own country first now.</P>
    <P>It is considered that, at the present time, we are going through an economic crisis.  If our people are really Irish, they should&mdash;at least for the duration of the economic crisis&mdash;spend their holidays in Ireland instead of going off to Paris, London, the Channel Islands, and so on.  A board of the kind which is contemplated could initiate a campaign to try to get more of our people to spend their holidays perhaps in the Gaeltacht or, if not there, at least at home in Ireland.  The last speaker mentioned Connemara. Certainly, it can hold its own with any place either on the Continent or in any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>I stated before that the restoration of the Irish language and the preservation of the Gaeltacht should be taken out of the orbit of Party politics. For too long, the Irish language has been the plaything of Party politics. Undoubtedly, the people in the Gaeltacht have been fooled and disillusioned by promises and plans which were much talked of in the past. I do not want to become political in my remarks but I cannot help mentioning that I recall hearing the present Taoiseach say at Mullingar in 1932 that they, and they alone, had a plan to restore the Irish language.  I hope the same fate does not befall this present project as has befallen the plan which he mentioned on that same day at Mullingar to end the Partition of our country.</P>

Tá an Bille seo tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht ar an ábhar go gcuirfidh sé deis cheart ar fáil chun na tionscail traidisiúnta sa Ghaeltacht a chur ar a mbonna i gceart, agus a leathnú amach.  Is iad na tionscail traidisiúnta, mar atá, tionscal an bréidín tionscal na bróidnéireachta agus tionscal na láimhchniotála, a rinne an dul chun cinn is mo go nuige seo agus, mar sin, is féidir a rá go bhfuil bunús maith ann le leathnú a dhéanamh.  Feileann na tionscail seo go maith do chúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Beidh mé ag súil leis, mar sin, go dtabharfaidh an bord nua aire speisialta do na tionscail traidisiúnta seo.</P>

Na fir atá ag obair go páirt-aimsireach ina dtithe féin, is fíodóirí iad agus, le blianta beaga anuas, tá obair lán-aimsireach ar fáil acu.  Tá an chuid is mó de na fir ins na tionscail fostaithe i dtionscal an bhréidín.  Mná ar fad beagnach a bhíonn ag obair sa tionscal cniotála agus bróidnéireachta.

    <P>Senator McGuire stated that the new board should not compete with private enterprise operating in Gaeltacht districts but should work in harmony with them.  He advises the board to concentrate on the existing traditional industries that are there.  He also referred to the importance of marketing. I could not agree more with the views expressed by Senator McGuire.  The time has come when industrialists in this country must stop watching one another with a jealous eye and must instead direct their energies and attentions to their competitors in the export market, as our economic survival depends on it.  There is great room for co-operation in industry, particularly in endeavouring to capture the export market which Senator McGuire talked about.  It may be suitable, as was suggested by Senator Ó Maoláin, to organise as has been done in Scotland, that is, that all industrialists, including Gaeltarra Éireann, would, with this new board, join together, advertise and co-operate in selling a national product which has now become known the world over but which has not been pushed sufficiently or, in my view, properly marketed.  There is very great scope for improvement in this field.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tweed industry, <Col N="1242" /> I feel that great headway can be made and that there is plenty of room for expansion, particularly for exports. That industry has developed in a very substantial way in recent times.  The skills here are as good as, if not better than, those in any other part of the world.  The one aspect in which I think we have been sadly lacking&mdash;and to which Senator McGuire and others referred&mdash;is the lack of proper marketing facilities, the lack of proper publicity directed in the right quarters.  I hope the techniques now so essential in these modern competitive days will be studied and that the new board, in conjunction with all our exporters, will endeavour to concentrate upon this field.</P>
    <P>Some Senators said that it was one thing to manufacture goods but another matter to sell them.  If we do not explore our markets and publicise our goods where there is a hope of selling them and market them in the proper way, then we will not succeed in the tremendous battle that is now opening on all fronts and which will intensify, if and when the new European Free Market develops.  It is true that we have suffered in this country as a result of the restrictions imposed on the export of tweeds to the American market.  I also join with the Senators who wished our representatives well in Washington who are at the moment endeavouring to have this matter righted. It is only right to point out, however, that the American restrictions are not the be-all and the end-all of our export trade in tweeds.  There are, in fact, very substantial export markets in many other countries all over the world, outside the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley raised a couple of matters to which I must refer.  One was the question of the manageresses who had given very long service with Gaeltarra Éireann, as they now are. He expressed certain fears about them. I would refer Senators to a statement I made in the Dáil on the Report Stage of this Bill when I indicated that provision was being made to bring these people in under the pension scheme to be provided under this Bill. <Col N="1243" /> Many of these were pioneers in introducing the embroidery, the lace and knitting industries to different parts of the Gaeltacht.  I gave an indication to the other House as to the provisions that were being made for them.  That deals, I think, with the first point raised by Senator O'Quigley.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the wages paid in some of the rural industries.  I want to say here and now that there has been a tremendous amount of misrepresentation about that very question.  I should like to point out that the wage rates paid in rural industries, under Gaeltarra Éireann as it has existed and as it exists at present, are fixed either through negotiation and agreement with the trade unions concerned or on the same basis as the rates paid in similar industries by private employers.</P>
    <P>What I understand happened was that there was a series of questions in the Dáil which covered every conceivable type of employee in Gaeltarra Éireann and some figures were given in respect of what I would call home work done by girls or women in their own homes, whenever they were free. Some calculations were made and it was suggested that all the people working under Gaeltarra Éireann earned some extraordinary rate like 6d. an hour or some figure of that kind. The fact is that these figures, which were misrepresented, applied only to people who have a loose arrangement with Gaeltarra Éireann to get possibly the thread and in their own spare time at home&mdash;it is largely more a hobby for them than a method of occupation or employment&mdash;to produce certain articles.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that the money earned by a large number of workers in so far as Gaeltarra Éireann are concerned is quite good, particularly in the factories.  We have some weavers in our factories in Kilcar in Donegal earning from £10 to £15 a week steadily and in very good employment. I should be very happy, indeed, if the new board were able to expand and double or treble the number who will find similar employment and similar rates.</P>
    <P>Some apprehension has been expressed <Col N="1244" /> about the powers taken by me in the Bill, particularly the power to dismiss members of the board.  Some say that the power should be reserved to the Government, while others have said that it should be left to the board itself.  This is no new provision in legislation passing through the Oireachtas and it is already enshrined in various Acts, including the legislation setting up An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and other State organisations.  From a practical point of view, it does not matter whether the power is solely in the hands of the Minister concerned or in the hands of the Government.  There is no Minister for the Gaeltacht who would sack a board of this kind without going to the Government first with the matter; on the other hand, there is no Government which would proceed on its own to discharge the members of a board without being guided solely or mainly by the advice of the Minister in charge of the Department concerned.  Therefore, from a practical point of view, those who have expressed apprehension in this matter should realise that there is no great difference.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary to have this power, again from a practical point of view.  I am satisfied that neither I nor any other Minister would exercise it to remove a member, or even the whole board, without very grave reason.  In addition, there is always the protection under our democracy, if wrong steps were taken by myself or any future Minister in this connection, that the question can be raised in Parliament. I am quite satisfied that if I dismissed some member of this board for no good reason, the ink would not be dry on my Order before there would be a motion put down to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>I have not become used to this House yet.  I have no doubt, from the Senators whom I have heard, that they would not be very backward in coming forward, if something like this were done by some Minister, if they did not think his action justified. I was very interested in the suggestions <Col N="1245" /> of Senator Sheehy Skeffington and various other Senators as to what the composition of the new board should be and as to the type of people I should try to get to serve on it.  This is a matter in respect of which I have received a tremendous amount of advice, not alone in this House but from hundreds of correspondents.</P>
      <P>While I should be very glad to try to find the type of personnel suggested by the different Senators, some experts on tweed manufacture, some enthusiasts for the Irish language, some experts on export marketing, some experts on export sales, and to combine with them people with the expert knowledge of a Miss Sybil Connolly, I am afraid that if I tried to meet the wishes of the people who have spoken and written to me, to get a board with all the different virtues that have been expressed, I would not get them in this country, or in England, or in the United States of America.  Other space exploration is just beginning and possibly there might be some people there about whom we do not know yet.</P>
      <P>All I can do is try and get the most suitable people.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggested that I should try to get people to serve on the board without remuneration.  In my view, it will be difficult to get people with the required qualifications who would be prepared to sacrifice the time from their private interests to give their experience and training to such an important board as this.  I do not doubt that many men of this kind would be prepared to make the necessary sacrifices in the national interest, but I think it would be unfair not to provide something for them, some form of remuneration.  Indeed I am quite satisfied that the remuneration that will be approved by the Minister for Finance in respect of the part-time members of this board will not compensate them at all for the time and the effort they will have to put into the work this board will have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a fair idea myself of what this board will be up against.  In my view, they will have on hands one of the toughest jobs that have ever been handed to any board in this country to date.  If they are to succeed in the <Col N="1246" /> tasks before them, we must try, as I have said, to get the best people we can to take on the work.  Many suggestions have been made about different matters to be undertaken by this board.  What I am getting under this Bill is an organisation that will be there to function and to make the best use possible of the raw materials in the Gaeltacht.  The very first duty of that organisation will be to take over a business which is worth £500,000 a year at the moment.  It is a very onerous and responsible task.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to what might be done in regard to the development of seaweed utilisation.  There is an organisation&mdash;in fact I would call it a company&mdash;Arramara Teoranta &mdash;of which I, as Minister for the Gaeltacht, am a member.  That company is registered under the Companies Acts and is outside the scope of the Bill.  It is in their factory that searods are processed.  I can assure Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the future of Alginate Industries is under active consideration at the moment.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise is also interested in this question.  As Senators will appreciate, and as has been mentioned here, a State&mdash;sponsored body of this kind must be very careful to avoid treading on the toes of private enterprise. If that occurred, we would have motions both here and in the other House.  Again, I should like to assure Senators that the possibility of developing the seaweed industry is not being neglected.</P>
    <P>Many other matters have been advocated here, including the provision of better tourist facilities in the Gaeltacht. Again, I want to emphasise that I am dealing only with industrial matters under this Bill, but that these other matters are ever present to my mind.  I have a duty as Minister for the Gaeltacht to consider every aspect of the economy of the people in the Gaeltacht as well as the question of their language.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin mentioned Section 15 and asked a question about the number of Irish speakers from other organisations who might be handed over to the board.  I should like to <Col N="1247" /> tell him that the number of non-Irish speakers employed by Gaeltarra Éireann is very small; my information is that there are only a half dozen so employed, all of them technicians.  The great majority of the existing staff are all competent Irish speakers.  The fears expressed by the Senator in that regard are consequently not well founded.  Of course, in work related to the manufacture of tweed, we have had to bring in people with very specialised knowledge of tweed production, tweed colouring and so forth.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán eile le rá agam ar an mBille seo.

      <P>I take it that there will be two whole-time members of the board and that they will be reasonably remunerated, but I want to suggest that the part-time members of the board should be adequately remunerated. I notice that in regard to many of these boards the remuneration is still the same or nearly the same as it was pre-war.  I suggest that it would be desirable that, in view of the commercial nature of the activities in which these members will be engaged, they should be paid adequate remuneration.  It is time we adjusted ourselves to what is happening to the value of money.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he has in mind some order of magnitude in relation to the remuneration for the part-time members of the board?  I made the point before that, while generous remuneration is justifiable for the managing director, it should be possible to have public-spirited people who would be prepared, as the Minister himself said, to make certain sacrifices, if necessary, for the good of the community.  I feel that an exaggerated remuneration would militate against the recruiting of the type of member we want on the board, a member who is prepared to give disinterested service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not yet been fixed what the remuneration will be, either for the managing director or for the part-time members of the board.  That cannot be fixed until this legislation has passed through the House, and it will be fixed in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, I cannot express any view at the moment, except that part-time members of boards that I know of often have to make sacrifices, even with the small fees they are paid.  I am sure that Senators, like everybody else, know <Col N="1249" /> that when remuneration is fixed by the Department of Finance, it will not be outlandish.  From my short experience as a Minister, I can assure the House that the Department of Finance does not throw money around.</P>
      <P>I shall certainly bear in mind, when I come to deal with this matter, what Senator O'Donovan has said.  However, any Senator who thinks that lavish allowances will be paid by the Department of Finance under this Bill has, I fear, very little experience of that Department.</P>

      <P>I take it that the chairman and the managing director will be permanent members of the board and that this provision is for the purpose of arranging for pensions for them, should they already have pension rights when they come to the board. Is that right?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may make a scheme for the payment, subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed in the scheme, of superannuation benefits on retirement to or in respect of whole-time members of the board and may, with the like concurrence, amend any such scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The managing director is the only whole-time man contemplated by me at the moment and this provides for superannuation for him.  There is also a provision under another section for a scheme for the whole staff.  These provisions are in all the legislation dealing with these boards.  The reason for them is that they must bring in a scheme of this kind as soon as possible <Col N="1250" /> so as to avoid the position we have in Gaeltarra Éireann at the moment where women working for 30 years have no provision of any kind made for them.  This, I assume, will be a contributory scheme and both the whole-time managing director as well as the employees, will start off on the right foot and have provision made for their retirement in due course.</P>

      <P>This is a simple amendment.  The section as it reads at present is that: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time remove a member of the board from office&rdquo; and my amendment would simply insert the words: &ldquo;on the advice of the board&rdquo;.  I drew the attention of the House already to the fact that in the Agricultural Institute Bill which is coming before us presently, paragraph (4) of the Schedule says: &ldquo;The Government may at any time, on the advice of the council, remove an ordinary member of the council from office.&rdquo;  Therefore, what I am suggesting is, at any rate in relation to some Bills, common form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in answering my point said that he was quite sure that he personally will not abuse this power, and that, if any other Minister were to abuse this power, the person involved would always have the possibility of recourse to Parliament.  I am <Col N="1251" /> afraid I am not satisfied that that is enough.  I know that it is quite possible to put down a question, and even possibly to move a motion in Parliament, but, if you give complete power to the Minister, he has power later to bring his majority in Parliament and overrule any objection.  If you give a limited power of removal to the Minister, which seems to be an eminently reasonable suggestion, then no Government majority or anything else can give him more power in this connection. I want to clip the wings of the Minister, as it were, and to restrict his power in relation to the removal&mdash; which might be quite arbitrary&mdash;of any ordinary member of the board.  I am supporting my plea in this regard by pointing out that the Minister for Agriculture has seen nothing hampering in a similar provision in the Agricultural Institute Bill.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Senator consider inserting the words &ldquo;after consultation with the board&rdquo;? This amendment, in my opinion, will have the effect of tying the hands of the Minister, so that he has no function whatever as a Minister except to act when given a direction by the board in regard to the removal of a member of that board.  It is hardly fair to expect the Minister to accept that since he would be removing all power in that particular regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the wording as it is in the Bill. There was a phrase used about the best member of the board.  It might be necessary to remove the best member of the board, as did happen in one other State company, where the best member of the board was removed. It was necessary to remove him as he was creating so much trouble that either the whole board had to be removed or he had to be removed.  In view of the fact that all moneys will go to them through the Minister it is essential that the Minister should have this power.  I do not think there is any case against it.</P>

I would like to ask&mdash;perhaps it did not occur to him in moving this amendment&mdash;can he imagine, unless there was an awful row, a man's own colleagues removing him from the board even though they felt he was inefficient or incapable or for various other reasons?

      <P>I do not want to get into any controversial political argument with the Senator.  I want to deal with this amendment in a sensible way.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht has an overriding duty, so far as this board is concerned, from the point of view of giving the members certain directions and so forth, and I could not conceive members of a board throwing a colleague of theirs to the wolves.  It would be the very last thing they would normally do.  Even though they might feel they had a duty to discharge by removing a man, they certainly would be inclined to leave him there until the time of his appointment had expired, while it might be vital in the interests of the industries we are speaking of that that man would be removed.</P>
      <P>As I said before I can assure the Seanad that it would be only in some very extreme case that this power would be exercised by any Minister.  I am quite sure the ordinary safeguards that are there for all citizens to use are jealously guarded in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no Minister who would remove a member of a board of this kind through ill-will.  He would want to be in a position to defend his action before the bar of public opinion and I think that is the best test known in any country where democracy works.  I would appeal to the Senator, having considered these matters, to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I feel tempted to press this amendment, not because I do not recognise <Col N="1253" /> the justice of a good deal of what the Minister says, but because I am not prepared to accept fully his major suggestion. Before I come to that, I should like to point out that what Senator O'Donovan says is quite irrelevant to my amendment.  He says it might be necessary to remove the best member of the board because he was making things impossible for his colleagues.  But if he is making such trouble, surely his colleagues can recommend that the Minister remove him?  I do not see the relevance of the Senator's remarks at all.  It would of course be an exceptional case.  As I am not a member of a political Party, I am not very knowledgeable about this type of incident.</P>

      <P>I accept that; I simply did not understand the Senator's reference.  I still do not know what he is talking about.  To come then to the point made by the Minister that the board would not like, as it were, to &ldquo;throw to the wolves&rdquo; a colleague even if he were incompetent, I feel that casts rather a reflection on the kind of board we intend to have.  I believe that a board that would not have the strength to suggest the removal of an incompetent member, even though his removal, in the words of the Minister, might be vital to the interest of the industries involved, would not be a good board.  If it was so weak, so afraid of giving offence and so cowardly, I am afraid it would be a bad board.  I am not prepared to accept the view that it will be so weak.  Were the occasion to arise that the continuing membership of one person would be vitally harmful to the interests of the industries, I believe the kind of board that the Minister is going to set up would have the courage to remove the man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about &ldquo;the bar of public opinion&rdquo;.  Unfortunately the bar of public opinion comes under the control of the Party Whip, and, even though a good case may be made in public, the Party Whip can overrule public opinion.  I should prefer <Col N="1254" /> that we gave the Minister rather less power than he is asking for in this Bill, and of course, in saying that, I intend no reflection on the Minister himself.  I am quite satisfied that abuse of that power would be exceptional, but I think to say that because the abuse of excessive power would be exceptional we are, therefore, justified in giving excessive power, is a dangerous argument to accept in this House.  I would, therefore, like the Minister to ask for nothing more than the power sought by his colleague the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

I resisted an amendment on this issue in the Lower House and I had to do so because there are several centres, some of them outside the Gaeltacht.  I think there are 38 in all.  If there was a statutory direction on the question of language, I was advised that we would be compelled to have some special person in each one of these centres to deal with this matter.  I can assure the Senator it is my intention to direct the board to indicate the position of the language in the important areas in which they will be operating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The roots of this Bill lie in the generosity of the American people in making certain moneys available to this country under the Marshall Aid Plan.  Senators will remember that these moneys fell into two categories.  There were, first of all, the loan moneys equivalent to about £41,000,000, to which conditions were attached in relation to the repayment of the capital and the interest charges. The only conditions attached to the grant moneys were that the moneys should be applied for the general economic improvement of the country and the specific objects to which the moneys were to be applied had to be accepted and agreed upon by the American authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About the middle of 1949 it was known that some grant moneys would be made available and the question as to how these moneys should be applied here came up for consideration. At an early stage, long before the total amount that would be available was known, it was suggested that the moneys could very well be applied here to the establishment of an agricultural institute.  The E.C.A. had as their representative here at the time Mr. Joseph Carrigan.  He was the Dean of the College of Agriculture in Vermont University, and he was also a Director of the Experiments Station attached to that College.  It was not unnatural, therefore, that the idea of establishing an agricultural institute here should be discussed.  The matter was taken up with a certain amount of enthusiasm <Col N="1258" /> and there were discussions which extended into 1950.  In May, 1950, the Government adopted the idea in principle and consultations with various interested bodies here, such as university colleges and so on, took place.</P>
    <P>In October, 1950, an outline scheme was sent to the American authorities, with a formal request for acceptance of the scheme.  At that time, I think the Americans were not prepared to consider any scheme for the partial expenditure of the money.  They wanted to have before them all the various ways in which it was to be expended and the items upon which it was to be expended.  In 1951 certain investigations were made by the Irish Government in relation to the question as to what an agricultural institute would do.  In June, 1951, there was a change of Government and, when the Government, of which I became the head, came into office, we set ourselves to considering the best way in which to utilise the moneys available.  As far as I can recollect, it was about that time we knew fairly precisely the amount of money that would be available in the Grant Fund; it amounted to £6,142,000.  We set out to consider then the best way in which that money could be expended here for the benefit of our economy and we decided, after very careful examination and consideration, on a number of purposes to which it might be devoted, one of them being the establishment of an agricultural institute.</P>
    <P>We had our scheme practically completed by 1952 for submission but this time there was a change in the American system of administration and projects which could have been dealt with administratively, had there being no change, had to be submitted to various Committees of Congress of the United States House of Representatives and Senate.  The result was that our full programme for the utilisation of these moneys, a programme which had to be very detailed, was submitted to the United States authorities some time in 1953.  It was considered by the Committees of Congress and certain modifications to meet the views expressed by the committees were made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> The entire plan was brought to a head about June, 1954.  Everything was ready, but there was another change of Government here.  The new Government, however, were in the position that they were able to sign on behalf of Ireland, and America signed at the same time.  Within a week after the change of Government we were able to get the agreement signed.  That agreement provides in general for the allocation of these moneys.  The allocations, of differing amounts, were for the benefit of agriculture and technical assistance, exchange scholarships and so on.  Besides the main agreement, there were to be subsidiary agreements signed in respect of each particular project.  That has been done in relation to all the other projects, with the exception of the agricultural institute item; the actual subsidiary agreement in relation to that has not yet been signed, but I understand it is practically ready for signature.</P>
    <P>The amount assigned for the Agricultural Institute is £1,840,000.  You will see in the Bill before you how it is proposed to deal with that sum.  The Bill itself is straightforward.  Anyone reading it carefully can learn what are the functions, powers and duties of the institute and the various methods by which it will be governed and so forth. I will come to deal with them in a few minutes.  Now I am only giving the story of the slow progress made in the establishment of this institute.  As I told you it began in 1949 and it is now the end of 1957.  During that slow progress there were very many consultations with bodies which were interested here, and also with the American authorities.  We had not merely to get agreement here at home but we also had to satisfy the American authorities. Therefore, to that extent the Government were not completely free to pursue the course which they might think desirable at any particular time.</P>
    <P>However, when we came into office in 1951, we worked on the foundation that had already been laid, or at least on the idea which was there, and we pursued it as vigorously as we could.  We continued the discussions which the previous Government had undertaken <Col N="1260" /> with various parties and had some successes and some failures.  At any rate, we had brought it to such a point that we would have been able to put forward our proposals within a few months of our leaving office, once we had got the American agreement. These proposals were actually put forward by the Government that succeeded us, the Government that came into office in 1954.  They were contained in a public statement in 1955. Sometimes it is referred to as a White Paper.  I do not know how correct it is, from the parliamentary point of view, to speak of these proposals as a White Paper.</P>
    <P>They were published by the Government to show what their mind at the time was, to show what their proposals were, and to see what public criticism these proposals might evoke.  Those who are interested know that they were met with rather severe criticism. I must say, in passing, that to me a great deal of that criticism seemed unjustified. However, the Government in charge continued to have conversations to try to meet the vigorous criticisms and finally, in 1956, the Agricultural Institute Bill was introduced in the Dáil and was published last February. Again there was a change of Government. It did not alter the general continuity of this process.  Again, believing that the project was long enough on the stocks and that it was better to make progress with it, we decided that, though perhaps it contained some things with which we were not in complete agreement, we should continue on the same lines.  We did so because we considered that it seemed to meet with no severe criticism, and that it seemed to indicate that a certain amount of agreement had been arrived at by the Government, acting through the Minister for Agriculture, and the interested parties.  We considered the Bill very carefully when we came into office and we decided that, in the main, we would follow the lines indicated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>They were of a different character from those set out in the proposals I have referred to as the White Paper. We examined the Bill carefully to see whether we were satisfied with it and <Col N="1261" /> we made some changes.  I am not going to deal with this, however, by way of comparison, comparing this Bill and the previous Bill, because it might lead to certain confusions.  Anybody interested in comparing the two Bills can, I am sure, get a copy of the Bill which was circulated in February of this year, and compare it with the present Bill.  That is a matter of interest for those keen on noticing changes and so on.  I think I should confine myself, however, to the provisions of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>This question of an agricultural institute could have been approached from two different points of view.  One point of view was that of establishing a teaching college, a college in which you would have research more or less centralised, with definite powers to enable proposals regarding agricultural education and agricultural research to be put into practice.  The other point of view was to establish something like the British Agricultural Research Council, which by giving grants to various bodies, helps to get a certain amount of work done which it desires to have done.  The first approach was, more or less, the idea in the White Paper proposals.  The other is the line which is followed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>You will see from Section 4, which is the section that indicates the powers, duties and functions of the institute, how it is proposed to act.  I will come later to the governing body, the human instrument for getting certain things done, for coming to decisions and so on.  It is a body which will try to co-ordinate.  It has no powers of coercion and compulsion but it has powers of inducement by making grants to institutions and persons.  I suppose when one uses the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; it is meant in the broad sense, to include institutions engaged in agricultural research.</P>
    <P>If you survey the ground at the moment you will see that the university colleges are engaged in certain fundamental teaching, which is necessary for agriculture and for other sciences as well.  There are certain fundamental sciences that are being taught in these universities.  It would be very foolish to attempt to duplicate that work and <Col N="1262" /> that was not intended in what I call the White Paper proposals.  The idea incorporated in the present institute is to make use of the work done in those colleges as far as one can.</P>
    <P>Not merely are these fundamental sciences being taught but also various branches of agriculture are taught.  You have the faculties for this in some of the colleges and you have also certain research work being done by them.  I would like, but I have not the time and I think it would not be appropriate, to point out that a great deal of very good work has already been done, and we have hidden our light very much under a bushel in regard to work being done by our existing agricultural research institutions. We have also the research units under the control of the Department of Agriculture and the idea is that this institution would be the means of coordinating the work done by all these bodies, reviewing the work done by them, and advising them in the sense of consulting and talking over their work with a view to suggesting certain things, and hearing what they have to say about some of the work that is being done.  I think that can be done with goodwill but it cannot be done without it.</P>
    <P>The whole hope of the institute is that it will secure the goodwill of the existing institutions so that they may be ready to co-operate, so that they will listen to any advice and so that they, in return, may make suggestions to the institute.  The first duty of the institute is to try&mdash;I say &ldquo;try&rdquo; because they have no real powers of compulsion&mdash;to secure co-operation so that there will be as little overlapping as possible and so that the direction of research should be that which promises to be of most value to the country.</P>
    <P>Of course, you always have the question of fundamental research, which very often turns out to be much more valuable than research directed towards a specific object; but research directed towards a specific object has the advantage that you know exactly where you are going and you have a much better chance of getting results fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> The first thing, then, is the attempt to secure co-operation and to co-ordinate, as far as your powers will permit.  In order that there should not be waste, it is obviously desirable that the institute should be in a position to give grants to existing institutions to do research for which they seem to be particularly fitted.  If, for instance, a certain distance is gone in research work in an existing institution, it is desirable&mdash;indeed it might be the cheapest way of doing it&mdash;to add certain facilities, it may be a piece of special equipment or it may be increasing the staff somewhat to get the necessary team work.</P>
    <P>In a great deal of modern research you need team work and you need to have the proper instruments.  Otherwise there is a good deal of unnecessary time spent.  I do not like to call it waste of time because very frequently in these cases, even though there may be delays if you have not got the most up-to-date apparatus, in the actual working and trying to improvise apparatus, you may do better than if you took the existing apparatus and worked with it.  It would be for the institute to see, if they want particular things done, whether it was better to do it itself or to get some of the existing institutions to do it.  If they think it is better to get the existing institutions to do it, they can add to their resources by way of grants.  If you look at Section 4 you will see the institute has the power of making grants for specific purposes, imposing such conditions as may be required and as it thinks right.</P>
    <P>The next thing is that the institute can establish research units itself.  It will do that, of course, if the governing body of the institute is of the opinion that that is the best way in which the particular investigation it thinks should be entered upon can be carried out. Co-ordination, facilitating and helping by grants existing institutions is one way; the other way is entering itself upon scientific research and investigation by establishing research units with its own staff and under its own immediate control.</P>
    <P>Grants and moneys will be available <Col N="1264" /> for the institute itself as well.  Teaching, as such, at least in its elementary stages, is not contemplated; but such teaching and study as would go with advanced research is, of course, essential and they can provide for that by courses for advanced students, seminars and the usual methods of encouragement for study and the giving of information which is availed of in institutes for research.  It can give scholarships for advanced students to enable them to come to the institute and prosecute certain lines of investigation. It can give fellowships, under such conditions as it may determine, for outstanding work done in the field of agriculture or of the sciences that may be ancillary or helpful to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think that I have indicated the main purposes and main functions of the institute as set out in Section 4. They are, first of all, given in general terms in sub-section (1); and in sub-section (2) you have a variety of specific examples.  They are lettered (a), (b), (c) and so on.</P>
    <P>In sub-section (3) you have a very important additional provision.  From time to time the Minister for Agriculture may wish to have certain investigations pursued and to have certain information.  It is put as a duty on the institute to give him that advice.  It is the intention, and I hope the sub-section so provides, that there is a duty on the institute to pursue an investigation and to give him the advice and the information which he would request in a particular case.</P>
    <P>In the other House an example was given of what might be required.  There might be some sudden disease in plants and you might want it investigated with a view to finding its origin and getting means of combating it.  In the past it was complained by the Department of Agriculture that when they asked some of the existing institutions for information, they could not get it as of right.  It was given to them as a matter of courtesy.  If, for instance, a professor in one of the colleges was engaged in a piece of research to which he had completely devoted himself, he might not wish to allow himself to be diverted to another line of research simply as an act of courtesy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> It was considered desirable that there should be a duty on the institute to advise the Minister for Agriculture in regard to specific matters that might be referred to them.  I know that power could be abused and I can understand that you might have a certain amount of criticism of that power but, on the other hand, if considerable sums are put at the disposal of the institute, it is not unreasonable to expect that institute to come in and help in an emergency situation.</P>
    <P>We now pass from the functions and powers of the institute to its governing body.  Again, I will not make comparisons, because it is better for us to keep to the framework of the Bill as it stands.  As the Bill stands, the governing power is in a council. That council has complete authority. That is the intention.  I hope it is carried out in detail in the Bill and I would ask for any criticism where it would seem not to be so.  The intention of the Bill is that the governing body, the council, should have supreme authority and have the last word in regard to any matter that may arise, that is as far as what should be done is concerned, what grants should be made, and so on.</P>
    <P>That being the governing body's power, the question is what will its personnel be?  The personnel that is provided is a chairman and 12 ordinary members.  The chairman, to indicate the importance of the office, is to be appointed by the President. The first chairman, in fact, and subsesequent chairmen will be appointed by the President.  Of course, as every Senator knows, the President will act in all such cases on the advice of the Government.</P>
    <P>The 12 ordinary members are divided into three classes.  We have, first of all, those who are to be representative of agricultural and rural organisations. There are five such members. The next class are those who are representative of the universities and there will be one representative from each of the four universiy colleges, the three colleges of the National University and Trinity College, Dublin.  We have the third class in those nominated and appointed by the Government. <Col N="1266" /> Obviously, the Government will have the choosing of these at their own discretion.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other two classes, however, the Government have to act on the nomination of the University Colleges in the case of the four ordinary university members, and in the case of the rural organisation, will have to act on the nomination of the various agricultural rural bodies.  If you had four or five of these bodies and said: &ldquo;We will have nominations from this body, this body and so on&rdquo;, then the task would be easy and that would be put in the Bill, but, unfortunately, the organisation of the farming community has not reached the stage at which you can do that, so that the Government will have to try to work out a scheme in which you will have five nominations coming from the most representative of these farming and rural groups.</P>
    <P>That will be done by Government Order which, of course, will be published in the usual way, setting forth what organisations are to nominate and, I expect, what are the conditions under which these nominations are to be made.  Once the five nominations are made, then the Government must appoint these persons.</P>
    <P>There is a Schedule dealing with meetings and various matters of detail. If you look at the Schedule&mdash;it is connected with Section 5 which deals with the council&mdash;you will see that it deals with various things which affect the conduct of the council and so on. I do not think that at this stage it is necessary for me to go into the detail set out in that Schedule.</P>
    <P>The chairman will always be appointed by the President for a definite term of years, not exceeding three years.  In regard to the chairman who will be part-time&mdash;the other members, I take it, will be part-time&mdash; certain remuneration will be attached to the office.  As far as the other members are concerned, I do not think there is anything intended for these people except that out-of-pocket expenses with regard to meetings will be met.</P>
    <P>Besides the governing body, the council, you have the chief officer of <Col N="1267" /> the institute who is called the director. The director has to act subject to the direction of the council but he is in charge of the staff and the general direction of research and so on.  When you have an authority like that there is always a possibility of a clash.  It is not easy to make up your mind as to how you should allocate between the council and the director the respective powers and duties.  Personally, I very strongly hold the view that it is better to let the council have the last word, if there is to be a last word, hoping that the council will be composed of men of common sense who will know best how to run the affairs of the institute.  If the council have a good director, who technically should be a research man or a man who is acquainted with the general character and nature of research, they will listen to his proposals.  He is not a member of the council but he would naturally put his proposals before the council.  If they are wise they will listen to them carefully and they will not object unless they see something obviously wrong.  Therefore, the hope is that the director will get the liberty to do the work in the way in which he, as a technical expert in this work, will think best.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a human problem there, as you have in all these cases&mdash;the human problem of getting proper team work and proper co-operation. The best chance of securing it is in the way I have indicated. There is less likelihood that 12 or 13 people&mdash;sensible people, as I hope they will be&mdash;will run off on some foolish line, than there may be in the case of an individual.  I believe there is safety, so to speak, in numbers, in that matter.  Consequently, we can with safety leave the last word in these matters to them, whilst wishing to give the director the freedom which would be necessary for him to do his work in the best way.  In giving him that freedom, he will not be unduly hampered by any directions he may get from the council as a whole.</P>
    <P>The next thing I should deal with is the funds.  I have dealt with Section <Col N="1268" /> 4, the functions; with Section 5, the council, and with Section 7, the director.  Now I wish to draw attention to Sections 10 and 11.  At an earlier stage I pointed out that the total sum available is £1,840,000.  That is divided into two parts and the first part, £840,000, is intended to be a capital sum which would be available for capital purposes.  Every Senator knows what is intended by that&mdash;such things as buildings and certain permanent types of equipment.  It is not intended that that money should be available for ordinary day-to-day use.  The interest on it will be so available, but the principal itself will not be available for the current work of the institute. It is available for all the types of capital grants or for any units which the institute itself may decide to put up.  It is available for grants for the extension of facilities in existing units in other institutions and so on.  In other words, it is available for capital purposes.  It is to be given to the institute whenever the institute requests it. The income from it&mdash;at least from such portion of it as is not expended, the portion that remains at any stage, the dividends and interest and so on that may derive from that sum of money&mdash; will be available as an addition to the current income of the institute.</P>
    <P>I come now to Section 11.  Senators will notice in Section 11 that there is an endowment fund of £1,000,000.  That £1,000,000 is to be invested for the endowment of the institute, bringing in an annual income depending on the rates of dividend on its investments, and so on.  Assuming it was able to have investments to bring in an average of 5 per cent., the income would be £50,000 a year from that.</P>
    <P>Another source of current income which it will have is the annual grant from the Oireachtas, provided for in Section 12.  The amount of that grant is to be determined by the Minister for Finance, as is right and proper, having listened to the applications and the needs and the work that was being done by the institute, and having consulted the Minister for Agriculture, who will generally side very strongly with the institute, I feel certain, in getting work done.  The Minister for <Col N="1269" /> Finance has the obligation to see that it is remembered that the money that is got, has to be got by taxation, and that if we are not careful about taxation we may impose burdens which may have serious consequences in regard to what we are aiming to do by this institute, that is, to advance our economic position in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I think Senators will agree that it is only right that the Minister for Finance&mdash;of course, with the approval of his colleagues&mdash;should have the last word to say on that.  Some people will say, &ldquo;You are making the institute dependent upon the Government.&rdquo; Well, the Government has to find the means by imposing taxation on the people, and it has to find a balance between the various things that have to be done and the money so taken out of the people's pockets.  However, there is provision made for such an annual grant and any Government would naturally be interested in trying to make the most of this institute and give it the means to work as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, the institute can get a certain income from fees&mdash;I do not know how much.  Trying to look ahead, I do not think that these fees are likely to be of a very substantial amount.  I hope I am wrong but at the moment I would not care to make the fate of the institute dependent upon that particular item of its income.  Also, of course, the institute can receive donations, from such good people as we may find in the community who would be willing to donate gifts to the institute, as is done in other countries.  If we have any big industries associated in any way with agriculture, they may make sums available by donation for the institute.</P>
    <P>I have covered now the functions of the institute, the council and the director. I have spoken of the sources from which the institute is to obtain its capital moneys and its annual income.</P>
    <P>For the rest, the Bill is largely a question of details about staff and so on.  In Section 17 there is a provision that the staff is to be appointed either by the council or under the authority of the council and there is a provision <Col N="1270" /> that, in the case of the research staff, before making appointments to the research staff, a board of people who would be regarded as competent to judge of the qualifications of the applicants and to study the applications would be set up and that the council would consider the report of that board when the appointment is being made.  Making appointments of technical people is always a matter of difficulty, as those Senators who have anything to do with universities and the appointment of professors, and so on, know full well.  It is an extremely difficult thing to arrange that the person who is best qualified and best fit to do the job will be appointed.  Very often, the man with the highest academic qualifications may not necessarily be the best person for the task and the best thing is to set up a board who will go into what the man has done and thereby judge what he is capable of doing, go into his qualifications and so on, examine them carefully and send their report to the council.</P>
    <P>The council is not compelled to act on the recommendations of the board but, of course, like any sensible body of people&mdash;and I hope many of them will be expert in the matters under determination, that is the question of agriculture&mdash;they will have sufficiently intimate knowledge of the work that is to be done that they will be able to satisfy themselves as to whether the recommendation of the board is, in fact, the best.  I imagine that in nine out of ten, or 99 out of 100, cases the recommendation of the board would be accepted.</P>
    <P>I think I should not detain the Seanad any further in explaining the Bill.  It is a straightforward Bill.  I have, I think, dealt with the main provisions which it is proper to deal with at the Second Reading Stage, and the rest of the Bill will be subject, in the Committee Stage, to close scrutiny, I am sure, by all Senators, and any matters that I have not touched on can be brought up in Committee. I hope I have covered the main ground that Senators want to have covered at this stage and, if there are any questions asked, I hope I shall be able to answer them in concluding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, the first thing that falls to be said upon this Bill is to agree with the Taoiseach that we should thank the American people and the American Government for making this money available for education in agriculture and, therefore, for a contribution towards the economic prosperity of Ireland.  The best possible thanks that we can give to the Americans would surely be to make this measure as effective as possible and to see that it works in the spirit in which it is offered and that it does bring the results which we all hope will come from it.</P>
      <P>It is, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, a Bill which has taken a long time to get to the Oireachtas because it involved negotiations between the Irish and the United States Governments. The Bill embodies an agreement between these.  It should be added, as was clear from the Taoiseach's speech, that the Bill also, in the main, is the same as the Bill proposed by the previous Government, Mr. Costello's Government. There is one main difference but we can come to that in Committee.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's presence, I take it, to-night is a tribute to the critical capacities of this House and we appreciate that he has thought fit to give us what I regard, at any rate, as an excellent summary of the provisions of this Bill.  I found myself in agreement with most of what he said in the beginning, with the way in which he hoped the Bill would work.</P>
      <P>He called the Bill a straightforward Bill.  Perhaps the way to say that is that it is a straightforward Bill in its leanness.  It is a Bill which gives immense powers to the council of an institute but it nowhere says what precisely the institute should do.  The Taoiseach has given some indication this evening of his mind on the matter. For my part, I found what he had to say more agreeable to me and clearer than anything which I had read in the Dáil Debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme in the Bill is not the same as that in the White Paper originally published by the Minister for Agriculture in the previous Government, <Col N="1272" /> Deputy Dillon.  That White Paper&mdash;with which it appears the Taoiseach agrees&mdash;came in for a great deal of criticism.  I do not know how far this Bill meets the criticism, which was very vocal at that time.  There are many people&mdash;I am afraid I am one of them&mdash;who, if they had their way, would arrange rather a different scheme for spending this money.  There is no advantage whatever to be gained by discussing that kind of thing now. The main thing is to bring to the working of this particular plan all the goodwill, energy and co-operation possible.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, both as a politician and as a Professor of the National University at University College, Dublin, I can say that everything that can possibly be done to make this scheme work in a reasonable way will be done.  The amount of money available is not very large.  It amounts to £840,000 for capital expenditure and income from the interest on £1,000,000.  Even if the whole £840,000 is not spent on capital and is invested and the interest accrues for annual income to the institute, the sum will be comparatively small when one recalls the immense task that has to be accomplished.  In Britain, for example, as far as I remember, the Government itself is expending £6,000,000 on agricultural research apart altogether from the immenses sums of money put into agricultural research by bodies such as Imperial Chemicals and other big industrial or other corporations.</P>
    <P>Although our population is much smaller than that of Britain, our interest in agriculture is immense.  We are entirely dependent on it.  Therefore, the amount of money which we are prepared to spend will, I think, have to become much larger.  However, as the money is not so great, one would have to exercise great care in the spending of it.  The Bill creates a council of a completely new type, the operations of which, I think, hopeful as one may be, nobody can quite predict. In Section 4, that council is given, in the usual way in these Bills, very wide powers.  It is not compelled to exercise all of these powers or, indeed, <Col N="1273" /> any of them but it has a very considerable variety of powers.</P>
    <P>It would appear&mdash;until we heard the Taoiseach to-night&mdash;that there was no very clear idea as to how these powers would be exercised.  I agree with him entirely that the first thing this council will have to do, when appointed, is to survey the existing facilities for higher agricultural education including research&mdash;existing facilities in men and women, personnel, laboratories, physical facilities such as farms, and so on.  We must see what use can be made of what is there or what extensions to these might be profitable.</P>
    <P>The institute clearly has power, under Section 4, to use this money to expand existing facilities or to recommend to the Government, under Section 12, that the Government itself should contribute moneys for the expansion or improvement of existing facilities.  These existing facilities are not very great.  There is, in fact, only one teaching Faculty of Agriculture in the country&mdash;that is in University College, Dublin.  There is a Faculty of Dairy Science in Cork and, as well, certain work is carried out by the Department of Agriculture in places belonging to it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended to put a top on our agricultural education.  Its function is to do research itself, if it thinks fit, to cause research to be done and assist in getting the result of research to the farmers.  That, I think, is also included in Section 4 and it is highly desirable.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, when one speaks of research of this kind, that research and higher education in agriculture or in anything else must be based upon good undergraduate education. There can be no possibility of getting people to do research unless you have sound undergraduate teaching and certain post-graduate courses. These courses consist of two years' general science and two years' practical and theoretical agricultural science.  From the people who do that particular course, whether they do it in Dublin or in another faculty established somewhere else, we are bound to get our research students.  You do not <Col N="1274" /> normally get, even from the best undergraduate classes, a very large number of research students.  If the undergraduate work done at present is not extended and improved, the foundations upon which this Bill is bound to rest will be insecure.  For that reason, we must take account of the whole picture of agricultural education while we are discussing the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is entirely true that the research that has to be done by this body must be related to the type of agriculture in which this country is engaged and to the lines of agricultural development likely to be the most favourable to our economic progress.  Nobody has suggested, although there have been accusations of that kind, that somebody should be put into a laboratory and asked to do research which can never possibly have any effect on the problems which affect us in this country.  Therefore, it must also be remembered&mdash;I think the Taoiseach pointed this out, too&mdash;that, apart from applied research, fundamental research must always be done in the universities or provided for by this institute in whatever way it thinks fit.  To judge from the Dáil debate, it would appear that there are people who think you can instruct a research worker to do a particular job in a particular space of time, directed towards a particular end.  That is not so.  While practical problems can be solved and investigations carried out, provision must always be made for fundamental research.</P>
    <P>Research is not, so to speak, a purchasable commodity.  If you get a certain amount done for £10,000 it is not, unfortunately, the case that if you invest £20,000 you will get twice the amount done and you will get it done in a fixed time.  In order that our research should be kept on particular lines, it is desirable that farmers should be associated with the council of this institute.  It is fair to say that they are not the only judges and not necessarily the best judges of what should be done in this particular line.  If the expressions of opinion in the other House are indicative of the minds of certain people, it would appear that there is bound to be a clash between <Col N="1275" /> what has been called &ldquo;the farmers&rdquo; and &ldquo;the professors&rdquo;, that is to say, the people whose boots are not necessarily dirty all the time but who may be highly skilled at research.</P>
    <P>One must hope much more common sense will be shown in the institute than has been shown by certain types of criticism already.  One could hope, I think, for harmony and goodwill. There are certain points which I do not want to go into now, because unfortunately we started on this Bill rather late, and I think we should try to conclude the Second Stage to-night, particularly as I gather it is proposed to postpone the Committee Stage until next month.</P>
    <P>A great deal could be said on Section 4.  There are just a few points I should like to make, for the consideration of the Taoiseach before Committee Stage.  I am not quite clear as to how the chairman and the director are going to work together. The previous Bill provided that the chairman was the director.  As a university professor, I am familiar with the president of a university college being the director of that college, but I do not understand quite well how the chairman and director will work in harmony.  The director, we presume, must be, as indicated here to-night, a scientist and he must also be an administrator.  He must have a broad knowledge rather than an expertness in a narrow line of work, if he is to direct agricultural research generally in this country.  He must be acquainted with scientific literature and with the agricultural industry as well.  It seems to me very difficult to get a person who fulfils all those qualifications.  If the chairman were a scientist as well, there would be very great difficulty.  On the other hand, if the chairman were a layman, simply directing the meetings and generally seeing to the taking of decisions and so on, it might be different.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty&mdash;which we can go into later on&mdash;of the period of office of the director.  The Taoiseach will recollect that, when the National University was founded, a university commission was set up by the British <Col N="1276" /> Government of the day and they appointed university professors and lecturers for a period, I think, of seven years.  I do not know whether that would suit in this case, because naturally a director, the kind of person we want, may already be in employment and may not be willing to leave that employment for something which does not guarantee permanency. On the other hand, this is a completely new project and it may be difficult for a person, and particularly for a very good person, to settle down to do the work in the conditions prevailing. There might possibly be found some scheme of &ldquo;seconding&rdquo; a man, as they say in the Civil Service&mdash;that is, a man could be given leave for a couple of years from the post he had, to see whether he would like this particular post.  Again, a man might be chosen from another country.  I do not know what is contemplated, but that seems to me to be one of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I realise it is right to say that the council must be the final arbiter as between conflicting interests, but I do not quite see how a chairman&mdash;and particularly a chairman interested in the work and having views of his own-is going to harmonise with an extremely competent director.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, although it is not exactly what I would have devised myself.  I bespeak for the Bill the co-operation and goodwill of everybody concerned.  The best way we can reward the generosity of the American Government and people and the considerable efforts made by various Ministers since 1949 to bring this matter to fruition, is by seeing that this institute works and brings forth the best possible fruits for Irish agriculture, on which, after all, the prosperity of all of us depends.</P>

      <P>In the first place, this Bill is welcomed generally by all Parties and I wish to pay my tribute to the American generosity which makes it possible to set up this great new institute of agriculture.  This is obviously an improvement on the earlier Bill, which antagonised certain important interests.  As both the Taoiseach <Col N="1277" /> and Senator Hayes have said, this Bill has had the co-operation and goodwill of all concerned with agricultural improvement and education in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Bill, of course, forms part&mdash;and, I may say, a small part&mdash;of a general policy for the improvement of Irish agriculture.  Everybody is agreed on the need for the expansion of our agricultural production, especially in view of the changes which are coming in relation to the European Free Trade Area.  These new changes may incur new dangers for Ireland, in the sense that we will have to meet new competitors; but they may also provide us with new opportunities in the sense that they will give us entrance to new markets.  The environment in which our agriculture has to work is changing and, therefore, there is a need for adaptability, flexibility and preparation. In that, the institute of agriculture could play a vital part.</P>
      <P>I am particularly anxious not to delay the Seanad this evening, but I feel a duty to pay a tribute to the founders of the programme of Irish agricultural reconstruction, of which this institute forms the coping-stone. In the 19th century, Irish agriculture was backward.  There were historical reasons for that.  Land tenure troubles and the land question took the interest and attention of farmers at a time when their competitors abroad, particularly in Denmark, were building up new competition.  The problem present in the 80's for this country engaged the attention of Sir Horace Plunkett.  The services of that great man were not appreciated by his contemporaries and I am afraid they are mainly forgotten by the younger generation to-day.  It surprises me, sometimes, when people come out with great discoveries in regard to agricultural co-operation, all of which had been proclaimed by Horace Plunkett 60 or 70 years ago.  People to-day possibly do not realise what a great figure Horace Plunkett was.  He was a world figure.  If there were any question about that, it could be proved by the remarkable tributes which were paid to him in the world Press at the time of his death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horace Plunkett's work in founding <Col N="1278" /> the Recess Committee in 1895 laid the foundations for modern agricultural reconstruction in Ireland.  He realised the need for agricultural education, at a time when other countriesd had not realised it to the same extent.  The result of that committee was the founding of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, which was a new experiment in Irish administration.  This Department was modelled on the great American Department of Agriculture in Washington. It was in no sense a mere echo of Whitehall or Dublin Castle.  It was an Irish Department, especially adapted to Irish needs.</P>
    <P>As one who had the honour of knowing Horace Plunkett, I can say that he would have found great satisfaction in the thought that this new institute is being founded by American money. Horace Plunkett had spent his youth in the United States.  His authorised biography describes him as an Anglo-American Irishman.  He had a vision of the part to be played in world history by this country, the United States and Great Britain, at a time when the future course of history, as we have known it, had not emerged in the way that anybody else foresaw. As I said, Horace Plunkett was an ambassador between Europe and the United States, and in that way he did a great deal to improve relations between Ireland, England and America. He would have regarded it as a particularly favourable aspect of this institute that it should be endowed by the great generosity of the American people.</P>
    <P>I think it is only fair to pay a tribute to the excellent work done by the Department of Agriculture of which Horace Plunkett was the executive head for the first seven years.  I wonder if the younger generation have ever asked themselves what Irish agriculture would be like to-day if the Department of Agriculture had not been founded by Horace Plunkett in the year 1900.  The late Patrick Hogan was a distinguished Minister for Agriculture, but one must remember that he stepped on the driving plate of a great locomotive which had been constructed, oiled and was in full running order when he took over.  It does not <Col N="1279" /> in any way take away from the admirable work and the great efficiency of the late Patrick Hogan to say that the machine which he drove was in operation when he took it over.  He drove it with great ability in the right direction.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the machine had been constructed by Horace Plunkett who laid the foundation of the agricultural policy of this country at the beginning of the present century.  The Department of Agriculture has always maintained the highest standards of administrative and scientific integrity both before the Treaty and since.  It has preserved the highest standards.  It has been subject to criticism by people who did not understand its functions; and it would have achieved even greater results if agriculture had not been, in certain circumstances, the plaything of politics, if political policies in regard to agriculture had not, on certain occasions, frustrated the work of the Department.</P>
    <P>The work of the Department has always aimed at reducing the cost of production and making Irish agriculture competitive, but these efforts have, on occasion, been neutralised by misdirected policies which, as I have said, led to frustration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling.  I was just about to say that the Department of Agriculture, as the Taoiseach stated, has always engaged itself in and encouraged agricultural research.  This research was mainly undertaken in associated institutions, in the faculties of agriculture in the universities and other bodies.  But the time has come when research needs to be co-ordinated rationally.  Research to-day is very expensive; it requires a, great deal of money.  I take it, in view of what the Taoiseach has said, that the functions of the new institute will not be to replace the existing agencies of research but to implement their actions and to supplement them, to coordinate <Col N="1280" /> them in the interest of the highest possible national advantage.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made the point, with which we must all agree, that agricultural research must be related to the actual day to day needs of farmers. There is no point in setting up an agricultural institute that cannot influence day to day farming any more than there is in establishing a great fertiliser factory when there are no provisions for spreading the fertiliser on the land.  Therefore, the object of the institute is to improve practical agriculture.  In this respect the function which is specifically designated in Section 4, sub-section (2) (j), is of great importance&mdash;that is to say, the function to</P>
      <P>disseminate, or procure the dissemination of, the results of agricultural research to interested persons, including, in particular, persons engaged in providing advisory services in relation to agriculture.</P>
      <P>The persons mainly engaged in this function are the agricultural graduates of our universities.  Therefore, the success of this new agricultural institute will depend, as Senator Hayes said, on the provision of more and more improved agricultural education, so that instead of this institute reducing the need for agricultural education in the universities, it will increase it.</P>
      <P>I have heard agricultural instructors described as conduit pipes.  They bring to the institute the knowledge of the practical problems of farmers and bring down to the farmers the knowledge of the results of research.  The success of this programme of research will depend on an ample advisory service for farmers.  That, in its turn, will depend on the fullest development of the educational facilities of the universities in the agricultural faculty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might refer in passing to the admirable report of the Commission on Agriculture in 1924 which was presided over with great distinction by Professor Drew.  This report, which was partly acted on and partly neglected, laid down a programme for agricultural education at every level&mdash;the primary level, the secondary level, the vocational level and the universities. <Col N="1281" /> It is one of those reports which I had in my mind, when I said in an earlier debate this year, a great deal of expert advice is available to the Irish Government which it does not always adopt.  I hope that, when the institute is set up, some of the proposals in the Drew Commission Report of 1924 will not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>There is one very important question to which the Taoiseach did not refer which I should like him to answer in his reply.  Does research include marketing?  Section 2 of the Bill does not make this clear.  In the Dáil, the Acting Minister for Agriculture was asked this very question but the reply which he gave was not to my satisfaction.  I am not criticising the reply, but I say it was not satisfactory because, if it is correct, I am afraid the institute will, to some extent, misfire.  As reported at column 926 of the Official Dáil Report for November 21st, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A question was asked as to what &lsquo;research&rsquo; covers.  If Deputies look at Section 2, they will find that &lsquo;research&rsquo; and &lsquo;agriculture&rsquo; are both defined.  From those two definitions, it will be seen that &lsquo;agricultural research&rsquo; in this Bill includes investigation, test, experiment, analysis and study of facilities, activities and sciences which relate to or tend to promote or improve agriculture.  That would seem to me to decide the question as to whether the institute could study marketing abroad.  I think it is beyond it; but it could study packaging, harvesting and packaging and that sort of work, in regard to either agricultural or horticultural products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to that, I should like to say that agriculture is a business, not merely a science.  Farmers are not farming for the good of their health; they are farmers to make a profit.  Horace Plunkett always insisted that agriculture depended for its success on better farming and better business.  In the early years of this century the Department could not contribute financially to business research because of the opposition of vested trading interests <Col N="1282" /> and the marketing of farm produce had to be left to the co-operative movement. One of the criticisms of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;to my mind the Department was not at fault because it was part of the spirit of the times in which it was founded&mdash;was the lack of economic research.</P>
    <P>I cannot refrain from telling the Seanad an anecdote in relation to a conversation which I had with Mr. Carrigan, the administrator of the Marshall Aid Fund.  I told him one evening that there was not very much money spent on agricultural economics in the Irish universities.  He asked me what the sum was.  I told him that, as far as I knew, the only education in agricultural economics was given by a course of lectures in Albert College for which one of our staff was paid £100 a year.  Mr. Carrigan said: &ldquo;Do you mean to say the total amount spent on agricultural economics education in Ireland is 400 dollars a year?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;No, it is 280 dollars.  You have forgotten the devaluation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I ask the Taoiseach to assure us that that deficiency will be repaired? There is no use in the farmers producing unless they are able to sell their products at a profit.  I know the line between production and marketing is very hard to draw.  Successful marketing must begin on the farm and marketing nowadays depends upon standardisation, freedom from disease, grading, and so on.  There is no use in a farmer doing his part properly, unless he can be assured of an adequate marketing organisation.  In that connection, I should like to congratulate the Government on setting up the new Committee on Agricultural Marketing. I hope that committee is one of the bodies which will share in the beneficence of this institute.</P>
    <P>This institute can play a great part in the agricultural advance of this country, but its success will depend on close association and co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, with the agricultural faculties of the universities, the co-operative societies and the farmers' organisations.  The good effect of this institute will depend also on a wise agricultural policy in many other directions.  By itself, it will contribute <Col N="1283" /> only a small part to our agricultural advance.  There must be a sound policy in relation to education, to the provision of capital and credit, to the size of farms, to marketing organisations and suitablé trade agreements in relation to the Free Trade Area.  However, inside that context and inside a wide policy of general agricultural reconstruction, this institute can play a useful part.  It deserves the support of the Seanad and, as I said at the beginning, we should be very grateful to the American Government for its very benevolent action to assist our economic progress.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one suggestion I should like to make and it is probably more appropriate on this stage because it concerns a matter of principle.  Perhaps the Government, between now and the Committee Stage in January, might consider enlarging the functions of the institute as outlined in Section 4, so as to include the setting up of the institute as an advisory body or council in regard to the disbursements of grants to our agricultural schools and to the universities, and also to constitute the institute, on this advisory basis, as the advisory body to the universities in connection with the operation of the agricultural faculties in the universities.  I would suggest the insertion of a general enabling sub-section in Section 4 to empower the institute to act as an advisory body to the Government and to the universities in regard to agricultural education.</P>
      <P>The reason I mention the matter is that it was one of the recommendations of the National Farmers' Association Commission made in December, 1955, following on the White Paper issued by the Government of the day.  That recommendation was made by a commission which included many prominent university people.  I suggest that it should be given serious consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been engaged in research on matters dealing with agricultural education for at least 30 years, I have no hesitation in referring to this measure as one of the most important which has come before the Seanad for years.  I am particularly <Col N="1285" /> glad that the Taoiseach should come here this evening and introduce this measure to us and introduce it so clearly and so well.</P>
      <P>All honour is due to our American friends who made this great venture possible, but I have reached the stage when I have more American cousins than Irish cousins, and I suppose it is only right that they should help the old country, their country having been discovered by St. Brendan.  Nevertheless we ought to show our appreciation of their action.  Taking a line from Senator O'Brien's remarks, I feel all honour is due to certain people of the past, to Horace Plunkett, who was a most remarkable man, to T.P. Gill, George Fletcher and George Campbell. I should think it would be very wrong to discuss a matter of this kind without mentioning the men who gave their lives in the service of our own Department of Agriculture and who were largely responsible for turning my interests to applied chemistry. Whether that was desirable or not is another matter.  When these people asked us in the old days what we were studying, and we said, &ldquo;Chemistry&rdquo;, they would say: &ldquo;What are you doing with your chemistry?  You must apply it.&rdquo;  This institute is certainly bearing that in mind.  There is laboratory chemistry and field science, and running right through the text of this Bill is the principle that knowledge is no use unless it is applied, and I certainly, for that reason, as a university representative, welcome this measure most heartily and praise the skill which has gone into its preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the points which I wish to raise could be raised more appropriately on Committee Stage, but there is one point I wish to raise now.  The pivot of the institute is the council. Having, for no obvious reason, been associated with councils every year for the last 20 to 30 years, I know that councils can be very difficult and councils can be very agreeable and the pivot of the council has, as its ball-bearing, a chairman.  I am very glad to see that the appointment of the chairman is regarded as being of such importance that it is entrusted to the hands of the President.  The chairman will be a figure who will not <Col N="1286" /> only uphold the traditions of the council but who will enable it to function smoothly.  We on the Medical Research Council were fortunate in having an admirable chairman and, while he did not do very much talking, he somehow kept us on the rails.</P>
    <P>The chairman of this agricultural institute will have an extremely responsible task and indeed, will have a most important office to fulfil.  I would think that the best efforts and energies of our administration should be devoted to selecting the right man.  Supposing the council is started and put into operation, what then are the problems facing it?  One of them is where the institute is to be located.  Is it to be in Dublin, in the South or in the Midlands? I can imagine a great deal of difficulty arising in the selection of the location of the institute and getting the most suitable area.  The institute will have to be very much larger than was anticipated at first because science is growing at an extraordinary rate and any institute erected will require extensions.</P>
    <P>Another point is the question of the relationship between the director, the chairman and the Minister.  I would suggest that some sort of provisional, or navigating, council could be got together first to consider these questions &mdash;the location, the size and the question of the type and choice of director. That would be quite enough work for the first six months or year of the institute.  In regard to the question of marketing, mentioned by Senator Professor, O'Brien, I should imagine that it would come under the heading of promoting agricultural research.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 4, paragraph 40, on page 3 which states: &ldquo;The institute shall advice the Minister on any matter relating to agricultural research or agricultural science on which its advice is requested by him&rdquo;, I should be inclined to insert the words &ldquo;the institute shall keep the Minister informed on the progress of its work&rdquo;. As worded at present, it appears that the institute remains more or less quiet until the Minister asks for information. I should like the institute to push the Minister just as much as having the Minister push the institute Senator Hayes referred to agricultur-in <Col N="1287" /> the universities.  We actually have, and still have agricultural students in T.C.D. I know that because I taught them chemistry.  A great many of them gave up agriculture because they said there was no future or prospects in it.</P>
    <P>One thing this institute gives us is hope and the feeling that those interested in science are not really working entirely in a vacuum, that they can now train students who will find a field for exercising the information we give them.  Now at last there is some chance of opening the doors of the laboratory and of allowing the people inside engage in outside activities. The problem up to this was one of finance.  I spoke to T.P. Gill on one occasion and asked: &ldquo;Why cannot something be done?&rdquo;  The answer, I suppose, is very much the same as the answer given to a man during the tourist season when he was charged 9/- for breakfast in a small hotel.  He was told: &ldquo;We are very sorry, but we need the money.  We would do what we could to be reasonable but we need the money.&rdquo;  At last, thanks to Providence and to our American friends, the money is available and, for goodness' sake, let us go forward.</P>
    <P>Most of us here are either farmers or farmers' sons or grandsons and the soil of the country has a special appeal for us.  We all live on the farmer who keeps us healthy and we have now to repay a very old debt that goes back to the Garden of Eden.  I am very glad to welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join in welcoming this Bill.  At the outset I should like especially to congratulate the Taoiseach on the very lucid and clear exposition he gave of the Bill and of its various facets.  I should like also to be associated with thanks to the Americans for their gift and for the help they have given us at all stages in developing our scientific potentialities.  We had the Scholarship Exchange Bill a few days ago which is just another facet of what we are dealing with to-night.  I am also delighted with the spirit of unanimity that has marked the passage of this Bill through the Dáil.  If we had to <Col N="1288" /> wait a few years perhaps it was well worth while, if we can start with such a spirit of unanimity.</P>
      <P>Before turning to the Bill there are one or two points which I should like to clear up.  The first is that it has been suggested that I have some interest in certain posts in the institute. I wish it to go on record that I reaffirm what I expressed in a letter to the Press a few years ago&mdash; that I have no intention of accepting any paid post in the institute, simply because I do not feel I am qualified, either from the point of view of training in agricultural research or training in the laboratory sciences, both of which are absolutely essential for the directorship of this new institute.</P>
      <P>Another point I wish to mention is that I was delighted to hear Senator Lenihan refer to the Agricultural Institute Report prepared by the commission set up by the National Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme.  As Senators all know, I was intimately associated with that project and I can vouch that we did our very best to conduct a scientific inquiry at the highest possible level.  Had we been commissioned by the Government or any other body, we could not have taken greater pains to get at the truth. In that respect we must acknowledge the wonderful co-operation we received from everybody here.  We had the universities and the agricultural organisations and all were prepared to come and help in every way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must pay tribute to that outstanding scientist, Professor Walton, the Nobel Prize winner, and Professor Conway, F.R.S., and above all to Professor Cooper of Newcastle, perhaps the greatest agriculturalist in Western Europe at present, who came to us for three years and answered question after question.  We felt very happy in finding that he was 99 per cent. in agreement with what we eventually recommended.  I am happy to see that the present Bill is again along the same lines, that is the idea of a co-ordinating institute rather than a centralised institute that would attempt to do everything itself.  I am very happy to put that on record and I would suggest quite respectfully that <Col N="1289" /> before the Committee Stage next month the members might find some useful information in the little booklet issued by that commission.  I know, of course, that there was a certain amount of what you might call undesirable publicity associated with it but that publicity was nothing more than an effort by the organsations and bodies concerned to ensure by democratic means that the Government at least marked time until the investigation had been conducted.</P>
    <P>Speaking quite frankly, one thing we could not understand then, and that I cannot understand still, is why we did not have an independent commission set up by the Government complete with outside experts to prepare the blueprint for this most important venture.  I do not mention this to arouse any discord; thank God we are all united as to where we are going and I just make the point so that Senators will, perhaps, gain something through reading through this report.  I see Senator Lenihas has quoted from it already to show the institute's main function as a co-ordinating body of the various agricultural faculties.  That is something akin to what was accomplished also by the G.M.C. for medical education and by the Veterinary Council for veterinary education.  I believe that is something that can be explored between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Again, I emphasise that I welcome this Bill very much.  Mainly it is an enabling Bill that sets confidence in the future, in the men we are about to elect to the council and in the institutions that we have in this country, confidence in the belief that we shall all pull our weight in developing the agricultural potential of this country, because the first thing we must examine is what the purpose of this institute is. Is it to write our name in glorious letters in the annuals of agricultural science in the world?  I think that is a little bit too ambitious at present.  Our job is really the job of getting down to agricultural production, getting from this country the production of which we know it is capable.  When we have done that we can be more ambitious afterwards.</P>
    <P>In the matter of agricultural production, I find in the general survey conducted <Col N="1290" /> over the past couple of years one of the most obvious results we have got in recent times fails to be used either to give hope or create despair, as the farm survey has been used to spread despair and can be used to spread hope.  I do not wish to dwell on it at this stage, but it shows that with our farmers segregated into three classes, the top-third, middle-third, and bottom-third, if we could raise the whole level up to the level of the top-third as an objective for, say, five or ten years, it would lead, on the present pattern, to a 50 per cent. increase in production.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant fact of all is that the main difference between the various groups is in the labour employed, both the family labour and the paid labour&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave the matter now except that I wish to emphasise the institute's first task is to get increased production and increased production calls for sending the information down to the farmers through the advisory services.  That is the first priority.  We find, of course, we cannot have effective advisory service to the advisers without having some concomitant research so that we must have the fundamental research which, it is the intention of the Government as conveyed in the debates, should be largely carried out in the existing institutions.  Then we have the routine research which might be set down to specialist advisory work.  We can see there a field in which we are very deficient at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on advisory services, many feel that the institute should control them but I think the approach to these services is rather that they should be decentralised.  It is the local control that we want and the institute if it fulfils its function, of channelling down scientific information, will be playing a major part, if at the other end of the pile we have developed local advisory committees and ensured that there is effective co-operation and liaison between the advisers and their farmers, <Col N="1291" /> the only type of effective and supervision that can get the best from the adviser and get the farmer to avail of that.</P>
    <P>One real bottleneck here at present is our scarcity of agricultural graduates. It may sound strange to speak of such a scarcity when we read in some of the farming papers that there are at least 20 of last June's graduates walking the streets without employment and thinking very much about emigrating. That is just a paradox.  We have not yet got the machinery to absorb these graduates but if we are to develop as a real live scientific agricultural country, and if the country is to develop to what we expect it will, we need many many graduates.  In fact, a study that I made some few years back with Professor Boyle of U.C.C. shows we need an output of 110 graduates in agriculture each year, for the next 20 years, so that in 20 years' time we can guarantee giving to our farmers the scientific services that are now available in countries such as Denmark and Holland.  The task is big and there is an obvious necessity for many graduates in agricultural.</P>
    <P>On the task of co-ordination, which is a main function of this institute, it is not sufficient to co-ordinate research alone.  The institute most also act as a co-ordinating body, as I have said, to the advisory services and to the agricultural scientists and the teachers in the vocational and agricultural schools, because we must place the agricultural teachers in the vocational schools on the same level as the advisers in the field.  We must provide for them the same opportunities, because in the last analysis, the teacher is every bit as important as, or even more important than, the advisory officer.  I hope, therefore, that in its development he will be able to ensure that the information is passed down to the teachers in the vocational schools and that they are made to feel in that way part and parcel of the agricultural family.</P>
    <P>It is vitally essential that our agricultural schools should keep themselves abreast of modern development. That is evident to all.  The farms attached to these agricultural schools <Col N="1292" /> might well be used by the institute as demonstration farms, or the institute might get the authorities in the schools to carry out a good deal of demonstration work.  These are all problems we shall have to study very carefully.  Perhaps it is just as well not to overload the new institute at the outset.  In a few years' time, when it has been working, we will be able to review more fully its association with our agricultural schools, our vocational schools, our universities and all the other interested bodies. We should approach this in a spirit of experiment.  We must have machinery for periodic review and we must not be afraid, as a result of such reviews, to make adjustments, if and when necessary.</P>
    <P>Many of the points I have to make can perhaps be made more appropriately on Committee Stage.  There is just one point upon which I feel very strongly.  I refer to the constitution of the council.  One fact emerges very clearly as a result of the working of many of our present committees, from the universities right down to the creameries.  Once a man gets dug in, we do not like to displace him.  We should consider here incorporating a provision that one-third of the council should retire every two years and be ineligible for immediate re-election.  I have no objection to a man, who has stepped down for one period, coming back again on to the council, if his nominating body feels they should be represented by him.  Let us have, however, a certain element of change. Changing one-third of the council every two years would not prove in any way harmful, in my opinion. Indeed, it would give us the new blood which is so vitally essential in such bodies.</P>
    <P>The Government might consider nominating some distinguished leaders of agricultural from England or America.  There are such excellent people as Professor Cooper, Colin Clarke and many of the Americans who were with us in the early stages.  It would be a good thing to know that we had on that council a man who could say: &ldquo;This is how we are doing it in England and it works in this fashion.&rdquo;  As the Taoiseach has rightly <Col N="1293" /> stressed, this institute is modelled rather closely on the Agricultural Research Council in England.  It would be of great benefit to us to have somebody on the council who knows both the strength and the weakness of the Agricultural Research Council in England.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be a large number of committees operating under this council.  One might wish that the Bill had gone in greater detail into the setting up of such committees, explaining where the advisory service will be represented on them and where other interested bodies will be represented. Some ideas along those lines might profitably have been incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the director, we are all agreed that the institute will stand or fall by the man who is picked.  We are all agreed, too, that the task will be a very onerous one.  It will certainly not be a 40-hour week job.  We will expect a great deal and, for that reason, I think we should look more upon it as a tour of duty: a man will be honoured to come and accept such a tour, knowing quite well that there is very hard work ahead and that he is not excepted to stay in the job very long.  He might be elected for five years and re-elected for another five, but, at the end of that period, he should retire to some quieter position rather than continue in the hectic post of director.  Being a research man, it might be possible for him to go as a research professor into one of our universities or institutions directly connected with the agricultural institute. The more new blood we can transfuse in the way of appointing directors, the better it will be.  Even at the risk of losing a good man, we should ensure that there will be a change, because many an institution here has failed not because of the inexperience of the man in charge but because the man in charge has been too long in the post.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point in relation to financing.  Here, the stakes are very high.  Our present production is £118,000,000.  Even if one envisages only a 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. increase, one is playing around with something like £20,000,000 to £30,000,000 <Col N="1294" /> per year.  If science and research are to play a considerable part in getting that increase, then we must be prepared to spend.  In England, at the moment, they are spending 3 per cent. of the total production on research, and that is considered to be very low. It is, in fact, far lower than they are spending in Holland and some other countries.  Now .3 per cent. for us would mean something of the order of £500,000.</P>
    <P>According to the 1953 Report issued by F.A.O. on the organisation of agricultural research in Europe, we were spending in 1953, £69,000, plus the research done in the universities; in other words, we were spending something of the order of £100,000 to £120,000.  We shall have to step that up considerably.  England at the moment is spending £6,000,000 on research. We are, of course, faced with one bottleneck when it comes to spending on research; we have not got the men to carry out the work.  Granted that we can get some to come from other countries but these will be only a minority.  The work that has to be done must be done by ourselves.  We cannot buy people to do it for us.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying how satisfactory it is to see again this note of confidence and hope in other institutions, that we can delegate responsibility, that we can get lesser institutions, to do the work for us.  Here we are applying the very well known principle of decentralisation of what one might call subsidiary functions.  I notice the Minister for Industry and Commerce is striking the self-same note in his programme for industry, putting it up to private enterprise to carry the main portion.  Likewise here, it is up to the universities, the technical schools, the agricultural schools, all to pull their weight in a free community, not under dictatorship bossed by an almighty institute, but as partners in that institute in fulfilment of true democratic principle.</P>
    <P>That is a very good augury for the future and I have very great pleasure in pledging the full co-operation of our university, especially University College, Cork, and also of the Association <Col N="1295" /> of the Graduates of the National University, who again asked me to convey their sincere appreciation of this Bill, and their offer of every co-operation in making it a success.  In concluding, I might say that our greatest guarantee for the future is that our scientists who are with us now, those who qualified since the war, are still in the country because they believe in the country.  If it was money they wanted, they would be elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome this Bill, chiefly because it will tend to put agriculture where it should be in this country.  I also welcome it because it will stimulate a greater interest in agricultural education.  That is the great lack at the present time.  From the schools up to the universities, we should stimulate a greater interest in agricultural education and agricultural interests. I was sorry to hear the Taoiseach say that anything in the way of teaching was not contemplated at present.  I had hoped it would come under Section 2 of the Bill where we have outlined those activities which tend to promote or improve agriculture and which are also mentioned in another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, it will stimulate interest in agricultural education and also in the ability to absorb.  We must start at the very bottom and give the elements of education to the schoolboy before he is able to appreciate and absorb what he is going to receive later on.  Just as, in England and other countries, the atomic bomb has stimulated interested in science, and sent forth a call for scientists, I hope this institute here will act as a bomb and stimulate interest in agriculture.  It is in agriculture that the hope of this country lies.  There is a tendency to believe that if agricultural advisers and inspectors know their work, that is enough.  They can do all the necessary things and, perhaps, not even explain the reasons for doing them to the farmer. They will give him his instructions, tell him that or his should be done, but we want the farmer to explain why he does it himself.  I hope that later this aspect will become one <Col N="1296" /> of the activities of the agricultural institute.</P>
    <P>Though I have, perhaps, as great respect as anybody here for the Department of Agriculture, I feel the fact that the American Government permitted this £1,840,000 to be spent on such a project as the institute rather points that their idea, which I must say I share myself at times, was that our Department was not going far enough, or fast enough, to keep in touch with modern requirements.  We, perhaps, tended to become a little conservative and did not depart from old policies that were successful, but at the same time were getting left behind.  I feel the Department was content to follow other countries and not get into the lead itself.  I feel I might make one quotation from the autumn issue of <i>Studies</i> which expresses better than I can what a Departments of Agriculture, or an agricultural institute should be.  It is from an article written by Garret FitzGerald and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a need for a new attitude of mind, experimental, restless, dissatisfied with past achievements, sceptical of present methods, questioning traditional agricultural policies. No matter how sound it may have been when first enunciated, no agricultural policy should be sacrosanct for more than a few years, and should automatically come up for comprehensive review at frequent intervals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This agricultural institute should more or less work on those lines.  Its staff should be always questioning and looking for new fields.  In this respect, I would support the suggestion and I intended to raise the matter suggested by Senator Quinlan, that the Minister should not hesitate to go outside the country for some of his staff and even some of his council.  We hope we will have the best council possible but, if we from it completely from membership in this country, I feel we may just be creating a new playground, as it were, for the team we have.</P>
    <P>Perhaps they had not got the finances or the assistance to do their work before, but we do not want just <Col N="1297" /> to create a new playground for that team.  I think outside coaches, to continue the metaphore, would be a help. Not alone would they be a help to our workers, but they would come here with ready-made contacts with what has been done in England and in America.  An example would be the best way to illustrate that.  We have probably done very little, if anything, in the way of research into the ability of new drugs to assist in the growth and increase in weight of animals per lb. of food.  The Americans have done a great lot in that regard.  When we start and have a team working in that direction, surely, if there is a member of our board who has worked on, or at least been in close contact with, that research in America or England, he would be of great assistance to us here.</P>
    <P>One difficulty about bringing in an outsider is, possibly, that he would have to be paid.  For that reason, I wonder might we not amend Section 6 so that fees could also be paid to outside members of the council?  While members of the council selected from this country might well be either lent from the Department or from a university, a man coming from England or America to act on the council in the way I suggest might have to give up like to see provision made that, if necessary, such a man could be paid. could be paid.</P>
    <P>The other few matters I have to mention deal with details which might be raised later on Committee Stage. However, there are a few points I should like to hear the Taoiseach reply on.  The first arises on Section 4, where one of the functions of the institute is set out as the publication of the results of agricultural research.  I would much sooner see published the progress, not necessarily the results, of the research.  That would be another help to stimulate interest in what is going on in the institute.</P>
    <P>As regards this vexed question of the director and the chairman, I have read the debate in the Dáil and I am not quite sure that I am satisfied with the present Bill.  I feel that I would rather come down on the side of putting all the power in the hands of <Col N="1298" /> the chairman, whereas the debate in the Dáil rather elevated the director. I cannot see yet where one starts and the other ends.  I am not quite sure that my idea would not be to have directors&mdash;that the director would direct some branches of the work of the institute in one direction and that another man, qualified in a different direction, would direct another branch or branches of research.  Senator Quinlan mentioned a director who would be a superman and I think it would be a very hard to find a man qualified to direct all branches of research.</P>
    <P>The only other point is a small one perhaps, but Section 7, sub-section (9) (b) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council, after consultation with the Minister, may at any time remove the director, other than the first director from office for misconduct or incapacity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is very hard to remove a man for misconduct or incapacity. Perhaps &ldquo;unsuitable&rdquo; might be better there.  I remember one case in court fairly recently where a man objected to the fact that he was removed for misconduct or incapacity, but he could have been removed if he were unsuitable. The council might find it difficult to remove a brilliant but unsuitable man for misconduct or incapacity.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we can raise the remainder of the points on another Stage.  I welcome the Bill very much because it brings agriculture to the place it should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unnecessary for me or any other speakers to join in thanking the American people and the American Government for making this money available to us.  I would rather say it is a poor tribute to the American people and Government that we have spent practically ten years discussing the implementation of this plan for a research institute. The Taoiseach mentioned it began in 1949.  It is now almost 1958 and I hope we have reached unanimity in regard to the establishment of this institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We began on a grandiose scale and I think we have now watered down <Col N="1299" /> our ideas to what is contained in the Bill before us.  The discussions that took place on White Paper issued during the term of office of the previous Minister for Agriculture led to an appreciation by farmers' organisations and farmers throughout the country of what we could do and what we should do while keeping our feet on the ground.  I remember attending a deputation to the then Minister when he told us about having different schools on the campus&mdash;a forestry school, a veterinary school, a horticultural school and so on.  These things were too grandiose and did not materialise.</P>
    <P>We should not go away with the idea that this research institute will be an omnipotent panacea for all our ills.  It was not the lack of research that prevented the success of agriculture in this country during the past 100 years. Agriculture in the 32 County area supported 8,000,000 people 100 years ago; now the Twenty-Six County area maintains fewer than 3,000,000 people and we have not increased agricultural output to any great extent.  The standard of living of the people living in the Twenty-Six County area to-day is, of course, far better than that which the 8,000,000 people enjoyed 100 years ago but it was the economic situation and outside interference that kept us backward.</P>
    <P>I have often said that our agricultural education has now advanced considerably and if we could apply the information which we have at present, an agricultural institute and research would be secondary to the results which would accrue to agriculture from the application of such information.  It is lack of finance and lack of knowledge that have operated against success in the matter of agricultural output. This agricultural institute will be a good thing, but we have not anything like the grandiose ideas of farming referred to a short time ago by Senator Quinlan, in this booklet produced by the National Farmers' Association.  They were going to take over the work of the Department of Agriculture lock, stock and barrel, perform their functions and provides the advisory officers throughout the <Col N="1300" /> country, educate them and supervise them.  That was the grandiose idea.</P>
    <P>Let me quote paragraphs (6) and (7) on Page 49 of the Agricultural Institute Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Take over the present functions of the Department of Agriculture with regard to the advisory services, as outlined in the recommendations in paragraph 6;</P>
    <P>Take over the present functions of the Department of Agriculture with regard to agricultural schools. This involves the provision of finance, technical guidance, and the co-ordination of courses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were just flying our kite too high. It is because we have seen the wood for the trees now that we have this great evidence of unanimity among the representatives of the nation in the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are two types of research&mdash;fundamental research and applied research.  As I understand it, in fundamental research, you are working on something which may not result in any great benefit accruing to the nation generally. Applied research is made when we apply the knowledge we know and make further research into some established knowledge.  Research of that kind would be of a more constructive nature than what we would classify as fundamental research, which, I think, will have to be done by bigger nations than ours.  In connection with fundamental research, there is nuclear fission and atomic energy, and we could never in our small nation contemplate conducting fundamental research on that scale.  We can always apply ourselves to the use of knowledge which is universal.</P>
    <P>We are giving to the institute a certain amount of money to carry on research. We are establishing a council to advise and direct a director of that, so that the machinery seems to be simple enough.  We have a certain amount of money.  We will have a director who will be an established well-known scientist, with the knowledge and practice of scientific investigation and we will have a council to <Col N="1301" /> direct him as to the work he should do, and then allow him to do it.</P>
    <P>We are not interfering in any way with what was originally thought of as being the educational functions of the universities.  I personally should like to see a greater sum of money made available to the universities for agricultural education in the faculties at University College, Dublin, and in the dairy science faculty of University College, Cork.  In Galway they have no agricultural faculty at all.  Although there would not be much difference between agriculture in the West of Ireland and in the East or South of Ireland generally, I think a faculty in each of the three colleges would be essential to enable students to go back to their farms fully qualified to run the farms.</P>
    <P>It might seem an exaggeration to some people that you would get a person qualifying with a degree in agriculture to go back to his farm. Senator Quinlan referred to the fact that unfortunately 20 students who qualified in agriculture last year were idle.  No research can cure a situation such as that.  It is a question for the Government of the country to ensure that those people will be absorbed into the service of the community rather than that they should be absorbed into a research institute.</P>
    <P>I do not see why ordinary people should not do a good deal of work in a research institute.  Some people might imagine that, to be a research officer, you must have some special mental ability.  I do not know, but I should imagine that the occasion often makes the man.  I presume that the universities will still provide graduates' fees; that the Department will still run its own institutions, and that An Foras Talúntais will provide facilities for research by any of these institutions under its care, and even by the Department.</P>
    <P>That need not necessarily mean big buildings.  I think it was Senator Fearon who asked where would the buildings be and how many would be required.  I think that for the time being buildings would not be required at all and that some of this research, could be done through the existing <Col N="1302" /> university facilities and through the Department itself.  There you have types of research carried out which have not come to people's minds at all yet in this debate.  One such type of research is veterinary research.</P>
    <P>I think veterinary research affords an even wider field than research into what I shall call pure agriculture, the tilling of the land and soil science.  I think veterinary science affords greater opportunities for research than even pure agriculture or horticultural science.  I will not delay the House discussing any particular details of the Bill, but I want to point out that a greater portion of our work must be done economically through the advancement of the agricultural industry and really our research will be ancillary to that in certain details.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the position of veterinary science.  When this institute was mentioned at first, the Veterinary College in Dublin, it was suggested, would be taken over by the agricultural institute and at the same time it was being absorbed into the National University in University College, Dublin.  It is still in mid-air.  The members of the veterinary profession did not agree to go into an agricultural institute.  They felt that their place was as a faculty in the university. It has not become a faculty of the National University and it has not become a faculty in an institute.  It is still run by the Department of Agriculture and the two universities, that is National University and Trinity College, give degrees in veterinary science.  The teaching institution is not under any university; it is run by the State.  That position is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>For something like nine years the agricultural institute has been under discussion.  We have reached a stage where we can see daylight, see good effects to come from the establishment of this institute and, if we have not been too much up in the air as organisations, individually, collectively, or as a nation, I hope to see very good results from the work which will be done, certainly in applied research rather than in anything of the nature of fundamental research, which I think would be beyond our sphere.</P>

      <P>This is the second occasion within a week on which we have had cause to thank the United States for great generosity.  I should like to join in the expressions of gratitude for that generosity.  If this money is wisely spent, it will obviously be of the very greatest benefit to the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I should like to touch very briefly on three aspects of the Bill.  It proposes to promote agricultural science at the highest level, to encourage research, and so on.  That, of course, is very good indeed but the question has been asked already this evening by Senator Hayes and by others, and I think should be asked once more, whether our undergraduate population in agriculture, so to speak, is sufficient to feed this elaborate institution, to supply suitable graduates for this desirably elaborate programme.  Are we, in other words, spending enough at present an the first stages of agricultural science?</P>
      <P>A few days ago I glanced through the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and it seems to me we are spending approximately £162,000 on scholarships to universities on the faculty in University College, Dublin, and on the Dairy Science faculty in University College, Cork.  Does this provide enough teaching?  Does it provide enough university training in agricultural science to produce enough intelligent and qualified students for the institute?  In other words, when this most desirable Bill is passed, will the structure of our scientific training in agriculture in this country not tend to become top-heavy?  Will it not be something like a pyramid standing on its apex&mdash;£162,000 being spent on the undergraduate level and very much more proportionately being spent on research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is as we all know&mdash;both in Trinity College and in University College&mdash;grave overcrowding in the existing institutions for agricultural degrees in the Republic.  These institutions are doing very well considering their straintened circumstances.  But they are gravely handicapped in funds and in equipment.  So, I suggest, there is a risk that out of this excellent <Col N="1304" /> Bill a certain disproportion, a certain unbalance, may emerge in the total structure of agricultural science in this country, and I do urge on the Taoiseach and the Government that there probably will be need for further expansion at the undergraduate level if we are to live up to the generous terms of this Bill.  Otherwise it will be, so to speak, too heavy at the top, too slender at the base.</P>
    <P>Here, there is no need to remind the Taoiseach or the Government, but there is need to remind Senator O'Donovan, apparently, that there are four university colleges, if you use small letters, not capital letters for the words &ldquo;university colleges&rdquo;, in the Republic.  He mentioned the sister colleges of Dublin, Cork and Galway but there is Trinity College, Dublin, too, and I would remind him that there has been a faculty of agriculture, in co-operation with University College, Dublin, in Trinity College for many years.</P>
    <P>I think it is not irrelevant now to remind the House that the Royal Dublin Society, which has done so much for agriculture in this country, was founded by public-spirited graduates of Trinity College, Dublin. I think I could quote other examples of good work which the college and university which I have the honour to represent have done in agriculture.  As we pass into this House past the library and the museum and look out over Leinster Lawn to the buildings there, the museum and the art gallery, we should remember that they primarily were fostered by the Royal Dublin Society.  It gives me, then, a certain quiet satisfaction as I enter this House to remember that Trinity has done so much in the past for the agriculture and culture of the country. I am sure it was an oversight on Senator O'Donovan's part not to mention the fourth college of the Republic. But I would like him, perhaps, in future, to be good enough to remember it.</P>

      <P>Would it be unfair to say that he mentioned Trinity in the irrelevant and not in the relevant, part of his speech?  There is only one other matter of general interest that I should like to raise.  I shall not keep the House long.  I wish there were one further provision in the Bill.  It may sound fanciful, but I am convinced that much of the agricultural success of this country depends on this.  I wish that there could be some means of encouraging our poets and writers and artists to revive a national sense of the nobility of work on the land&mdash;not only the financial aspect, not only the economic necessity of agriculture, but the genuine nobility of work on the land.  I think our poets and writers could restore a sense of this if they had the encouragement. They could persuade our people that the heroes of Ireland to-day are the people who work our land a little better.  Swift's famous definition of patriotism, to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before, is not enough.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a spirit of enthusiasm amongst our writers and poets which would persuade the intelligent young people of our cities that it would be a noble thing to go back on the land.  It has happened before.  Virgil achieved it in his magnificent poem <i>The Georgics</i>, at the instigation of the Emperor Augustus. He wrote that noble epic of work on the land at a time when Rome was fearing the drift towards the cities, as we are fearing the drift towards the cities now.  This, perhaps sounds fanciful.  This is not a Bill to encourage poets.  But it would be well if, in some way, the Government or others could enlist the support of our writers and persuade them not to write about the sordid side of Irish agriculture.  Most of the novels and poems I have read in the past few years about life on the farm were discouraging and, in many cases, sordid.  If we could change that, it would mean a very great deal.  The nobility of life on the land is what we must depict.  Ultimately this is a practical need, I believe and not a fanciful suggestion, and I am convinced that what I have suggested might be beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> Finally, I have a question to ask.  I notice that in Section 6 of this Bill it is provided that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There may be paid, out of the income of the institute, to members of the council such expenses of travel and subsistence as the council may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no financial interest in this; I am not personally concerned with agriculture. But in the Gaeltacht Industries Bill, 1957, I notice, in Section 6, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A member of the board shall be paid, out of funds at the disposal of the board, such remuneration and allowances for expenses as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the provision for remuneration mean that their work will be different from that of the agricultural council? Does it mean they will be a different kind of people?  Or what does it mean? It is a small matter of detail and I should just like some explanation of it.</P>
    <P>I shall end by joining in the unanimous expression of welcome for this practical and promising Bill.  I pledge the utmost support of the university which I represent in working for the success.</P>

      <P>I am extremely glad to see so many people in this House who have forsaken the nobility of work on the land falling over one another in their desire to support this Bill.  I should also like to join with the Taoiseach and other speakers in thanking our American cousins for their generosity.  To show my appreciation of the lucidity with which the Taoiseach explained the Bill, I shall confine my remarks to five or six minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody in the other House said that what the farmers want is cheap lime, cheap manures and good credit facilities.  That is very true.  They want these.  However, they want more. They want research work.  I think it was Senator O'Brien who asked if research includes marketing.  I hope it does.  There is no use in producing the goods, if the marketing facilities are not right. <Col N="1307" /> We buy from Britain £134,000,000 worth and she buys £99,000,000 worth from us.  If we refer to the other countries we deal with, we find that the discrepancy is much greater.  Some effort should be made to even up these things.  In 1956, we sent £4,000,000 worth of cattle to the Continent.  It was a good job we did so.  It was a good job we had that market, as otherwise the bottom would have fallen out of our own market.  At the same time, however, Britain sent £12,000,000 worth of cattle to the Continent.  I wonder what proportion of those cattle were of Irish origin.  That is a point which should be investigated&mdash;I do not know if &ldquo;research&rdquo; is the correct word-very fully.</P>
    <P>Two items come to my mind which have been responsible for the loss of milions of money to Irish farmers&mdash;contagious abortion in cattle and white scour in calves.  Contagious abortion was brought in by the premium bull, and the premium bull was introduced by the Department of Agriculture to improve the cattle of this country.  The premium bull was a communal bull and contagious abortion followed almost immediately.  It continued for almost 50 years before a remedy was found.  I do not know if it was fair to expect a remedy earlier, but the farmers were clamouring for a remedy for the disease, which was very disturbing.</P>
    <P>White scour in calves followed the coming of the creameries.  There was no pasteurisation of milk and white scour set in almost immediately.  In 1902, the Department of Agriculture brought over a professor from Denmark to look into that disease.  He failed to find any remedy.  It was in 1953 or 1954 that experiments, carried out by the Department of Agriculture in West Limerick and North Cork, yielded a perfect remedy for the disease and, due to that remedy, we have had an increase in our cattle population.</P>
    <P>I shall have to keep my word about speaking for only five or six minutes. I might say that cereal diseases are the bane of the corn-growing farmer-eye-spot, black-stem rust, take-all, and others.  Research into these diseases is very badly needed.  A few years ago, <Col N="1308" /> a wheat-growing farmer woke up one morning and found his crop destroyed overnight by the midge fly.  I think that happened in 1951.  Research is certainly needed in connection with cereal crops.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the beet-growing farmer.  He is at a loss to know how to increase his crop sugar content.  When the beet plant was first introduced, the sugar content was 5 per cent.  Now it varies from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. and some people get 20 per cent. to 22 per cent.  Research work into the sugar content of beet would be very important work.  I am aware that the sugar beet company has one man employed on research work in beet-growing but that is hardly enough, I think, and it could be doubled, trebled or perhaps quadrupled.</P>
    <P>The housing of animals in this country might be described as chaotic. Every farmer is his own architect.  In Holland, the housing of cattle is standardised. It is all of a pattern.  Here, however, there is no method or regularity in the way we house our cattle. Every farmyard presents a different picture.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the director.  We ought to have the best director possible, even if we have to go outside the country to get him-and, when I say that, I am not in any way reflecting on our own scientists.  I know that many of them are men of international repute.  We shall probably be able to find one amongst us, but if there is a better one outside the country.  I think it would not be wrong to bring him in.</P>
    <P>I could refer to the necessity for research in pig-keeping.  There is a disease&mdash;virus pneumonia&mdash;which has robbed pig producers of a good deal of money.  Swine fever also requires research.  In sheep, braxy, twin lamb disease and foot rot occur.  All these diseases need research.</P>
    <P>Having welcomed the Bill, I will now wish it good luck.  The Bill will be what the new council will make it. I do not know whether there is any idea as to how the £840,000 will be spent.  I expect that will be left in <Col N="1309" /> the hands of the council and director to spend as they see fit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Having engaged in farming, among other occupations, all my life, I feel honoured to be in the Seanad when this Bill is being introduced. I also feel honoured in remembering that when our American cousins decided they wished to help us in this respect, they sent a man with Tipperary blood of the name of Carrigan over here to assist us in forming this agricultural institute.</P>
      <P>This evening, there has been considerable talk about marketing.  I personally do not believe this is covered by the scope of the Bill, but I may say, in passing, that I believe it is well covered otherwise and that the Government is mindful of the problem of marketing.  The late Minister for Agriculture set up a committee which is at present functioning on that problem and the Minister for Finance made available in this year's Budget a considerable sum of money for that purpose. I should hate to think that, since there is so much talk about marketing to-day, it might be taken as a panacea. It is a problem which will have to be approached from a practical angle.  The new people who are devoting their minds to it will have to remember that many of those who have spent years at it in practice have a contribution to make also, as well as those new people who are asked in to bring enthusiasm and to look at the problem afresh.</P>
      <P>I believe this Agricultural Institute Bill will cover research in problems such as the investigation of the processes of ancillary industries&mdash;the beet-sugar industry, the bacon industry, the dairying industry, or any industry set up for the purpose of uniform processing or better processing of some agricultural product.  That is not quite clear in the definitions or in Section 4, and I should like to see added in Section 4, after (j) and (k) the words &ldquo;and related subjects.&rdquo; Paragraph (k) deals with publications and it might be no harm if research which might help related subjects were also published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the products of our agriculture be properly <Col N="1310" /> processed and manufactured.  There is a certain amount of overlapping, as we see in the beet sugar industry, in that they do a certain amount of research and field work in agriculture, in advising how the crops should be grown, and so on.  It may be in the background research, in the fundamental research which will take place, that they may come across facets of these subjects which will assist the processing industries.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that we ought to appoint some outsiders on the council.  That would be very desirable and I should like to remind the Seanad that there are many eminent Irishmen who are professors in foreign universities and who are honouring and gracing this country by the fact that they hold these distinctions.  Many of these will probably come back to Ireland again to make their contribution. The idea of a university is that of a place where minds may exchange their views.  If one or two people from outside&mdash;perhaps from Britain or America, or some of the continental countries&mdash;were asked to serve on this institute, and if the Taoiseach could insert a section or sub-section into the Bill to make it possible to pay these people a suitable remuneration, that would be desirable.</P>
    <P>Professor Quinlan expressed the view that each two or three years a rota of members should resign and not be eligible for re-election for a further 12 months.  I think that would be desirable. In the case of the five members&mdash;and perhaps the four from the universities which the Taoiseach mentioned&mdash;other persons may not like to oppose them.  Owing to their great prestige, others may not like to allow their names to go forward against them.  For that reason, this provision may be desirable, particularly in a small country like Ireland, where we all know one another so well and do not want to hurt one another's feelings.</P>
    <P>With regard to fundamental research, it struck me that in our case it may be in a very limited field.  I understand that one of our workers did fundamental research on diseases affecting potatoes.  We do an important export trade in potatoes and have an enormous <Col N="1311" /> reputation for them.  It may be in a small field like that that we may be required to do some fundamental research but generally I think it will be in the interpretation, the application and the dissemination of the knowledge and research of other countries that this institute will be called upon to act.  Apart from research, there is always in agriculture the application to our climatic conditions of information from outside and that opens up to our workers a fruitful and profitable field of activity.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we are very pleased to have the Taoiseach here to explain this measure, with such patience and in such great detail.  I feel that, when he leaves the Seanad, he will believe that the Seanad can make and is making quite a contribution to a Bill of this sort.  In Bills such as this, the Seanad can help the Government of the day and in that way we can make our contribution to the legislation of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Finally, the way this measure has been received and is being unanimously received by the Government, the Opposition and by the farming associations, opens a very bright prospect for the success of this institute.  We all wish this Bill God-speed in the very great work which it will do for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with those who have welcomed this measure, which is designed to promote and finance agricultural research.  It seems to me that its function is actively inspirational, as the duty of the new institute will be not merely to inspire but actively to promote this kind of research for the benefit of our agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to notice that the Taoiseach stressed the value of fundamental research.  It ought to be clear to all of us that fundamental research may, in the long run, be much more valuable to our agriculture than specific research on specific projects.  What we require in the council of the new institute is the spirit of adventure, the spirit of imagination, the spirit that will be prepared to take some risks in <Col N="1312" /> the research field.  It ought to be realised that many absolutely necessary experiments in several fields&mdash;and in this field, in particular&mdash;produce negative results.  I do not think this institute should be stupidly and unfairly attacked on the ground that some of the research it finances and inspires turns out to have negative results.</P>
    <P>I was a little disappointed to hear Senator Hayes suggest that the research should be such as to &ldquo;serve our economic needs&rdquo;.  If that is interpreted too narrowly, I am afraid a lot of valuable research will remain undone, because it may not be possible to see at the beginning just what needs a particular piece of research may serve. I may be misinterpreting Senator Hayes, because he went on to take a broader view in the second part of his speech&mdash; that it is essential this institute should be capable of giving advice, and inspiration, and of encouraging general research as well as individual specific projects.  Senator Ryan, on an earlier Bill this evening, made the point that we should not be afraid of having occasional failures&mdash;that it is better to make some failures than not to make anything.</P>
    <P>I should like just to mention two other points, one briefly, the other at a little greater length.  The first point is the question of the relationship between the chairman and the director of this board.  I am not quite happy about the notion of a director who is not even a member of the council, and his capacity to put up proposals.  I should rather fear his capacity to have them fully implemented, unless he were at least a full member of the council. I should feel happier if he were managing director of the council.  This separation between chairman and director may make for difficulties in practice.</P>
    <P>The other point relates to the practical application of the results&mdash; how are they to be got across to the farmers?  I listened with the greatest interest to Senator O'Brien's speech and in particular to his references to the late Sir Horace Plunkett.  He did not mention, by the way, that Horace <Col N="1313" /> Plunkett was a member of this House, that he was a member of the first Seanad.  It is but fitting that a tribute should be paid to him and to the immense amount of groundwork he did in favour of the notion of co-operation among farmers, which, I fear, has not yet been carried to the point where it ought to be, and where it will be some day.  It is fitting also that mention should be made of the stress he laid upon the value of agricultural education.</P>
    <P>How are the results to be got across to the farmers?  Is it through the Civil Service in the Department of Agriculture?  I see a separation in the Department of Agriculture Civil Service&mdash;as it were, the Civil Service in the field and the Civil Service at the desk.  I fear that the Civil Service at the desk are extremely skilled in showing the value of taking no action. I should not like the council to be inspired by that spirit of excessive caution.  Too much recourse is had to &ldquo;the old methods&rdquo;, and I think we should be prepared to try something new.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service in the field are very well informed and active.  I feel that if they are not chained too closely to the Civil Service at the desk, they will be able to do even better work.  In the Dáil recently, the Taoiseach himself referred to the fact that there is a growing realisation that our own policy on land division has perhaps been carried a little too far.  I should like further thought along those lines.  That is what I have in mind when I speak of new methods rather than of clinging to old ones.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak briefly of primary education and the slant given in primary school textbooks to the child in relation to such subjects as arithmetic.  How often is the rural child asked to make calculations in relation to the emptying and filling of tanks in towns, calculations quite unrelated to rural life?  I have seen in France the rural arithmetic textbooks related to practical calculations in connection with the farms from which the children come.  I should like, accordingly, that we would be more <Col N="1314" /> careful also in our indirect approach to agricultural education.</P>
    <P>One of the best things recently in this country in relation to agriculture is the formation of Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Association. Their aim, and I think they have been very successful in it so far, has been to bring the farmers together, to make them vocal, where necessary, and to allow them to study and discuss matters together.  The farmers themselves are the people who are best able to tell us how to help them.  It is for Macra na Feirme and such organisations to show us how the farmers can be led to co-operate with one another, and, perhaps, to operate pilot farms for the purpose of practical demonstrations and to give practical application to the results of the research that will be carried out under the financial inspiration of the institute.</P>
    <P>It is said that the typical midwestern farmer in the United States says: &ldquo;I'm from Missouri; you gotta show me.&rdquo;  I think that farmers everywhere have got that spirit.  Of course, that is a perfectly legitimate spirit and the best way of bringing the fruits of research to farmers is to show them, on a well run pilot farm, perhaps under private or perhaps under co-operative ownership, under the guidance of Macra na Feirme.  My hope is that the institute will find out and then show our farmers rather than being content to find out and merely tell them.</P>

      <P>At this point, I would ask Senators to keep their eyes on the clock because there is an arrangement by which the Taoiseach is to be given ample time to conclude the debate on this stage of the Bill to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Though other Senators have tried to be brief, when they got under way they were carried away and could not stop.  Like Senator Fearon, I have more American cousins than Irish cousins and therefore I join with other members in expressing appreciation of the generosity of the Government and people of the United States of America.  The moneys for <Col N="1315" /> the establishment of this institute were made available under what was commonly known as Marshall Aid and, in welcoming this Bill, one must reflect that it has been a long time under consideration. Such reflection makes me recollect that originally I had quite a different notion as to the type of foundation we were to have as a result of these moneys being made available.</P>
      <P>I had the general idea originally that a university institute would be founded which would, through the co-ordination of our universities, house the Faculty of Agriculture in this country.  I also had the notion that the functions of the Dairy Science Institute would be vested in this agricultural institute, and had some idea that the functions of our Veterinary College would also be vested in the institute.  I know it was very difficult to plan the project, that many intricate matters arose.  I know now of the difficulties, both large and small, difficulties in relation to policy, in regard to vested interests of individuals and associations of people.</P>
      <P>I do agree with other Senators that any scheme is better than no scheme at all.  Any reasonable scheme, properly prosecuted to finality, is better than all talk and no action.  I feel also that in the institute we will have an instrument through which immense good work can be done for the farming community.  It can be of immense value to the agricultural community and to the Irish nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the actual wording of the measure before us its function would appear to be purely of a research nature.  I want to find out, as do other members of the House, particularly Senator O'Brien, whether that would include market research and marketing which, in my opinion, is very necessary indeed.  I can see the ultimate value of scientific research, but I should not like it to be research for the sake of science or science for science sake.  I feel sure that would not be the approach of the council or of the director but that the research would be of such a nature as would be applicable to the everyday life of the farming community.  In America what is regarded <Col N="1316" /> as scientific research would probably be frowned on by the dons of some of our European universities and the universities of this country.  They appear to have a more practical approach to problems in that regard.  I hope that will be the outlook in this institute.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised of bringing people from outside this country to carry on investigations or to be members of the council.  It would be a great advantage if people of high standing could be brought in, people with specialist knowledge who could be remunerated for their expert advice by the council or by the director.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has also been made that it might be desirable that some of the work would be done by business firms having an interest in scientific matters.  I could envisage firms like the Irish Sugar Company co-operating with the institute in the carrying out of very useful scientific work.  It might also be possible to enlist the assistance of such firms as I.C.I. which, with branches inside and outside this country, has done a tremendous amount of scientific research.</P>
    <P>In regard to premises, there should be a decentralisation of the institute's premises.  I should not like to see a capital sum spent on the erection of one building in one of our major cities, Dublin or Cork.  It should be possible to utilise existing premises in the Department of Agriculture in places like Ballyhaise College, County Cavan, the university colleges in Galway and Dublin and Trinity College.  If a spirit of co-operation existed between these various bodies all the moneys designated for capital expenditure might not have to be used.  However, with the growing demand for premises that might not be possible but in the initial stages useful work could be done by having specific investigations carried out in different places like Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>In view of the limited time available I must curtail my statement, but I want to refer to education.  I agree that there should be co-ordination between the institute and the faculty of agriculture in our universities.  One could go down the line from that and suggest, <Col N="1317" /> with regard to students who intend to take up the study of agriculture in our univerities, that there should be a certain bias towards that subject. I know from experience that people coming from the conventional type of secondary school where they study subjects such as Latin and Greek, are not equipped for the study of agriculture.  Senator Stanford may not like this.  Let me say I have no prejudice again Latin or Greek, but I am convinced that that is not the best type of education for a boy who intends to do agricultural science.  His secondary education must have a slant towards mathematics.  That is why brilliant boys who get the other type of secondary education, which does not envisage the demands of the faculty of agriculture, with a bias towards mathematics and maths. physics, cannot measure up to the required standards. I hope that problem will receive attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel all sides of the House are in agreement with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture as to the goodwill of all Parties in piloting this measure through the Houses of the Oireachtas. It marks an important stage in our agricultural activities.  We all value the great gift of the American Government in making available to us this large sum of money under Marshall Aid.  Following the lengthy arguments of the past two years, it is pleasant to be able to record at this stage that agreement in general has been reached on the outline of this project.  Considering the many interests involved, a certain amount of delay was inevitable. That, incidentally, may have been a good thing in the long run, first, because it enabled the Government and other interested parties to decide the shape of the proposed institute; and, secondly, because it has shown that the ambition of some section to have a completely new departure from established practice in regard to our teaching and advisory services was not feasible in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of using existing establishments to do the work they have been doing and can do in the future is wise. <Col N="1318" /> The proposal in the Bill to found a central body charged with the duty of distributing the results of agricultural research and, wherever possible, to have it done with the least disturbance, is sound.  It follows from what has been said in the Dáil, and here to-night, that the whole scheme as envisaged in this Bill hinges on the council.  On it will depend the potential value of the institute.  I think it is wise to proceed with the means at hand instead of wasting time and treasure on costly buildings which might not, in the long run, be deemed to give a full return for the money spent on them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated that part of the £6,000,000 allocated under the agreement of June, 1954, has been devoted to the ground limestone transport subsidy scheme and part divided proportionately between the bovine tuberculosis scheme and the pasteurisation of milk scheme.  More of the money went towards the promotion of rural organisations as well as the scholarship exchange scheme between here and the United States.  All these schemes are of the greatest importance in promoting the production of our primary products.  In regard to the ground limestone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I am making only a passing reference to it, with respect, if you will allow me to continue.  It has done wonderful work in sweetening up thousands of acres of sour pasture land, the quality of which is still very unequal to the demands of the day.  If we subscribe to the view that early and late grass is the best and cheapest means of producing early beef, then we should set ourselves a target in this sector in order to hold our place in the markets abroad.  With regard to the second point, the eradication of bovine tuberculosis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2, then, deals with research and it is confined to investigation, experiment, analysis and the study of the various activities and sciences related to agriculture.  That would seem to suggest that the institute may not go in for the study of marketing or production methods. Perhaps it may be as well at this stage, if it should deal only with matters directly related to scientific subjects. At this stage, the institute, as envisaged in this Bill, will have a considerable amount of work to keep it going for a long time.  There is some leeway to be made up in soil analysis and the allied subject of plant disease. In this direction, it could do very useful work indeed, between field instructors in conjunction with pilot farms.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I want to refer briefly to the fact that progress in agricultural science, in general, has been greater abroad than here, principally because other countries had the means to devote towards this type of work.  Let us hope that the founding of this institute will give our scientists the same opportunities to pursue their studies as are enjoyed by those engaged on the same subject in other lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say just a few words about one aspect of the work of the council.  I notice in Section 4 that the institute may do &ldquo;all of the following&rdquo;, and then there follows a list of 11 things that the institute may do.  All except nine of these relate to research and it is only the last two sub-sections that deal with the dissemination of the results of research, the publication of the results.  I hope that the council of the institute will pay particular attention to the publication of the results of research. A considerable amount of very valuable research has been done in this <Col N="1320" /> country already.  The Taoiseach said earlier that we are inclined to hide our light under a bushel, and that is so.  I think there is a danger that that state of affairs will continue.  Too little, I believe, has been done to keep those interested, particularly farmers, informed of the results of the research that has been done.  In spite of the fact that we have various magazines, and so on, devoted to agriculture, I do not think the farming community are getting the full benefits of the research that has been done up to now.</P>
      <P>It reminds me a little of what Senator O'Brien said here when we were discussing economic affairs.  He said, when it was suggested that some new commission or new body of experts should be appointed, that, in his opinion, we have had plenty of expert reports, plenty of commissions in this country and that we have been told over and over again what we should do to rectify our economic problems.  What we want, he said, is a Government that will act on the reports.  I may not agree with him entirely in that respect, but I think a somewhat similar situation may arise in a few years' time&mdash;that we will have plenty of research done, an abundance of very valuable information accumulated, but we will not have passed that information on to those who need it.  It is not only a question of finding improved methods for agriculture but of ensuring that these improved methods will be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I speak of the publication of the results of research, I think it is not merely a matter of publishing those results in a cold, precise manner, of publishing something on the lines of the leaflets at present published by the Department of Agriculture.  It is not merely a matter of saying: &ldquo;We published them; they are there and anyone who wants them can pay for them.&rdquo; The council will have to go a little further and publish the results in a widespread and convincing way that will persuade the farmers that the results of the research, the new methods suggested, are worth while and that it will pay them to use them.  I think it would be a great pity and a great waste of effort and money if we found ourselves at the end of five years with a vast accumulation of very valuable <Col N="1321" /> information which nobody was using and which nobody was being persuaded or induced to use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy at the manner in which this Bill has been received by the Seanad.  It is, in truth, a modest proposal.  I was fully aware of that.  The capital sum that is available is small when one considers the cost of any type of building at the present time.  The endowment fund will not yield a very large annual income. So conscious was I of that that, had it been permitted in the early stages when, as one of the members of the Government, I had to consider this matter, I would have wished to devote almost the whole of the £6,000,000 to the institute and to use only a certain fraction of it for capital purposes.  But I understood that was not possible.  Of course various other Departments had their claims in.  The Department of Agriculture was pressing very hard for funds necessary for such purposes as the limestone scheme and the bovine tuberculosis scheme.</P>
      <P>I cannot hope to answer all the points raised in the debate.  In regard to marketing I would have said, as a layman, that there are types of marketing problems which would lie within the competence of the council and the institute such as, for example, how to deliver certain agricultural products in the best condition in foreign markets, or even in home markets.  The marketing of fresh eggs and preserved eggs occurs to me as an example, whether it is a practical one or not.  I know fresh eggs are always preferred to preserved ones but I do not know precisely what the difference is.  But I can imagine, if it were possible to carry out some research which would enable preserved eggs to be indistinguishable in quality from fresh eggs, then I would say that that would lie within the competence of the council and the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is really no need to consider the matter at all in the way I would consider it&mdash;as a layman.  I am assured from the legal point of view that the Bill is sufficiently broad to enable marketing problems to be dealt with by the council.  Personally, if I <Col N="1322" /> were a member of the council, I do not think I would push in that direction so much, especially now that a body is being set up to deal with marketing problems of a different kind and I believe this question should be left to them and that the more scientific type of problem in regard to marketing should be confined to the institute.  I feel Senators can be satisfied that the legal advice I have received shows it is possible, and within the competence of the council and the institute, to deal with marketing problems.</P>
    <P>Some Senator regretted that there was no provision for teaching in the institute, but there is, of course, provision for that type of teaching that goes with advanced study in regard to problems relating to research and that generally means, in all sciences, the highest level of teaching.  You have teaching in the sense of study and the giving of information at the very highest level, and the teaching down along the line leading up to that, of course, is bound to be affected by the teaching at the highest level.  I am quite satisfied that the existence of the institute will have a very great effect on the teaching at the lower levels.  When I say &ldquo;lower levels&rdquo; I am going right down to the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the problem of what direction should be given to our secondary education but I agree with Senators who have said that there should be, in our rural schools, a strong bias towards rural matters.  I found myself very sympathetic to the ideas of Senator Stanford when he suggested that we should have our poets and writers extolling the value of life in the country so that the beauties that really surround young people, beauties unfortunately denied to very many who live in the cities, should be brought prominently to the minds of these young people so that they may appreciate them and appreciate living in the country.</P>
    <P>When I was explaining the working of the institute I forgot to mention that this question of the publication and dissemination of information was of primary importance and the institute can do that work.  To my mind. <Col N="1323" /> there is considerable need to try to ensure that there will be a proper flow of the information, results and ideas that will be produced at the highest level so that these will travel down and ultimately affect the farmers' daily practice.  I am sure that that will be regarded by those in charge of the institute as of primary importance.  The relationship between the advisory services and the institute will of course have to be worked out, and the problem of co-ordination will have to be examined by the institute.  The Government and the Department of Agriculture will be keenly alive to the importance of that also.  They will have to arrange matters so that the information affecting the farmers' everyday procedure will get down to the farms and the farmers.</P>
    <P>I have a number of other notes here but I am afraid it is a case in which one cannot say: &ldquo;An rud a scríonn an púcha léann sé féin é.&rdquo;  I have kept them for reference but I do not think there is any other particular and immediate problem to which I have to pay attention.  I should like to say that there are a few points in the Bill as it stands that I might like to amend when it comes to the Committee Stage, for example, the question of the removal of the director, and the circumstances in which he might be removed. It is easy enough to talk of misconduct and incapacity but these are very narrowly defined&mdash;legally, at least.</P>
    <P>I think that in solving problems of that kind where one can go too far in one direction and not far enough in another, the only safe course to adopt is not to rely on forms of words which have to be interpreted in the law courts but to provide some suitable machinery.  The only machinery that occurs to me at the moment which would be reasonable would be that the director could be removed by the council of the institute with the approval of the Government.  In other words, you would have two bodies involved. For instance, in the case of Parliament, the existence of a Second Chamber solves a problem.  It was found in the Dáil that a percentage <Col N="1324" /> majority was not sufficient and it was decided, quite rightly, that when one has concurrent resolutions in differently constituted Houses one gets the sort of vital human machinery which will solve problems in a way in which one cannot solve them when simply putting down clauses which have to be interpreted subsequently. This is one of the matters at which I would like to have another look.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, too, that there should be some rotation in the membership of the council.  I have a definite leaning towards that.  There should be some method by which membership could be rotated.  Of course, I know the objections to that. Sometimes such an arrangement could deprive a body of some of its best workers, the people most essential to its successful operation.  Therefore, one has to balance that suggestion with the alternative that one might create a body which would grow stale ultimately.</P>
    <P>The personnel of this council will, of course, be nominated by different bodies.  First of all, you will have those directly appointed by the Government, then those nominated by the farming organisations and, thirdly, those who will come from the universities.  Nominating bodies will be conscious of the dangers and will, I am sure, try to resist as far as possible the tendency always to send up the same nominees. Suppose the head of the faculty of agriculture was regarded as the best representative, it might be awkward to have such an individual debarred from consecutive terms of office merely because of the existence of some mechanical rule governing rotation.  I shall give this matter further consideration. I have, of course, considered it already and, as a result of that consideration, I came down on the side of hoping that, because the different nominating bodies would be so diverse themselves, the chances were that there would be a certain amount of change.  However, as I have said, I shall give that matter further consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other point to which I need reply at this stage.  We shall be considering this Bill in Committee and I hope that Senators <Col N="1325" /> who have given thought to this measure will be able to table amendments which will improve the measure.  We shall approach any amendment tabled with a very open mind.  We have only one thing at heart, namely, to make this Bill, when it passes into law, as I hope it will, the type of legislation worthy of the pains that have been taken with it over a long period in an effort to get something really satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to associate myself with the expressions of gratitude here for the gift which enabled this institute to be founded. We are all appreciative of it and we hope that the institute, when founded, will in its operations really reflect the <Col N="1326" /> gratitude we feel and show itself worthy of the generosity which made its foundation possible.</P>
