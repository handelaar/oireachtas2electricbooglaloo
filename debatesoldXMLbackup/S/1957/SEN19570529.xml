      <P>While welcoming the Parliamentary Secretary to the House, I confess I would prefer to have the Minister here at the moment because I am anxious to go back on one point, especially, to which I addressed myself on the Second Reading.  I do not mean the House to infer from what I have said that the Parliamentary Secretary would not be very capable of dealing with this matter.  Like myself, he is a country man; I am sure he knows a good deal about bogs and, accordingly, ought to have some interesting views about their future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is asking authority for a capital sum for the purpose of further development of our peat bogs.  I struck <Col N="56" /> a note of interrogation on the Second Reading and I want to carry the point a little further now, arising out of a reply which the Minister made to me. In my judgment, the time has come when the Minister, whoever he may be, who has the responsibility of dealing with the development of our peat resources, should consider anew the prospects for the future and the policy which is the wisest to pursue.</P>
    <P>That comment is not in any sense a criticism of the idea of utilising our peat resources for the development of electricity or against the notion that the Minister has embodied in the Bill of obtaining further capital for that purpose; but I think those of us who know the vast expanse of peat resources which we have in this country will agree that there is every possibility that, many years before these are exhausted in the production of electricity, new sources of power will be available to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister, at column 51, Volume 48, of the Seanad Debates of 22nd May, 1957, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as the deep midland Bord na Móna bogs are concerned, I think it is far wiser to consider getting the turf off them when it can be done without cost by converting it into fuel rather than contemplating some very expensive reclamation process.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would urge very strongly on the Government that the time has come for a new study of the better utilisation of our bogs.  I do not accept the Minister's view that these midland bogs or the high bogs in the West of Ireland cannot be reclaimed and developed.  The contrary has been proven.  There are thousands of acres to be seen in the Parliamentary Secretary's own county and I am quite certain he has seen them.  It is really a sight for the eye to go into that part of Ireland, and see vast, dreary expanses all round and, miles away, this great green area.  At first, you wonder what it is; then you come close and you realise it is grass growing on thousands of acres of peat bog.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands, perhaps 500,00 acres, of peat bogs will be <Col N="57" /> left undeveloped when new sources of power are available to us.  Certain areas to-day are being exploited for the purpose of the production of power.  In that small pocket in Galway, great work is being done in this type of reclamation which Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann are proving is possible. I think it can be undertaken on a much more vast scale and I would feel that is the view of the future of our bogs which we ought to take now, or at least ought to contemplate taking.  If they are to be properly and economically developed, the study should be made now as to the areas which are to be exploited for fuel resources in the future and those other areas to which we could look as a vast stretch of peat land which can be reformed and rehabilitated and developed into soils which, as I said here the last day, will support animal and man.</P>
    <P>There is work being done in North Mayo.  I have not seen it and do not know the extent of it, but from information available to me, I think good work is being done.  I do not know that anything very new is being discovered, anything that was not known already.  I want to urge strongly that, instead of the Department of Agriculture working in a watertight compartment in Bangor Erris, instead of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann working in another watertight compartment and the Turf Development Board working over the vaster area, a new study should be made of the whole picture.  Then we could see how all the activities could be co-ordinated and correlated so as to get the best out of all the resources, which eventually will be developed by somebody.</P>
    <P>I know the view is held&mdash;and I held it originally myself&mdash;that the only way to have reclamation carried out is to cut the peat off the top of the bogs.  I saw that being done in Kildare, Offaly and elsewhere.  What strikes me about it is that there will then be a vast drainage problem to be contemplated and undertaken.  It may be that when we cut away the peat from the surface, we will be under the water level to such an extent that we must have <Col N="58" /> power available to us to do the pumping, if this residue is to be available at all, either for the cultivation and development of crops or for forestry.</P>
    <P>I cannot speak with any authority on this point as all these aspects form a many-sided problem.  The information ought to be available to us.  I do not know that the Minister or the Department or the country as a whole is trying to look at the picture in the light in which it should be looked, if the best is to be got out of our peat resources for all those who are operating them now and for the people of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say, but I think it is time to say it now.  I feel I am entitled to say it because, as I said on the last occasion, when others had much less faith in the Minister's proposals as originally introduced than they have to-day, I warmly and enthusiastically and cordially backed him in his proposals then.  I watched what has been done with great interest and a degree of pride.  In that sense, I think we should try to look into the future now and freshen our minds again by a new study, which I do not think has been undertaken.</P>
    <P>I say that, in my judgment, the time has arrived when we ought to have enough confidence in the value of our peat resources to spend time and money on them and to get advice wherever it is available to us, so that this vast and valuable source of power and life will not be misused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make an inquiry from the Parliamentary Secretary about the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 1.  As I read it, sub-section (2) provides that the terms upon which moneys which may be borrowed under sub-section (1) of the section may include provisions charging the moneys and the interest upon the property of the board or upon any particular property.  In that respect, I find no objection.  It is a very proper provision.</P>
      <P>However, it goes on to deal with the priorities of other charges which may already be made upon the property of the board and it reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" />&ldquo;...in relation to charges in respect of advances made, whether before or after the passing of this Act, to the board out of the Central Fund and such terms may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment, provide that any charge in respect of money borrowed under this section may rank before or equally with charges in respect of such advances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would seem to me to give specially favoured terms to the moneys borrowed under sub-section (1) of the section.  It seems to me to prejudice the existing priorities in relation to charges already made in respect of moneys advanced to the board and that seems to relate particularly to moneys borrowed from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the necessity for establishing such a priority in respect of moneys to be borrowed under sub-section (1) and I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate the necessity for this provision, which would have the effect, if it were implemented, of wiping out the priorities already existing.  It seems to me to be a bad principle and it seems to run contrary to normal practice&mdash;that where any person has a charge upon any property, a subsequent charge on it can acquire prior right.  That seems to me to be contrary to normal practice in relation to charges upon property and I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate the reason for this provision and the justification for it.</P>

      <P>Gním comhgháirdeachas leis an Seanadóir Baxter as ucht a thogha mar Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel impelled to say that if any other Senator should feel inclined, when Senator Baxter is in the Chair, to emulate his example and make a Second Reading speech on the Committee Stage, I do not think Senator Baxter would permit him to do so. Therefore, Senators should not follow his example too closely.  On the Committee Stage, I do not think it would be proper for me to attempt to make <Col N="60" /> any outline of policy other than what was made by the Minister himself on the Second Reading.  However, let me say on my own behalf and in the name of the Minister, that we have no adverse comment to make on the opinions which the Senator has just expressed.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Seanad that this is not a Bill to outline general turf development policy, or even a Bill to expand capital.  It is a Bill to enable Bord na Móna to get moneys from sources other than those from which they have been getting them heretofore. It enables them to exercise powers such as have been vested in the E.S.B.  I do not think this is a suitable occasion, on the Committee Stage of a Bill, to alter the method of getting their finances, on which I might be expected to add, or could usefully add, anything to what the Minister said on the Second Stage.  I suggest, therefore, that we proceed with the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Yes, but should we not take them <i>seriatim</i>?  I understand Senator O'Quigley dealt with sub-section (2).  I do not know exactly what order is followed in the Seanad on the Committee Stage, but I take it that the same procedure is followed as in the Dáil, and that section after section is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I was not aware of that.  It will be noticed in regard to this matter of priorities that there are enabling powers given and I do not think the Senator is entitled to rush to the conclusion that the priority of charges such as he has outlined <Col N="61" /> is the one that will, in fact, be applied.  This type of phraseology in relation to financial provisions in other Acts is more or less sterotyped and of a stock character and it is being followed here now.  If the Senator will indicate to me that there is some fundamental departure from the usual procedure, I certainly will be willing to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for further consideration.  He has not indicated that any fundamental departure from the usual procedure is being followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I am not sufficiently familiar with these provisions in other Acts to say that this is a stereotyped procedure which is being adopted in regard to the establishment of priorities.  From my own knowledge of the position with regard to charges upon any property, it does seem to me that this is a departure from normal procedure.  It was for that reason that I spoke on the matter and inquired what was the justification or the need for it.  I am not entirely satisfied that this is justified.  It seems to me that it has been incorporated in this Bill because of the circumstances of its introduction, namely, that Bord na Móna is being entitled under the Bill to borrow moneys from sources other than those from which it was customary or previously entitled to borrow.  It seems to me that it is for the purpose of attracting capital from this unusual source that this special provision has been incorporated, so that these new sources which may be lending money to Bord na Móna will be assured that their loans are being protected.  That seems to be the purpose of the section&mdash; to give assurance to these new lenders that they will have a first charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it does not necessarily follow from what is contained in the sub-section that existing priorities will be disturbed, but the power is none the less there.  The power may be exercised not by virtue of any regulation or Order which this House or the other House of the Oireachtas will have an opportunity of commenting on, but merely by virtue of some terms or prospectus that may be issued by <Col N="62" /> Bord na Móna, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be going very far to say, despite anything in any other enactment to the contrary, that, by virtue of the publication of terms, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, existing priorities could be wiped out and priority given to the lender of money under sub-section (1).  It seems to me to be a very radical departure and it is certainly a departure from the established law with regard to ordinary charges on any kind of property.  It is a matter upon which I think the House would be entitled to more information from the Parliamentary Secretary and he might be able to give an indication that such information will be forthcoming at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator state that priorities already established can be wiped out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question generally, is it not so that a lender of large sums of money will acquaint himself with the conditions under which he is to lend the money and assure himself on the points raised by the Senator? As the Seanad knows, the board has received a loan of a considerable sum from a commercial firm.  This Bill will secure the repayment of that sum. I take it that that commercial firm satisfied itself that the conditions of repayment would be reasonably satisfactory and I am quite satisfied that, in any further negotiations, they will also take similar precautions to see that loans are safeguarded.  After all, the State is the pillar upon which the activities of this board rests, the same as many other similar boards.  I think the experience and history of these boards have already established a considerable degree of confidence in the lending public in regard to their integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know exactly what detailed degree of guarantee the Senator wants.  It seems to me that the same <Col N="63" /> type of phraseology has been used here as is used in similar financial sections and I think it should be satisfactory to all concerned.  However, I will have the Senator's remarks on the matter brought to the Minister's notice.</P>

      <P>One is an amendment of the other.  I do not think that for practical purposes they can be very well segregated.  Article 5 of the parent Order is being removed.  The purpose of Article 5 was to enable the <Col N="64" /> exporters of goods in the manufacture of which sugar is used to import sugar at world prices and so be in a position to compete with similar manufacturers from other countries in the world market.</P>
      <P>The reason for its removal in the amending Order is largely due to the fact that the world price of sugar has been rising and, therefore, there is no inequality between our price and the world prices of sugar.  The facility afforded to the manufacturers of sugar-containing goods here is no longer required.  That, in a few words, is the sense and purpose of the Order and I do not think there is anything further I can usefully add to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled by the feeling that it is necessary to rescind Article 5 of this Order which comes before us for the first time to-day.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us the reason is that the world price of sugar is going up and that, therefore, there is no longer any point in permitting the import of sugar under licence; but the Order, as it stands before us, is simply a permitting Order and the Minister would have to give his certificate before such sugar could be imported.  I fail to see the necessity for immediately rescinding Article 5 for the reason stated.  It does not seem to me to be a sufficient reason to rescind the granting to the Minister of the power under certain circumstances to allow the import of sugar at world prices.  I was a little surprised to hear that the world price of sugar is more or less the same as the home price.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary like to quote a figure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is still a margin, as it were.  There is something Gilbertian about our procedure.  We are asked to confirm an Order and, when we confirm it, we are asked to revoke portion of it.  It is like the old <i>Dublin Opinion</i> picture of a treaty conference at which one delegate said: &ldquo;Don't tear up the treaty yet.  I haven't signed it.&rdquo;  It seems to me that in respect of these Orders we are doing something somewhat similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> I cannot see what embarrassing situation is created by leaving in Article 5, even though it might not be used at the moment.  It is quite possible that the world price of sugar may go down again, in which case we would have a further Order introducing something like Article 5 again.  On the other hand, if we leave Article 5 in as it is now, all that it does is to give certain power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which he may or may not have to use.  Rescinding the Order, on the facts stated, does not seem to be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason this Order was made last December was that people were not satisfied with the conditions under which the monopoly importation of sugar was carried on at the time.  I have not seen the debate in the other House on the new Order.  The Irish Sugar Company has had a monopoly of the importation of sugar here since the Act was passed in 1936.  Under that Act, there was only one importer of sugar, that is, the Sugar Company.  Some complaints were made to the Government by certain responsible firms in regard to the conditions imposed on them by the Sugar Company.  These conditions were not satisfactory and the Government made this Order in the interests of private enterprise.  It was a perfectly proper Order to make.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the circumstances have been since which have led the new Taoiseach to rescind a part of the old Order or what the change is for.  I thought I would explain why the Order was made in December.  It was made in the interests of private enterprise.  The firms engaged in the export industry were not satisfied with the price and the conditions under which they were getting sugar from the Sugar Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know there is a great tendency on the part of State companies &mdash;the Sugar Company is not the only company&mdash;when they have the monopoly, to put on people conditions that business people would not regard as reasonable.  I am not passing judgment at all on this case because I do not remember the details, but I remember <Col N="66" /> the circumstances in which the Order was made.  Whether it had anything to do with the price of the sugar, I cannot say.  I think it had to do with the price at which people were obtaining sugar.  I think there were other conditions also, apart from the price&mdash;dissatisfaction in the case of certain firms&mdash;and that was the reason the Government of the day made the Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many different types of sugar.  I presume the sugar referred to in the parent Act is cane sugar or beet sugar.  In Article 3 of this Order, it says that: &ldquo;The importation into the State of sugar not manufactured or produced in the State is hereby prohibited.&rdquo; Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell me what that means?  Suppose you start making milk sugar, does it mean it cannot be imported?  A man could also start making starch sugar or glucose. I think it would really be much better if the definition of sugar were made more precise in the specification in this Order and sugar were described as cane or beet sugar, which I presume it means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what Senator O'Donovan has said, I am a little unhappy about the removal of this fifth part of the Order.  Does it mean that if we rescind this part of the original Order the sugar company will regain a monopoly over the importation of sugar?  If that is so, it is a grave matter.  Senator O'Donovan also said that some firms have expressed the opinion that it put a disadvantage upon them.  We should be quite clear on these points before we make a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington as to the sense of coming in here to confirm an Order and, at the same time, to amend it, perhaps I should advert to the fact that an Order is allowed to run for six months before confirmation becomes necessary.  There must have been some reason for fixing a period of six months.  I take it that the reason was that some changes might emerge as desirable during the course <Col N="67" /> of the six months and that, on confirmation of the Order, effect might be given to them.  I think the amending Order really just does that.</P>
      <P>No disadvantage is being caused to the commercial users of sugar by this amendment.  For Senator O'Donovan's information, perhaps I should say that the extent to which the facility was availed of was very small indeed, which shows that, in fact, there was no hardship in what has been described as the &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo;.  It is true that the Sugar Company were the sole authority that could import sugar.  To that extent, if one likes to apply the term &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo;, it is applicable. However, it has been the position all down the years.  Now, with the equality in world prices as compared with our own price so that the consequent disadvantage which an inequality would impose on our manufacturers no longer exists, and as there is not any reason for this certifying of importers other than the Sugar Company, I do not think there is anything in the facts behind these Orders which would warrant any sort of apprehension whatsoever.</P>
      <P>The flexibility of making such Orders is, in itself, a guarantee that any untoward situation that may arise in relation to the manufacture of sugar-containing goods can be just as easily dealt with in a subsequent Order as is now being done in respect of this Order.</P>

      <P>The fact that very few importations were made under this Order does not prove anything, for the very reason that once the Order was made these firms had the right to go elsewhere.  In other words, the company was brought to heel in relation to the importation of sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that perhaps only a few cwt. or even only a few lb. were brought in under it does not prove anything at all.  My recollection is that when the Government made this Order in December, there was a good deal more to it than the question of the price of sugar.  There were other conditions as well.  I am not familiar at the moment with the way in which <Col N="68" /> the trend of sugar prices on the world markets has moved.  However, this is an enabling Order and why do away with an enabling Order?  Who made the representations that it be revoked? Why is it being revoked?  We have not been told any of these things.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that the price of this or that has taken a certain turn, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the power, under the first Order, to act as he likes.  He is now being deprived of that power.  It is putting back the complete monopoly into the hands of the Sugar Company. I take it that the Government of the day&mdash;who at that time had been nearly three years in office-did not just make this Order on the spur of the moment or out of chagrin.  I think they had good reasons for doing so and certainly my recollection is that they had.  I take it, also, that the Government of to-day have good reasons for making the revoking Order, but we have not heard them.</P>

      <P>I accept that there were good reasons for making the Order, but these reasons no longer obtain.  The occasion of confirmation has just been used to amend the Order. There is nothing more to it than that. The quantity of sugar affected by Article 5 of the parent Order was very slight and had no bearing whatsoever on the Sugar Company's dealings in sugar.  If the reasons which operated to produce Article 5 of the parent Order should again supervene, then a new Order can be made.</P>

      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what danger would ensue if the powers which Article 5 gives to the Minister for Industry and Commerce were to continue to be vested in him?  That seems to me to be the point at issue. We are asked, in revoking Article 5, to remove certain powers from the Minister.  That is all it does.  What danger would reside in continuing to vest those powers in him?</P>

      <P>I cannot indicate any danger.  All I say is that the reasons for the making of the Order no longer exist and that, in so far as the best <Col N="69" /> advice indicates, the position will improve in favour of home manufacturers using sugar in their manufacturing processes.  The occasion of confirmation of the original Order is just being used to insert an amendment which gives effect to the facts of the situation as it now exists.</P>

      <P>Having listened to this discussion, I should say that there seems to be something which has not been brought out here.  As a protagonist, always, of private enterprise, may I point out that at the moment there is in existence a Fair Trade Commission inquiring into restrictive practices and monopolies?  It would seem that this Order is giving the Sugar Company a monopoly.</P>
      <P>We frequently hear about the great success of State companies as against the so-called &ldquo;failure&rdquo; of private enterprise. These State bodies can be a great success when they are in a position to have monopolistic control of markets.  It seems fair comment on this particular Order that we should be very careful.  We should like to hear more about cases where monopolies are being given to State bodies, whereas private enterprise is supposed to trade in the open market and under a Fair Trade Commission.</P>

      <P>What effect will this have on the chocolate crumb industry? The success of that industry is tied up entirely with the price at which that industry can purchase raw sugar.  If they cannot purchase it at the right price, they cannot compete in the world market with that very important product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not have any adverse effect.  They will get their sugar at a price that will enable them to compete with similar manufacturers from other countries.</P>
      <P>As regards the monopoly element, that does not apply at all in this case for the reason I have given, that the trend of imported sugar prices is such as to nullify any advantage of monopoly.  It is because of that that our manufacturers no longer require protection.</P>

      <P>If the terms of trade run otherwise, it means that the Government may have to revoke that Order in order to allow these manufacturers to buy sugar at the imported price.  That might take a month or two and this very large, important industry has to wait while the Government is revoking the Order.  If they did not bring in the Order at all, the whole procedure would be unnecessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>No; we are not making any such suggestion.  We are suggesting that a monopoly is being given to a State body for the importation of sugar and nobody allowed to buy, except with the acquiescence of that body.  That is a bad principle and I think people on the Senator's side of the House will agree with that.  All we are saying is that we would like to hear more on this question.  We have not had a full explanation.  Maybe the Parliamentary Secretary has not had a proper brief.  He may have been handed this as he came into the House to-day.  If that is the case, perhaps it is not fair to question him, but we are doing so in good faith.  We are not challenging the Government.  The Government has made some statement recently with which I agree, that it is about time we cleared up the decks in this country and got going on purely business lines.  I think monopolies, whether by private enterprise or State bodies, are bad for business and for our future economic position.  It is in that spirit we are asking this question. Perhaps it is not a good idea to have this Order and there might be second thoughts on not giving the Sugar Company a monopoly.</P>

      <P>Nobody can object to the general remarks on monopolies. Nobody likes them and nobody wants them.  I do not think anybody has ever recommended them, except where some vital interest required them.  We must remember that the monopoly, as we know it in relation to sugar, has a very close relation with an important agricultural industry for the production of beet.  I take it it is no different from the protection afforded to other agricultural and industrial activities in this country over the past 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the monopoly on sugar imports affecting manufacturers, I do not think there is anything I can say <Col N="72" /> to emphasise what I have already said, that the retention or the removal of this Order does not adversely affect their interests in any way.</P>
