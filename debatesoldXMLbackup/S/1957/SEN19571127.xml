      <P>Mar is eol do Sheanadóirí, ó bhí an Seanad ina shuí go deiridh, fuair an Seanadóir Seán Ó Maoláin, an tAire Talmhaíochta, bás. Ba duine é an Seanadóir a thuill cliú agus cáil mhor.  Thuill sé iad de thoradh a stuama agus a chalmachta mar shaighdiúin sa gcogadh a troideadh ar son saoirse na tíre.  Thuill sé iad ar an stuaim a bhain leis mar Theachta Dála agus mar bhall den Rialtas. Thuill sé iad ara dhílseacht do chúis teanga agus saoithiúlachta a thíre&mdash; agus fós ar an bhféile, ar an gcarthanacht, ar an gcáirdeas agus ar an gcneastacht a roinn go buan leis ó nádúr.</P>
      <P>Bhí ríméad ar an uile dhuine againn ocht mí ó shin nuair tháining an scéala amach go raibh beartaithe ag an Taoiseach Seán Ó Maoláin a cheapadh ina Sheanadóir agus ina Aire Talmhaíochta. Ba bhall oirdhearc den Seanad é agus ba Sár-Aire é.  Bhí fhios againn, ó thús, go mba taca mór dúinn sa Tigh seo é go mórmhór de bhárr na spéise móire a bhí aige i ngnóthaí parlaiminte agus de bhárr an chleachta mhóir a bhí aige mar Theachta Dála, mar Rúnaí Parlaiminte agus mar Aire, ar aireachtaí éagsúla Stáit.</P>
      <P>Níor gheall Dia, áfach, go mbéadh cabhair a intinne géire aibidhe againn ar feadh i bhfad.  Is mór é ár gcailliúint sinne anseo sa Seanad, is mór é cailliúint an Rialtais agus is mór é cailliúint na tíre fré chéile é a bheith imithe uainn.  Is mór é bris a mhná céile agus bris a chlainne agus ní maith linne a mbris.  Solas na bhflathas go raibh aige.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for office workers protection similar in character to that provided for industrial workers by the Factories Act in regard to such matters as cleanliness, temperature, lighting and general safety of the places where they work.  As the title suggests, the Bill concerns itself with the physical conditions in offices, and places on occupiers an obligation to provide safe and healthy offices for their workers.  It also gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to go beyond that general obligation by making regulations which will prescribe in a detailed way the standards to be observed in particular instances.  In making these regulations the Minister will have the assistance of a representative advisory council to be set up under the legislation and in fact he will be obliged to <Col N="798" /> consult the advisory council before making any such regulations.</P>
      <P>When the Factories Act was being framed, we could draw on our long experience of the operation of legislation relating to factories.  We were able to turn for guidance to the legislation of other countries and approach the whole task of framing the Bill in the realisation that we could make a fairly good job of it.  The preparation of legislation for office workers was an entirely different matter.  So far as can be ascertained, there is no similar legislation elsewhere and there is no I.L.O. Convention on the subject.  I should add that we have sought the advice of a number of interested bodies.  In some cases there was a notable lack of comment, but in other cases some useful proposals have been made, a number of which were incorporated in the Bill during its passage through Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>With the text of the Bill an explanatory memorandum was circulated, but there are one or two points I should like to underline at this stage.  The Bill will apply to offices in which there are more than five clerical workers employed.  We are, so to speak, feeling our way on this initial attempt to legislate for office workers and the obligations imposed by the Bill may involve expenditure by occupiers and owners in many cases.  While that expenditure will, perhaps, press fairly lightly on the larger and more solvent concerns, there is a danger that if the Bill were to be applied to smaller concerns some of them might decide to disemploy one or two workers rather than to face up to expenditure on improvements and to the prospect of inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point which I wish to make is about enforcement.  It is not proposed to set up for the purpose of this Bill a new and separate inspectorate for its enforcement.  Offices in factories and Government offices will be inspected by officers attached to the existing factory inspectorate in the Department of Industry and Commerce. In the case of all other offices the Bill proposes to place responsibility for enforcement on the various sanitary authorities throughout the <Col N="799" /> country.  On the whole, this is the best arrangement to make, and, in any event, it is desirable to avoid amendments which will involve additional administrative costs.</P>
    <P>The Bill was welcomed generally in the Dáil and can be regarded as an agreed measure.  The text is similar to that which was circulated in February last by the previous Government. The amendments, which were relatively few in number, were, for the most part, incorporated so as to give effect to suggestions made by Chambers of Commerce and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>I think we should approach this first piece of legislation for office workers with the aim of having a practicable, workable and reasonable measure rather than that we should strive towards some theoretical ideal which may be unattainable in practice, or try to draft a code to regulate in every detail the working conditions of office staffs.  If we can secure an effective measure which will deal in a reasonable way with matters of health, safety and welfare for office workers, we will have done all that is practicable in present circumstances, and hence it is that I recommend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I am glad that the Minister took up the measure which had got its First Reading under the previous Government. I am glad that at last steps are being taken to regulate conditions in offices.  I cannot agree, I am afraid, with the Parliamentary Secretary in his hesitant approach to this problem and in what I thought was a plea that we should not improve or amend this Bill.  As a Bill, it is a good Bill, but I think that it can be considerably improved in Committee Stage.  I have spoken about a hesitant approach and it seems to me that in drawing up the Bill there was that hesitant approach&mdash;a rather negative attitude to problems instead of laying down, where necessary and proper, definite standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember, when speaking on the Factories Bill in this House in 1955, making a very strong plea that it <Col N="800" /> should be extended to Government offices.  I listed the items that were provided for in that Bill and said that they could quite easily be applied to offices as well.  As always, the Chair was kind to me, even though, when I think of it now, I am sure I was quite out of order in talking about offices when dealing with that Factories Bill. It comes to my mind now that we might take a useful lesson from what is in the Factories Act.  In that piece of legislation, very firm provisions are laid down.  I think we could examine the Office Premises Bill side by side with the existing legislation in regard to factories.</P>
    <P>All of us will agree that what is regarded as good and proper for the manual worker in the factory should be equally given to his colleague working in the office.  Putting those two pieces of legislation side by side, we can considerably improve the Bill now before us.  Obviously, I do not want to enter into detailed criticism of the Bill because I think it is a measure which would properly be dealt with on Committee, taking the various sections one after another; but there is one major criticism I must make.  It is the fact that this Bill will apply only to offices employing a minimum of six.</P>
    <P>All of us will appreciate and know from experience that in quite a large number of factories&mdash;unfortunately we have not a great number of large establishments&mdash;no more than four or five clerical workers are employed.  It is proposed here that the legislation shall not apply to such offices.  The factory in the same building is covered by the Factories Act, but the office will be excluded. I have experience of dealing with conditions in offices, and it has been my experience that it is easier to deal with conditions where there is a big body of clerical staff employed. You generally find that conditions in such offices are fairly good.  I am not talking of Government offices.  Where the office is a small one, employing two or three clerks, then you find that conditions are bad.  There is no adequate heating, the windows do not open&mdash;if you can see them with the dirt&mdash;and offices like those are generally regarded as not being important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> I had hoped that the legislation, when it would eventually be introduced, would help the people employed in such small offices.  Instead, we now find a line being drawn.  They are excluded and I am making the point that from my experience&mdash;and I think it would be the experience of other Senators, too&mdash;that it is those small offices which are most in need of protection by legislation.</P>
    <P>I have said that this Bill needs improvement and I do not wish to weary the House by making the arguments which I hope to make in Committee in regard to the various provisions; but I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that an appeal that this measure should go through, that it is experimental, will fall on deaf ears, I am afraid, certainly with me.  It is not that much of an experiment at all.  We have data on which to go.  There is the Gowers Committee Report in Britain; there are various publications by the I.L.O.; and we have the experience of the Factories Acts.  If a minimum temperature is laid down for a factory, there is no reason why the same minimum temperature should not be laid down for the office attached to that factory.  That sort of comparison and argument can be carried right through this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak but I should like to make a few remarks.  First of all, I understand that one of our Senators has in mind an amendment or two, but he is absent to-day owing to illness.</P>
      <P>This Bill was prepared by the previous Government.  I can assure Senator Murphy that this question of excluding certain offices, and where the exclusion would start, under this Bill, was given prolonged consideration. Many moderately-sized shops employ two or three clerical workers.  Are those shops to be involved in considerable expense&mdash;if we take the grocery business, it is not too profitable a business at present, I think we all agree&mdash;or are they to be put to extra expense for two or three clerical workers, where very often the facilities are available privately in the house, or something like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Murphy, <Col N="802" /> I regret to say, in regard to the big offices, that they are necessarily very suitably provisioned in this respect. Naturally, one does not wish to give definite instances, but I must say that I was extremely shocked on one occasion recently by the manner in which the workers were crowded into a very big office.  Therefore, it is not quite correct to say that the big offices are invariably good in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the whole, we welcome the Bill. As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it is initial legislation in this country, unlike the Factories Acts, which go back more than 100 years.  I understand one of our Senators will put down an amendment or two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill, designed to safeguard the health of office workers, it gives me great pleasure that Ireland should make the first move in introducing legislation so necessary for a class of worker who hitherto has been overlooked in occupational reforms.  Office workers, as is well known, are a class of persons who have suffered gravely from serious ill-health because until now the law has offered no protection to them in such essential things as sanitary accommodation, heating, ventilation, lighting, structural safety and so on.</P>
      <P>The Bill now before us is no doubt a beginning, but it suffers from the very serious defect to which Senator Murphy has referred, that it does not apply unless there are more than five employees in an office.  It is well known that, even in the very heart of Dublin, there are offices of the most unsuitable kind, in which the health and safety of employees are entirely disregarded and in some cases where there is no sanitary accommodation even within the building itself.  There are no washing facilities there, and no regard to heating, ventilation, lighting or even to ordinary cleanliness.  Quite prosperous businesses are being carried on in and from such offices and simply because there was no law covering them, the proprietors did not think it worth their while to expend a little money in providing facilities which the law did not demand from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, these offices have one, <Col N="803" /> two or maybe three persons and as the Bill stands, no change whatever in their conditions will take place.  They are entirely excluded from the Bill. To my mind, this is a very serious exclusion, because it leaves out the very premises where the gravest abuses take place.  Offices such as I have described are generally of the type where the employees have no protection by way of trade unions and they run a serious risk of dismissal, if they so much as put in the slightest complaint about such matters.</P>
    <P>As has been said already in the Dáil, the large offices employing large staffs are generally run in a quite satisfactory manner and so far as they are concerned, this Bill makes no difference to them.  I would, therefore, press on the Minister, through his Parliamentary Secretary, to make the Bill applicable to all offices employing any number of persons on clerical work.  I can see no merit whatever in passing this Bill as it stands at the moment, on a sort of promise that some time in the future we might widen it to cover offices employing a lesser number of persons.  Too many persons are liable to lose their health in the interval.</P>
    <P>The necessity for paragraph (e), sub-section (2) of Section 3 rather puzzled me.  I should like the Minister to say in what circumstances he might desire to exclude &ldquo;a premises or class of premises&rdquo; other than those mentioned, from the scope of the Act.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Bill applies to offices in the occupancy of the State; but Section 4 gives power to the Minister to exempt from the provisions of the Bill, in case of a public emergency, any office where work is being done on behalf of the State.  I should like to know what kind of an emergency is visualised.  In recent times, what we came to know as an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; covered a period of about six years.  I do not think it would be fair that civil servants should be expected to work under bad conditions, likely to injure their health, for such a long period.  If such a provision is felt necessary in the Bill, there <Col N="804" /> should be some limit to the time during which, even in an emergency, civil servants would be expected to work under bad conditions.</P>
    <P>Most of us are aware of the frequent complaints from civil servants working in crowded rooms, in what might be called reconditioned rooms in houses never intended to be used as offices, where there is poor lighting and where the ventilation and heating leave very much to be desired.  It would be right to say there have been over the years complaints from Civil Service organisations directing attention to the high incidence of ill-health, especially among young civil servants, attributable to such unsatisfactory conditions in buildings.  Dublin Castle, which houses a good number of civil servants, is described not only as entirely unsuitable for offices, but in fact in many ways it is completely dangerous.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the most important thing necessary to make this Bill a really effective measure for the protection of the large number of persons working in offices, particularly those working under unsuitable conditions, is that it should be made to apply to all offices irrespective of the number of employees.  I ask the Minister, through the Parliamentary Secretary, if he will look into the provisions again from the point of view of the health of the employees and not from the point of view of the cost or inconvenience of the people who own the offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at Senator Murphy's effort to throw cold water, more or less, on this Bill, and at some of the statements which were made by Senator Miss Davidson.  I welcome the Bill and regard it as an excellent piece of progressive legislation, adding another rung to the ladder of our social code for the protection of workers.  We must remember, despite what Senator Murphy said, that it is a piece of pioneering and experimental legislalation. One would imagine that no thought had been given to the Bill, or that the fact that it did not apply to certain offices with a certain minimum number of staff meant that it was not fully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> I have the recollection that this Bill has been on the way and under discussion since last February, when it was first introduced and circulated by the previous Government.  The Second Stage of the Bill was taken in the Dáil early in May.  There has been quite a lot of discussion in political and labour circles on the various sections of the Bill since then.  Any organisations affected were asked for their views, and the time in which the Bill was under consideration was considerably extended to enable any organisation interested to present its views.  Many of them did so and I cannot understand Senator Murphy's innocence in regard to that aspect of the question.</P>
    <P>He lamented the hesitant and negative attitude of the Minister in drawing up the Bill.  It is a serious and praiseworthy attempt to give to office workers, a much neglected class, the same type of protection as is afforded to factory workers.  The fact that it applies only to premises housing five and more persons is something that must be taken at a valuation, having regard to the fact that it is experimental legislation and that there was nothing to use as a guide before it was drawn up.</P>
    <P>There is no reason in the world why, any more than in regard to any other enactment in our social code, when experience has shown how it is working and the difficulties which have to be surmounted, the Act, as we hope it will then be, will not be made to apply to the type of office which Senator Murphy and Senator Miss Davidson have in mind.  I certainly should like to congratulate the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on having introduced this Bill and I hope the Seanad will give every assistance in expediting its passage into law and in helping to do long delayed justice to a section of workers whose interests have been sadly neglected in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, I should like to say that we welcome this Bill.  We see little in it to which any employer would object.  In fact it struck me, while some of the Senators <Col N="806" /> were addressing the House and praising the introduction of social legislation of this sort, that many employers to-day feel these things are not really necessary.  People who manage their businesses well and who like to get efficiency know that, in their own interests, good conditions for office workers and industrial workers run parallel with good output and good products.  In fact most employers to-day study the type of conditions in which office workers and others will have to pass their employment.  Not alone do they study such things as are provided in this Bill, elementary sanitary accommodation and so forth, but they study the colour schemes to be used in offices and factories to promote better work and give a better environment, so that we, as a people, will be able to produce goods and services efficiently and compete in the world markets.  If we are not able to complete in these markets we will not be able to enjoy the standards of living that the people want.</P>
      <P>It is in a way, if you like, rather an anomaly that labour representatives and others to-day are interested in social legislation and the employers see some of the things the classical communists saw in the past, the withering away of the State.  They see the lack of necessity for these things because they have gone further ahead in their approach to these problems. When the Factories Act was first introduced, the Minister said that everything in the Act had been anticipated and put into effect years before by progressive employers.  The same thing applies to this type of Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the smaller offices where three, four or five persons are working, I think that when they see the benefits arising from the good conditions laid down in this Bill for the larger offices, there will not be any need to introduce regulations for them. It would be a great thing to see, in regard to the many pieces of legislation, progressive or otherwise, which we have passed, year by year, fewer officials necessary, because employers and workers who are sharing in helping to give us prosperity, would see it was in their own interests to have <Col N="807" /> these conditions which are for the benefit of all the people, rather than that such conditions should have to be prescribed by Order or Acts of Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill also.  Any criticisms I have to make of it will be solely on the question of its scope being somewhat limited by certain sections.  I think it is obvious that we all welcome the general principles of the Bill and the fact that the Government has seen fit to introduce it.  It is, therefore, on the question that has been mentioned by several Senators&mdash;how far this Bill ought to extend its protection and over how many workers&mdash;that I should like to say something.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan, speaking in relation to Section 3, which excludes from the provisions of this Bill any office with five or less clerical staff, made the point that this, perhaps, would apply to small shops which might not be able to go to the expense of supplying the various safeguards required. The various things required are that the workers shall not be overcrowded, shall have enough air to breathe, shall have sufficient sanitary accommodation, washing facilities and so on.  It seems to me an odd argument to say that we must deprive certain workers of these things because their employers could not afford to give them to them.  In other words, in order to keep certain employers in business, you have got constantly to sacrifice the health of their workers.  I wonder is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that that is what was intended.  I feel it would be a dangerous principle to admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that if the small businessman is not in the way of ensuring decent, human conditions for his workers such as are provided for in this Bill, then he should not be in that business.  It is sometimes claimed, I think wrongly, in relation to the grocery shops that Senator O'Donovan mentioned, that certain cut price establishments exploit the workers, underpay them and so on. Usually this is hotly denied on the other side.  I feel that Senator O'Donovan's speech has tended to <Col N="808" /> condone that type of exploitation whether it now exists or not.  I should be very emphatically on the side of Senators Murphy and Miss Davidson on the point that this excluding sub-section (2) of Section 3 should not be there at all.  I think we ought to be able to extend reasonable safeguards, minimum provisions, under this Bill, to all clerical workers, however they are employed, whether there are two, three, four, five or six in an office.</P>
    <P>I can think of only one provision in this Bill which might be regarded as unreasonable in the case of small offices, and that is Section 23 which provides for facilities for &ldquo;preparing and taking meals.&rdquo;  All the other provisions seem to me to be quite reasonable to be required for a staff of one, two, three, four or five.  It is not only in the offices of factories that you might have office conditions obtaining which ought to be deplored. Senator Miss Davidson has pointed out that there are a great number of small offices in Dublin where the conditions are not such as might be desired.  I think perhaps Senator Mullins misunderstood Senator Murphy who made the point that it is precisely to the workers in the smaller offices that protection should be given.  His point was that those workers are, on the average, less well organised and less well able to defend themselves than the workers in the bigger offices.  I do not think he suggested that all big offices are properly run, but that the workers in bigger offices tend to be better organised on the average.</P>
    <P>When Senator Mullins spoke of the text of this Bill being widely discussed and widely circulated to the organisations affected, it seemed to me that even some of the workers' organisations might not be quite as concerned about the workers in the smaller offices where they might not be organised.  I find myself unmoved, furthermore, by being told in this House that this matter has already been thrashed out in other places, and that therefore we need not think that we can amend it.

      <P>I regret if I misunderstood the Senator.  He expresses surprise at &ldquo;the innocence&rdquo; of Senator Murphy in rising now to suggest certain things when these had not previously been suggested.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what is the explanation underlying certain clauses, before reaching a decision regarding amendments. In Section 3, sub-section (3), I notice that the Act will not apply, according to paragraph (a), to premises occupied by the Defence Forces.  I should like to know if these conditions, in such offices adjoining barracks and so on, are already legislated for by other legislation, or whether it is that we do not care what becomes of clerical staff in barracks?  We are concerned with other Government offices, and I should like to know we are not concerned with the Defence Forces. There may be some very good answer to these points.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) says that this Act shall not apply &ldquo;to premises used substantially as a private residence or for private domestic purposes&rdquo;.  I should like the House to remember that, in any event, this Bill, as at present drawn, applies only to places with offices of a clerical staff of six or more people.  Even where there are six or more people, the Act will not apply to those six or more working in &ldquo;premises which are substantially a private residence&rdquo;.  Six or more people working in any office should not be protected, apparently, because &ldquo;the premises are used substantially as a private residence or for private domestic purposes&rdquo;.  I should like to hear some comment from the Parliamentary Secretary on what necessity he sees for removing the protection of this Bill from such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, in relation to that sub-section, the point made by Senator Miss Davidson was that she noted that some &ldquo;premises or classes of premises&rdquo;, according to paragraph (e), <Col N="810" /> may be &ldquo;exempted&rdquo; from the provisions of this Act by the Minister.  I see a danger here.  I am afraid of granting such powers of exemption without any standards or provisions being laid down, of simply giving a blank cheque to the Minister to allow exemption of certain classes of premises.  I have a feeling that a lot of the Act falls to pieces if, having drafted it carefully and showing what it will apply to, we include this clause. Even though it may appear to apply to certain firms, we give the Minister power to exempt any particular premises, and any class of premises which he feels like exempting.  I do not know what other Senators feel about this blank cheque being asked for, but I for one would like to hear along what lines the Minister is thinking, when he asks for that odd sort of power.</P>
    <P>Similarly in regard to Section 9, which deals with overcrowding in offices, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what kind of standards he has in mind in relation to sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section. We are told that the Minister may prescribe regulations as to the minimum space standards and so on.  I do not know whether the Minister would care to give us now the amount of cubic space provided in other Acts, what kind of standards he has in mind, and how he will arrive at the kind of standards which are to be laid down in the regulations under Section 9?</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the provision of suitable sanitary conveniences for people employed in offices.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to state for us why, when asking for power to insist that such conveniences be provided for office workers, there shall be no such protection in offices where there are less than six office workers.  That seems to me not to be a legitimate &ldquo;restriction&rdquo; of the Act. I think it is a mistaken exemption.</P>
    <P>I feel the same way about Section 20 which deals with the provision of washing facilities.  Whether there are one, two, three, four or five people in an office they all need to wash, and the fact that washing facilities need not be provided, apparently, in offices where <Col N="811" /> there are less than six workers does not seem to me to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>I think we should welcome the provision in Section 23, sub-section (2) paragraph (c) relating to facilities for the &ldquo;preparing and taking of meals&rdquo;. I have already referred to this and it seems to me to be yet another portion of the Bill which is most reasonable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say much more about the Bill but I should like for the sake of guidance, when we come to the Committee Stage, to get the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude to the questions I have put to him.  I cannot help concluding with the thought that I should very much like to see legislation of this kind for the provision of proper sanitary conditions, washing facilities, and &ldquo;facilities for the preparation of meals&rdquo; being brought before us in relation to our primary schools, 800 of which are in a most obsolete condition.</P>

      <P>There is one query I should like to make about Part V of the Bill, under which the chairman and ordinary members of the advisory council are appointed by the Minister. The Parliamentary Secretary told us that he had consulted various bodies with regard to this Bill and with regard to what should be in it.  Would he not consider that members of these various bodies should get representation on this advisory council?  I have in mind members of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and the trade unions.  Surely we have gone far enough in this country to allow outside bodies to be represented on these advisory councils.  We have no guarantee that the persons who will be appointed by the Minister, or the people whom he will be advised to appoint, will differ in any way in mind from the <Col N="812" /> people who appoint them.  I should like to see bodies such as I have mentioned represented on advisory councils of this sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this legislation is not to be taken as evidence of a belief on the part of the Legislature that employers of clerical workers generally have imposed conditions of work less than what might be considered reasonably good, but I think that that type of remark could be applied to almost any other piece of social legislation.  I have no adverse comment to make on the criticism levelled at this measure.  I agree with the Senators who said that the Bill is not good enough, that it is a piece of legislation which cannot be tested as against any previous legislation, here or in other countries.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise what Senator Miss Davidson has said, that Ireland is the first country to embark on such legislation.  We are one of the young nations and this is not the only piece of social legislation in which Ireland has pioneered.  We are aware that there are some provisions in the Bill which are not as good as the critics would wish to have them.  There is hardly anybody on either side of either House but would wish to have the Bill improved, if that is possible, and I think it would be more satisfactory for all concerned if we were to take the details of the Bill on Committee Stage when we will be in a better position to give all the explanations we have been asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are one or two points that should be referred to here and now.  The principal one is the provision that the Act will not apply to offices employing fewer than six people.  It has been stated by the Minister, and it was repeated in my introductory speech, that that is so for one reason: that there was a danger that the employer who employs small numbers might disemploy one or two members of his staff so that he might avoid the obligations which this measure imposes.  I know that that type of fear can be scouted and reasons can be advanced for the scouting of it.  We think, however, quite apart from that <Col N="813" /> apprehension&mdash;and we consider it a very real one, seeing that this is a piece of pioneering legislation&mdash;we ought to give the smaller employers all over the country an opportunity of adapting themselves to the requirements of this piece of legislation.  We anticipate that in the course of time and with growing experience they too will eventually be roped in by an amendment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a very reasonable approach. It gives fair warning to all concerned that the good conditions which this Bill will ensure in those offices employing more than six will in time have to be made available in the smaller offices.  It is not possible for me to satisfy those who have strong feelings on this question of denying these facilities to the smaller numbers.  In one respect at any rate, namely overcrowding, there is less danger in the smaller offices than there is in the larger ones. With regard to sanitary accommodation, temperature, safety of structure and so forth, these apply equally to smaller offices and to the big.</P>
    <P>I have been asked some specific questions and I think I ought to reply to the one raised with regard to exemptions. Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked me to say why certain premises are being exempted.  He mentioned premises occupied by the Defence Forces.  I understand it is inadvisable, if not entirely prohibited, to have civil inspection of military premises and that is the reason why the exclusion is made.</P>
    <P>With regard to premises used substantially as a private residence or for private domestic purposes, I visualise premises used for the combined purpose of residence and business.  It is possible that the element of private residence accounts for this exclusion. If, however, the Senator leaves the matter until the next stage, I shall try to get more precise information for him.</P>
    <P>With regard to shops having offices, such offices are adequately covered by the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think I ought to go in any detail into the various points raised at this stage, I take it the principle of the measure is acceptable.  That, in fact, <Col N="814" /> has been stated by a number of Senators.  The Second Stage is really for the purpose of putting the issue of acceptance of the principle of the measure to the House.  I will undertake to have as much information as possible available for Senators on Committee Stage.  In the meantime, I ask that the measure as it stands be given its formal Second Reading.  Any amendments which Senators may wish to put down will be very carefully considered and, if not accepted, I hope to be in a position to give very good reasons for their nonacceptance.</P>

      <P>The Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, will expire on 31st December, 1957.  Accordingly, from 1st January, 1958, general powers to make Orders fixing maximum prices and charges will derive solely from the authority conveyed by this Bill which provides for the repeal of the Control of Prices Act, 1937, and the Prices Commission (Extension of Functions) Act, 1938.</P>
      <P>The Control of Prices Act, 1937, provided for the establishment of the Prices Commission and authorised the Minister for Industry and Commerce to fix maximum prices for commodities when he had received a recommendation to that effect from the commission. The Act provided also for the establishment of the office of Controller of Prices and the assignment to him of certain executive functions including action on complaints in respect of overcharging for commodities not the subject of price Orders.  The Prices Commission (Extension of Functions) Act, 1938, authorised the commission to review the operation of tariffs and quotas, in particular cases, and to make recommendations to the Minister. Powers of a similar character with respect to tariffs and quotas are now vested in the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> The Control of Prices Act, 1937, was only a relatively short time in operation when the crisis atmosphere of 1938 gave way to the emergency of 1939. With the onset of the emergency, the nature of the prices problem underwent a radical change.  The main difficulty became a shortage of supplies extending over a wide field.  The root causes of the price increases were not hard to find nor was there any great difficulty in establishing in what direction the balance of national advantage lay as regards interference in price matters in individual cases.  Furthermore, the rapidity with which action was required and the number of commodities involved precluded procedures involving any form of lengthy investigations.  Accordingly, under Emergency Powers (No. 173) Order, 1942, a Minister was authorised at his absolute discretion to make an Order or to give, either in writing or orally, a direction for controlling the prices at which articles of any description might be sold or purchased or the charges which might be made by any undertaking in respect of the doing of any work.  It is this Order as supplemented by the Order made in 1951 establishing the Prices Advisory Body which has provided authority for price control.</P>
    <P>When the Minister addressed the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 28th May, 1957, he dealt with the question of the continuation of the emergency arrangements for price control.  He said then that the survival of these war-time price controlling measures long after all scarcities have ended has operated as a major deterrent to investment in Irish industrial possibilities and that they have been interpreted by people outside Ireland interested in the promotion of new undertakings here as implying a hostile attitude to industrial profits.  Every foreign expert, who advised on Irish industrial development, put his finger on these price control arrangements as an impediment of outstanding significance. It is true that profits earned in export business have never been subject to control but that fact has not been appreciated.  It is proposed <Col N="816" /> now to dismantle that war-time price control structure.</P>
    <P>Some system of price control there must be, undoubtedly, but it is intended to legislate for a system which will be invoked, only where either (a) there are monopoly conditions arising from unavoidable circumstances or from combinations among suppliers which can be shown after examination to be operating to the public detriment; or (b) in the case of protected industries, there is evidence of inefficiency, by which is meant excessive costs due to factors within the power of those engaged in the industry to rectify, whether manufacturers or employees, or (c) there is need to deal with temporary shortages arising from temporary causes.  The Government believes that in normal circumstances competition is the best regulator of prices and where competition operates there will be no control.  There is no desire to prevent the most efficient firm from getting the reward of increased business in higher profits, lower prices and better conditions for its employees.  The Bill is intended to give legislative effect to the foregoing general statement of policy.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will no longer have unfettered discretion to fix maximum prices and charges even in respect of prices and charges to which the Bill applies.  With certain exceptions, his power will be exercisable only on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the receipt of a report under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, from the Fair Trade Commission;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the receipt of a report from a Prices Advisory Committee as envisaged in the Bill, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  the making by the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Bill of an Order that a state of emergency exists with respect to a specified commodity or commodities.</P>
    <P>In ordinary circumstances, therefore, the position will be that general powers of price control cannot be exercised on an arbitrary basis and can be exercised only on the basis of the <Col N="817" /> report of an independent investigational body.  Earlier price enactments provided for the appointment of a prices commission and a controller of prices and entrusted to them functions with regard to the surveillance of prices, the carrying out of price inquiries, the investigation of the effects of protective measures and other responsibilities of a similar nature.</P>
    <P>I think that the establishment of a permanent commission or of a controller is unnecessary and is undesirable from the point of view of the wrong implications which might be drawn from their existence.  Since the enactment of previous price legislation the necessity for a commission or controller has been eliminated to a very great extent by the establishment of the Fair Trade Commission and the Industrial Development Authority.  I think it is unwise to have any overlapping of responsibility or of functions in matters of this kind and therefore, in so far as price problems derive from restrictive practices, the Bill provides that the Minister's powers should be exercisable only on a report from the Fair Trade Commission.  The position is more complicated in the case of the Industrial Development Authority because of the variety of functions and responsibilities attaching to the authority.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that as regards price investigations other than those relating to restrictive practices as defined in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the best course is to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory committee to conduct each particular investigation.  Once, however, such a committee is appointed it will have all the powers and status necessary to carry out its responsibilities and will have full power to summon witness and examine them on oath.  I think it is essential that the latter power should be exercisable only by the chairman and the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that advisory committees in addition to their other powers will have authority to report as to whether in their opinion prices or charges are unduly high by reason of undue labour costs.  These undue costs might arise from a variety of circumstances including restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> The power to fix maximum prices in a state of emergency is one which is considered appropriate to a situation such as developed in the course of the Suez crisis.  If an emergency of the proportions of war or near-war arose it is likely that resort would have to be had to legislation of a more general character.  It is desired to limit to the maximum extent possible the use of direct powers of control and the procedure proposed seems to provide the best practical approach to the problem. It might be unwise, however, to have any lesser powers of control in an emergency even of limited extent.</P>
    <P>In a period which is not an emergency, the only commodities in respect of which direct powers of control may be exercised are bread, sugar, milk and butter.  Provision was made in the Bill as introduced in Dáil Éireann for continuing in force the Intoxicating Liquor (Maximum Prices) Order, 1957.  The Order fixes maximum prices for stout and porter in County Dublin, the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and the Borough of Galway.  Following discussions with the trade, it has been decided not to continue the Order in force after 31st December, 1957, and it will now expire on that date, unless previously revoked.</P>
    <P>There are specific enactments relating to milk and bread which give authority to control prices and it will be possible to proceed either under these enactments or under the Bill.  The power to control milk and butter is restricted to retail prices and is exercisable only after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture.  In the case of milk, the power to fix prices is subject to the further limitation that it is exercisable only in areas declared to be sale districts for the purposes of Part II of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>No provision is made in the Bill for the continuance in force of the Orders at present in operation fixing maximum prices for kerosene, motor spirit and sugar.  These Orders, as well as the Order fixing the maximum prices for intoxicating liquor, already mentioned, will lapse on the 31st December, 1957, with the expiration of the Supplies and Services (Temporary <Col N="819" /> Provisions) Act, 1946.  The Orders providing for the display of price lists and requiring a seller to give on demand to a buyer certain prescribed particulars of a sale will also expire on 31st December, 1957.  In the case of sugar, it will, of course, be possible to make a price Order without reference to either the Fair Trade Commission or a prices advisory committee.  While no final decision is possible at this stage, present indications are that it will be necessary to maintain control.</P>
    <P>Power is taken in the Bill to make Orders requiring the display of prices of any or all of specified commodities. Certain commodities do not lend themselves to the display of exhaustive price lists and the articles specified have been selected by reference to their importance and to the reasonableness of requiring shopkeepers to display prices of these articles.  No provision is made in the Bill requiring a seller to furnish to a buyer particulars of a sale or for the making of an Order to that effect and such a rerequirement could be included in an Order only, if at all, to the extent to which it shall appear necessary or expedient for giving full effect to any provision inserted in the Order or to secure compliance with the Order.  A number of other detailed provisions contained in previous legislation or legislative proposals have also been omitted.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the commodities in addition to sugar which are subject to direct control under the Bill are bread, butter and milk.  Retail prices of milk in certain areas are at present controlled under the provisions of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, and it is not anticipated that any changes will be made with the coming into operation of the new Act.  No Orders are currently in force with respect to either bread or butter nor has any immediate reason for such Orders come to notice.</P>
    <P>The remaining matter of principle to which it is necessary to refer in relation to the Bill is the provision for exclusion from its scope.  The important exclusions are prices paid to producers of agricultural and horticultural <Col N="820" /> products and to fishermen, charges for professional services and prices and charges already subject to control under specific enactments or coming within the administrative competence of members of the Government or local authorities.  As already mentioned, however, the Bill expressly applies to bread and milk although control of prices is provided for in specific enactments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any fairminded person must admit that, since the end of the war and even during a part of the war period, price control has not been very successful in this country.  Quite obviously, this Bill is intended to dismantle the bulk of the price control machinery.  A few items are left in, in a rather diffident way.</P>
      <P>In a period of long-term inflation, the Executive has great difficulty in keeping the prices of the necessaries of life at the level which appears to the ordinary person to be reasonable.  I should like to direct attention to one factor in the situation.  Although they have turned downwards now, import prices have been rising continuously in recent years.  That resulted, in the past 12 or 18 months, in a considerable rise in retail and wholesale prices here, and in import prices, although our export prices remained approximately stable.  These figures are shown in the current Quarterly Bulletin of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The result of a deflation in the economy here, combined with an inflation in Britain last year of about 7 per cent., has been to give rise to a considerable spread in the standard of living between this country and Britain.  It is an extremely difficult problem to deal with and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whoever he may be and to whatever Party he may belong, deserves considerable sympathy in trying to cope with it.  It would be fair to infer from this Bill that to a certain extent the present Minister for Industry and Commerce has thrown his hat at the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for myself, I do not agree with the action which was taken by the Government in abolishing the subsidies on bread and butter&mdash;and I <Col N="821" /> will give my reasons.  Before the subsidy on bread was abolished, the price of the 2 lb. loaf delivered was 9¼d. and the subsidy can be worked out very accurately at about 3¼d. or 3?d.  If you add the two together, you get 1/0½d. In fact, when the decontrol took place immediately following the Budget, the bakers fixed the price at 1/2.  That was too much for the Minister and he reimposed the control immediately; but it would appear from subsequent events that the bakers were assessing the position correctly, because the price is now again 1/2 for a 2lb. loaf delivered.</P>
    <P>My point this evening is an economic one.  There is a subsidy of 3¼d. and when it is removed, you get an increase of 4¾d.  Of course, any person who knows the way these things work out would expect that to happen.  There are the consequential costs; the subsidy is paid at the base, probably through Grain Importers Limited; you cut it off at the base and you effect all the consequential spiral of costs.  That is the case of the bread subsidy.  There is a much greater increase in prices than the benefit the Exchequer gets through the abolition of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>There was a subsidy of 5d. a lb. on butter and the price officially was 3/9. Owing to price cutting, it was cheaper here in Dublin, at times.  It is cheaper at the moment than the official price. The recognised price, the general price, went up from 3/9 to 4/4.  Although the subsidy was 5d., the price went up by 7d.  Anyone who wishes to defend that change, on the ground that people who could afford it were getting butter at a subsidised price, is welcome to that argument.</P>
    <P>One must not get away from the fact that undoubtedly all this led to the current round of wage increases of 10/- a week which is being paid generally. That is, of course, going to put our export industries into a very grave position.  If it be true, as the Minister for Education said in Cork a few days ago, that the &ldquo;fifth round, the 1955 round, of wage increases created the conditions which led to the difficulties for our export trade&rdquo; we are going to be back in those difficulties.  But the 1955 round was due entirely to the importation of inflation and I want to go <Col N="822" /> back to that subject in a moment because people are inclined to chaff about it occassionally.  The Minister suggested that the 1955 round of wage increases created serious difficulties for the economy.  That round of wage increases came about without any action of any sort by the Government of the day.  The Government kept out of the business; the negotiations were allowed to take place between the unions and the different organisations of employers.  On the current occasion, the Government has held the ring again, so to speak, but more than on the 1955 occasion.  The result, at any rate, is that there is an increase of 10/- a week in many categories of wages.</P>
    <P>If in fact it be true, as the Minister for Education seems to suggest, that difficulties were created for the export industry by that increase in wages, there is not the slightest doubt that similar difficulties will be created again.  People in other countries are inclined to chaff about the subject of importing inflation and that is particularly true of some of the English writers.  It is an easy excuse to say it is imported from somebody else.  In this country, half the imports are raw materials and the other half agricultural raw materials.  The effect of continuously rising import prices will be to produce inflation.  I am glad to say there has been a definite downturn in the prices of raw materials during the last four or five months.  Copper has come down from over £400 a ton to £180 a ton and the whole fall of import prices should be of benefit to our economy.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Government, in abolishing the food subsidies, calculated the risk and what the increase in wages would be.  It was quite obvious that when it happened immediately, without any furore, they were in agreement with the increases in wages but that will not affect the internal economy to the same degree as it will affect the export industries.  As it is necessary for our economy to increase exports, it is obvious that the expansion of exports will be made more difficult.  If the increases in wages in 1955 was too great the economy has not had time to absorb <Col N="823" /> that increase in a period of two years, particularly with import prices rising continuously.  The present Executive are taking the risk on that front, with the external part of our economy, which from one point of view has been running exceptionally well for nine or ten months, but is now getting into difficulties.</P>
    <P>Many people have objected to this Bill dismantling these controls and have thought it extremely undesirable. The Fine Gael Party does not feel that price control has been so successful that the Executive are not entitled to take a decision to dismantle a large part of it, though it is quite obvious that, in a small country like this, where you have individual monopolies in a good many of the ordinary commodities that are produced, the Executive are running a risk.  I cannot say that I honestly welcome the Bill, but I think the Minister is entitled to take his view and that we will not be inclined to oppose it as he has introduced it in this way.</P>

      <P>The Bill now before us repeals the Prices Act of 1937 which, as we know, has been in abeyance, and it replaces by permanent legislation on price control, the Supplies and Services Act of the emergency.  We can all agree on the desirability of replacing the temporary legislation.  In fact, the previous Minister had intended to do this.  We feel, too, that it is essential that there should be some machinery available for the investigation of prices and for control by the Minister and Government, where necessary, but we have a feeling that the legislation now proposed is definitely a dismantling of price control machinery and that, we submit, is dangerous as well as highly undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In legislation of this kind, the protection of the consumer should be a primary consideration and we do not agree that price control is inimical to industrial development, as the Minister implied in his speech in the Dáil.  On the other hand, we are of opinion that investigation could redound to the advantage of manufacturers and <Col N="824" /> traders in that it would give them an opportunity to justify their prices to the public and to prove that their profits are low&mdash;if that is in fact the case.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the major factors concerning price levels are not susceptible to control by Governments.  The price of imported raw materials is the primary factor in our situation and we feel that public investigation of prices can do a great deal to bring this fact home to the community, and to create a more balanced public opinion on prices.  I do not think anyone suggests that price control can prevent prices going up in all circumstances, but it certainly can prevent unjustifiable increases.  The Minister continually asserts that profits are too low and that any suggestion of price control creates an anti-profit atmosphere.  It may, of course, be true that profits in some cases are too low, but what evidence is there that they are too low in industry, distribution and trade generally?  The I.B.E.C.  Report is usually cited as proof that profits are too low, but the conclusions in that report are based largely on a comparison between American and Irish results, which is hardly realistic.  Then, too, the data on which the report was compiled relate to almost ten years ago.  If its conclusions were correct at that time, they are not necessarily applicable to present-day conditions.</P>
    <P>The real fact is that there is not sufficient evidence to show whether profits are too low or not.  The Committee of Inquiry into Taxation on Industry which was set up in 1953 by the then Minister for Finance, concluded its report which was published last year with these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the absence of comprehensive data... it is difficult to arrive at any worthwhile objective conclusions in regard to Irish profit levels.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This apparently is all that can be said on the matter and it is unwise for the Minister, or anybody else, to assert dogmatically that profits are too low, when in fact the evidence is not there.</P>
    <P>In the Bill before us, an important defect is that there is no provision for investigation of distribution margins. The Prices Advisory Committees will <Col N="825" /> be restricted to manufacturing, whereas it is excessive distribution costs that are most subject to public criticism on prices.  The Minister has based the Bill on his assumption that competition is the most effective price regulator, but when there is a small market, with relatively few industrial units, competition is unlikely to operate effectively.</P>
    <P>In any case, apart from agreements to maintain prices or other such restrictive practices&mdash;which, in theory, can be blocked by the Fair Trade Commission &mdash;it is not difficult in Irish conditions to restrict competition&mdash;close personal, social and business contacts in a small community can be exceedingly effective. Price control is difficult to operate in many cases, but this should not be an excuse for abandoning it altogether. The Bill abolishes the Prices Advisory Body and its functions will be taken over by <i>ad hoc</i> Prices Advisory Committees. A strong case can be made for a Prices Advisory Body, or Board, with a permanent personnel, as against <i>ad hoc</i> committees such as are proposed. Such a body need not be expensive and its members would become expert in the difficult task of price investigation and would be extremely useful to the Minister in their advisory capacity.  Such body could win the public confidence in a way a committee never would.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body did a very good job and the previous Minister referred a considerable number of investigations to it.  Since the change of Government, however, there has not been a single public investigation.  The public investigations of the body were welcomed by the consumers and the consumers' organisations, and in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 13th of this month, there is a statement regarding a protest sent to the Minister on the Prices Bill by the Irish Housewives' Association in the course of which they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We regard the abolition of the Prices Advisory Body as a retrogressive step....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and they continue:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are of the opinion that the fact that sittings of the Prices Advisory Body were held in public has to some extent acted as a check <Col N="826" /> on rising prices.  We deplore the proposal to hold sittings of the Advisory Committees in private.  This would deprive the consumer of this safeguard and also of the right to know what is being done by his representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the public investigations of the Prices Advisory Body were of great value and the reports in the press of its investigations were also of value in educating public opinion on the factors affecting prices. There is bound to be general concern that the body is being abolished.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise a point raised by Senator Miss Davidson which has been running through my head since I have been considering this Bill and statements made about it and the functions and workings of these proposed Advisory Committees.  It seems to me that, in losing the old committee of the 1937 Act, we have lost a very important channel of communication which that committee could exercise by independent inquiries.  So far as I see, there are no facilities made for public sittings for this proposed advisory panel.  I think it is very desirable, where prices are concerned, that there should be some way in which an approach can be made to a sitting body and that a sitting body can go in search of information.  It looks to me from the construction of this Bill that the advisory body will be very much of an appendage to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of his remarks on the Bill in the other House, the Minister said that the element of profit is only a small part of prices.  I suppose that is right, but I do think that, in prices investigations, we should remember that profit and quality are very often closely related.  Very often, we have to pay the same price for articles made here as for articles made elsewhere, but very often the quality is not as good.  When the Minister refers, in Part II Section 10, to the prices charged for commodities, I would like the quality to be included as well as the price.  Many of us are prepared to pay higher prices, provided we get what we are expecting to get, but when <Col N="827" /> we are charged practically the same price for doubtful confectionery, or other strange things, then we feel doubly hurt.  I think the quality should be stressed as well as the price.</P>
    <P>I observe in this Bill that the Minister has reserved power in regard to the important food materials.  I still believe, and sometimes imagine that I will live to see the day when food finds its own natural price level.  There is one thing we cannot change, that is, the amount of food required every 24 hours to keep a man going.  For that reason, I feel that when a Government is reserving the power of control over food prices, that Government must be very well informed as well, lest quite unwittingly it interferes with the nutrition necessary to mankind.</P>
    <P>I think it is very desirable for the Minister, in the Schedule, to make provision for the display of retail prices.  Where prices are displayed, the element of competition comes in.  I have only got to look at the price lists in my own town to find that citrus fruits vary from 1/6 to 10d.  Of course, they might not be of the same quality and one vintage might be different from the other.  All I regret is that the Schedule is not a little more extensive. For instance, vegetables and tomatoes are left out.  Oranges are the only citrus fruits included and I suppose fish is too risky to be included &mdash;it certainly becomes rarer and rarer in a community so well provided for by the sea.  Apart from that, I welcome the intentions of the Bill, but not all these operations I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, this Bill provides for the repeal, by the Minister, of the wartime controls in use year by year under the annual Supplies and Services Bill, and in particular the Prices Advisory Body sitting continually as a public body is now to go. The Minister proposes to deal with four essential commodities as heretofore by direct ministerial Order.  By such Order, he can control the price of bread, butter, milk and sugar.  In regard to other services, the Minister proposes to reserve to himself what he called reserved functions or enabling <Col N="828" /> functions.  In other words, from a permanent panel, he can call into being an advisory committee under certain circumstances on a declared state of emergency, or when costs in a protected industry lead to unduly high prices.  I think it should be made clear that there is no question in this Bill of dismantling price control as was said by Senator Miss Davidson.  What is gone is what I would regard as the ineffectual Prices Advisory Body which, over the past few years, has been having expensive sittings and which, to my view, and I think in the opinion of the Minister, has been largely making work for itself over the past few years.  It is inevitable, with a permanent body of that nature, that it will try to make work for itself where work is not necessary.  In its stead, the Minister will have this committee which he may bring into being in certain circumstances.  I think that is a good thing.</P>
      <P>The Minister's real problem is that the degree of price control which we can have in this State cannot be such as will act as a deterrent to private industrial enterprise.  If we are to get anywhere in our efforts to cope with unemployment and emigration, we must have a greater degree of private industrial enterprise.  I think it is with that end in view that the Minister has brought in these reserved functions in regard to non-essential commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a good one for two very good reasons.  The first is that it marks, as I hope, the end of the era of political friction over prices in Irish public life.  We have had that friction every year for the past 10 years when the annual Supplies and Services Bill came before the Oireachtas.  That has happened every year since 1948 and the attitude has been bred in the public mind that the Government can control prices and that the Government of the day should be held responsible for the prices of commodities.  That was largely introduced by the type of anti-Fianna Fail electioneering which has been carried on since 1948&mdash;the type of electioneering that sought to create in the public mind the view that the Fianna Fail Party alone were responsible <Col N="829" /> for high prices.  That reached its zenith in the 1954 General Election&mdash;</P>

      <P>I bring in the 1954 General Election only in this context, with regard to that type of electioneering.  I am thankful that the attitude of mind reflected in that electioneering is going under this Bill and I hope the Bill marks the end of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduce it only in so far as Senator O'Donovan made his point.  I think that the abolition of the subsidies and this Bill have brought that type of thing to an end.  From now on, there will be no arguments about subsidies and prices and the Government of the day can carry on with the practical business of running the country.</P>
      <P>The second important reason for supporting this Bill is that it nails on the head the statement that excessive profits are being made in Irish industry. Senator Miss Davidson has attached herself to the outworn notion that excessive profits are being made in Irish industries, but the Minister, when introducing the Bill, dealt with that matter in column 120, volume 164 when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have far less desire to revive the campaign against profits when all our experience is that the profit margins in industry are in many instances too low to permit a rate of expansion in industry such as we would desire to see.  The advice which we have got from outside experts who were from time to time brought here to advise upon Irish economic development is that profits in industry are inadequate to en-encourage investment in industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister has said there about profits in industry is the main factor militating against the expansion we require in Irish industrial development to-day.  The fact is that profit margins <Col N="830" /> are not high enough.  Senator Miss Davidson said that it was unrealistic to draw comparisons between Ireland and the United States, but if a high margin of profit operates there, we should aim at a similar margin here so as to bring in outside and home investors.</P>
    <P>I hope the idea that great profits exist in Irish industry is now gone for ever, and if it has not, that this Bill will put the final nail in its coffin. Prices should be taken out of the political arena and the question of margins of profit should be regarded as an incentive to industrialists and investors in this country so that they will invest more in the effort to combat unemployment and emigration.  The truth is that the rise in the cost of living in this country has been brought about by world-wide inflation which no Government in this little island could offset to any degree.  That alone has been responsible and the sooner we face up to that fact, the better.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that this Bill represents part of the general pattern of Government policy which has been evident since March of this year.  First, we had the Finance Act and the various tax concessions which were given by the Government under that Act, such as the increased depreciation allowance and the 100 per cent. remission of tax on profits from exports.  These fiscal concessions should operate as an incentive towards greater investment.  The existing system of war-time price controls was a disincentive which prevented people from putting money into Irish industrial enterprise.  These two measures I have mentioned, taken in conjunction with the proposed amendment of the Control of Manufactures Act which will shortly be before the Oireachtas, represent a real effort on the part of the Government for the past six months to get to grips with our essential economic problems.  There should be no difficulty in getting this Bill through the House as I have no doubt that it will commend itself to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that the previous speaker should have introduced a political <Col N="831" /> note into the debate on this Bill, especially as he is, like myself, a business man.  Apart from a few asides, I agree with practically everything he said.  I should like to treat this Bill from a businessman's angle and not from a political angle.  I agree with the previous speaker that the major industries, and agriculture is one of them, the industrialisation of our country, the employment of our people and the reduction of emigration are all problems that should not be used purely as political shuttlecocks; but that is how these problems have been used in the past.</P>
      <P>Unlike the previous speaker, however, I do not propose to cast a political slant on my remarks on this measure. Despite the Minister saying in the Dáil, when introducing this Bill, that it was of minor importance, I regard it as of major importance.  It shows a major change in the views of the present Government and of the Opposition Party, to which I myself belong, on this whole question of price control.  Both the Minister and Deputy Cosgrave expressed recognition of the futility of the price controlling efforts of the past 20 years, efforts against which I have taken every opportunity to protest since I came into the Seanad.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was introducing this Bill the Dáil, he said at column 119, Vol. 164 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the Control of Prices Act of 1937 was being debated here before the war it was in an atmosphere in which it was generally contended that all price increases which occurred were due to one cause and one cause only, namely, excess profit taking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The experience of those 20 years, the record of continuously rising prices due to inflationary forces which no system of Government regulation, investigation or control was able to check has, I hope, helped to educate public opinion in regard to the forces that affect prices.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> In the same debate, Deputy Cosgrave, speaking for the Fine Gael Party, said at column 126:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I suppose experience has taught Deputies on both sides of the House but it is possible that both sides have contributed to the illusion that prices can be controlled by Government action or by some statutory authority.  Experience in recent years, however, has demonstrated that, with occasional exceptions, that is not so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have both sides admitting that something was attempted which should never have been attempted because of the damage perpetrated upon the industrial and commercial life of the country by the unwise and unfair imposition of these controls on prices and profits.  I believe that much of our unemployment and emigration to-day can be traced back to this 20 years attack on profits through prices, because, as Senator Lenihan has pointed out, there was a public opinion created and a public mental climate antagonistic, through prices, to business itself, business on which we depend to employ our people and to stop emigration.</P>
    <P>I must say I am always astonished at the attitude of the Labour Party and the trade unions on this question of prices and profits.  The fact is that wages in any particular costs bill are the single biggest factor.  In fact, at the present moment, when the prices of raw materials have fallen, it is fair to say that from now on, the only factor which will put up prices&mdash;and prices will go up&mdash;is wages.  How the Labour people can attack profits all the time is something I cannot understand. As I have said before, the Labour Party are boring holes in the ship they are travelling in; business must make a profit in order to carry on and to maintain itself in a strong and healthy condition.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to America.  I think we should copy America because, in America, they have the highest standard of employment, the highest standard of living and the highest wages.  Surely, that is something to be copied and not something to be <Col N="833" /> denigrated.  In this context, I should like to refer to a remark of Senator Miss Davidson about distribution.  We are always hearing about distribution costs being too heavy.  Does that mean that we should employ fewer people in distribution?  If we are to have a less wieldy form of distribution, we shall have to disemploy people and get rid of people who are at present employed in distribution.  From a social point of view, it is vitally important that all who are at present employed in distribution should be retained.  Does the Labour Party and Senator Miss Davidson suggest we should get rid of these people in what she describes as this over-wieldy distribution system?  That seems to me to be the suggestion.  I do not think it is a logical one, coming from people who are always asking for higher wages and more employment.</P>
    <P>An atmosphere has been created here to-day to which we are not wholly unaccustomed. I know we shall have more attacks on prices and profits as the debate proceeds.  The I.B.E.C. Report is supposed to be out of date.  It was published in 1951, only five or six years ago.  It is not out of date.  The only drawback is that notice was never taken of it.  What is the good of getting reports?  We are now to get a report from the World Bank advising us on our economy.  Supposing that report states that our profits are too low to reward our own native capital, to build up wealth and strength in our industrial economy or to attract outside capital with the know-how, will we ignore that report because it is not in accord with the Housewives' Association views in relation to prices, profit controls and so forth?  I would ask the housewives: do they want to have lower prices for goods which they are not able to buy?  Would they prefer to have reasonable prices given to industry which employs their husbands, their sons and their daughters?  I think housewives generally would be much happier having their husbands and children employed than having lower prices for goods at uneconomic prices which they themselves would not have the money to purchase.</P>
    <P>This Bill marks a welcome and essential <Col N="834" /> change in Government policy and Government thinking on the question of profits.  The fact is we need and we should encourage enterprises, private or State, that are profit-making.  I wish our C.I.E., our Aer Lingus and all the others were making big profits.  If they were, we would be in a very strong position.  Are we going to try to make private enterprise as unrewarding as C.I.E. and all these other undertakings? If we do, I do not know who will pay the subsidies and the taxes necessary to keep these uneconomic enterprises going.</P>
    <P>I welcome this change of policy and the admission by the Government in relation to prices and profits.  I welcome the Bill, but there is still inherent in it a certain degree of suspicion and a desire to hold on.  We have got to the stage here&mdash;it is a general one the world over&mdash;best illustrated by the story of the little girl who was being brought down Grafton Street by her mother.  She was holding her mother's hand, but, as she walked, she looked about her.  Suddenly she hit her head against a lamp post.  In tears, she said to her mother: &ldquo;Mummy, why don't you look where I am going?&rdquo;  That appears to be our philosophy.  We want the Government to look where everybody is going.</P>
    <P>As I have said, for many years past, public opinion has been suspicious of business and antagonistic to it.  Up to now, it has been considered anti-social for business men to make profit.  The truth is that it is anti-social not to make profit.  If we get that sort of mentality in this country, that it is anti-social not to make profit and that we must make good profits, then we will be at least on the road to developing an economy that will be able to employ our people.</P>
    <P>Here we are, after 30 odd years of self-government, and everybody wonders what is wrong with the country.  It is quite simple.  As somebody said to me when I was abroad recently: &ldquo;The Irish people are not business people; they have no idea of the reward necessary in order to build up capital.&rdquo; For instance, I believe that before we can have our people properly employed, we will have to change completely <Col N="835" /> our attitude towards business. At present, there is penal taxation designed against business.  We should have little or no taxation on undistributed profits in order to build up capital.  Our death duties are an absolutely killing factor so far as private businesses are concerned.  On top of that, businesses operate in an atmosphere in which it is supposed to be anti-social to make a profit; in other words, to run a successful business.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill for the reason that it shows that price control has been a failure in this country.  The reason it failed is that it was bound to fail.  The only thing it succeeded in doing was to damp down industrial and commercial progress and expansion. I welcome it as a first step in the direction of creating the right atmosphere in which we can have a successful industrial, and even agricultural, economy.</P>
    <P>I have already said what we all know to be a fact: that wages are the biggest factor in costs, and, therefore, in prices.  Reference was made by Senator O'Donovan to the fifth round of wages.  I will not go into all the ill effects that that had on our economy; but I think it is relevant to mention that we are now dealing with the sixth round of wage increases and that will have a lot to do with prices and profits.  An agreement was made by the Federated Union of Employers and P.U.T.U.O. on a future policy for wages, under which it was agreed that general rises in wages should not cause unemployment or rises in prices. Wage claims could be negotiated up to a ceiling of 10/-, but it was also mentioned in that agreement that where wage increases were given, something should be done between the employer and the workers to arrange that there would be an offset against wages paid.  Otherwise any such payment would be purely inflationary. In the words of the agreement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The two bodies are anxious that increases in wages would not be followed by increases in prices and recognise that, in so far as they are able to exercise any influence on restraining price rises, employers <Col N="836" /> and trade unions have a duty to do so.  Both organisations accept the responsibilities for ensuring that every practical effort be made to offset increases in costs where they may occur by improved efforts and efficiency and greater productivity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What has, in fact, happened up to now?  In many cases, I am sorry to say, employers have not asked for improved efforts, efficiency and greater productivity. They are merely handing out this 10/- as a formula and thereby floating into the spending power of the community inflationary money that has no counterpart in production, in work and in services.  I need not tell you that such purely inflationary money will create trouble such as we had last year.</P>
    <P>Where employers have asked for greater efforts and for the breaking down of restrictive trade practices, I am sorry to say that, in a great many cases that have come to my notice, the unions are refusing.  They just say: &ldquo;We want the 10/-; that is all there is to it.&rdquo;  They are turning down&mdash;I do not like to use the word &ldquo;contemptuously&rdquo;&mdash;almost contemptuously any suggestion that they should do anything to offset the 10/-.  They say it is their right under the agreement. Of course, it is not.</P>
    <P>What I am pleading for is that the trade unions and the employers should read the whole of that agreement.  If we are to keep down our costs, and therefore our prices, they should read it.  It not only mentions 10/-, but does so in accordance with the terms relating to that ceiling.  That is a most important point.  I wish it could be got over to the country generally.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say once more that I welcome this Bill as a movement in the right direction, towards the freeing into rational channels of the operations of industries in this country.  I can only say that I hope the movement that has been started in this Bill will be pursued and that, later on, we will see an enlightened Bill to give relief from the penal taxation at present imposed on business here.  If we get a reasonable taxation code, plus a reasonable <Col N="837" /> atmosphere in which business can operate, I think we can look forward to a much more pleasant future in relation to the employment of our people and dealing with emigration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to this debate with great interest.  It has been a varied and fruitful debate and&mdash;if I may say so without discourtesy&mdash;a wider debate than it was found possible to give this measure in the Dáil where only three Deputies were aroused to make speeches on the Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator O'Donovan who first used the phrase that this Bill was effectively &ldquo;dismantling the present prices machinery.&rdquo;  Some Senators have differed from him in that view.  I think it is a sound analysis of what is taking place.  I had a feeling when I first read this Bill that it represented a large measure of window-dressing, of pretence that something will be done in some wonderful new way, with &ldquo;panels&rdquo; of people who can be put on &ldquo;advisory committees&rdquo; and so on.  As I read the Bill, I realised it was not even going to be window-dressing.  It was not even going to be kept in a shop window; it was going to be put on the shelf. That may seem a little hard, but I can quote the Minister as saying that very thing.  In volume 164, column 135 of the Dáil Debates, he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the Bill becomes an Act, it will be put upon a shelf, and taken down from the shelf only when some set of circumstances arises which, in the view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Government, requires its utilisation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole Bill is entirely empty of content, unless circumstances arise to make the Government or the Minister think that they might set up one of these advisory committees.  I do not think that this is a Bill with teeth in it; I do not think it is a measure which intends action at all.  Therefore, we find the business interests so far as they are represented here in the House, praising the Bill and saying it is a wonderful Bill, because they know it is a completely ineffective Bill in so far <Col N="838" /> as it claims to deal with prices.  After all, the title of the Bill is &ldquo;Prices Bill.&rdquo; It might as well be called the &ldquo;No Interference with Prices Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan made a point that, in fact, all our Irish Governments have always been completely incapable of controlling prices.  I hope I am not misinterpreting him when I say that. It is quite unfair of one Party to criticise another Party because they have failed to control prices, says Senator Lenihan, because the other Party knows perfectly well that they cannot do it, that they are powerless. It is not a question of being incompetent; but of being impotent in their efforts to control prices.  At all events, says Senator Lenihan&mdash;and Senator McGuire agrees with him&mdash;it is recognised that no Government can do it, that we never had and never shall have in this country effective price-control by Governments representing either of the big parties.  I think that is an absolutely fair statement of the facts, and I agree with it.  I do not believe that either of the big parties here have ever controlled prices effectively, or that they ever intend to control them, or are capable of doing so in the future.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the Prices Advisory Body is a return to something like the old days when there was a Prices Commission sitting in the Department of Industry and Commerce behind closed doors, making decisions based upon mysterious evidence which never came before the public at all.  I do not suggest there was anything improper in the way in which such a body acted; I believe it behaved in a most conscientious way; but I suggest that such a closed-door method of determining a just price is bad in a democracy. It leads to lobbying, and trying to find people who &ldquo;have the ear of the Minister,&rdquo; and so on.  That lobbying may be ineffective, but the tendency is very great to encourage it by all decisions on prices and price control being made behind closed doors.  I would prefer that such decisions should be taken right out in the open.  For that reason, I believe that the Prices Advisory Body, which was set up by the first inter-Party Government, <Col N="839" /> represented a very big step forward.</P>
    <P>It may, of course, have been a step forward deplored by certain prominent members of the Fine Gael Party. Senator McGuire does not agree with that kind of thing and would like to retain the old method.  Yet, in spite of the harsh things said about it by Senator Lenihan, I believe that, by and large, it has done excellent work, and I believe that if we had not had these public inquiries, defective as some of them may have been, prices would be far higher to-day.  I believe the abolition of this body&mdash;and its present cessation of work, more or less&mdash;is having an effect on price levels at this moment.  I think then that it was good, but that it suffered from two main defects.</P>
    <P>The first defect it had was that upon it there was no consumer representation. That is a point I want to make in relation to the present Bill and to the advisory committee panels which are to be set up.  It is absolutely essential that the consumer should be directly represented.  I am familiar with the thesis that says: &ldquo;After all, there were trade union representatives on the Prices Advisory Body and everybody is a consumer; a High Court Judge is a consumer and a trade union official is a consumer.&rdquo;  I am not satisfied with that.  I have seen cases come before the Prices Advisory Body where prices could be shown to be high and where the defence was made that the trade unions insisted on certain wages which necessitated a high price; and the trade union representatives on the Prices Advisory Body were very reluctant to criticise or interfere with a price factor for which trade unions appeared to be responsible.  For that reason, I do not believe that a trade union representative makes a sufficiently good representative of the consumer.  That was one defect: that the Prices Advisory Body had not got direct consumer representation.</P>
    <P>The other big defect it had, in my opinion, was that although some of the proceedings were held in public, not half enough was brought before the <Col N="840" /> public.  Much of the evidence which was asked for in public by consumers' organisations was not given in public. The business men, who are so cager to defend the profit motive and the sacredness of their &ldquo;social duty&rdquo; to make as big profits as they can, are terribly reluctant to tell us just precisely what those profits are, in public. If it is a social honour, as Senator McGuire has told us, and a social duty &mdash;assumed perhaps even reluctantly, for the sake of the country&mdash;to make such profits, why are business men so ashamed to let it be known what those profits are, and tell how they make them, before the public?  Again, businessmen pleaded before the Prices Advisory Body that such and such information was confidential and its disclosure would embarrass them, and they could only whisper it in private into the ears of the members of that body.  They did so; they had to do so under the law; but such evidence was never made public.</P>
    <P>Now, I am satisfied that the Prices Advisory Body was a body of complete integrity, which took into account all the evidence placed before it.  What I am pointing out is that one of its two major defects was that much of the evidence, even for public enquiries, was given privately, and, of course, several of the inquiries were entirely in private.  So, that body suffered from those two defects; but it was, on the whole, a good body.  Now it is being abolished by this Prices Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of consumer representation, there is no guarantee enshrined in this Bill that the new committees, if ever set up, will have consumer representation.  And there is a reference specifically to the holding of inquiries before such committees in public; and that specific reference is that they shall &ldquo;not be held in public,&rdquo; unless the Minister gives his special permission.  I cannot think that that is an improvement on the present situation.  Before the Prices Advisory Body to-day anyone can appear, anyone can ask them to make an inquiry, and anyone can give evidence before them in public.  Any manufacturer who wants to justify a rise in prices&mdash;and it is obvious that sometimes a rise may be justified&mdash;has to make that justification <Col N="841" /> in public.  I do not think that that is a bad thing.  I do not see why business interests should be afraid of it, and I deplore the fact that that apparently will not be necessary any longer.</P>
    <P>I would remind people like Senator Lenihan furthermore&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;that the right of our State to inquire into Irish price levels is a function of the State protection which is gladly accepted by our industries. Industries, whose representatives talk about their &ldquo;rugged independence&rdquo; and so on, are protected by 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. tariff walls.  They accept this State interference with &ldquo;the prices mechanism&rdquo; and all the rest of it.  They accept this shelter provided by the State and I suggest to them that that protection ought to be linked with a parallel right of the State, which gives that protection, to inquire into the factors which constitute their price levels.  I believe protection of that kind ought to carry with it the right, if not directly to control prices, at any rate, to insist that they be publicly justified.</P>
    <P>I should like to give one example. There was only one case in the history of the Prices Advisory Body where a group of consumers brought before the body an application to have the price of something reduced.  This one case was in connection with children's perambulators.  The case was pleaded before the Prices Advisory Body, and it was shown that there were only three Irish manufacturers of prams, and that there was a very strong retail traders' organisation.  It was shown that these Irish prams benefited by a 50 per cent. protective duty.  It was shown also that the traders' association was putting a squeeze on the manufacturers to prevent them from supplying any trader who committed the ghastly crime of taking a profit of less than 50 per cent. gross. That is a business crime.  You must not do it.  You must not cut the amount of profit which you are prepared to take.  In this case, the compulsory profit margin was 50 per cent., and the protective duty was 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>It emerged, in the course of evidence, <Col N="842" /> that one of the manufacturers was also a retailer, and was very closely linked with a finance company to arrange hire purchase terms for people who could not afford to buy prams at the extraordinarily high prices insisted upon by these traders in their ring.  And this was a ring. The Prices Advisory Body went into this question and it emerged that one retailer who was prepared to take a 33? per cent. profit had applied time and again for permission to allow him to import British prams free of duty in order to break this ring.  The Minister said that he was helpless in that regard.  This is the kind of thing the ordinary consumer thinks about, when he hears business representatives talking about the sacred duty of the business man to get as much profit as he can.  The Prices Advisory Body found and specifically ruled in this case that it was in the public interest to decree that the price of prams should be reduced by 1/4 in the £.</P>
    <P>I cite that example as a representative example of the sort of arrangements, negotiations, collective action and rigging of prices, and rings, rings which the community would like to see a Bill like this framed to combat, and which, in my opinion, this Bill does nothing whatever to defeat or circumvent. I never cease to be astonished&mdash; perhaps I have a big capacity for astonishment&mdash;when I hear speaker after speaker in politics, in the Dáil or in the Seanad, speaking in favour of &ldquo;competition.&rdquo;  Deputy Cosgrave said competition was the only effective form of price control.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce hardly opens his mouth without praising competition, but he does not really want competition; he only wants to talk about it.  These speakers do not want competition.  They want this type of price fixing arrangement.  They want no competition at all in prices, and, if competition in prices breaks out, there is a loud squealing about &ldquo;cut throat competition,&rdquo; suicidal competition and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission brought in three or four reports which were implemented, in contrast with their <Col N="843" /> last report which was not implemented. These reports dealt with the grocery trade, wireless trade and the building trade.  Nobody can claim that the prices of groceries did not drop immediately after the introduction and implementation of the Order by the Minister in accordance with the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, which was aimed at breaking the price-controlling ring in groceries.  You have only to walk down the streets of Dublin, and even Grafton Street, which was referred to by Senator McGuire, to see that the prices of wireless sets have dropped, since this Order was brought in, breaking the price-fixing ring.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there have been too many &ldquo;controls,&rdquo; and that the object is to &ldquo;abolish controls.&rdquo;  I am in favour of abolishing controls over prices by private interests.  Let us have only public control in the public interest.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what steps does he or the Minister intend to take to ensure that there will be price competition?  Has he any legislation in mind to break price-fixing rings?  Is he concerned to break price-fixing rings, because if, on the one hand he loves competition and, on the other hand, the organised bodies have the purpose of preventing price competition from taking place, I think he ought to tell us what he is going to do to ensure that the competition he loves so much is going to be real and not fictitious or part of his dream world.</P>
    <P>I am supported in my view that the Minister is not really concerned at all to break this kind of ring by the fact that the Fair Trade Commission brought in a report to recommend an Order to stop this kind of &ldquo;collective action&rdquo; in relation to pharmaceutical products and infant foods, an Order which was not made by the Minister. The commission considered that &ldquo;collective action to maintain fixed retail prices, whether through an association or otherwise, by manufacturers or traders, for the enforcement of such prices constituted an unreasonable restriction on the supply of goods&rdquo;<Col N="844" /> and they &ldquo;recommended that it be prohibited,&rdquo; but the Minister decided he would not prohibit it.</P>
    <P>The commission also recommended that &ldquo;collective arrangements between wholesalers relating to prices to be charged was contrary to the public interest in that it constituted an unreasonable limitation on free and fair competition,&rdquo; but has the Minister prohibited it?  No.  He has looked into the recommendation, and has decided he would not like to prohibit it.  The reality is that the Minister has not the slightest interest in there being really effective price competition. Rather he is interested in talking about price competition, and, at the same time, allowing the pricearranging associations, to continue to prevent effective competition.  The commission also recommended:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The coding of prescriptions to show the price charged by one chemist as a guide to other chemists is unnecessary in view of the detailed information on prices available to chemists and is undesirable in that, by promoting uniformity of prices, it may induce a chemist to charge a higher price than he might otherwise charge.  Accordingly, the commission recommends that this practice should be prohibited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister prohibit it?  No. He has not the faintest notion of prohibiting it.  When the Fair Trade Commission makes such a specific recommendation and clearly states that it is a danger and against the public interest, why has the Minister done nothing about it, if he is genuinely interested in real competition, which I am afraid he is not?</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to some of the provisions of this Bill and to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in relation to Section 5, why it is that there are so many bodies exempted from the applications of this Bill: &ldquo;a vocational education committee, a railway, road, air or water transport undertaking or a harbour authority?&rdquo;  These are all out, and quite unaffected by the Bill. &ldquo;Ex-boat prices of fish and all transactions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara' <Col N="845" /> are also not affected.  Does that apply to the prices of imported fish?</P>
    <P>Again, in the same section, in paragraph (g): &ldquo;charges for services wholly of a professional character&rdquo;&mdash; I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary does that cover chemists' prescriptions?  Are they to be completely out?  Again I would call the attention of the Seanad to Part II, Section 9, the &ldquo;Constitution of Prices Advisory Committees,&rdquo; which states&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister may from time to time by warrant under his hand constitute such and so many bodies of persons as he thinks fit...&rdquo;  That is the worst section, I think, in the whole Bill.  It means, as the Minister has frankly admitted, that he is going to take this Bill and put it on the shelf, and probably not use it at all.  He &ldquo;may from time to time,&rdquo; but there is no obligation on him to do so.</P>
    <P>In Section 10, the prices to be gone into would appear to be solely manufacturers' prices.  Senator Miss David-son has mentioned that apparently the middlemen are not covered, and it is not quite clear, but perhaps paragraph (c) covers that.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on that matter.  I should also like to ask if the section covers the price of coal and meat?  Would they be regarded as &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; commodities?  I am not clear about that.</P>
    <P>In sub-section (3) of Section 10, &ldquo;an Advisory Committee shall report to the Minister...&rdquo; and so on, &ldquo;and if it reports that the prices or charges specified in its report are unduly high owing to causes within the control of manufacturers or of persons rendering services or to undue labour costs, shall state whether in its opinion circumstances are such as to require the Minister to make an Order...&rdquo;  I would resent that reference to &ldquo;undue labour costs.&rdquo;  The only price factor references are either to &ldquo;causes within their control&rdquo; or to &ldquo;undue labour costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that, if undue labour costs are to be mentioned, exorbitant profits ought to be mentioned in that section. Nobody wants exorbitant profits, I take it, although apparently the roof <Col N="846" /> is to be taken off profits, if we are to listen to some Senators.  I thought it quite touching to hear Senator McGuire agreeing wholeheartedly with Senator Lenihan on the question of the necessity for having no limit on profits.  Yet, almost in the same breath, Senator McGuire indicated that no working-class man should get more wages.  If it is wrong to limit profits, it is surely wrong to limit wages.  Senator McGuire is horrified that the workers should get more than their 10/-, but any suggestion that there should be any limitation on profits is regarded by him as &ldquo;antisocial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to see&mdash;and I shall propose an amendment to that effect&mdash; either the omission of the words &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo; or the insertion of the words &ldquo;exorbitant profits&rdquo;.  I am not one of those who join with Senator McGuire in feeling that the more profit the business man gets, the more public thanks should be given. I think it is very nice of him to go into business, but I find it a little bit mealy-mouthed when I hear it said: &ldquo;We are getting profits which it is our public duty to take; we are doing it all for the sake of the community.&rdquo; If that is so, I should like to see many of these business men in an atmosphere of real competition, with the removal of some of the protective tariff barriers&mdash;which may in fact have to be removed in the not so distant future.  I should make the same observation about Section 14.</P>
    <P>On paragraph 2 (1) of the Second Schedule, I have made a point already in regard to consumer representatives. I think it is quite essential on these panels.</P>
    <P>There are two final points I should like to make before I conclude.  One is in regard to paragraph 11, subparagraph (5), on page 14, and is about this question of the Advisory Committee not holding its meetings in public.  I think that that is wholly bad, and I would much prefer&mdash;&ldquo;it shall, unless by consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  In paragraph 12, subparagraph (3), I notice that a witness before an Advisory Committee shall be &ldquo;entitled to the same immunities <Col N="847" /> and privileges as if he were a witness before the High Court&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  What kind of protection in fact is the witness going to get?  In sub-paragraph (4) of the same section, if any witness refuses to give evidence or gives faulty evidence, or &ldquo;does anything which if that Advisory Committee were a court of justice having power to commit for contempt of court, would be contempt of such court&rdquo;, that Advisory Committee may certify the offence of that person, and so on.  If a witness does anything wrong, the penalty is stated, but if the witness is subsequently victimised by reason of his having given evidence, he is afforded &ldquo;the same immunities and privileges&rdquo; as if he were a witness before the High Court.  What does that mean?  Supposing somebody who is a trader or a wholesaler gives evidence, and has all his supplies stopped subsequently.  Will these committees or the Minister have any power to do anything under this Act? There is no reference to that being the equivalent of contempt of court and no penalty is mentioned.</P>
    <P>A case has been brought to me of a witness who gave evidence before the Fair Trade Commission, and whose supplies were stopped immediately afterwards.  The Fair Trade Commission, with whom I have been in touch, have, in effect, confessed themselves to be powerless to protect him.  Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether this clause is quite empty, and whether in fact, unless some real protection can be offered to witnesses, such committees, if they are ever set up, will find it difficult to get witnesses to come forward.  That is all I have to say.  I am afraid I shall vote against this toothless Bill on general principle, because it is so weak.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when he spoke on the Second State of this Bill in the Dáil, stated that it gave reserved powers to the Government to deal with the prices of commodities, the prices of which might give rise to concern in certain circumstances.  He instanced the circumstances and set <Col N="848" /> out the conditions.  I might describe that as a wise decision.  We know, all of us, that unless and except the country is subjected to a state of emergency and going through an emergency, the best method of controlling prices is free competition. With the lapsing of the Supplies and Services Act towards the end of this year, it is desirable that some sort of price control should be held by the Government.  The fact that those powers cannot be used arbitrarily except in respect of some commodities should be sufficient to show to those engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or retailing the real desire of the Government to let trade flow freely.</P>
      <P>In post-war years, experience has shown the futility of trying to control the prices of certain goods simply because standards vary.  There no longer exists any lingering doubt in that regard.  All Parties subscribe to the view that whatever need there was for a system of price control in former years, it has practically vanished under present trading conditions.  In fact, in some trades, the position would seem to be reversed by the advent of the cut-price trader.  Lawful traders and certain trade unions are concerned regarding the activities of these merchants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I said lawful traders. I did not imply that it is unlawful to indulge in cut-price trading.  One can only hope that the law of diminishing returns may, in due course, catch up with those merchants.  Generally speaking, the Bill would seem to be well thought out and framed to deal with a heatedly-contested subject.  In recent years, several elections have been won and lost on the question of prices and the idea that profits are wholly illegal should have long since died a natural death.  In later times, the statement that people are not entitled to profit is no more than a mouthful of wool shavings.  That is why we, on our part, welcome the powers that are <Col N="849" /> in the Bill.  Let us hope that the Minister will have no need of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points in connection with this Bill which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to amplify now or later.  One is in connection with Section 15, which deals with the Government's declaration of a state of emergency.  It sets out: &ldquo;Whenever and so often as the Government are of opinion that abnormal circumstances prevail....&rdquo; It just says &ldquo;abnormal circumstances&rdquo; and nothing else.  I feel that that power could be used by an unscrupulous Minister in days to come to declare that abnormal circumstances exist with regard to any class of goods. Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider that there should be an appeal to the Advisory Body from an Order made under Section 15?</P>
      <P>Another section which might cause hardship is Section 14 which deals with the fixing of maximum price rates.  Suppose this Prices Advisory Committee comes to inquire into the goods of a certain manufacturer and that manufacturer himself knows that his prices are not what they should be and that the prices of the commodity he produces will be reduced by Order of the Minister.  Under Section 14, that manufacturer could unload his commodity straight away on to a shopkeeper, without the shopkeeper knowing that there was any inquiry into the price of the commodity.  Could we not safeguard the shopkeepers in that respect by putting an additional clause into the section?  In the case of raspberry jam, for instance, a manufacturer could unload large quantities by allowing his travellers to take orders for larger amounts than they would normally take, if he knew that there was to be an inquiry into his prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of the general principle of the Bill.  If we are to invite outsiders in here to start up industries, to produce and to employ, we do not want to have them saying that the people in this country have Acts and regulations about profits and that we would not allow them to make profits above a certain percentage.  If we <Col N="850" /> give them a chance to say that, they will not come in here.</P>
    <P>We can see from reports of English companies the amount of their profits that they plough back into the business. Senator Sheehy Skeffington rather thinks that all the profits from these businesses go into the pockets of the owners and are spent in riotous living.  If he would only look at the balance sheet of any competitive company, he would see that the profits are ploughed back into the business to give employment in the country.  That is the reason that we do not wish to limit profits too much in this country. Business cannot expand where profits are limited.  The former Prices Advisory Body was open to the consumers and only once was it used by the consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGuire and Senator O'Donovan have given at length the views of this side of the House, but some things have been said during the debate upon which I should like to comment.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred at some length to price control in peace time.  I believe that such control savours very much of a planned economy, the sort of economy they have in Russia, and I believe that such an economy will benefit neither the worker nor anybody else.  America is free of all forms of price control and profit margins and profits are higher there than they are anywhere else in the world.  In America, there is an enormously expanding economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire referred to the I.B.E.C. Report.  The fact that it is now six years since that technical service was made available does not render out of date any single principle laid down in that report.  One of the finding was that we are not earning enough to allow us to have an expanding and a buoyant economy, such as they have in the United States of <Col N="851" /> America.  If we have price control, we will not get the money which will give us the savings necessary to plough back into industry and we will not have money for socially desirable schemes.</P>
    <P>It is not within the wit of man to say what the effects of price control are in this or any other State which has a free economy; it is not within the wit of man to say what the results of price control may be.  We are an agricultural community and many of our products are exported to Britain and elsewhere. Cattle, sheep, pigs, bacon and so on vary in price on the British market and one of the things which helps our economy is the fact that we are in a position to export certain products to Britain when those products demand a good price, and the home market goes scarce.  Such trading is an advantage to this country and the so-called planners and the people who suggest price control might easily upset our balance of payments and upset the incentives given from time to time, because of the existence of good prices for our products, if they interfere with the market through the medium of price control.</P>
    <P>The Irish Housewives' Association and the consumer organisations could do a great deal of good if they would educate the people as to what to buy and as to what is beneficial to our economy at a particular time.  If shiploads of fish came into Dublin tomorrow and the best fish was sold at 6d. per lb., the people would not buy it.  The people are not sufficiently conscious of the market and, instead of the Housewives' Association and consumer organisations complaining about prices, they would do a tremendous amount of good if they would indicate to their members and the public generally what should be bought and where the best value is to be found.  That type of education would be very beneficial and the more expensive products could then be exported to Britain and other countries.</P>
    <P>I will deal with fish briefly.  If people got the best fish for next to nothing, they would not eat it.  These organisations could encourage people in the <Col N="852" /> use of foods which are in good supply at a particular time and are reasonable in price.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the question of profits.  Senator Cole referred to it also.  If we look at the balance sheets of any of our good public companies&mdash;and the same thing applies to the private companies that have remained in business&mdash;we find that three-quarters of the money is held for reinvestment and for expansion in these industries.  Is not private enterprise, when it is expanding its business and giving good employment, an enormous benefit to the State?  It removes from the central Government the problem of providing employment and expanding industry.</P>
    <P>I say to the people who wish to restrict profits and to be allowed to have a sort of continuous witch-hunt of industry, that they ought to bear in mind that it is only by allowing profits and reinvesting them that we can have sound, competitive industry. Such industry will require to look outside Ireland if it is to develop itself fully.  Therefore, not alone will we have a healthy industry supplying the home market, but it will also supply the export market.  The final result will be that we will have cheaper priced goods in greater variety and abundance.  The Minister deserves to be congratulated on bringing in a Bill that looks at the situation we have here in Ireland to-day in a realistic manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill at all, but as it seems to me that much nonsense has been spoken during the debate, I feel that I should make a contribution. Whether or not I speak nonsense might be a matter of opinion, but I suppose I am entitled to my opinion that a lot of what has been said is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a free economy.  There is no competition in the sense of what is known as free competition in the United States of America.  Having listened to all that has been said, I wondered why we are worried about the Free Trade Area and how it will affect Irish industry.  Because there is not free competition in industry here, it is my opinion and the opinion of <Col N="853" /> some of my colleagues that there is need for price control.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the rights of people to make profit, and I am not attempting to challenge the rights of people to make a reasonable profit; but it seems to me that the supporters of this Bill from both sides of the House are attempting to imply that if anybody raises his voice against profiteering, he is something near a communist&mdash;a terrible thing altogether. I make no apology whatever for saying that in this economy as we know it&mdash; where there are protected industries, where there cannot be, because of our small economy or the protection necessary, free competition as generally understood&mdash;the State has the obligation to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>If we look at this Bill from that angle, I am afraid we will have to say that it is quite inadequate.  It means that the Prices Advisory Body, which has done some good work, will disappear and there will be <i>ad hoc</i> bodies which may or may not be set up by the Minister, as he so wishes.  We know the attitude of this Government in regard to price control.  It has been made very plain to us and apparently it is supported by people on the other side of the House.  We saw, in answer to a question in the Dáil last week or thereabouts, a staggering list of the commodities which have been released from price control since last March. We know that this Government is not in favour of price control and of giving what I would say is adequate protection to the consumer in this economy, which is not a free economy and in which there is not a free competition, such as was referred to by previous speakers.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some of my colleagues and myself find ourselves in this predicament.  We think the Bill is quite inadequate.  We regret that the Prices Advisory Body is disappearing. The Prices Advisory Body has its existence because of the Supplies and Services Act, and that Act will lapse at the end of the year.  If this Bill is not passed, there will be no provision whatever for any measure of price control, so I suppose we have to say it is better this Bill should pass <Col N="854" /> and provide even inadequate safeguards, rather than that the provisions of the Supplies and Services Act should disappear at the end of the year, leaving no right or authority to the State to intervene at all in price control.  Whilst not enthusiastic in any sense about this Bill and whilst criticising its inadequacy, I am afraid we could not oppose its passage through the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the stage at which the principle of a Bill is debated and rejected or accepted.  I think only one speaker, Senator Sheehy Skeffington, opposed the Bill on principle. I think he specifically used the word &ldquo;principle&rdquo;.  He has interpreted the Bill as being a departure from control.  I should like to remind him, as Senator Murphy has said just now, that  the end of the year, the existing régime will have passed and there will be no power in the hands of the Government to exercise any form of price control.  Therefore, when Senator Sheehy Skeffington tells me he opposes the Bill &ldquo;on principle&rdquo;, I do not know exactly what he means.</P>
      <P>I prefer to interpret the Minister's words in the Dáil somewhat differently from the interpretation given them by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  He said that this Bill, when passed, will be shelved&mdash;and we all know what the word &ldquo;shelving&rdquo; means.  The criticism has been offered that we had control continuously applied under the existing conditions of affairs.  That is true to some extent and it is also true that we are, so to speak, withdrawing the control from that advance position and putting it into a position of reserve. However, it certainly will be there and will be available for use in the circumstances set out in this measure.  This Bill, of course, is one further step in the attempt to get away from the emergency conditions produced by the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments advanced here are so obvious that I need hardly repeat <Col N="855" /> them.  One is the very cogent argument that competition is the best regulator of prices.  This Bill is an attempt to get back to conditions of competition and, at the same time, preserve some protection for the consumer, if that protection should be required.  I could not agree more with what Senator Ó Maoláin has said just now. I have heard it said by people who were in very close contact with the machinery of control during the war years that in an atmosphere of control, prices tend to rise and in an atmosphere of competition, they tend to fall. This Bill is an effort to get the downward tendency operating under its own momenturm, to get away from the artificial system of control which, in fact, never worked satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that those who most desire, or seem to desire, control appear to be its keenest critics when they have it.  It does not seem possible to devise a scheme of control of prices which will satisfy those who are constantly clamouring for it. Nearly all of us remember that when the subsidies were imposed, there was considerable objection to them.  The arguments were somewhat like those we have been hearing now in opposition to this measure; but the very same people who opposed them also opposed the removal of them.  Consequently, one is not impressed by the consistency of many of the arguments advanced in matters of this kind. Where maximum prices are fixed under control, we know from our experience the tendency is for them to become the standard prices.  That bears out the argument that, in circumstances of control, the tendency is upward.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon objected to the removal of the provision for the display of a list of prices.  There is provision in the Bill for such a display in respect of commodities set out&mdash; the most important ones.  It seems to me that there is an inducement to business people who are charging reasonable prices to display those prices as a good piece of business advertising, leaving the buying public in their locality to make a comparison with those who are charging exorbitant <Col N="856" /> prices.  That is a far more effective method of making reasonable prices known than any official arrangements such as a statutorily required display.</P>
    <P>In the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that our controls generally had an adverse effect here on industrial promoters, the Minister was not relying on the I.B.E.C. Report alone for evidence of the truth of that statement.  The Minister has had numerous interviews with people from outside who, since the end of the war, have been showing an interest in the industrial possibilities here.  I think it has been the experience in almost all cases that they made an unfavourable comparison between the régime of control here and with the conditions of affairs in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the inducements have not up to date been sufficiently powerful to bring that amount of useful capital for industrial promotion here which our present condition demands.  If this Bill makes any small contribution towards relieving the apprehension of these people, many of them very good friends and some of them having hereditary connections with the country, who are anxious to come here, that, in itself, would justify the passage of this measure.</P>
    <P>A number of seeming anomalies have been mentioned by some Senators, but, I think, principally by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I should like to remind him, and any others who have misgivings, that there are no serious gaps being left, that there is the protection which is available under the Fair Trade Commission, and some of the matters referred to can be dealt with only under the provisions of that body.  There have been a number of matters mentioned, again picking out details in the Bill, which I think might be more thoroughly dealt with on Committee Stage.  I feel confident that if we cannot satisfy the objections, we will be able to explain the reasons.</P>
    <P>One point was made that we are applying this Act to the possible machinations of manufacturers and we <Col N="857" /> are not providing against the ultimate result of these machinations by also controlling the distributors.  If we can ensure that manufacturing costs will not be allowed to be unduly inflated because of the reasons mentioned in the Bill, we will have controlled the distribution at the proper point.  That is the explanation of why the section is worded as it is.</P>
    <P>Some Senators seem to think that there was discrimination against labour because the expression &ldquo;undue labour costs&rdquo; was used and that profits should also be specifically mentioned. Profits are, in any event, very effectively dealt with in the way I have just indicated, by dealing with the manufacturers' costs, and any machinations, rings or otherwise operated by manufacturers, will naturally be dealt with automatically.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is really anything to reply to in the debate. There has been only one speaker who indicated that the principle of this Bill was not being accepted by him.  I am at a loss to meet the objection of this Senator, because he seems to demand control much more than any other Senator who has spoken.  This Bill provides that control and, if it is not passed before the end of this year, there will not be any control.</P>
    <P>Much as that state of affairs is to be desired, if it could be achieved with safety to the consuming public, we feel that the time has not yet arrived when control can be entirely abolished.  By removing control a little to the background, in view of the many objections expressed to it by the people who can contribute very considerably to the economic progress of the country, we are making a gesture, showing that we appreciate their viewpoint and that we are determined to co-operate with them as much as possible.  However, in view of our experience during the emergency, we feel the time has not arrived at which control can entirely be abolished.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O'Donovan who referred to the effects of the removal of subsidies on the price of bread.  When control was removed in respect of bread, action was taken <Col N="858" /> almost immediately to increase the price of that vital commodity.  The Minister was forced to step right back again with an emergency Order to restore the position.  That experience indicates that it is not yet safe to remove control entirely and we feel this is the best compromise, and the best arrangement, in the present circumstances of the conflict that exists between the business community and those who speak for the consumer.  In the last analysis, when all is said and done, the Government is the best protector of the consumer.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal object of this Bill is to extend the operations of the Undeveloped Areas Act 1952 for a further period of five years beyond 31st December, 1958, and to increase the funds available under that Act from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000.</P>
      <P>Of the £2,000,000 provided under the 1952 Act, An Foras Tionscal has entered into commitments in respect of grants amounting to approximately £1,600,000 and I understand that applications likely to come before that body for consideration in the near future exceed the balance of £400,000 remaining at their disposal.  With the assistance available under the Act 31 industrial projects have already gone into production and there are 18 more at various stages of development.  The assisted projects cover a fairly wide range of products, including textile yarns, cloth and other textile manufactures, plastics, ceramics and a number of engineering products.  The total capital involved in these projects is of the order of £4,500,000 and they are expected to employ over 3,000 persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the results achieved to date <Col N="859" /> under the Undeveloped Areas Act cannot be described as startling, it should be borne in mind that the tendency for industrial activity to concentrate in the eastern part of the country is deepseated. I think it may be safely said that few if any of the projects which have been assisted would have started in the undeveloped areas were it not for the facilities available under the Act.  From the manner in which the volume of grants approved under the Acts has tended to increase in recent years it seems that promoters are becoming increasingly conscious of the value of the facilities available under the Act.  For the first three years, i.e., to the 31st March, 1955, the grants approved were of the order of £150,000 each year; in the succeeding two years grants approved amounted to slightly under £300,000 and £400,000 respectively; while to date this year grants approved exceeded £400,000.  In the light of these figures, it would be reasonable to expect that there will be a quickening of the tempo of industrial development in the undeveloped areas in the coming years.</P>
    <P>No doubt Senators will be interested to learn that, apart from providing employment and contributing to the general improvement of the economic position of the undeveloped areas, the facilities provided under the Act are also helping to contribute to a solution of the most pressing problem facing the country as a whole, that is, the expansion of exports.  Certain of the projects already in production have entered the export field and I understand that there are several projects which have either been approved or are under active consideration and which, if they come to fruition, will make a significant contribution to our export potential.</P>
    <P>As Senators will no doubt have noticed, quite a considerable part of the present Bill is related to what will happen when An Foras Tionscal ceases to exist.  The reason why these provisions have been inserted in the Bill is that An Foras Tionscal drew attention to the fact that as a considerable length of time may elapse between the approval of a project and its completion <Col N="860" /> it would be desirable that there should be some machinery whereby grants promised by An Foras Tionscal, but not discharged when that organisation ceases to exist, would be paid. The Bill proposes that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will accept liability for all commitments entered into by An Foras Tionscal when the grants scheme is ended.  I should like to emphasise that the inclusion of these provisions in the Bill does not imply that a decision has been taken to end the grant scheme.  They are merely designed to deal with the position which would arise if the scheme were ended.  There is nothing in these provisions which would prevent the Oireachtas extending the grants scheme in due course for a further period should such a step be considered desirable.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal has also drawn attention to the fact that certain practical difficulties have arisen from the provision in the 1952 Act that, in determining the amount of a training grant, wages in excess of the normal trade union rate for learners should be disallowed.  The Bill proposes to remedy the position by repealing this provision and leaving it to An Foras Tionscal to decide how much will be given for training purposes in any particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection to this Bill, naturally.  The House supported the measure when it was introduced originally and if there is a proposal for its extension we must welcome it.  If we speak of ourselves as having undeveloped areas in relation to industrial development, we must be prepared to make some contribution to this development.  We can see the vast amount of funds being placed at the disposal of Northern Ireland for the assistance of industrial activity there.  They are, in this regard, spending a great deal more than we are and they are making it possible for big industrial undertakings from outside the country, and even outside Britain, to come into their territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, I think it is of utmost importance, when proposals are being studied, that we should try to keep as close as possible <Col N="861" /> to the development of the type of industry which is related to the needs of the people here.  While it is desirable to cultivate and develop an attitude of mind about the building up of new industries and new ideas, it is something of which we have not had a great deal of experience.  If we are to have something stable and lasting, it must be related as closely as possible to the everyday lives of the people.  We can see the disturbance that can take place with a great institution like Short Brothers and Harland of Belfast.  How it happens, one does not understand, but it is conceivable that in the new world which we are entering in regard to measures of defence and attack in war, many of the orthodox resources and ideas and methods may have to be abandoned and there can be such an upheaval in industrial life as will have a tremendous impact on the economy.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain we are not venturing into that field very far, but I do want to emphasise that point of view.  We must approach this problem of industrial development, either in the undeveloped areas or beyond them, with the attitude of mind that we are not just going to produce something for the limited market we have here at home.  When we cast our bread on the water in regard to development and industry, we must do so with the attitude of mind and with the conviction that not only are we going to give our own consumers the best commodity that can be produced from such a factory anywhere, but we are going to work hard and efficiently so that it can be put on the market outside our shores, and thereby earn an income for us.</P>
    <P>I raised certain objections to the original Act and the restrictions imposed on, or the limit to, the area in the original Act.  I am not making any very vigorous protest about this matter now, but it is true that foreigners coming in here prefer to remain in the east.  That is perfectly understandable. It may very well be that we will have to adopt the attitude that, if new industries are to develop here and are to come in from outside with people who have the technique, <Col N="862" /> the capital and so on, they will have to be given free choice to go where they like.  It may be good national business to assist these industries even in the east, in the midlands, in the north-east or anywhere else our people can be employed.  I know it is very desirable to keep our people in the undeveloped areas, but it is very difficult to do it.  They have developed minds to the point where they do not accept that the confines of their own shores give them ample scope for their efforts and abilities.  They are leaving their own country and going beyond it to find a way of life.</P>
    <P>If the opportunity comes to the country to develop an industry that can only get a start by having it, as I say, in the east or in the midlands, it is very good national policy to assist in its establishment, even if it is outside the undeveloped areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows the people of these regions better than I do.  It is true that their opportunities and resources are limited, but that is perhaps due to circumstances over which they have no control.  Whether we come from the north, south, east or west, we are all Irish, and, when we begin to draw lines and make efforts to classify our people into different sections, I do not think we are giving them the best opportunities to develop.  I will not pursue that matter any further to-day.</P>
    <P>I know, and all the members of this House know, that, in the Six Counties, they have not yet taken up the matter of building industries in what they might describe as their undeveloped areas.  They have left the poorest and most remote areas until the very last. As far as we are concerned here, we have a problem, a complicated, difficult problem.  We have not the training or the knowledge that is necessary and it is not available to us.  We have to go out in search of it and have to find it, and that is not an easy thing to do in the world of to-day.  In fact, we have to put a note of interrogation after the question as to why all our endeavours and efforts to base industries here have not been more successful.</P>
    <P>If we cannot found industries in the country as a whole, one wonders whether we will have much success in <Col N="863" /> trying to bring industries into the more remote areas, where transport and other matters of that nature are of major importance.  While we all support this Bill, we may have to face the problem as to whether the proposals embodied in it may not have to be applied to the country as a whole.  We are going to make one last desperate effort to provide a way of life for our people.  We must be in a hurry about doing that, because there is very little time left to us, owing to the attitude of mind we have in the country to-day.  There is not a great amount of time left to us to find the means of living for our young people some place in Ireland.  It would be a good thing if the Parliamentary Secretary and his Minister did consider whether the time is now ripe for the extension of the proposals contained in this Bill to the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the House from the West of Ireland, I wish to extend a welcome to this very important Bill.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated, the principal Act to which this is an amending Bill has been nothing but a success.  In all, 46 projects in the West of Ireland and in Kerry and Donegal have been assisted under the Act and £1,500,000 of State funds have been approved of as grants to these industries.  The total amount invested is in the region of £4,500,000 and the approximate number of people who will be employed when the money is fully invested is in the region of 4,000.  That is not an inconsiderable achievement.  It is something that the people in the West of Ireland are very proud to have achieved over the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises as to why there cannot be similar developments in other areas of the country.  As far as I know, the Industrial Grants Act which was passed last year purported to make available similar grants to other parts of the country.  My information is that that Act, unlike the Undeveloped Areas Act, is largely ineffective. I believe that is due to the fact that it was very hastily drafted at the back end of last year.  I should <Col N="864" /> like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us how many grants have been made under that Act.  We know that 46 projects have been started under the Undeveloped Areas Act and I should like to know how many have been started under the Industrial Grants Act of 1956.</P>
    <P>I come from a county that has not benefited overmuch from the Undeveloped Areas Act.  County Roscommon has not succeeded as yet in getting any industry under that Act, and I hope that the officials will bear that in mind when they are considering further applications from that county.</P>
    <P>A matter which was referred to by the Minister when introducing the Bill in the Dáil was the question of contiguous areas.  He said in Volume 164, No. 2, column 293 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of certain areas which are contiguous to these undeveloped areas, as defined in the Act, I have indicated that, if concrete proposals emerge, they will be referred to An Foras Tionscal for consideration and, if An Foras Tionscal indicates its readiness to give assistance, I will be prepared on my part to give sympathetic consideration to the question of making a Scheduling Order under the Act in respect of the area concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that should bring in certain congested areas abutting on the undeveloped areas, such as West Cavan, Longford, South Westmeath and Offaly.  I gather from the remarks of the Minister that these areas will receive favourable consideration, if application should be made for industries for these areas.  That is a very welcome provision.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter has already pointed out that a considerable proportion of these industries have been contributing, or are likely to contribute, to our export trade.  That is a matter for congratulation and particular emphasis should be placed on it, in view of the fact that we are about to enter into the European free trade area.  That is a progressive trend and should be encouraged.  There is some hope for <Col N="865" /> the future when we find these industries contributing to our export trade.</P>
    <P>As regards the future of the country on the industrial side, a large part of our hope lies in the prospect of bringing American capital here.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has referred to the fact that we could play a specific part in American investment in the future European free trade area. In that context, the West of Ireland would be very suitable and would be an ideal base for any such investment.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of discussion lately about the possibility of developing the Shannon estuary as a major port.  Possibly Galway and Cork harbours could be developed in the same way.  The South and West are particularly suitable for American investment for the purpose of developing, processing or despatching American goods into the European free trade or common market area.</P>
    <P>It is good to see the snowball effect so far of this Undeveloped Areas Act. In the first year, £150,000 was spent; in the second year, £300,000; in the third year, £300,000; in the past two years, £400,000 each year.  If we can encourage American investment here on the basis of this country being a springboard for American expansion into European markets, then that effort could be further accelerated. The South and West could be utilised by prospective American investors. Heretofore, the trend in trade has been towards Britain and the east coast has predominated as the trading and commercial centre of the country.  With American investment over the next five, six or ten years, the South and West could redress that balance.</P>
    <P>I know that this may sound theoretical and speculative, but it is important that we should have a measure such as this making public moneys available to prospective investors, be they foreigners or nationals, for the purpose of developing the South and West.  There is no doubt that we have too long had this pull between the east coast and Britain.  It is time that pull was corrected and greater attention given to areas which have been depressed for years.  There can be no <Col N="866" /> opposition here or anywhere else to this admirable extension, the purpose of which is to make available from public funds another £2,000,000 over the next five years towards the development of the congested areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say very much on this measure, except, perhaps, to continue what I was saying earlier on another measure.  Giving an initiating lump sum to an industrialist to establish an industry in the West of Ireland is merely launching the ship or having the baby born.  There has been a certain amount of disappointment and disillusionment.  I know cases myself where industries have been started, involving quite a lot of initial capital investment, together with help from the Government and local capital, in which there has been very serious disappointment and loss of money.  It is all part of a general problem to which I referred earlier to-day: our industrial climate must be one in which industry can prosper, not only in the undeveloped areas but all over the country.  The climate in which industry and business generally are trying to operate here is not a healthy one.  It is no good giving a man £100,000 to open a factory in Galway, if, when he makes a few pounds, a penal load of taxation is imposed upon him and he is allowed no proper depreciation value for machinery and so forth.  In other words, it is no good launching the ship, unless the sea on which it is launched is a calm one and one upon which the ship can sail gracefully and successfully into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one stage, people had some criticism to make about An Foras Tionscal and how sticky they were in accepting some of the propositions put forward.  I think they are quite right because, in the past 30 years, we have had too much of the idea of people trying to bring industries to places without knowing exactly what industries they were going to bring.  Very often, people who, with the best of intentions, set themselves behind a project to bring an industry to a particular place, found themselves ultimately with no industry to bring.  They went to the Department of Industry <Col N="867" /> and Commerce and looked up files to see what was being imported and how much, in the vain belief that they could establish an industry to cut out these imports.  That approach is absolutely wrong because these people become involved in something in relation to which they are completely lacking in know-how.  The whole thing is amateur and it ends in loss of money, disappointment and disillusionment. That has happened in a majority of cases since we started our industrial drive.</P>
    <P>If the right climate is created here, particularly in relation to benevolent taxation, and if we have a proper outlook as to what return should be given on investments and proper co-operation from workers, we may get somewhere. All too often, our workers want to start at the top.  Anybody who starts an industry here finds himself in comparison with Birmingham immediately.  If an industry is started in Tralee, the union marches in in the first week and says that the right pay for the people is such and such because that is what is being paid in Birmingham, and the unfortunate promoter finds himself faced with what amounts to an ultimatum.</P>
    <P>We want a realistic approach.  We must give industry not only a fair chance to start but a fair chance to carry on.  If the proper atmosphere is created, the undeveloped areas will take their place.  Industrialists may and will require special incentives to go to these areas.  The natural place to start an industry is Dublin.  As a business man, if I were starting an industry to-morrow, I would put it in Dublin, and, if I am asked to go elsewhere, with a view to providing employment, then some extra incentive must be given.  That is where a Bill of this kind comes in.  Extra capital is made available.  I would go so far as to say extra incentives in the way of tax remission should be given to people in out-of-the-way places to carry on industries in such areas.</P>
    <P>We should go back to fundamentals in creating an industrial economy here. We should encourage people to invest and, having invested, we should give them a fair return on their money, together <Col N="868" /> with the facility of working in a congenial atmosphere in which they can be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome this Bill.  From the experience we have had of the working of the Undeveloped Areas Act, I am wondering whether we might not consider if, in fact, the purposes of that Act are being achieved and if the provisions are sufficiently wide in their scope.  Reading the debate on this measure in the Dáil, I was struck by the fact that the Minister said that there were more applications for assistance turned down than granted due to the fact that it could not be shown that there was an economic disadvantage attaching to the location of the industries proposed.  I found that the approach to this measure is to compensate the industry for the economic disadvantage of the location.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Act originally was to start a flow of industry to the undeveloped areas to correct the unbalance in regard to the setting up of industry, which has been in existence for the past few decades, and to get industries more interested in the western undeveloped areas.  The Minister hoped if that flow could be started, it would gather force of itself. What he proposed and made provision for was temporary assistance for industry to move into the undeveloped areas and that, once that flow got started, the special assistance could then be withdrawn and the flow would continue of itself.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, considering the legislation from that point of view, it does not in fact go far enough, because if you are simply giving compensation to an industrialist for the disadvantage of the location, you are not, in effect, inducing him to move to the undeveloped area and to set up an industry there.  What the Act provides and what An Foras Tionscal does is simply to give that measure of compensation. Where it is found that in fact there is no economic disadvantage in going to the undeveloped area, no assistance is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that the general principle of this could be looked at afresh. For instance, I wonder how many of <Col N="869" /> the industries which were refused assistance, because it could not be shown that there was an economic disadvantage in the location, eventually went to the undeveloped area or, because of the refusal, simply set up in the east?  I should imagine if I were an industrialist, which unfortunately I am not, I would not take on the difficulty of going to the undeveloped area, if I were simply to be given compensation for the economic disadvantage of the location.  I should prefer to stay in the east and do without that compensation, because, as I said, it is not an inducement.</P>
    <P>If the real purpose of the original Act is to be achieved, I think there would have to be an inducement.  That is the only thought I have on the measure.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister will consider that suggestion on its merits and see if in fact further assistance should not and could not be given by way of inducements.</P>
    <P>I would just make one comment on what has been said during the debate so far.  It struck me that while every Party and every individual would welcome foreign investment, foreign know-how and foreign assistance in the setting up of industries here, we may be beginning to look for foreign assistance without making an effort ourselves.  We may be thinking that it is necessary to have American know-how and capital, without at the same time giving ourselves a push and seeing if we can do anything ourselves.  We should welcome foreign assistance, but not sit back and wait for somebody else to come in and rescue us.</P>
    <P>That thought came to my mind when Senator Lenihan was speaking about the ports and, in particular, about Shannon Port.  I recollect that there have been suggestions that we should investigate the possibility of setting up a free port in Shannon.  In this matter again, are we to say that American capital and know-how must do it?  I do not know enough about it to be able to say whether in fact we ourselves should not get cracking on the idea and see if we can do it.  Well and good, if we can get assistance from outside, it would be welcome, but <Col N="870" /> surely we cannot forever sit back and say that if the American, Belgian, Dutch or British industrialists will not come in here, we ourselves can do nothing.  We must make the attempt ourselves and, while welcoming assistance from outside, we should not lose sight of the fact that endeavours should be made within the country itself and would always be welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that we have only a very limited amount of money available for investment in Ireland and it is necessary that we should invest this money in a way that will give the best return and the largest amount of employment.  In the establishment of industries in the West, we must always take into account the disadvantages of heavy freight charges from the western seaboard to ports in Britain and Europe. I know of one commodity that is exported from Waterford to London at a cost of 160/- per ton and it costs 220/- to export the same commodity from Tralee.  An equally high charge is levied on the export of the same commodity from the port of Sligo.</P>
      <P>The Minister should direct the board to see that the industries established in the West are industries that give large employment and that the articles manufactured are of such a nature that the freight charges on them will be in no way a deterrent to their future.  In the South of Ireland, in the areas adjacent to the ports of Waterford and Cork, there is the advantage of being able to compete on favourable or more than favourable terms with the east coast ports trading with Britain and they have the advantage of being nearer to the continental ports.</P>
      <P>It appeared, from the figures which the Minister gave, that £1,500,000&mdash;he did not give the figures in that way&mdash; would require to be invested, from their experience, to provide employment for 1,000 persons.  We can all see that it is very necessary to have this money invested fruitfully and beneficially, if we are to help to solve our unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I say this board will have a very heavy responsibility, in seeing that the money invested in the west <Col N="871" /> will be successfully invested and that these industries will continue to operate long after the period in which they will enjoy the benefit of these grants.  If there is any doubt in the mind of the board as to the suitability of location, and if freight does not enter into it as too great a deterrent, I think they should recommend to those prospective industrialists to avail of grants made under the Industrial Grants Act and that they should establish the industries in suitable locations in the south or east.</P>
    <P>We have no money to experiment and we must be sure that any investment we undertake, and for which the State gives money, will be a permanent investment which will not need any future assistance from the State.</P>

      <P>I take the view that grants made by An Foras Tionscal would be in the nature of an inducement to industrialists within the area, or people outside it proposing to set up an industrial undertaking in the West.  Those grants would be regarded then as an inducement.  I had always regarded these grants as inducements and I was rather alarmed when Senator Murphy suggested they be regarded as compensation to offset the disadvantages of going to a congested district.  The very fact that a considerable amount of money has been paid out as grants to over 40 industrial undertakings would indicate that those grants must be regarded as inducements, rather than compensation. If they were to be regarded merely as compensation, in view of the disadvantages of establishing an undertaking in the West, I doubt if that amount of money would have been paid out.</P>
      <P>As Senator Murphy suggested, there may be a particular type of undertaking that would not qualify for a grant in Connacht.  If I or any group of individuals were to start a limestone undertaking in an area like South Galway, in competition with people in an existing business, most people would agree that an undertaking of that sort should not get a grant from An Foras Tionscal.  If a grant were given in such circumstances, it would have the effect of giving State money to one individual, or one group of individuals, who would just be going into competition with an industry already in operation in that area.</P>
      <P>There could be similar such cases in Donegal, which is covered by the Undeveloped Areas Act, where they have the technical know-how and industrial undertakings, for instance, in respect of shirt-making.  If an Foras Tionscal were to give grants to other undertakings to compete in the same line, I think Senator Murphy would agree it would be an abuse of State capital. It is to provide that such things will not happen that the Act is so drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still hold the view that the moneys paid out under this Act are of an inducement nature, rather than a compensatory nature, to offset the disadvantages <Col N="874" /> which industrial undertakings would be up against in congested districts.</P>
    <P>While the amount of money spent by way of grants is fairly substantial, and while the number of undertakings which received grants is over 40, the Parliamentary Secretary did not tell us the number of cases that were turned down.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary may take the view that it would not be desirable to tell us the number of cases that were turned down, because it would create a false impression.  We can all fully realise that a body like An Foras Tionscal will have proposals placed before it from time to time of an immature nature.  Immature proposals would be ones which were not given a lot of thought or study, or any detailed examination with regard to the question of manufacture, the proximity of raw materials and the possibility of marketing. With such proposals, An Foras Tionscal could not go very far, and for that reason there might be a large number of applications turned down by it.  I often wondered what percentage of concrete proposals were received, and what percentage received grants, because I have heard it suggested, and I have argued to the contrary, that An Foras Tionscal is a rather conservative body.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that it is only when An Foras Tionscal are fully satisfied that an industrial proposal will succeed that it will give a grant. I should not like to think that is so. I should like to feel, since there is a reasonable element of risk in any undertaking, and it is because of that risk that it is quite often hard to get capital in a congested district, that An Foras Tionscal would be prepared to take ordinary risks.  In fact I should go so far as to say &ldquo;more than ordinary risks&rdquo;.  When An Foras Tionscal can feel there is a reasonably sound proposition, a reasonable hope of good management and a reasonable hope of success, it should pay out grants.  It would not be a good thing at all that it should be felt by people outside that An Foras Tionscal was so conservative that it would pay grants only when it was more than sure of the success of any undertaking.  People <Col N="875" /> investing their money in any undertaking must take the reasonable risks involved.</P>
    <P>I do hope that, in view of the experience of the past number of years, and the fairly substantial success achieved by industrial undertakings in congested districts, An Foras Tionscal from now on, having found its feet, will be able to do its bit and not be so conservative in its approach to paying grants to concrete undertakings.  It would not be a good thing if it should be felt An Foras Tionscal was too conservative. I myself do not think so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell Senator Baxter that there is no leaning against the other rural areas simply because there are special facilities being provided under the Act for the western areas, and I think it is hardly necessary to mention them.  They cover the entire western coast from West Cork to Donegal and when one uses the term &ldquo;west,&rdquo; it must be taken to signify <Col N="876" /> the entire western coast from north to south.  I think that the balance has been possibly restored somewhat, if it was ever disturbed, by the passing of the Industrial Grants Act.  But Senator Baxter himself in his opening remarks, in making a case against the location of industries in remote places because of transport costs, and so on, made the very case on which the Act is based and that was the argument which the Minister for Industry and Commerce advanced when he was speaking in the Dáil and Seanad originally in respect of provisions of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do not know what practical difference there is between compensation and inducement in respect of special facilities being offered.  I take it that the size of the grant offered must be sufficient to influence a decision on the part of the promoter to establish his industry in one of the western locations, as against elsewhere.  There are exceptions, of course, and if there is no economic disadvantage&mdash;that expression has been used here&mdash;then the applicant does not qualify.</P>
    <P>For instance, if somebody discovers a valuable mineral in one of these areas, he cannot&mdash;and this has been emphasised by the Minister on many occasions&mdash;get a grant under the Undeveloped Areas Act to develop that mineral because, whether he likes it or not, he has to develop it where he found it.  But if it is a case of establishing a factory and he has a location east or west of the Shannon, the giving of the grant may decide which location he may choose.  I think, in simple terms, that explains the function or the purpose of this Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is anything special being introduced into this amending Bill that requires an explanation, because all the explanations are, as I say, in the debates covering the original Acts.  What the present Bill does is to increase the amount of money so that the operation of this Act can be continued for a further five years. The Minister has said that there have not been spectacular results, but there have been satisfactory results, results sufficient to justify a continuation of these inducements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> With regard to the question raised by, I think, Senator Lenihan, about areas outside and contiguous to the undeveloped areas, I would point out that it is possible in respect of some of these to have a Scheduling Order made, if, in fact, industrial proposals materialise; but I think it would be unfair to expect the Minister to make a Scheduling Order until definite concrete proposals had taken shape.  Perhaps it is well to emphasise that the industries established with the help of these aids are not Government factories and the Government and the Department of Industry and Commerce have no more function in relation to their management when they are established than they have in respect of industries established entirely with private money.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the criticisms raised about An Foras Tionscal being somewhat conservative.  I think there is sufficient evidence on the records of An Foras Tionscal to show there are very many people in the country who are prepared to start industries in many parts of the undeveloped areas, provided An Foras Tionscal puts up the money.  Anybody will take a risk with Government grants, if he gets them, but there are certain well-defined rules and practices now established that are invariably applied.  Number one is that the applicants for the assistance must bear the greatest part of the risk of any failure.  In other words, there must be more private money in the industry than public money.  That is one safeguard.  If it were otherwise, a great many proposals might get through that would not have as good a chance of success as they have under the existing arrangement.</P>
    <P>Another proviso, and I think it has been referred to by some Senators, is that a proposal, no matter how sound it may be in itself, must not be of a kind that if an industry is established, it is likely to render existing industries, established with private finance, uneconomic.  Anybody can think of some commodity that is being produced in sufficient quantity at present for, say, the home market, and if another producing plant is set up, the entire production of that commodity <Col N="878" /> might become uneconomic.  Therefore, State money will not be put into an industry which would be calculated to produce a result of that kind.  If the promoters want to set up that industry with their own money, either in the undeveloped areas or outside, they are quite free to do it.  That is a further consideration that An Foras Tionscal has to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other things which are emphasised in a leaflet issued by An Foras Tionscal.  One of these is that the industries will be likely to provide or maintain employment in the area and another is that financial assistance is necessary to ensure the establishment and continuance of that industry.  It may be that, in respect of the application of these rules, people may say that An Foras Tionscal is a conservative body, that it has a narrow outlook on this matter and that its conservative attitude is rendering the operation of the Act nugatory.  On the other hand, there was evidence in some of the speeches made to-night that there was a danger that An Foras Tionscal was leaning in the opposite direction.  My suggestion is that An Foras Tionscal has steered a clear course right between these two extremes.  It is not, on the one hand, over-conservative and on the other hand, I want to warn people who think that they can set up industries on State money that An Foras Tionscal is not so flaithiúil as to accommodate them.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think they have done the right thing in saying that the initiative and drive has got to come from the people who want to have the industry.  I think it is quite clear to everybody that An Foras Tionscal is doing splendid work.  There ought to be, and we have found that there is, sufficient initiative and also a reasonable amount of capital available, both inside and outside the undeveloped areas, to induce an increasing number of industries to find a location inside these areas.  It has been particularly gratifying that foreigners also have shown an interest in the operation of this Act.  I do not know if I am correct in saying that Americans show preference for complete ownership of <Col N="879" /> the industries which they wish to establish and that the British, in comparison, like to be partnered by Irish industrialists.</P>
    <P>I do know at least one recently-arrived American who preferred to have the entire ownership to himself, but he did show an interest in the facilities afforded by An Foras Tionscal.  On the other hand, there are several others who have a sort of hybrid directorate, composed of Irish and British.  An Foras Tionscal is not concerned very much with considerations of that kind.  They make their decisions entirely on the principles I have referred to.</P>
    <P>There is reasonable hope that this Act, given a further period of five years, will produce much better results, because the character of the grants made indicate projects which will, at the end of the five years, have absorbed the additional money which is being made available under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The reasons for suggesting that these industries should be in the east and south, as advanced by Senator Burke, are the reasons why the Undeveloped Areas Act is there.  There is a definite disparity of advantage existing between the west and the east.  We would have no hope of making any reasonable progress in the undeveloped areas industrially, if that disadvantage was not reduced as much as possible.  I think it will be freely admitted that emigration is most rampant in those undeveloped areas and that the population there is the population which we can least afford to lose by emigration.  By comparison with Leinster and Munster, the problem has now reached a point at which it is imperative that we must preserve the population.</P>
    <P>The only hope we have of doing that is by an increase in industrial employment. It has been said that our emigrants find their way to towns and cities in America and England.  The alternative is to give them an opportunity of settling down in an Irish town and the advantage of this Act is that there is a reasonable chance that they will not have to go to the Irish town at all.  Some of these <Col N="880" /> industries are finding their way to the rural places.  That is a distinct advantage and a feature which should be noted in connection with this measure.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is anything else I should say.  If there are any questions which I have not dealt with, I will do my best to answer them on Committee Stage, when we will have a further opportunity of dealing with them.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the draft Order is to provide the Dundalk Engineering Works Limited with working capital by way of bank borrowing guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  Under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, the Minister for Finance may guarantee both as to principal and interest borrowing by a body scheduled to the Act, with in the limit specified in the schedule. Section 9 of the Act empowers the Government by Order to add a body to the schedule and to specify the limit within which borrowing by that body may be guaranteed.  A draft of the Order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the Order may not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  It is proposed in the draft Order to add Dundalk Engineering Works Limited to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954 and to insert the sum of £500,000 as the <Col N="881" /> maximum amount of borrowing by that company which can be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Common services on the G.N.R. cross-Border secondary lines were terminated on the 1st October last and passenger services on the &ldquo;stump&rdquo; lines remaining in the State, on the 14th October.  Merchandise services on the &ldquo;stump&rdquo; lines in the State are being continued for a further period on an experimental basis.  The termination of these services will immediately reduce the volume of railway work available for the Dundalk Works. The projected closure of the Porta-down-Derry line, and the decision of the Belfast Minister of Commerce to terminate, one year hence, the G.N.R. agreement entered into in 1953 for the joint acquisition and operation of the G.N.R. undertaking will inevitably involve a further reduction&mdash;possibly to the point of extinction&mdash;in the amount of railway engineering work to be done.  As already announced the Dundalk Engineering Works, Limited, has been formed to take over the works and carry on general engineering work there.  The new company will continue to undertake all the engineering work required by the G.N.R. on a basis that will involve no extra cost to the board and will also actively canvass the possibilities of attracting to the Dundalk works new industrial activities of the type for which the works are suitable.</P>
      <P>The Dundalk works provide employment for some 1,100 workers, the majority of them skilled men.  The works are the biggest source of employment in Dundalk, with a weekly wage bill of the order of £10,000.  If the works were to close, or if the volume of employment there were to be seriously curtailed, the loss of employment would be a severe hardship on the men and the prosperity of Dundalk would be adversely affected. It is to be hoped that the efforts of the new company will be successful and that these efforts will ensure a growing volume of permanent employment which will be independent of developments affecting the future position of the G.N.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements are proceeding for the <Col N="882" /> leasing of the works to the new company. The company requires considerable working capital to enable it to carry on and develop the works.  As the works are being leased by the company it has no assets to offer as security against bank borrowing in the normal way.  There are at present legal difficulties in the way of a transfer of ownership.  A new situation will arise, however, in October 1958 if the G.N.R. agreement is then terminated as proposed by the Minister of Commerce. The G.N.R. will then cease to exist as a separate undertaking and ownership of the works will be transferred to the new company.  It is hoped that it will be possible to arrange for the transfer of the physical assets to the new company without capital liability.  Meanwhile the company will operate the workshops under lease. Dundalk Engineering Works Limited is a State sponsored company in which the Minister for Finance holds the entire capital of £100.  This will be the position for some time at least but should the success of the venture or other circumstances warrant it the structure of the company can be altered later if necessary.</P>
    <P>The company has already tendered for some large contracts abroad. Naturally, we hope that it will be successful in securing some or all of the contracts it is seeking.  On the assumption that it may be successful in securing these contracts or some other contracts of equivalent dimensions it is estimated that a working capital of £500,000 approximately may be required. This sum is required as working capital in the ordinary sense of the term.  It is intended to enable the company to buy materials, pay wages and do all the work involved in completing any orders the company may receive.</P>
    <P>It is important that the company should be in a position to tackle vigorously and without financial impediment the task of developing new activities at the works.  The provision of working capital is in itself, of course, no assurance of the success of the enterprise.  The board of the new company have been given an immense task.  Over 1,000 workers are involved. <Col N="883" /> The establishment of a new enterprise in this country employing 1,000 skilled men would be a big achievement at any time, but the preservation of employment on that scale at Dundalk is as big an undertaking to face and nobody should have any illusions about the size of the task.  It is not possible to guarantee at this stage that the efforts of the new company will be successful.  The success of the venture will depend, in the main, on the competence with which the undertaking is directed and the opportunities which arise for the development of new forms of engineering activities at the works.  It will particularly depend on the energy and enthusiasm with which the workers in the works face the task of building up the efficiency of the works in a way which will enhance the prospects of developing new activities particularly export business.  Indeed the great asset of these shops is not the machinery or buildings that are there but the skill of the workers and it is that asset that has to be turned into revenue to maintain the workshops.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps refer to a number of subsidiary problems which has arisen out of the transfer of the workshops. These problems, some of which have not yet been resolved, relate to pension and other rights of the workers who will be transferred to the new company.  Some of the workers in Dundalk works have pension rights based on a fund; some have what might be called rights based on traditional practice.  The pension fund is substantially in deficit but payment of the pensions is at present guaranteed by the G.N.R. Board.  The clerical and most of the supervisory staff at Dundalk works are members of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund and means are being sought to preserve the pension rights of those officers who transfer to the new company. These and other staff problems have been the subject of numerous discussions between all parties concerned, including the trade unions representing the men.  It is the aim of all concerned to remove these problems and the anxieties that go with them in a way which will leave no permanent <Col N="884" /> discontent behind.  The solution of some of the problems involved will require legislation and the necessary legislation will be prepared in due course.  In the meantime there would seem to be no reason why suitable and acceptable working arrangements cannot be completed.</P>
    <P>I recommend this motion to the House.  The enterprise with which the new company is being entrusted is a major one which could not be carried on without adequate working capital. I am sure that the proposed Order which will provide the necessary working capital meets with the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that these difficulties of the Dundalk workshops were bound to come to a head, once the Government declined to exercise its right, under the 1953 legislation, to keep open the secondary lines of the G.N.R.  However, that is so much water under the bridge.  Even though I did not see eye to eye with the Government attitude and their approach to the problem at that time, nevertheless matters have taken their course and we now have to deal with the difficulties which have resulted.</P>
      <P>It is prudent that the Government should not await the end of the agreement on 1st October, 1958, before doing anything about the workshops.  They have taken a commendable step in trying to tackle the problem in the intervening months.  I wonder, however, if the steps they are taking are the right ones.  I remember that some two years ago the T.U.C. suggested to the Government the setting up of a heavy engineering authority.  The idea was that this authority would be based on the railway workshops in Inchicore, would be independent of public transport, while still carrying out work for the railways, and would have freedom to develop heavy engineering, do work for other semi-State organisations or private industry, and possibly work for foreign industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the fact that Dundalk will become redundant next year, it is right that the effort should be made in order to use and develop the workshops at Dundalk.  But there seems to be this difference.  The heavy engineering <Col N="885" /> authority suggested by the T.U.C. would be a semi-State undertaking along the lines of the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and other like concerns.  However, we do not seem to know exactly what is intended by the Government in regard to the Dundalk Engineering Company Limited.  Will this be a semi-State undertaking along the lines envisaged by the T.U.C. or, on the other hand, will it be a private undertaking?</P>
    <P>It seems obvious, for a start, that private enterprise and industry, as such, cannot undertake that type of work.  We are being asked here to provide a guarantee of loans by this new undertaking without being told in fact what is envisaged.  The capital of this company is, I think, a nominal £100 and it is held exclusively by the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, it would seem that the Minister for Finance would be the person who has appointed the directors.</P>
    <P>I have to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that the trade union movement is puzzled and alarmed by the fact that the Minister did not think fit to appoint as a director somebody with experience in trade union matters. This seem to be a complete departure from the practice of, not only this Government, but of all previous Governments.  Indeed, I would have thought that in dealing with workshops such as this, in which there is a variety of trade agreements and so on, it would be desirable to continue the practice of appointing somebody with that background of experience in trade union matters.  I wonder can the Parliamentary Secretary give us an explanation for this departure from practice?  Perhaps he can say, which would be more satisfactory, that steps will be taken to correct that unfortunate lapse at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the position of the workers employed in the Dundalk workshops.  There are some thousand workers there, most of them skilled craftsmen in receipt of trade union rates of pay.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, that employment for these should be continued&mdash;important not alone for themselves but indeed essential for the survival of Dundalk <Col N="886" /> town, as we know it.  The position seems to be satisfactory enough for the moment in regard to the salaried employees. In the case of the salaried employees working in or having connection with the Dundalk workshops, they will continue as employees of the G.N.R. Board, until legislation changes that position.  They will, in effect, be seconded to the new undertaking, without disturbance of their superannuation or compensation rights.</P>
    <P>I am rather worried about the position of the other workers.  It seems to me that whenever this new undertaking takes over these other workers, from that date they will cease to be employees of the G.N.R. Board and will, in effect, become employees of the Dundalk Engineering Works, Limited.  That is fine as far as it goes, but, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, these employees are members of pension funds of the G.N.R. Board.</P>
    <P>As far as I understand the rules of such pension funds, they provide that once the workers leave the service of the railway, they get a refund of their contributions to the pension funds. That is no consolation whatever to the individual concerned.  What is all important to him is the safeguarding of his accrued pension rights.  It is no compensation to say to a man of 59 or 60 that he will get back whatever he has contributed to the pension fund. What he is interested in is his right to a pension at the pensionable age. It may be arranged, and probably will be, that the contributions, by agreement with the relevant employees concerned, will be handed over to the new company, which would continue to make the appropriate deductions from the pay of the men&mdash;the same deductions as would have been made for the pension fund if they had remained employees of the railway.  But is that sufficient?  I am not attempting to question the good intentions of the Government and of the new undertaking in this matter, but you are dealing with a very important matter when you interfere with the pension rights of individuals.</P>
    <P>It has been the precedent in this State to deal with such problems by <Col N="887" /> legislation and to make provision by legislation that the accrued pension rights of the individuals affected be a major charge on public transport.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will tell me that it would be the intention to continue the pension rights of the employees concerned.  The intention would be that such pensions would become a charge on the new undertaking, the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Has anybody any idea of the cost to this new undertaking of such a handover of rights?  Has anybody any idea that, if the cost is discovered, the new undertaking would look very kindly on the prospect of having this new liability put on their shoulders?</P>
    <P>This is all very unclear to the people concerned.  I would press the Parliamentary Secretary most earnestly to examine the position and see if it would be necessary to introduce some legislation to guarantee the pension rights of the people concerned, before the take-over of these employees from the G.N.R. Board.  That is just one of the problems involved.  There are others and it seems to me that new problems are being discovered as day follows day and week follows week.</P>
    <P>It would probably have been more helpful to the trade unions if an examination of the resulting problems had been made by the G.N.R. Board, once this take-over was suggested, and was put down clearly in writing, because my experience is that most people are trying to feel their way in the dark in regard to this take-over. Trade unions cannot be expected to know all the facts.  In an undertaking such as the G.N.R. with various pension funds&mdash;there is a variety of them &mdash;trade unions as such are not party to those pension funds.  The individuals as employees of the G.N.R. are; but we all know that as individual employees, we may belong to a superannuation fund and we just accept the fact and pay in and are never very clear at any stage what our rights are. Here now people are largely in the dark and it is regrettable that the difficulties which will arise from this take-over were not examined earlier by people with the necessary knowledge, <Col N="888" /> people on the G.N.R. who have the facts, and not have the trade unions attempting to grope their way in semi-darkness discovering new difficulties as day follows day.</P>
    <P>There is one last word before I conclude. It would be remiss of me to sit down without saying that I, like other representatives of the workers, wish this new undertaking every success. We think it is very important that it should succeed.  We hope that it will get the necessary work to give full employment to the people in Dundalk and, if possible, to expand the employment there.  We know that the people at the head of this undertaking have the necessary drive and we hope that they will succeed.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy seems to be under the impression that this present situation with regard to the Dundalk works arises from the fact that the Government here failed to keep the northern lines open.  The Senator knows the Government could have taken that course by guaranteeing the loss, but in any event they could not undertake the obligation for a longer period than the G.N.R. agreement would remain in force.  There is an indication from the Belfast authorities that that agreement will terminate in a year's time, so there would not be a great deal gained by undertaking the very heavy financial burden which the guaranteeing of the loss would entail.</P>
      <P>I do not think that Senator Murphy should press me very hard on the details of the rights of the workers who are to be transferred to the new undertaking. It is true that the wages staff pension fund is in deficit and I take it the Senator knows that.  The G.N.R. is the guarantor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The G.N.R. will cease to exist, perhaps, in a year's time. Therefore, a new guarantor will have to be found.  The Minister has had meetings with the workers' representatives, and I think those workers are satisfied that the Minister will do everything possible to ensure that <Col N="889" /> whatever rights they had are preserved. Senator Murphy ought to leave the position at that and allow this transfer to take place as smoothly as possible.</P>
      <P>The ownership of the works will, as has been indicated in the statement, be considered definitely when the G.N.R. agreement terminates; and, as has been indicated, it is anticipated that the transfer of full ownership will then take place.  In the meantime, it is hoped that whatever work the G.N.R. will require to have done will be carried out for them, as usual, in the Dundalk works.  After that, there is no guarantee of further railway work because it is likely that the Belfast to the Border end of the line, if it still continues in operation, will have its share of railway maintenance work carried out in the Belfast works.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which is very much in a state of flux at the present time. It would be most undesirable to go into in any great detail in relation to the matters which apparently are nearest to Senator Murphy's heart.  I want to tell him they are very near the Minister's heart also, and he can rest assured that, in so far as the can see to it, the men will be no worse off.  But he cannot&mdash;and neither can anybody else&mdash;guarantee the success of this new Dundalk Engineering Company.  Its success will largely depend on the contracts for work which they will be able to secure in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy asked why no representative of the trade unions was appointed to the board.  I do not think the Minister adverted to the representative capacity of anybody on this board.  There is nobody representing organised employers on it, and the Minister would not have that type of consideration at all present to his mind when he was selecting the members of the company.  I want to assure Senator Murphy, and to put it in the simplest words possible, that there was no offence meant, if he wanted to indicate that trade unions had been shabbily treated in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the proposal at this stage cannot be elaborated upon any further than my introductory statement.  Anything I might say in reply to Senator <Col N="890" /> Murphy's remarks would be quite superfluous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say if he would examine the desirability of having legislation to safeguard pension rights?  I accept the good faith of the Minister and of everybody else concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Senator Murphy that the Minister, on more than one occasion since this situation arose on the G.N.R. system, has expressed his concern for the effect of the change on the employment and prospects of the railway workers.  He has referred to that result of the change more than to any other consequence which the change is likely to bring about.  I do not want to stress the matter any more than that.  I can assure Senator Murphy he will attempt to do, and is determined to do everything that is humanly possible in the interests of the workers.</P>

    <Title>Destructive Insects and Pests (Consolidation) Bill, 1957. - Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure, which was originally sponsored by my predecessor, proposes to give effect to the recommendations in the Conroy Report on Reversionary Leases.  Accordingly, it repeals and re-enacts, with amendments suggested in the report, all the provisions of Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, so that the Bill when enacted will contain within its compass all that the law has to say about reversionary leases.  This, I feel sure, will commend itself to practitioners.</P>
      <P>Although the Bill is expressed in highly technical language many of its provisions are merely a re-enactment of the present law and the main changes which it proposes to make can be stated fairly simply.  But first it is necessary to indicate briefly what the present law is on these matters and how it came to be what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before 1931, when Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act came into <Col N="891" /> operation, the ground landlord was entitled, when a building lease expired, to get possession of the property, including the buildings erected by the original building lesses, in accordance with the terms of the lease.  He was then free to retain the property for his own use, to sell it or to let it at the highest rent obtainable either to the lessee or to a stranger to the title. the practice followed by the better-managed estates when one of these old leases expired was, however, to grant a reversionary or renewal lease for a long term at a rent which usually was only a fraction of the rent that could be obtained for the property. The policy of these estates was to give the new lease to the person who appeared to them to have acquired the beneficial or proprietary interest in the property, that is, either to the person who held the building lessee's interest or to a person who had &ldquo;bought&rdquo; the property by taking a long sub-lease of it at a low rent and by paying a large capital sum there and then.  Part V of the 1931 Act adopted these principles when providing that leaseholders should be given a statutory right to renewal of building leases on terms to be fixed by the court in default of agreement.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make three main changes.  Perhaps the most important of these is the recommendation that the maximum rent which may be fixed under a reversionary lease should be one-sixth of the open-market letting value instead of the present fraction of one-fourth.  The commission thought that the present fraction was too high and that no reasonable lessor could complain if it were reduced to one-sixth.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to extend the benefits of Part V to certain leaseholders who, for technical reasons, are outside its scope.  The leaseholders who will benefit from this extension are, in the main, those who hold under leases which are not building leases but merely renewals of leases which expired before the 1931 Act came into operation and which would have been building leases or proprietary leases if the 1931 Act had then been in force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> Lastly, provision is being made in the Bill for the payment of compensation to a lessee who is declared not to be entitled to a reversionary lease because his ground landlord wishes to rebuild or develop the property or because he requires it as a matter of good estate management.  It appeared to the commission that compensation for disturbance should be paid to the lessee, who would suffer financial loss even though no business was being carried on in the premises.</P>
    <P>Apart from these main changes of substance, the Bill contains a number of minor amendments to the present law with which I do not think it necessary to burden the House.  All of them have been made in pursuance of recommendations made in the report or suggestions made before and during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  Some of these suggestions are still under consideration and it may be that I shall move amendments to give effect to them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should not like to conclude these remarks on what is essentially a Committee Stage Bill without paying a tribute to the chairman and other members of the Conroy Commission for producing such a clear and comprehensive report on this difficult subject. It has lightened considerably the task of everyone connected with the preparation and examination of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has indicated, this is really a Committee Stage Bill.  Judge Conroy and his colleagues on the commission deserve the thanks and congratulations given by the Minister.  What has been done was desirable from the point of view of legal practitioners for it will embody all this type of law in one Act, when this Bill becomes an Act.  It is a measure which has had the agreement of two successive Governments.  The Minister indicated that he might have certain amendments and I think the matter might be left over to the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Report Stage in the Dáil, amendments simply poured in and it was impossible to deal with <Col N="893" /> them there and then.  Those we could deal with we did deal with and others were referred back to the draftsman for examination.  When this examination, which is taking place at present, has concluded, we will make our decision as to whether we can accept them or reject them.  I can give that assurance that they are under examination. I have no doubt I will be bringing some of the amendments, which the various Deputies brought to my attention, to the House.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1957, which I am asking the House to approve is linked up with the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956.  As Senators are aware, that Act provided for increases in pensions of State servants who had retired prior to 1st November, 1952. When the provisions of the Act came to be applied to a particular ex-superintendent of the Garda Síochána who had retired in 1951 and who was also in receipt of an Army pension, it was found that the aggregate of his dual pensions was held, under existing Pensions Orders, to a limit of two-thirds of his Garda retiring pay.  No provision was made in the 1956 Act to raise this limit to two-thirds of his notional pay on the 1st November, 1952, which would give him a pension increase in conformity with that given to other State servants.  The purpose of the present Order is to repair that omission.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
