      <P>I spoke last evening about our opposition to this Bill, the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Bill, 1979, and I would like to assure not alone the House but the general public that this Bill has not been passed by the Seanad yet.  One of the main agricultural correspondents in the <i>Irish Independent</i> stated that this and the other agricultural Bill have passed both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure them now that they have got it wrong this time.  We have opposed this Bill strenuously because of the levy system.  We do not like the levy because it is an imposition on all farmers irrespective of whether they made the effort or not.  It is wrong for legislation to impose a levy on people <Col N="1400" /> and especially farmers who made the effort to get rid of bovine TB and brucellosis in their herds.  This is wrong.  It will not encourage in the future other bodies who may be asked to do things that would better them if they feel that when they have carried out the instructions given to them by the State or by industry they will have to pay the cost of those who disregarded the advice.  That is what happened here.</P>
      <P>There will be .5p on every gallon of milk supplied for processing, that is going into bottled milk, cheese, butter and whole milk powder; £3 on every head of cattle slaughtered; and £3 on every head of cattle exported live, whether the cattle come from infected herds or not&mdash;that is my main argument.  If that levy was imposed on cattle coming from infected herds, then I would have no objection. Although I object to levies as such if those people who did not get involved in the eradication schemes up to now had to pay for the eradication of the diseases, then I would have very little objection to that.  But I object to those who put in the effort being now asked to pay for those who did not make the effort.  That is not fair on those who made the effort and it will discourage them in the future to make the effort required of them.</P>
      <P>This is taxation in another form.  It is now being foisted on the agricultural community after taxes imposed upon them all down the line.  During the last week in another forum much opposition was voiced against this Bill.  I congratulate those who did oppose the Bill, because farmers are now being taxed in every way possible at a time when the profits from agriculture are at a low level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the 2 per cent co-responsibility levy.  It is another levy being imposed on farmers and being opposed by the farming organisations, and rightly so.  Farmers' costs have increased substantially over the past 12 months. Profits from agriculture are declining fast.  To impose a levy at a time like this does not give the farming community encouragement to develop.  There is much room for development in agriculture.  If farmers were encouraged and advised, they could increase the volume of output <Col N="1401" /> by 50 per cent or more across the board. Some farmers could increase their output by 100 per cent or even more, given the proper advice and encouragement. This Bill does not give any encouragement to any type of farmer.  It probably encourages the farmer who did not get involved in the disease eradication scheme to say to himself, &ldquo;I was right and, unless I am forced to get involved in schemes such as this, I will do what I have done in the past and gain from it&rdquo;. But he has not gained from it and neither has the State gained from it.  We oppose that and we oppose the Bill for the reason I gave last night&mdash;the powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners by this Bill.  They now have access to examine records kept by the meat factories and the milk processing plants of each supplier without the supplier being present. I made this quite clear last night also.  It opens the door to the Revenue Commissioners to examine farm accounts.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have the right to knock at the door of a creamery, processing plant or meat factory and demand to see the books for examination. Nobody, not even the manager, can object to that because of this Bill.  The Revenue Commissioners have the right to examine all the accounts that the farmers have, a right that was objected to when we were on the other side of the House by Senators who are now on that side of the House.  They objected to that in a Bill introduced by Deputy Clinton when he was Minister for Agriculture and which I opposed.  Now those people will stand up and vote for the right of the Revenue Commissioners to enter those places to examine farmers' accounts. The 2 per cent co-responsibility levy also gives them that right.  The secrecy of accounts has gone.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the 0.5p on every gallon of milk supplied to the processing plants will give £5 million per annum to the State in revenue.  It is estimated that one billion gallons of milk will be supplied to the processing plants or to the bottled milk plants in 1979.  That is a reduction of £5 million that could be given to farmers to invest further.  As I have said, there is room for investment <Col N="1402" /> in agriculture.  If we prevent that development in any way then we are not doing this House or the State any good because the backbone of this country is agriculture.  It has been and always will be because of the state of our soil and the climate that we have.  It is a great country to grow grass in without any great investment being made in the production of that grass.  What we should be doing is encouraging farmers and the State to invest more in agriculture.  We have always recognised the value of agriculture.  I hope we will recognise that value in the future.  Levies are no help in that regard.</P>
    <P>The farmer is willing to pay his fair share of tax under the accounts system. I know that because I meet them regularly.  What system is fairer than the accounts system as far as paying tax is concerned?  If one makes a profit one should pay tax on that profit.  If one incurs a loss how is one expected to pay tax on that?  Levies such as this will reduce what profit may have been made by farmers over the years.  It is money taken from farmers who made an effort to develop agriculture.  It discourages them and legislation that discourages farmers from developing must be bad legislation not alone for the farming community but for the whole country because from the produce of agriculture come many jobs.  Tens of thousands of jobs in rural Ireland are created by the produce of agriculture and the more we produce the more jobs will be available.</P>
    <P>In the milk sector, where I work, farmers had to work for a pittance in the years before we joined the European Economic Community.  They struggled for a livelihood and they formed the cooperative movement to help one another in the processes of agriculture and in the developing of jobs in rural Ireland. Those farmers, by their co-operation with one another and by the help given to them by the State, developed the dairy industry to such an extent that it is accepted by all, whether they are rural or city people, that it must be encouraged to develop still further.  They are now being asked to pay 0.5p on every gallon of milk supplied to the processing plants in a year where there is no monetary increase <Col N="1403" /> for the production of milk.  Is it right to penalise people who invested millions of pounds to create a livelihood for themselves and for those who live in the areas where that investment took place?</P>
    <P>It is right to penalise the farmers and the people who did not become involved in the eradication of the diseases now mentioned, but it is not right, and it cannot be just, to penalise the farmers who became involved in the eradication schemes and who got rid of brucellosis and TB from their herds.  They also, because of their membership of farming organisations, advised those farming organisations to get the members who were not involved in the eradication schemes to become involved in them. Farming organisations must be complimented for the efforts they put into this.  Now the farming organisations are apparently opposed to the introduction of those levies.</P>
    <P>When we are passing legislation here, let us not pass legislation that will deter the development of this country.  We are passing legislation that will slow down the development of agriculture.  There are some farmers who are not interested in the development of the country, those who are in the game for the fast buck&mdash;there is a small percentage of people involved in this&mdash;who have removed the tags and so forth.  The people who will do that must pay for it.  The people who keep the laws must not be penalised for doing that.  They must be encouraged to keep the laws of the land and to develop the country.  The back bone of the country is agriculture, has always been and will always be.</P>
    <P>This side of the House oppose this Bill for the reasons I have given.  When the levies are passed by the House even though this side of the House will oppose them, I ask that the amount collected by them be kept separate from the other finances collected by the Revenue Commissioners. It should be shown clearly that those moneys collected in this way are invested in the development of agriculture, whether or not it is in the eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>Every Member of the Oireachtas <Col N="1404" /> should get an annual account showing clearly the amounts that are collected under each item here, through .5p on every gallon of milk, £3 on every head of cattle slaughtered and £3 on every head of cattle exported live.  We would also like to know the stock of cattle in the country annually.  I fear that we will have an unaccountable traffic across the Border because of this scheme.  The people who are not interested in investing in clearing animal disease are the very people who will now open the door for this traffic.  If that is the case they will not be obliged to pay the levy because there will be a way out.  Unless we have an annual census of cattle I do not think this scheme will work.</P>
    <P>This side of the House oppose this Bill.  The farmers of Ireland, represented by the farming associations, the IFA and the ICMSA oppose this Bill.  Surely some recognition must be given to that fact.  Something must be wrong with the Bill, even if the Minister does not accept my argument.  He should hold up the Bill, consult with the people involved, the farming organisations, who have now asked that they be consulted.  It is good advice, not only politically but agriculturally, because they are the people who will be carrying out the scheme. They will have influence with their members in the carrying out of the scheme and unless we consult with the people who have the influence then we are not on the right track at the beginning. Influence is a very valuable weapon, and in Ireland we should know that co-operation is also a very valuable weapon, Let us use both before we pass this Bill today.  I ask the Minister to listen to what I have said, to go back to the organisations I have mentioned and discuss with them their objections to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, I support this Bill in the hope that it will at long last help to bring to an end what I can only describe as the biggest financial scandal in the history of this State.  There has been an appalling waste of public moneys on an enormous scale in efforts, which so far have proved to be in vain, to eradicate the bovine diseases of tuberculosis and brucellosis.  Undoubtedly, as <Col N="1405" /> Senator Butler has just said, many farmers, possibly the majority, have cooperated with the programme of eradication. Undoubtedly, also, many have not. Vast sums of money have gone out in fees to veterinary surgeons and in compensation to farmers for reactor cattle&mdash;all to no national advantage whatsoever.</P>
      <P>It is time this scandal was brought to an end.  Last Autumn, in their comments on the Government's Green Paper, the National Economic and Social Council, on which the farming bodies referred to by Senator Butler are represented, had this to say under the heading of disease eradication:</P>
      <P>No reference is made in the Green Paper to bovine disease eradication. This is a surprising omission for a number of reasons.  Up to 1977, State expenditure on the schemes for the eradication of the two main diseases, brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis, totalled more than £250 million at 1977 prices.</P>
      <P>I may say in parentheses that the Minister in his opening speech mentioned, I think, £130 million.  He also went on to admit that that was lumping good money with not so good money down the years and that in terms of present day values the amounts are enormous. They are undoubtedly of the order of more than £250 million.  To continue the quotation from the NESC report:</P>
      <P>The scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis began in 1955. Yet, according to figures published by the Department of Agriculture, the incidence of this disease was worse in 1977 than it was in 1965.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned that one herd in 25 was still infected.  The NESC report went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme for the eradication of brucellosis began in 1964 but a start has yet to be made on the eradication of the disease in the 10 southern counties where, on average, 28 per cent of all herds are infected.  The enormous <Col N="1406" /> expenditure on these schemes combined with slow progress in the elimination of the disease must raise serious questions about the effectiveness of the measures taken.</P>
    <P>They regretted the absence of any discussion of policy options in this area while noting that changes in the main disease eradication schemes had recently been announced by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>No doubt, in answer to this, in the White Paper published in January last the Government had a couple of paragraphs about disease eradication. These paragraphs admitted the enormous nugatory cost of the programme to date.  They said, in rather muted terms:</P>
    <P>It has been evident for some time that the results achieved have not been commensurate with this expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government went on to make the point, which is of great concern to us all, that failure to eradicate these diseases within a reasonable time could threaten the country's substantial export trade in cattle, meat and dairy produce.  The White Paper said that the primary beneficiary from the elimination of these diseases would be the farming industry itself and for that reason the Government had decided that it was equitable the farming community should make a direct contribution to the cost of the disease eradication programme, thus heralding the present legislation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it could be described as an investment by the farming community to make now a belated and concerted effort to remove the weaknesses in the productive capacity of farming which these diseases represent and to strengthen the productive capacity of agriculture for the future.  I have no particular comment to make on whether the contribution should take the form of levies or some other form but I do think a contribution is right in principle and reasonable and will pay off in terms of direct benefit to the farming community.  From what the Minister has said I recognise that the contribution proposed in this Bill represents less than <Col N="1407" /> half the expected annual cost from now on of the programme.  That is not unreasonable. I would hope that the need to make a contribution will act as an incentive to the individual farmer to make sure that he gets value for his contribution by observing the rules himself, and that he will keep a watchful eye on his neighbours to ensure that they do the same, so that not only the farming community but the national community will at last get some value for what is an enormously expensive programme but, equally, an urgent and necessary one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We realise on this side of the House that the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis from our cattle herds is of vital importance to the future of this country.  No responsible person would deny that.  We accept that statement made by the Minister and support it in every way.  We believe it to be of vital importance that as soon as possible we reach the stage at which our herds are free of these diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to saying that we are 25 years endeavouring to eradicate bovine TB and that we have spent £130 million on it I should have thought the Minister would have made more specific comment on the reasons the scheme has been a failure to such a degree.  The case could be presented more forcefully were there specific examples given of the reasons for the comparative failure of the scheme in the opinion both of the Department's inspectors and the farming organisations.  I agree with Senator Butler that if we are to succeed it is essential we have the goodwill and co-operation of the farming community as a whole and that every effort be made to secure their co-operation.  The imposition of levies felt by a large percentage of the people to be unjust is the wrong way to go about achieving such co-operation. It is most unwise to introduce measures at this stage that will add further to the discontent of the farming organisations. The 2 per cent levy on agricultural produce introduced in the budget was so ill-considered that it resulted in farmers having a very strong case for opposing it and in some instances led to the withdrawal by the Minister for Finance <Col N="1408" /> of some of the measures introduced originally in the budget.  Therefore, the farming community were given to understand that, without protest and pressure from them, they could not hope for what could be described a 100 per cent square deal.</P>
    <P>There is the belief in the farming community that this Government are pressing unduly heavily on them.  The removal of the rates relief from farmers of £60 valuation and over, on the understanding that that £60 limit will be reduced to £50 in the near future, means that big numbers of farmers are now paying full rates.  There is the withdrawal of the lime subsidy from a vast area of the country and the introduction of the £8 fee on the 30-day test of cattle.  All these measures coming in the short period of a few months against one section of the community have led that section to believe that they are not getting a fair deal.</P>
    <P>This Bill intends to impose levies on people who have striven to keep their herds free from disease and have succeeded at great cost.  These people are now to be subject to a levy of £3 a head on cattle sold for slaughter or for export and a halfpenny a gallon on milk.  The figures issued by the farming organisations, the IFA and the ICMSA have shown clearly that a very large number of farmers are not living in a state of prosperity but are finding it very hard to make ends meet.  The imposition of the halfpenny a gallon levy on milk with the consequent reduction in the returns from the creamery and the imposition of the levy of £3 per head on cattle sold for export or slaughter will reduce the income of these people to a degree where farming will no longer be viable for them. That is bound to add to the discontent that prevails in the farming community and will result in opposition to this measure.</P>
    <P>If the measure introduced had been agreed on as a result of consultations between representatives of the Minister's Department and the farming organisations as to how best to combat this problem of disease, then we could expect co-operation.  It is not unreasonable to think that the farmers would co-operate in a scheme since they are the people <Col N="1409" /> who will suffer most from failure to stamp out bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.  This is a matter of concern to everybody in the country, but it is of greater concern to the farming community than it is to others because their livelihood depends on its success. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that we would have co-operation on a high scale with the Department in the eradication of these diseases if the measures introduced were agreed on after consultations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is going the wrong way about solving a very serious problem. Part of the reason why farmers did not co-operate in the past as fully as they should have done in some instances was the failure to obtain a market value price for reactors.  A farmer existing in difficult circumstances found that when his herd was stricken with brucellosis or tuberculosis the price he could get for a stricken animal came nowhere near the replacement price.  That left such people unable to face up to the fact that they would be in a position of being unable to replace stocks because of the inadequate price available for reactor cattle.  That left that sort of farmer less than enthusiastic about co-operating with the scheme.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill which allows information to be obtained about the ownership or control of lands where cattle are held has the support of every responsible person in the country.  Any measure taken by the Minister to enable his officials to track down people who are not co-operating or who are flouting the regulations and circumventing them in every way possible, has whole-hearted support from this side of the House.  The objectionable part of the Bill is that which insists on collecting a levy from people who will not be in a position to pay it, because they already have difficulty in surviving.  Farming prices are now levelling off and the return in real terms for the farming community this year shows a decrease.  It is unfortunate that this measure should be introduced, along with a number of others that I have referred to already, in a year when, as a result of a very severe winter, <Col N="1410" /> farmers are still paying off creameries for feeding stuffs that had to be bought to tide their stocks over the winter.  From that aspect this measure is ill-considered and shows the same lack of consideration as was displayed in the introduction of the original 2 per cent levy in the budget.  People affected by this halfpenny a gallon levy on milk and the £3 levy on cattle will be excused for asking themselves if it is just or right that they should be penalised to this degree by a Government who have already abolished wealth tax and relaxed considerably the provisions of the capital gains tax.  All this will arouse antagonism on the part of the people from whom co-operation is necessary if it is to be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Micheál Cranitch Micheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Micheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago there was a very popular recitation which concerned a gentleman by the name of Hanrahan, who in all circumstances took the most pessimistic view possible of life and the happenings all round him.  As I listened to most of the speeches from the other side of the House, that recitation came back to mind.  It is my opinion that whatever ruination comes as a result of the levies, it will be nothing comparable with the ruination that will come if bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis are not eradicated soon.</P>
      <P>The greatest danger facing agriculture here now is the incidence of those two dreadful diseases, not alone for the losses they are causing to agriculture and the further losses they will cause but also because those diseases, particularly brucellosis, have now spread to human beings.  It is causing untold anxiety to the community at large.  I know of a number of cases in my district of fathers of families, hard working farmers, who were stricken down with this disease. They had the best medical opinion and the best they can hope for is to live with it.  It is one of the new diseases and no cure, to my knowledge, has been found for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest priority for the farming community should be to set their minds once and for all towards co-operating with the Department in eradicating those <Col N="1411" /> diseases.  I commend the Minister for the way he stated the case as follows:</P>
    <P>The eradication of these diseases is possibly the most urgent problem facing the Irish livestock industry today. We have for some time now been operating on the basis of derogations from the EEC's rules on animal disease, especially as they apply to intra-Community trade in bovine animals. These derogations have afforded us some borrowed time, but this is rapidly running out.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the House should ponder on that: time is rapidly running out.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>Currently the derogations are valid only to the end of the present year and the position after that is uncertain.  As well as that, the Community has drawn up rules relating to trade in liquid milk and these are likely to foreshadow similar rules relating to trade in manufactured dairy products. If all these measures are applied in full before we have our disease levels down to acceptable EEC standards the effect on this country's export trade in cattle, beef and dairy products, could well be disastrous. When we talk about the urgency of eradicating disease, therefore, what we mean is that the future of the farming industry is at stake.</P>
    <P>I know many farmers who agree with that statement and are perfectly happy to pay levies or anything else if they get a reasonable assurance that it will be possible at this stage to eradicate those diseases.  It is only fair and right if a job is being undertaken for the special benefit of the agricultural community that the beneficiaries of such work will pay a reasonable amount to have it brought to a successful conclusion.  They are not being asked to pay the whole amount, not even three-quarters of it. They are being asked to pay something less than half of the amount of money involved. This is like a recurring decimal. Senator Whitaker has referred to the length of time that this has been in progress, scheme after scheme ending in failure because there was not complete <Col N="1412" /> dedication and resolve to eradicate the diseases on the part of all concerned. There has been a lot of double-thinking about the efforts to eradicate those two terrible diseases.  A certain amount of sympathy was expressed here and there for the tag-switchers and those disseminators of disease.  There should not be any sympathy whatever for those people.  It is a question of the survival of the cattle industry or its failure.  As was stated in the Gospel, &ldquo;the axe is laid to the root of the tree&rdquo; and now is the time for action and complete dedication.  The cost involved will be nothing compared with the losses that will result if those diseases are not eradicated soon.</P>
    <P>The Department should consider a general effort to get the public interested in this, an educational scheme.  Many people outside the farming community, and those on the periphery, do not seem to understand the problem.  Those diseases, particularly brucellosis, have spread to human beings and will pose tremendous medical problems for the future.  Everybody should be involved in this, particularly the farming community. The inconvenience of paying levies, small and all as they may be, may be a factor militating against their co-operation but that co-operation will have to be forthcoming if we are to win the battle against the diseases.  The tag-switcher and the disseminator of disease will have to be put out of action.  As in the case of the wastage of petrol and energy, which must stop, the spread of all bovine diseases must stop also and their eradication must be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add to a number of points already made in this debate.  The biggest objection I have to this measure is that it is coming after an election campaign in which, to say the least, the public were given to understand that the farmers' tax burdens, if Fianna Fáil were returned to office, would be eased.  Not only is that not so, but a number of other levies have already been introduced.  This is a fairly comprehensive Bill and every producer, whether of milk, beef or veal will have to pay the levy.  My main objection to levies of this sort is that they fail to take into account the profit margin, if any, <Col N="1413" /> there may be in any line of agricultural husbandry.  Looking back over difficult years, it has happened on a number of occasions, especially where farmers finish beef cattle, that farmers who fattened cattle did not return a profit. In those cases, this type of levy is unfair.  On section 3, I should like to ask the Minister whether in the future he will want to use this legislation to prohibit the total export of calves.  It is unfair that the same levy applies to a suck calf of two weeks' old as that which applies to an animal which is being exported and which is worth several hundred pounds.  In this way this measure will be inequitably applied to different producers.  From that point of view it is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>Senator Cranitch very rightly drew attention to the fact that everybody wants to see diseases eradicated.  Despite what people say great strides have been made and the Department have done a reasonably good job in the past.  They have got tremendous co-operation not only from the farming community but also from the veterinary surgeons and from the civil servants who work in the various counties and in district veterinary offices on this problem.  There is a tremendous team working in this area.  No matter what line of endeavour one is involved in, one invariably meets the occasional bad egg or somebody who wants to make a fast buck.  Regrettably there is a minority of not only farmers but veterinary surgeons and civil servants who will take short cuts and who are not perhaps as diligent as they should be.  No matter what one does one will always have that minority.</P>
      <P>This does not get away from the underlying unfairness in these kinds of levies.  So far as the farmers are concerned this is the year of the levies.  It must be pressing the ingenuity of the civil service to keep thinking up new levies.  Farmers will get quite a shock when they tot up their accounts at the end of the year&mdash;and most of them will be new at this&mdash;and find the total amount of levies, taxes and rates and the loss of remission they will suffer.  For that reason I am against this measure and I hope the majority of the House will also be against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> Of course, I am not against the efforts of the Government to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.  We need to have herds of disease-free status but this is not achieved very easily.  It is a matter of commonsense and sound agricultural husbandry.  I have had a disease-free herd for a number of years.  The vast majority of farmers do not want to have their herds lapse into a disease situation. It is a matter though, where one must always be vigilant especially when one is buying in cattle.  You see cases where people deliberately either switch tags or offer for sale cattle that have not been cleared.  For such offences the penalties cannot be strong enough.  The minority of people who behave in this way are motivated by greed but there may be also an element of ignorance involved. The Minister and his Department must accept that.</P>
    <P>However, we have an excellent agricultural industry where the vast majority of farmers treat their enterprises as business enterprises but they have had to cope in the last few years with new situations. The older farmers especially find the imposition of income tax on them very frightening.  Most of those people recall the experience of the thirties, in particular, when they could not meet their overheads and when they could expect a visit from the sheriff.  Farmers, who are traditionally conservative, have a fear of not being able to meet their overheads.  The imposition of all this taxation has caused tremendous apprehension in the agricultural industry.  The Government are pressing too hard with the various taxes and levies which they have introduced so rapidly.</P>
    <P>It is a valid argument to say that the farmers should contribute towards the eradication of diseases.  The value of the export of cattle to the economy is enormous. There are a lot of people engaged in agriculture-associated businesses, whether they are supplying inputs to the farms or processing the produce of farms and who share the general prosperity that is so often described as agricultural, to an extent greatly in excess of what actually goes to the landowners themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> I am very often amazed at the people who think up these levies whether they are Ministers or senior civil servants. These people in the main have a very high IQ and they know the traditions of agriculture very well.  The Government are going to put too much stress and strain on the goose that lays the golden egg.  We got off to a bad start this year agriculturally and the incomes of farmers will not be able to meet the levies that are being demanded of them. This is going to set the industry back considerably.  It puts us in a position of not being able to compete with the strong and well-financed competitors in the other eight European countries.</P>
    <P>Though we accept that we must conform to the various directives emanating from the Commission, we should have been looking more closely at the situation obtaining in Europe <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rules and regulations so that our farmers would be more on a par with the kind of systems which our competitors operate. The taxation system of farmers in the other European countries is very straightforward, a profit-on-income system.</P>
    <P>The Government are endeavouring by using so many different kinds of levies and types of operations to fool the rural community into thinking that they are paying very little.  When all the various levies are taken <i>in toto</i> the amount of money that the Government stand to gain this year on the five or six levies they have introduced will amount to a staggering figure.  My only hope is that the farming community will be able to finish the task and that permanent damage will not have been done as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure. It has been patently obvious here today, as it was yesterday, that everybody wishes to have brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis eradication schemes, but nobody wishes to pay for them.  While you have financial participation by the farming community in any scheme, you have their sincere support and co-operation in pursuit of the objective.  While you have that <Col N="1416" /> financial participation you will get their dedicated support for the complete eradication of these two diseases.  We have a precedent for this in the warble fly eradication scheme which is the complete financial responsibility of the farming community.  We have the isolated case of the Ballycroy warble which the Department are unable to eradicate down in my own county.  That is a veterinary problem.  The farmers took complete financial responsibility for the eradication of that disease.  That scheme has been successful and with the financial participation by farmers in this eradication scheme, results will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>It has been stated&mdash;and I do not want to be parrot-like&mdash;that over the past 25 years £130 million of the nation's money has been poured into disease eradication schemes introduced by a previous Minister, Mr. Paddy Smith.  I remember when the three northern counties were declared a cleared area, we had a very low incidence of disease in the west but sadly after 25 years of Government programmes for disease eradication, the incidence has not decreased.  Rather it has increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Butler said that people who have endured 25 years of harassment for the provision of catching facilities and lairages for the eradication of these diseases are now to be included in this scheme and will have to pay the same levy as the people in Leinster and in the south who have not participated over the past 25 years.  I blame the administration section of the Department for this.  The positive boundary we had in the west, the Shannon, was ideal for a complete eradication scheme in all the counties west of the Shannon, including Connacht, Clare and Donegal.  It was an ideal barrier.  In the selection of additional counties, Roscommon and Galway and such counties should have been included rather than going east of the Shannon while there was no control of input and traffic into the western region.  We had that barrier.  There were very few bridges to cross and control measures could have been introduced whereby no cattle could cross those bridges into a cleared region.  If that had <Col N="1417" /> been done we would not have to pay for a national scheme now.</P>
    <P>Disease eradication was treated by the Department as an annual chore, something that they had to do, something they had to administer.  They had no positive goal in trying to tackle the problem.  As most of us know, we are now living on borrowed time as regards the eradication of these two diseases. Fine Gael Senators are here today to contribute to this debate but I do not see any of the Labour or Independent Senators who were very much to the fore over the past two or three weeks in this House.  Whatever we may say about the Opposition, Fine Gael still have an interest in our farming community.  I compliment them on their contributions to this debate and their participation in it.</P>

      <P>Senator Cranitch mentioned the human element, the human risk.  In a neighbouring county of mine loose milk was delivered to a boarding school and on one occasion some children had to be taken from the school. When I investigated the matter I found that the herd of the person supplying milk to that school was highly infected with brucellosis.  Corrective measures were taken and the school now provides pasteurised milk but it was too late for one child who will be retarded for life. There is no cure for this disease in humans and it is very common because of the intensity of the dairy industry particularly in the dairying areas, and much more so in the south than in the west.  It is a dreadful disease and there is an educational problem which needs to be tackled.  Brucellosis is a dreadful disease and we would need to educate people through programmes on radio or television. People removed from the farming section do not realise the danger of contracting brucellosis from unpasteurised milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made yesterday of the importation of calves from the south to the west.  I have investigated this matter through the animal health advisory committee <Col N="1418" /> and the veterinary information I got is that such calves from the south are not regarded as carriers of the disease.  It is possible for weanlings to carry the disease. As they are not carriers of the disease, suck calves are not debarred from the west.  That trade from the south was criticised here yesterday.</P>
    <P>The success of the eradication programme depends on the co-operation of all involved in the business.  I am sorry that Senator Connaughton, who is a progressive manager of a livestock mart, is not here today.</P>

      <P>It has been mentioned that the element of tax and the levy on the farmer were the only things on the mind of Opposition speakers.  The scheme cannot be successful without the co-operation of the farmers; the Senators, the press and the mart managers, even though they are not here.  They are in close contact with the farming community.  The scheme is a national scheme.  There is a measure of patriotism about the success.  If we have a disease-free herd here in 1982 we will be able to export live cattle, fresh meat and serum from our AI stations to European countries.  The farming community will not object to paying a contribution to the scheme.  However, I hope the levy is a temporary measure.  The Bill does not provide for the termination of the levy at any particular time.  I would welcome the termination of the levy when the two diseases have been eradicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the 30-day movement test from islands off the Mayo coast, it is not feasible to have veterinary tests carried out prior to the movement.  Mayo County Council provided transit lairage facilities at Roonagh Point to facilitate Inishturk and Clare Islands.  Facilities for at least a four-day holding lairage should be provided to cover the testing period.  I would welcome an input of capital to provide feeding lairages and covered-in sheds where cattle from these <Col N="1419" /> islands could be held until testing is carried out by the nearest veterinary station in Westport, which is roughly 18 miles away.  Mayo County Council have provided enclosed facilities and cattle crushes.  The Minister for Agriculture has told the veterinarians that they will be given the money to eradicate the two diseases.  It behoves the technicians and the veterinarians in the Department to ensure that funds are provided for these facilities.</P>
    <P>There is some difficulty in operating the scheme on commonages.  It is impossible at present to get an inspector of the Land Commission out to apportion commonages. In a county like Mayo at least two officials should be given the job of apportioning and dividing commonages. It takes years to get a Land Commission inspector on site in my county to apportion commonages.  We get great co-operation from the liaison officer of the advisory staff but the actual apportionment for mapping purposes must be done by the Land Commission.  We feel there is a breakdown in this area.  There is communal grazing on commonages at the moment all over this country.  One reactor grazing on a commonage leads to high risk of contamination.  The quicker commonages are divided and apportioned the quicker these diseases will be eradicated.  Farmers welcome the apportionment of commonages because nowadays people are more conscious of manuring and having their own stock within their own fences.  I welcome the Bill.  The financial participation of the farmers will ensure the success of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I want to make in relation to the Bill.  The objective, the eradication of disease, has been accepted on all sides and the relevant points have been made by Senators who are more capable than I of making them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to discuss one point in relation to criticisms which have been made from the other side of the House. The whole problem of revenue and taxation generally is concerned with the redistribution of income, providing <Col N="1420" /> fair and equitable financial structures in our society.  It is a complicated matter and a very complex issue.  There is an immense amount of revenue to be raised nationally and it is raised through a maze of legislation which makes it extremely difficult for the ordinary taxpayer to identify where the money is going or to accept in any precise way how he is benefiting from the revenue which is raised either through PAYE or VAT or whatever system is applicable.</P>
    <P>This adds a great deal to the problems of obtaining acceptance of our revenue raising laws and it contributes to the problem of achieving equity and an understanding and acceptance of the wide-ranging way in which revenue is raised. Where it is possible to have a flexible element in revenue raising, that is a very good principle.  Most of the time it is not possible because the sums involved are so great that they necessarily give rise to legislation which is difficult for the individual to understand.  But there are occasions when it is possible.  Where a particular cost can be identified and a particular fund created, it is a move in the right direction to help to identify for those who are paying the charge, whatever form it takes, why the money is being raised and where it is going. While it is difficult to achieve that close identification of cost with benefit and charge, this Bill in terms of the levy proposed manages to achieve that, but it is not the first time it has been achieved, difficult though it is.</P>
    <P>Workers in industry or agriculture have for years been contributing through the NHI stamp and now through PRSI to a fund for their benefit, either through health services or through pension or redundancy funds.  There is an identifiable fund to which they contribute on a weekly basis and to which their employers also contribute.  That has operated for many years and is totally accepted and it applies in the agricultural area just as much as it applies in the industrial area.</P>
    <P>AnCO for many years have levied industrial firms to provide money for training or retraining in industry and this is a most essential service.  It is one that has produced great benefits to industry <Col N="1421" /> and to individual workers who have been trained or retrained and has provided this country with skills which have maintained employment, maintained production and growth and have redounded to the benefit of the whole community.  The charge falls on people in industry in relation to the wages they have paid the previous year.  Very often those making that contribution cannot identify members of their own firm who have directly benefited, but nevertheless they make that contribution within their group for the benefit initially of their group and ultimately for the whole country.  It is a charge which arises on the wages paid by the firm, whether or not the company made a profit or incurred a loss that year or the previous year. There are circumstances when appeals can be made, but generally that is the principle.  That is another example of where an identifiable fund exists to which people in a certain category contribute and have been doing so for many years and it has been generally accepted by all involved that it is necessary and highly beneficial.  Although nobody likes paying the charge, it is paid for the benefit of the industry, for the workers and ultimately for the community.</P>
    <P>The financial aspects of this Bill are concerned with a similar situation, the eradication of disease in a vital area in our most basic and fundamental industry. That is accepted by everybody throughout the country regardless of his point of view.  The importance of agriculture to our economy cannot be over-emphasised.  It is absolutely fundamental. The cattle trade within that industry has the same ratio of importance to agriculture as agriculture has to the whole community.  It has been accepted throughout the whole debate that success in this area is absolutely essential.  It is also right to point out that where the success of this will stand to the whole country it will initially and more immediately stand to the benefit of the farming community, in the same way that the other levies discussed stand to the benefit of those who directly contribute to them.  This is an attempt to identify a particular cost with the particular benefit.  That is difficult to achieve <Col N="1422" /> in the overall context of revenue raising but it is something which it is possible to achieve now.  It will have the additional benefit of helping in this case to produce a clear understanding of why the charge exists, why the revenue is being raised and for what purpose.  This is a situation that does not normally exist in the broad mass of revenue raising.</P>
    <P>Equity in the raising of revenue and taxation generally is of fundamental importance and the matter of the greatest concern throughout the country in urban and rural areas, regardless of what sectional interest may exist in any particular case, because the success of the country, economically and socially, in the whole area of industrial relations to a great extent depends on a general belief that there is fairness and equity in the raising of revenue.  The difficulty in having even a fair system of taxation understood arises because of the complexity of the problem.  It would be unreasonable to expect the average citizen to equip himself with the knowledge and understanding of all our taxation laws.  If we add to that a belief that the tax burden has not always been shared on a fair and equitable basis by all our income earners, then I think we get a clear understanding of how discontent and protests have arisen.</P>
    <P>Over-criticising this measure which identifies a cost with a benefit is insensitive to the whole community in the context of the worry that exist about revenue-raising and taxation generally. If the Opposition over-criticise the financial aspects of this Bill and misrepresent the effects of it financially, that would be counter-productive for the farming community. We are all in this together.  We must get broad acceptance of our revenue-raising laws and if it is possible for those who benefit directly to see where their money is going to their own benefit then that is a step in the right direction.  To overreact against that is insensitive in the present context and will be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is also summed up in a comment which Senator O'Toole made, that there is a measure of patriotism in this.  The criticism of the <Col N="1423" /> financial proposals in this Bill were quite predictable.  Because of that the Minister and the Government are acting courageously in facing up to this as they have done.  They are acting in a very honest and direct way, in a way which will be accepted by the farming community as reasonable and responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much that can be said on this situation after 25 years of debate.  Over the past 25 years, and this is a disturbing feature, we have not been successful in eliminating the diseases.  That is an appalling situation. It is important that we express our appreciation to the farmers who have cooperated effectively during the years in every effort to better their industry and who have endeavoured to meet the problems as they arose.  It is important that we express our appreciation to those people.</P>
      <P>There is another section of the farming community, the people who not alone put their own jobs at risk but who are prepared to put the jobs of the entire farming community at risk.  These saboteurs must be singled out.  The Minister has indicated here some of the problems of herd movement, tag switching, falsification of certificates and other aspects that put not alone the jobs of the farmers at risk but also put at risk employment in the associated industries, which Senator McDonald spoke about. Agriculture is our basic industry and it is important that every effort be made to eliminate the type of problems that not alone affect the farmers, the people in the associated industries but also the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are weakening our own situation abroad when we must move into competition with people who have more acceptable standards.  It is important that after 25 years of failure we face up to the problems of today.  Senator McDonald said this Bill was introduced soon after the elections.  This shows the concern of the Minister in relation to a problem that affects the nation in such a drastic way. I hope that the people who are responsible for having this situation at the emergency level it is today and who are putting the nation at risk will be sorted <Col N="1424" /> out and will get no sympathy from their neighbours or the farming community. People from the cities and the country should be united in ensuring that those who are defrauding the nation and putting it at risk are not allowed to continue to do so.</P>
    <P>A feature that has come to light in the course of the discussion is the question of doubtful co-operation because of the imposition of the levy.  If there is doubtful co-operation at this stage, then the grave problems we have will continue possibly for half a century.  After 25 years we should realise that positive and deliberate action must be taken by each and every one.  There can be no doubt that the neighbours of the people who are defrauding the nation know what is happening.  It is the duty of everyone to expose those people so that the full force of the law can be applied to them.  They are a menace to the farming industry because they are putting it at risk, just the same as the saboteurs in industry about whom I spoke yesterday are putting the other industries at risk.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister. The cost that has to be borne is small when we consider the contributions that were made in the past by every section of society.  That the prosperity of this country should continue should be the aim of every citizen.  We are not going to stand by and allow a small section of the community to interfere with the engineering industry and other industries, apart altogether from the agriculture industry.  The cost factor has been mentioned by many speakers.  I think Senator McDonald took a swipe at the civil servants when he said that they are guilty of shortcuts at times and that their ingenuity is exhausted in thinking up levies.  Perhaps the solution that his leader had in applying the 12 per cent levy is the correct solution.  Perhaps that is the solution that Senator McDonald feels is more appropriate than measures that are applied to particular aspects of agriculture.  Many people might agree with him but there are many more who would not agree that a 12 per cent levy is the solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>We know that there has to be an input into industry by indultrialists.  If you invest <Col N="1425" /> in your industry you are going to get a reward from it in the future.  That is the situation as I see it.  When these diseases are eliminated the farming community stand to gain; this can only be regarded as an investment in their own industry, but the co-operation of the industry is necessary.  I applaud all the speakers from the Opposition benches who showed their real concern for the problems of this very important industry. I hope that, when this Bill becomes an Act, this co-operation will continue and that we can expose the people who are endeavouring to sabotage the national effort.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the Bill &mdash;I speak as a city Deputy&mdash;is the question of acceptable limits within the wider EEC market.  Senator McDonald mentioned, rightly, that we are in competition with the other European countries. This makes the final solution all the more important and urgent.  Many things can be and will be said about levies.  We heard all the talk in the past about everyone wanting to pay his fair share of tax, but nobody wants to pay tax.  How you can pay your fair share of tax without paying tax is another wonder of the world.  The eradication of disease has to be paid for and it can only be regarded as an investment in the farming industry.  Co-operation is the keynote and I hope that when the time comes we shall have the same concern as has been displayed here on all sides of the House. I do not know what part I can play, or what part Deputies from the city can play, but we are really concerned&mdash;as, indeed, is the housewife&mdash;with the problems of all our industries, whether it is the agricultural industry or any other industry.  If we read in depth and in detail into the problems and suffering that have been caused by a small group of exploiters, we would realise how serious the situation is.  Having glanced briefly at the document before us, we see that there is a serious situation which must be eliminated.  The Minister is to be congratulated on his prompt action in tackling this problem at the moment so as to ensure that no further damage will be done, either to the people earning their living in the industry or, indeed, to the community as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say one or two words about this Bill, which I support, and to give every encouragement to the Minister to proceed with the policy for the eradication of bovine diseases. It is great to see a young and enthusiastic Minister behind this policy, which is what is required.  Given the obvious bad record over a quarter of a century, it is all the more important now that we have some kind of messiah who will take this on as a real, national job. The condition of the cattle in this country is as important to us as the condition of our land.  There are certain natural attributes, natural advantages which were given to this country by the good Lord; one of them is the fact that the land is capable of supporting healthy cattle and producing them in good numbers.  Other countries have other natural advantages&mdash;they have a greater stock of mineral wealth, or oil wealth, or whatever else it is.  We cannot afford to take half measures about one of the most important product lines available for our economic development, naturally given to us, so that it can support the increasing population of the country.  The question, in talking on Second Stage of this Bill is, where are the weaknesses? From listening to the debate I gather that the blame is being put on the group of people who have been abusing the system.  Senator Dowling has hammered that home, loud and clear to us.  If there are people doing this they are in the category of felons of the land; they are digging holes for future generations.  The second question is, is the process being tackled properly?  Is it being managed properly?  Is the right technology being used?  This is not my field&mdash;my field is managing things&mdash;but I wonder whether or not this process has been managed properly over the last 25 years.  The Minister must take a good, strong look at the Department and see has everything been done right.  They have done very good work, but was it always right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just returned from abroad last night and have not got with me figures I published last year.  I did a few sums comparing the numbers of veterinary surgeons here with those in other countries. <Col N="1427" /> I was trying to find a base figure and the base figure I went for was the number of cattle in each country.  It is simple logic that if you want eradication you must have a mass attack on the disease, as we had, for instance, against tuberculosis in humans, over the years.  Most of us remember those terrible years, when relatives of ours died because the cure for the disease had not yet been found. There was a mass attack on the disease; sanatoria were built; more and more doctors were specialising in it and one knew that something was happening.  I looked at the figures for the number of vets in Ireland per thousand head of cattle and I found that Ireland was the lowest in a league that included most of the European countries.  Subsequent to publishing those figures I had a letter&mdash; I cannot now remember from whom&mdash; which pointed out that things were not as bad as I was painting them and that when you categorise vets in the proper way it showed that we were higher up on the list.  That is just playing with words, playing with figures, playing with categories.  The facts are that, in terms of the quantity of cattle we have here compared with the quantity of cattle in other countries, we have less vets.</P>
    <P>If one of our greatest problems is bovine disease and we have a big problem of tackling it, it would seem eminently reasonable that we should put more manpower behind the job, even if it means putting in more manpower for a few years until we have won.  When you take into account that the qualifying conditions for entry to veterinary colleges is such that only a very small number can get in every year, it raises questions. There is a question there to be answered and I put it to the Minister that it is just one of the examples that make me a little dubious as to whether we are marshalling our resources fully.  Obviously, the Minister is well aware of this; this Bill is an indication of that.  I would suggest to him that the effort be multiplied, that the quality and condition of our cattle is as important as the quality of our land.  It is not just another product line and therefore the attack on it must be on a massive national level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their very useful contributions to this debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Whitaker stated that the levy was an investment by the farmers and it certainly is an investment.  If we do not rid ourselves now of the twin scourges of bovine TB and brucellosis, the future for Irish agriculture is very bleak indeed.  I am glad that the Senators who spoke here today are in full agreement with our efforts to get rid of this disease.</P>
      <P>Senator Connaughton, leading off the debate for the Opposition yesterday evening, asked why the people were not told in 1977 that a levy would be imposed. I would ask Senator Connaughton and his colleagues why the Coalition parties did not tell the electorate in 1973 that they were going to impose income tax on farmers, or why the Fine Gael Party did not tell the electorate in 1977 that their present leader, Deputy Garrett FitzGerald, had proposed to impose a 12 per cent levy on farmers.  When one examines that proposal one will appreciate that the levy which we are imposing in this Bill today is only chicken feed in comparison to what the present leader of Fine Gael proposed at that time.</P>
      <P>The Senators and the farmers generally realise what a serious threat TB and brucellosis are to the farming industry generally because it is not just the cattle and beef industry which would be destroyed if we found ourselves excluded from traditional markets because of TB and brucellosis.  Senator Butler spoke from his personal knowledge of the dairying industry and knows that TB and brucellosis could threaten the future of that industry also.  Due to the close links between the beef and dairying industry, if one sneezes the other catches a cold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk is regarded by many European countries as a disease risk, particularly from the human health point of view, and some of our EEC partners make no secret of their concern about products derived from milk from diseased herds.  I am sure that Senator Butler is aware of that.  While Senator Butler and other Senators are all for disease eradication <Col N="1429" /> they want to eradicate it painlessly for the farmer and without money having to be spent.</P>
    <P>The main benefits from disease eradication will go to the farming industry, just as farmers will be the main losers if we do not eradicate disease. Senator Connaughton agreed that farmers ought to in their own interests carry some of the cost and he acknowledged that £3 per animal was not a very significant sum.  That at least was honest.  Senator Connaughton was concerned about what will happen when we are rid of disease and the cost of eradication is greatly reduced.  We want to reach that stage as soon as possible, but I am afraid it is some distance away yet.  Even when the incidence of disease is down to what the EEC would regard as acceptable levels, regular testing of the national herd will have to be continued just as it is in Britain where TB has been eradicated.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler was worried about farmers who had made every effort to clear out disease and queried why they should have to pay the levy.  For them, total eradication is the only security.  As long as disease is prevalent as it is now, no herd can feel free from re-infestation or re-infection and, far from being an unwelcome cost farmers could well regard the levy as a very good investment in the future security of the farming industry.</P>
    <P>I emphasised in my introductory statement that the provisions in the Bill about the milk price differential are of an enabling nature only and I explained that there was no fixed intention as to how and when these would be used.  I need not say any more about that except that most creameries are already operating their own system of price differentials for one reason or another.  The provisions in the Bill are not new.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler was obviously misled about press reports regarding the powers given in the Bill to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners become involved only with live cattle exports, and nowhere in the Bill are there any powers for the Revenue Commissioners to enter meat factories, creameries or other premises.</P>

      <P>They are not involved in this Bill in any way except with live exports. They have no authority to go into any meat factory or anything else under this Bill.  Whatever powers they had before do not derive from this Bill.</P>
      <P>The human health aspect of disease was also mentioned.  This is certainly of the utmost importance and this point was made very forcibly in the other House.  The ultimate answer is to get rid of TB and brucellosis.  But until we can get to that stage, it is right to be concerned about the effects on people.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien wants full market value for reactors and also wants no farmer contribution to the cost of disease eradication.  The Senator wants to make the cost to the State still higher and wants all of it to be carried by the PAYE taxpayer.  That is not a realistic proposal and even the farming community would not put forward that kind of a proposal.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of the special species of warble fly they have in the Ballycroy area of County Mayo.  We are diligently pursuing that warble fly and hope we will be able to catch up with him in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Cranitch and O'Toole mentioned the importance of an educational programme.  This is a good idea and we can certainly have a look to see what is possible or appropriate.  The Minister for Health said in the Dáil that he has asked the Health Education Bureau to consider implementing a campaign on the dangers of brucellosis and this would certainly be well worthwhile considering. We have to do a lot of work in this area in educating people about the dangers of this disease.  They have been highlighted <Col N="1431" /> here today by some of the Senators who have personal knowledge of disease, particularly brucellosis and its effect on humans.  I am sure the Department of Health will co-operate in every way possible in any programme that we might initiate to educate the people about the dangers.</P>
    <P>The important factor we are concerned with here today is from the agricultural point of view.  If we consider the seriousness of this disease to our national herd, to our agricultural industry in general, no effort should be spared to get rid of it.  We are depending to a large extent on exports of cattle, meat and dairy products.  I said in my opening remarks that time is running out on us.  We have spent 25 years trying to eradicate the disease, trying to bring home to farmers, to marts, to cattle dealers and to everybody concerned with the industry the need to come to grips with those two diseases.  Unfortunately, our efforts have not borne a lot of fruit.  Let us hope that now in the new situation, where we are forced by our EEC partners to take immediate action, <Col N="1432" /> farmers and everybody else concerned will play their part in trying to eradicate those two diseases.</P>
    <P>It is not a very popular job for any Government to have to impose levies to provide the money to deal with those things.  It is absolutely essential in the national interest, in the interest of the farmers and the people involved in the agro-industry, that we eradicate, once and for all, those two diseases and that we can go before our counterparts in Europe with a clear sheet and say that our efforts have borne fruit, our farmers, vets and farming organisations have cooperated, that we have got rid, once and for all, of those two diseases.  We would then be entitled to export our cattle to any place where we could get suitable markets for them.  Our aim and ambition are to try to get rid of those two diseases. I am sure the inconvenience of a levy of this kind will be borne by the farmers, because in the long run it is in their best interests that those two diseases are eradicated.</P>

    <Title>Milk (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper on National Development the Government indicated their intention of revising the fees charged for dairy inspection services provided by the Department of Agriculture in order to meet the growing cost of such services. The Bill is to give effect to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> No new principle is involved in the Bill.  The fee at present charged for dairy inspection services was fixed by the Dairy Produce (Amendment) Act of 1941 and has not been increased since, despite the fact that the cost of the inspection services has increased very significantly in the meantime.  The current fee brings in only about £14,000 per annum in revenue against an estimated cost of the inspection service in 1979 of about £900,000.  As indicated in the White Paper the Government consider that a continuation of this situation whereby the shortfall in financing the service is met by the general taxpayer is undesirable and should be corrected.</P>
    <P>As butter is now only one of a number of dairy products manufactured in this country, the fee on butter fixed in 1941 is to be abolished and replaced by a comprehensive fee on all milk sold for manufacturing purposes.  The inspection services provided by the Department cover all dairy products manufactured for the home or export trade.  The Bill will also apply to milk sold for the liquid trade in respect of which my Department also provide an inspection service.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the fee will be payable by the first purchaser of the milk so there is no possibility of the fee being payable more than once on any particular lot of milk.  Thus for example under section 2 butter factories will not be liable.  The immediate reason is that they do not purchase milk.  But the basic reason is that the butter they blend will have been made at a creamery from milk on which the fee will have been charged. Viewed in this light butter factories will be in no different position from any dairy produce manufacturers who take in milk on which the fee has previously been charged at other premises.</P>
    <P>Likewise farmers with highest grade licences are exempt even though the Department provide an inspection service for them.  Such licensees account for only a very small fraction of the total milk processed and in any event about half their annual production is bought by pasteurisers who will pay the fee on it.</P>
    <P>Among other sections of the Bill are those providing for the keeping of <Col N="1434" /> records, section 4, recovery of fees, section 5, inspection of records by officers of the Minister, section 6, and cancellation, revocation or suspension of registrations or licences in case of refusal to pay the fee, section 7.</P>
    <P>As to the rate of fee being provided for at section 3 (1), one-tenth of a penny per gallon can only be described as a very modest imposition.  In terms of the current milk prices it represents less than 0.2 per cent of the price paid for manufacturing milk and even less for milk purchased for the liquid milk trade. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>The only objection we have to the Bill is the increase in the cost of the inspection service to almost £1 million. This represents to us additional taxation on the farming community because it is the farmers who are going to pay for it out of their milk.  In view of all the taxation proposals that have been recently put forward by the Government, one would say it is about time to stop.  All these proposals are named in the Bill we discussed this morning.  In a short period of a few weeks this amount of taxation has now been imposed on farmers without any consultation one might say with the farming organisations.  I can understand the extra cost of the inspection service because of the changes and development in that industry over the past 10 or 15 years.  Being one of the executives in the industry who got caught up in the amalgamation of a small society into a big society, and taking my position in that large society, I know the development of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also know many of the dairy produce inspectors and they are a credit to the Department of Agriculture.  They carry out their duties with respect and by that they get more co-operation in the industry.  The Department should look at the personnel they are now employing, and take into consideration what is being paid to management within the industry in comparison with the salaries paid to their own people.  It is my opinion that certain grades of managers within the industry who were paid substantially less than the Department officials, have over a period of five or six years got advances <Col N="1435" /> in pay so as to give them substantially more than the Department inspectors.  It is about time the Department looked at that aspect of the matter, because if they do not they will not get the type of personnel they have been obtaining from the universities.  There are many more outlets for those people where they can probably get more satisfaction and definitely higher salaries.  If the Department want to retain people of this standard or increase their numbers, then they must pay them, and it is time the Department or the inspectors sat down with the Minister for Finance if he is the appropriate person and discussed their salaries with him.  There is a case to be made for increased salaries.</P>
    <P>My main opposition to the Bill is the increase in the cost of up to £1 million imposed by it.  Naturally it will be the farmers who will have to pay that.  We have already heard this morning of the other levies that are being imposed on farmers.  All those levies will reduce any profit that has been made by farmers, especially those farmers who are in milk and have to work seven days a week, all through the summer and have very little time to enjoy themselves.  The increase in the price of milk now is settled.  For the future, I can see more of the type of increases in milk prices that have pertained over the past four or five years.</P>

      <P>We are not strenuously opposed to the Bill but we are not in favour of the type of levies being put on the agricultural industry which will have to be paid by the farmer.  The farmers are already burdened enough with the type of legislation that is now going through and the 2 per cent co-responsibility levy.  All of those will erode the profits farmers make from farming.  That is the only objection we have to the Bill but I appeal to the Department to look after the inspectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill at this stage is unwise because it is another addition to a long list of levies and taxation being imposed on the farming community at a time when farming prices are tapering off and when, in real terms, there is a decrease in farmers' incomes. It comes at a time when the farmer has to face increasing costs and when increased importation of New Zealand butter into Britain is likely to increase further the difficulties confronting the farming organisations and milk producers.  For that reason it is unwelcome, not so much for the amount of levy imposed under it but because of the fact that it is an addition to a whole series of levies and withdrawal of subsidies the combined effect of which will be to make farming more unprofitable. This will drive more and more people out of milk production, which would be a serious blow to the economy.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Butler and O'Brien for their contributions to the Bill.  I realise that any measure of this nature which imposes further taxation on farmers or, indeed on any other section of the community, is not welcome.  It will be appreciated by all sides of the House that this is a very small measure.  The increase asked for is very small.  Perhaps the mistake made over the years was that this has not been increased since 1941 when it was first introduced.  The fee being charged at present brings in £14,000 whereas the overall cost for the inspection to the Exchequer amounts to about £900,000.  The Government consider that a continuation of this situation whereby the shortfall in financing the service is met by the taxpayer is undesirable and should be corrected.  For that reason it is necessary to bring in this measure, which is a very small imposition on the industry for the type of service that is being provided.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental importance to the economy of our trade in meat and livestock is well recognised and so is its potential for further development.  The aim of the Bill now before this House is to provide the means by which this potential may be translated into fact.</P>
      <P>Irish beef production, both at farm and at factory level, is in a healthy state but the marketing end of the industry is less satisfactory.  The base on which we are now building dates from the establishment of Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teoranta as a limited company in 1969. Its main functions were to promote exports of cattle and sheep and meat&mdash;but it had no selling role at all.  Despite its narrow brief CBF has made a big contribution in developing exports of Irish livestock and meat.  I am convinced that more can be done, provided we give CBF a more involved role in the industry and back it up with enough funds to make its presence felt.  This is why I am proposing the winding up of CBF Teoranta, its replacement by the new, statutory, CBF, and the granting to the new body of wider powers than its predecessor enjoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main features of the Bill, therefore, are to provide CBF with a wide promotional role, to give it limited trading powers and to enable it to finance part of its operations by means of a small levy on the industry.  For this purpose the board will be restructured and outside assistance can be enlisted in an advisory capacity through a system of committees.  Essentially, therefore, what I am setting out to do is to secure further development of the meat and <Col N="1438" /> livestock trade particularly in the export area, but I am asking the industry which benefits from the board's work to make a contribution towards the cost of that work.  It is a big and prosperous industry and well able to afford it.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to say that, apart from some points of detail, the Bill received a large measure of support in the Dáil.  All parties have recognised the need for more vigorous action in this field.  I am confident that this House will also show its support for a measure designed to help everyone who is involved in the livestock and meat industry. Many of the provisions in the Bill could be regarded as standard for statutory bodies so perhaps I need only mention the distinctive features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>First of all a part of CBF's income will now come from the industry through a levy of 50p on cattle and 5p on sheep. These are smail sums compared with the present price of cattle and sheep.  This levy will on the one hand ease the burden on the Exchequer&mdash;though Exchequer support will continue&mdash;and on the other hand will ensure the active commitment of the industry to the board.</P>
    <P>CBF will also have a selling role, which its predecessor did not have. There is no question at all, however, that CBF will go into competition against existing export interests.  Their role will be confined to seeking out new markets and, at least in the begining, efforts will be limited to third country markets. CBF will also have a new role in encouraging meat consumption on the home market, a natural consequence of collecting a levy on slaughterings for the domestic trade.</P>
    <P>There will be a board of ten.  I have deliberately kept it small so that it will be able to function most effectively.  For a board of this size, it is difficult to get agreement from all the interests concerned that their representation reflects their contribution to the trade.  I have, of course, taken into account the views expressed by interests most affected by this legislation, namely, the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters Society Ltd., the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish <Col N="1439" /> Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Ltd., the Irish Livestock Exporters and Traders Association Ltd., the Irish Master Butchers Federation and CBF Teoranta.  Lengthy discussions with all of these interests took place.  All things considered I think they will agree that the proper balance has been struck between &ldquo;small&rdquo; and &ldquo;representative&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Whilst the board itself will number only ten, CBF will have freedom to draw from outside its own membership for advice in relation to its statutory functions. All the expert knowledge of the industry will, therefore, be at its disposal through a system of committees, though all decision making will, naturally, remain in the hands of the board itself.</P>
    <P>We had a constructive debate in the Dáil and I hope I can look forward to equally constructive contributions from Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have any objection to this Bill, even though we have argued against a levy system.  The levy proposed here is small and we realise that a new CBF will have to be financially sound.  The levy is a small percentage of what farmers will receive through the involvement of this new CBF.  We are also happy with the setting up of the new CBF because we realise it will be the Bord Bainne of the beef industry.  If it functions as well as Bord Bainne does we will have nothing to fear.  I am sure the new CBF will from time to time examine the development of Bord Bainne and will benefit from the knowledge it will get from that examination.  We accept that the beef industry is vital and that it can be further developed.  I am sure this board will examine the method of production within the industry itself. We have peak and valley periods in that industry and if we could get out of that situation and have a level system of production, not alone would the farmers benefit but the country as a whole would benefit from the extra financial benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will this new board be involved in the development of processing of meat in the country?  In my opinion too much beef is exported on the hoof.  It is necessary that <Col N="1440" /> some percentage be exported on the hoof but the percentage at present is much too high.  Perhaps that is occasioned by the peak and valley situation obtaining or because more finance can be obtained from exporting beef on the hoof.  We should do what is best for all our people which means processing the meat at home.  The packaging of the meat is all important.  Over the years Board Bainne have developed a packaging system in the dairy section.  I am sure that information can be made readily available to CBF.</P>
    <P>There is also the peak and valley situation to be examined.  It is important that the meat be exported when the price is at its highest level to reap the maximum value.  At home we endeavour to keep meat prices as reasonable as possible for the housewife.  When we export it should be the function of CBF to get a maximum price for our meat.  In this country there are only 6,000 to 8,000 employed in the meat industry at factory level.  In my opinion that is a very low figure and should be increased substantially in order to have more of our meat processed at home.  If we were to process as much meat as possible at home we could double or perhaps treble the number of people employed in that industry especially in rural areas.  Such employment creates development within an area, thereby creating more jobs.  We should like to see such development taking place in rural Ireland.  I am sure the new CBF board will be interested in that development also.</P>
    <P>There is very little more I can say on this Bill except to wish the new CBF all the help it should and can get from our farmers who will be represented on the board.  As the Minister said, the board will consist of the Irish Meat Exporters' Society Limited, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, the Irish Livestock Exporters' and Traders' Association and the Irish Master Butchers' Federation.</P>
    <P>I would also like to recommend to the Minister that perhaps the consumer should be represented on the board.  The consumer, especially the housewife, will hardly be represented on the board <Col N="1441" /> because the women of Ireland take little active interest in those associations.  I know that, in principle they are interested but their active interest is vital in the CBF Board.  They are the people who cook and serve the meat.  They would know better than would the menfolk how meat should be presented to the housewives, not alone of Ireland but of Europe, and would be able to render valuable advice to this new board.  I would recommend also that the Irish Countrywomen's Association be represented on the board.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Butler in welcoming the establishment of this board, to express the hope that it will be successful and do for our trade in meat and livestock what Bord Bainne have done for the dairying industry and that this new board when set up will display the same expertise and initiative as have Bord Bainne.  I regard Bord Bainne as one of the great successes amongst State boards.  I sincerely express the hope that this new CBF will attain the same high standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank both Senators for their contributions to the debate and their acceptance of the Bill as proposed.  There is an acceptance by everybody that some such board is necessary in order to promote the sale of cattle and beef, so vital to the national economy.  I have high hopes that the board now being setup will do just that and will try to resolve any of the problems affecting the sale of Irish cattle and beef in foreign markets. The board have a very useful role to play and I am happy the House has accepted that.</P>
      <P>Senator Butler mentioned the board's possible role in the processing business. They can and will be able to encourage the development of processing.  Indeed, also in the selling of such meat the CBF will play a useful role in trial shipments on behalf of any processor developing new products or seeking new markets, but their role would be confined to that operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> Representation of the Irish Country-women's Association is something the Minister will have to consider when setting up the board.  I am sure he will be inclined to afford as wide a representation as possible to the interests involved in the meat and processing business but the main role of the CBF will be on the export side.  Senator Butler also mentioned the peaks and valleys in beef production. Admittedly these constitute a big problem.  Our factories can get as many as 40,000 cattle a week and as few as 10,000.  This is the unfortunate situation obtaining in this country.  Our problem is our dependence on grass which is cheap but, of course is also highly seasonal and naturally it dictates our supply of cattle to the factories.  These are the two points that Senator Butler has made.  Again I thank Senators for their acceptance of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tourist Traffic Bill, 1979 proposes to raise the statutory limits on Bord Fáilte's accommodation expenditure from £16 million to £25 million and on non-accommodation expenditure from £4.75 million to £10 million. The increase for accommodation proposed represents a very considerable stepping up of the scope for expenditure as against previous similar measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that in the context of increased limits I intend authorising Bord Fáilte to introduce a new cash incentive scheme for new hotel bedrooms and an extension to the country at large of the existing supplementary holiday accommodation scheme which up to now has been confined to the special <Col N="1443" /> development area which embraces, roughly, the 13 westernmost counties from Donegal to Kerry.</P>
    <P>Tourism to Ireland has staged a strong recovery and we have had an increase of nearly 480,000 visitors, equivalent to 27 per cent, in the 1977 to 1978 period.  All successful tourist destinations are founded on a satisfactory range of access transport facilities and an adequate supply of accommodation. The Government's Green Paper of last year recognised that an accommodation shortfall could act as a constraint on growth.  One of the options in the Green Paper was to anticipate such a shortfall by bringing forward plans for future investment and concentrating on securing accelerated development for the 1980 season and immediately thereafter. We are now, in effect, taking up that option. Despite the problems which tourism has faced this year, I have every confidence in the future of tourism and in its ability to overcome the present temporary adversity and to continue to expand and develop.  The decision to reintroduce accommodation grants expresses that vote of confidence in practical terms.</P>
    <P>Tourist projections prepared by Bord Fáilte showed that tourist numbers would continue to rise to 2.7 million by 1981.  A very important feature of the growth is that the numbers of ethnic or Irish-related visitors from abroad are tending to stabilise so that a considerable bulk of the projected growth represents non-ethnic visitors who will make more use of commercial accommodation. In settling the type of incentive scheme which would produce the best results, I have had regard to past experience, the financial state of the industry and the level of incentive which would provide the proper stimulus.  The principles embodied aim to secure optimum increase in the accommodation stock at national and local levels and the main features are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  it is framed on a selective basis so that it will represent a correct response to our needs;</P>
    <P>(b)  it is related solely to the cost of providing additional bedrooms;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> (c)  there will be different levels of grant related roughly to estimated need with grants from 25 per cent to 35 per cent of room cost subject to fixed cash maxima;</P>
    <P>(d)  priority will be given to the extension of existing hotels over the construction of new hotels, and new hotel construction in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Shannon, Killarney and other major conurbations with a substantial tourism-business base will not qualify for grants.</P>
    <P>I have instructed Bord Fáilte to prepare a detailed scheme embodying these principles so that on passage of the measure now before the House they will be able to consider applications and undertake the financial commitments, for which new moneys can be provided.</P>
    <P>The other major change which I propose is the extension of the supplementary holiday accommodation scheme which was established in 1967 and which at present applies only to the non-urban areas within the special development area.  The scheme, as its title implies, was designed to encourage the provision of a supply of extra bedrooms through the addition of new rooms to existing private houses.  Over the past number of years farmhouse accommodation has developed into a very distinctive tourist product in its own right.  The high rates of occupancy enjoyed suggest that there is considerable scope for development of this product.  I have, therefore, authorised the countrywide extension of the scheme, a doubling of the size of the fund and a raising of grant levels from £700 to £1,000 per house in a single year subject to a maximum of £3,000 overall.  The scheme will also be used to upgrade many existing approved farmhouse, town and countryhouses in all areas of the country through the provision of extra facilities such as hot water, handbasins in bedrooms and so on.  These improvement works will enable small rural areas to be promoted more vigorously and through a longer season, especially in those areas where it will be possible to build on activities such as fishing and shooting.  The preference of the special development area will be retained by <Col N="1445" /> provisions designed for topping up grants to premises located there.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for hotels and supplementary accommodation will be introduced strictly in accordance with the main features I have outlined and will operate on that basis for some time. I will, however, see to it that all details of the schemes will be carefuly monitored to ensure that we get a satisfactory response.  Bord Fáilte will, of course continue their existing programme of ongoing capital accommodation expenditure on such items as camping-caravan sites, An Óige type developments and its accommodation improvements scheme except that in the last case and in tune with the drive to concentrate on providing extra accommodation the scheme, as is now generally known, is now being focussed on improvement and upgrading of bedrooms.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a new fund was established with a limit of £4.75 million for development works of a capital nature other than accommodation which in the opinion of Bord Fáilte would promote the development of tourist traffic.  The board's plan set out proposals for capital spending which included joint development with bodies such as the Office of Public Works, and the Forest and Wildlife Service, on conservation, recreational and educational projects as well as expenditure to encourage the improvement of facilities by those directly involved with sailing and water sports, horse riding, horsedrawn caravans, sea angling, swimming pools, recreational projects and similar activities and facilities.  Works have been undertaken in close co-operation with the regional tourism organisations, local authorities and other interested parties in this ongoing process which meets present and future needs of tourists.</P>
    <P>I attach great importance to work of this kind.  No country can rely solely on its scenery and other inherent attractions for success in tourism.  Growth will depend on continuing to attract an increasingly sophisticated ethnic tourist, and the non-ethnic visitor who expects a range of facilities which would be normal <Col N="1446" /> elsewhere.  All of the visitor products created by Bord Fáilte spending contribute to the stock of facilities available for visitors and residents alike and are a positive aid in generating new business and attracting repeat business.  Many are not directly revenue producing while others have a highly commercial content but because of seasonality and other risk factors, the long developmental period and high capital cost involved, would have developed more slowly without the incentives Bord Fáilte are enabled to give.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the present statutory limit from £4.75 million to £10 million guarantees the contribution by Bord Fáilte to the process of providing facilities of the right kind in the right place.  Bord Fáilte, the regional tourism organisations, the local authorities and other State agencies such as the OPW and Forest and Wildlife Service are all doing an excellent job of work in this area.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a major earner of foreign currency.  It contributes largely to our balance of payments.  The import content is lower than for other sectors and, since it is a labour intensive industry, the job creation potential is greater.  Most important of all its benefits are widely dispersed throughout the country so that it is an excellent aid to regional development. The proposals for tourism I have announced denote a strong vote of confidence in the future of the tourist industry as well as a clear acknowledgment of the part tourism plays in the economy of the country.  As a further statement of Government confidence another Bill is in progress to provide moneys to enable the B &amp; I to finance an additional passenger car-ferry for delivery for the 1981 season.</P>
    <P>The extra funds which we have been making available for tourism promotion over the past two years have been paying dividends and have enabled Bord Fáilte to campaign more vigorously in existing markets and also to begin to explore new market areas.  By the end of last year we had again built up to the levels of our previous highest tourism year, 1969, and were set out to share in continued tourism growth.  Tourism in Ireland has, however, experienced <Col N="1447" /> special difficulties this year indeed, some of the problems are worldwide.  The effects of the postal dispute were seriously compounded by the oil shortfall which existed for a period but it is difficult to get a sound assessment of the overall position.  The picture that emerges is that while carryings to Ireland were up earlier in the year overall expectations of carryings were down on the target for 1979.  The carriers, particularly the sea carriers, planned for substantial increases on 1978 capacity.  While these schedules have not yet been fully implemented we still have the same level of services to Ireland as we had in our record breaking year of 1978.  The review of projections for the year would be a difficult exercise particularly since the bulk of the season is yet to come and conditions are now improving.  Bord Fáilte have moreover mounted vigorous promotional efforts at home and abroad &mdash; where I have, personally, taken an active part &mdash; and these factors combined may produce the turnaround we need.  The board's present hope is that we may at best equal the 1978 performance, which was an all time record. My personal belief is that after a pause this year we will be ready to move forward again at or near growth rates previously forecast.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, vigorously tackled the petroleum oil problem in the tourist interest.  The first pressures on tourism were on the use of diesel oil used for coaches and cooking-heating in hotels.  Very early on, the Government declared tourism one of the priority areas and the difficulties with diesel largely faded for tourism.  Following the onset of the petrol difficulties Bord Fáilte and my Department were very active in seeking to ensure that the quota of fuel used by tourists, and on which part of our 1979 allocations are being based, would in fact be available for tourists. The result was the voucher scheme to ensure minimum supplies for visitors, which I believe to be unique and which operates as an assurance for visitors that their needs will be catered for in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The scheme must be seen in perspective. Tourism is an essential industry on <Col N="1448" /> which over 100,000 jobs depend, not to mention the other very tangible benefits. It is also a service industry dealing in a very perishable commodity which cannot be stored or left on a shelf until the customer is ready to collect it.  The motoring holiday has grown so enormously in popularity and is such an important means of spreading the benefits of tourism around the country that the Government were happy to make this positive response to the needs of the industry. I have also arranged with Bord Fáilte to implement a scheme to assure Northern Ireland motoring tourists a minimum supply of petrol while they are on holiday here.  I think all will agree that the steps we have taken on the petrol front to protect the tourist industry have been a great reassurance to tourists and were both necessary and worthwhile.  I hope the industrial action in the sector will soon be settled.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the general basic fuel position continues to stabilise and if everybody uses energy sensibly and sparingly there will be sufficient for all sectors of industry including, of course, the very important home holiday market.  As Deputies are aware, a major energy conservation campaign has been launched throughout the country and I am pleased to mention that Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry are complementing this through the establishment of an energy conservation committee within the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, the position is that Bord Fáilte hope that it may yet be possible to approach or match the all time record achieved last year.  Despite the temporary setbacks which we are experiencing this year and which I hope will resolve themselves fairly quickly, the underlying trend in tourism is inexorably upwards and the mood is one of confidence in the long-term growth prospects.  I hope the industry will recognise the emphatic declaration of the Government's confidence represented by this measure which involves making available an incentive scheme for new rooms for the first time in many years.  The scheme will not do the job by itself.  We have to plan and work for growth and, above all, ensure that we <Col N="1449" /> have the necessary basic infrastructural requirements.</P>
    <P>This is what we are aiming to do with this Bill, which I now commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not find any objection to the content of this legislation, although we would regard it as more appropriate if some attempt was made at this stage to try to help our ailing tourist industry.  In the course of his address the Minister said that the legislation was framed on a selective basis so that it would represent a correct response to our needs.  It would have been better had the Minister said that it was framed on a selective basis so that it would represent a correct response to our future estimated needs.  We certainly welcome the development of our hotels and the provision of more bedrooms but I do not believe that anybody who visited hotels, particularly in tourist areas in the west of Ireland, would say that this year they need any additional bedrooms.  People from there know, as do people who have visited such areas, that most of the hotels are half empty.</P>
      <P>I would also consider it more appropriate if Bord Fáilte were given money to spend this year on grants they had sanctioned for people and which people were meant to get.  I am aware that grants were sanctioned for people in respect of property developed and goods purchased but these people have not received the grants because Bord Fáilte say they have no money They have spent their grant money for 1979; whether it is being spent on grants or not I am not aware.  The truth is that if Bord Fáilte or the Minister wanted to help the tourist industry in Ireland this year, as the Minister has a duty to do, he would at least see that the board fulfil the promises they made to people in respect of grants that were sanctioned but were not paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not appropriate on the Second Reading of this Bill to discuss the full background to the major problems that created the tourist crisis this year.  The telecommunications dispute and the fuel crisis were the major contributing factors. <Col N="1450" /> I have very definite views on whether there was ministerial responsibility for these crises but this is not the correct time to go into them.  Given that the crisis occurred in both the telecommunications area and in the area of the provision of petrol to tourists and other people and given, from the point of view of this debate, that the Minister here today, or the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, had no responsibility in the matter and did not contribute themselves to the problems that we had in the past six or eight months, there was a great deal that should have been done to try to alleviate the tourist disaster which we have had in 1979.</P>
    <P>The Minister quotes Bord Fáilte as reckoning that they will at least have as good a year in 1979 as they had in 1978, which was a record year.  I dearly hope he is correct but I doubt that he will be correct in terms of revenue.  I am sure that in terms of the goodwill which is essential for us to generate among foreign visitors and particularly the non-ethnic classes of which the Minister has spoken, we certainly have generated none of that commodity.  The inactivity of this country in the past several months has caused our tourist industry irreparable damage, not just for this year in terms of revenue but for future years as well.  I believe that the very profound effect that the telecommunications dispute and the petrol crisis have had on our tourist industry will not be realised until the end of the year when the figures are added up and published.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the actions which I believe the Minister present might have taken when the telecommunications dispute occurred to try to alleviate some of the inconveniences and difficulties that were created.  I know a great number of people &mdash; hotel owners and other operators within the tourist industry &mdash; who are receiving letters daily, dated several months ago, requesting booking of accommodation in a hotel, the hire of a boat or of a car for a period in May or June.  In so far as the people who wrote these letters are concerned, mostly people on the Continent, they sent their letters last January or February and as far as they were concerned <Col N="1451" /> they received no reply and no indication as to why they did not receive a reply.  To those people it must appear that the Irish are disinterested and grossly inefficient.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether any specific attempts were made by Bord Fáilte or by the Department to inform people through the public press and the media generally on the Continent so that people would understand there was a telecommunications dispute in Ireland and to advise them not to write letters but to use some other means of communication. I say the Continent particularly because I am aware that action was taken in the United Kingdom.  That action was very necessary after a now infamous television programme which portrayed some of the problems that existed in Ireland in so far as tourists were concerned.  I know, as the Minister knows, that in the past few years there has been a tremendous growth in the number of continental people&mdash; Germans, Dutch, French and Italians &mdash; who come to Ireland during the summer to enjoy the facilities which we provide for them.  Was there any real attempt made to inform potential visitors from the continental countries of the difficulties we had here?  I do not believe there was.</P>
    <P>I know of a number of tourists who had been in Ireland earlier this year and had written to hotel proprietors with whom they stayed on other occasions but from whom they received no reply. Since the postal dispute ended tourist operators in Ireland contacted those people to explain the situation and the response from potential visitors was one of complete surprise and amazement that there had been a postal dispute and that it could have lasted for so long.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the proprietors of hotels and guesthouses in the west who suffered not only from the postal dispute in so far as letters were concerned but also from the absence of any telephone service during what were crucial months for them.  Their losses will be vast.  Even now hotels in the west are only half full and hotel managers will tell you that it is not just because of the petrol situation but because their normal <Col N="1452" /> flow of visitors were not able to contact them they made alternative arrangements. I hope that Bord Fáilte, and particularly the Minister, will do whatever is appropriate to help those hotels and guesthouses to recoup some of the vast revenue losses they have suffered in 1979.</P>
    <P>The other great difficulty for tourists in 1979 was the energy crisis.  I should like to ask the Minister some questions about the voucher system which was introduced. I know tourists who had vouchers but who could not get petrol because petrol stations were closed.  Is there any obligation on the owners of petrol stations to open if a tourist with a voucher asks for petrol?  I should like to know why, when Bord Fáilte run a massive campaign in Ireland every year asking our own people to discover Ireland, these home tourists are not regarded as tourists for the purposes of the energy crisis or as people for whom it is appropriate to go on a motoring holiday? Why is it that people from Tipperary who go to Kerry or Connemara cannot get petrol?  Are they not as valuable to the hotels and restaurants and the commerce of the tourism industry in the west as is the foreign tourist?  What arrangements have been made with regard to the distribution of petrol vouchers to those people who have come to Ireland <i>via</i> ferry from the United Kingdom to the North of Ireland?  Where have these people been able to get petrol vouchers?</P>
    <P>I understand from one person who came across on that ferry last week that, before they arrived in the North, passengers were advised over the public address system that tourists in the Republic of Ireland would be able to obtain petrol vouchers in a number of towns.  Two or three were mentioned but they were mentioned so quickly that even this man to whom I spoke, who is an Irishman and who is familiar with most of the towns in Ireland, did not catch them. There were tourists from the United Kingdom coming to visit Ireland in their cars on that ferry, and they had to inquire from him as to where these towns were.  He thought one was Mullingar and he mentioned it to these people, who told him they were not going anywhere near <Col N="1453" /> Mullingar and asked what were they to do for vouchers to keep themselves in petrol while they visited Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been amazed at the difficulty in getting petrol along the west coast of Ireland.  A quota system is meant to operate so far as the distribution of supplies to petrol stations are concerned. One would imagine that, with the great tourist season we had last year, petrol stations all along the western coast, indeed in any good tourist area, would have had a very big turnover figure from 1978 and would, therefore, have received a very substantial quota to meet the demand that exists this year.  I know from my own experience, not as a tourist but just as an ordinary citizen who goes down to west Cork, or Kerry, it is extremely difficult to get petrol there because the petrol stations are not open.</P>
    <P>On the general fuel situation apart from petrol, the Minister made reference to tourism being regarded as a priority so far as the distribution of fuel for hotels was concerned.  I had occasion in the House last night to raise a matter on the Adjournment about the conditions on Lough Derg so far as people who hired cruisers were concerned.  I can tell the Minister &mdash; perhaps he is already aware of it; but if he is not, I should like to inform him &mdash; that at present it is impossibe for people who hire cruise boats to get diesel from anyone other than the person who hires the boat to them.  This has greatly restricted the scope of travel these visitors &mdash; and most of them are continental visitors&mdash;are able to enjoy.</P>
    <P>A very ironic thing has occurred which is appropriate to this Bill.  It is a bit repetitive of an issue I raised here last night.  The Electricity Supply Board had cause at the end of June to reduce the water level in Lough Derg by about five feet, one of the consequences of which is the fact that very many harbours all around Lough Derg are no longer navigable.  It is quite impossible for any boat that leaves Killaloe to pull in anywhere along Lough Derg.  They must travel up to Portumna, which is quite some distance.  It is a four hour trip from Killaloe to Portumna.  When you arrive in Portumna you are told you cannot <Col N="1454" /> have diesel for your boat.  If a tourist asks where he will get diesel, he is told to go back to where he came from and he will get his diesel.  The trouble is that you cannot pull in anywhere on the way back, so you have to go back to Killaloe to the person from whom you got the boat.</P>
    <P>I know a number of tourists who are complaining bitterly that all they can do is bring their cruiser up and down Lough Derg without pulling up anywhere.  You get enough diesel at the start to go to Portumna, where they will send you back to get more diesel to go further. You return to Killaloe and, if you want to go further, you can go back to Portumna and repeat the exercise.  This sort of stupidity in a major growth industry is a classic example of the ineptitude of the managers of the tourism business in Ireland this year.</P>
    <P>I complained here last night that the Electricity Supply Board, before they pulled out the stopper in Lough Derg and reduced the level of the water by five feet and caused such a massive loss of revenue to traders around Lough Derg, could at least have advised people beforehand of what was happening.  The Minister responsible for the Office of Public Works told me here last night that they did, and produced the advertisement in the press that advised the people of this.  The advertisement in the press was published after they had pulled the stopper, and left boats worth £40,000 in one particular harbour in County Clare sitting on dry land.  The water was gone before the operator of those boats knew it was going.  He is stuck with two new boats worth £40,000 embedded on a sandbank in his own harbour into which he put £100,000 last winter and which is unusable now. Those boats are costing him £500 per week loss of hire at the moment, while they lie there on that sandbank.  The ESB did not tell that man about it before they pulled out the stopper in Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge no marina on Lough Derg at the moment is navigable. The consequence of that is simple.  It means that boats cannot pull into the side to take on their passengers.  All that <Col N="1455" /> can be done is that the boats line up six to 12 abreast along the edge of the lake, and tourists climb from one to the other with their bag and baggage until they get to the one which is theirs.  An alternative system adopted is that they are moored away out in the middle of the navigation channel on the lake and the tourists are ferried out in dinghies.  I know of one unfortunate German who broke his arm in an attempt to get from his dinghy to his boat.  In fairness to them, most of the continental hirers regard it all as rather quaint.  They think it is a nice touch of additional adventure to their holiday. There are some who are very annoyed, and who wonder whether they are being badly hoodwinked.  They now know of the telecommunications dispute.  They know of the energy crisis.  They did not know there was a water crisis in Ireland. They find it very odd to have been invited to a country where they were asked to visit the beautiful hamlets around Lough Derg, and enjoy the cuisine in Dromineer, and the nice country public houses in Terryglass and Kilgarvan, and in the other little harbours around Lough Derg.  They come and find they cannot visit those places because they cannot get into them.  They discover that when you go as far as you can and pull up, namely, Portumna, you have to go back to get fuel to go further.</P>
    <P>It is an indictment of the managers of our tourist industry that, in a year when we had so many problems, no effort was made by the ESB in this instance &mdash; or by Bord Fáilte who should have been informed by the ESB that this was going to happen so that they might at least explain to our tourists what the problem was &mdash; to explain those problems to tourists.  To give some idea of the market denied to traders on Lough Derg, and to give some idea of the number of people who are being inconvenienced, in 1978, 22,000 people enjoyed a cruise on the Shannon, of whom 20,000 people were foreigners.  What will those people think of this country?  What attempt was made to tell them of our difficulty?</P>
    <P>I know of boat hire operators who are trying to explain to them that it is not their fault, that normally there is water <Col N="1456" /> in the lake but, on this occasion, because of a national crisis, or because of an industrial dispute at Poolbeg generating station, or because of a blunder made by the ESB when they tried to lower the level of the water too quickly, these problems have arisen.  The visitors cannot understand why they were not informed in some official way.  There are only about a dozen points on the lake from which these boats operate.  If the ESB had taken the one little exercise in public relations of putting an official notice up beside the jetties or marinas to which these people go, the situation could have been explained to them, but it was not.  It is like the bungling that occurred in relation to the voucher system so far as foreign tourists are concerned, and particularly tourists who come in via the North of Ireland, and the bungling that went on over the telecommunications dispute.  There was a patent lack of any effort to explain to our visitors what the problems were.</P>
    <P>I hope we will recover from the mess we are in.  I am sure this country has in its own resources sufficient attraction to help overcome it.  Regardless of the optimism in the Minister's speech, I can tell this House that the loss to this country has been very substantial.  If you do not believe me, go and visit those people who are relying on the tourist industry to make money, and are in a position to observe the level of operation of our tourist industry in Ireland this year, and they will tell you very quickly what it is like.  Go and look in the towns of west Cork, Kerry and Connemara and judge from your own experience what the level of business is like.  It is at an all-time low. That is the reality of this situation and it is a reality of which we should be ashamed to speak but of which we must speak.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister whether Bord Fáilte are presently starved of funds, not for next year or for hotel bedrooms for next year or 1981 but at present.  I am aware that people who had purchased goods in respect of which they received grant sanction from Bord Fáilte have not received the money because Bord Fáilte say they have not got the money.  I want to know whether Bord Fáilte are being starved at a time <Col N="1457" /> when money needs to be poured into them on a massive scale to try to draw some additional tourist business for this country in the late summer and autumn of this year.  If that extra effort is not made now, and time is running out, 1979 will prove to be an utter disaster for this country.</P>

I said that some sympathy was due to the Minister because he has been the butt of attack from all sides.  In view of that I welcome the optimistic note in his speech.  Some Senators may be aware of different situations in different parts of the country.  I have been around the country and the parts of it in which I have been are not that badly off.  In other words, it is not a total mess.  I will not go into geographical details.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the cause of the difficulties because the matter merits a few words.  I am glad that the Minister, at the end of his speech, touched on the matter of the consequences of the fuel situation and of the postal strike.  Bord Fáilte should assess the job losses consequent on hotels not being available by telephone for bookings.  Those involved in the strike should have brought home to them the responsibility for the job losses.</P>

      <P>Both Government and Opposition agree with the need to provide employment.  God knows how many young people there are this summer who have not even got the temporary work that they would have looked forward to in various parts of the country in hotels which have not got bookings.  The consequences to the economy and to the people of trade disputes, particularly trade disputes in the public service, in our public monopolies, should be brought home to all of those involved in the industrial relations malaise from which we have been suffering. Even in this city at present I shudder to think of the feelings of visitors to Dublin who see the piles of refuse bags outside houses, not to mention other refuse spilled out in some areas in the city.  We are going to suffer from the postal dispute for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>The petrol problem is a difficult one in the sense that it is partly industrial and partly due to the energy crisis.  Senator Molony gave one side of the picture but I think there is good and bad among the petrol distributors.  I have been right across Ireland and I have seen places where some distributors have advertised their opening times.  They have at least conveyed that bit of information to the unfortunate motoring public and to the visitors.</P>

      <P>I do not object to Senator Molony's interventions.  He has a point when he says that, if you are travelling from one part of Ireland to another, even to go on holidays, you need to be able to get petrol.  If Senator <Col N="1459" /> Molony is travelling in the south of Ireland I will let him know a few garages that are doing their job.  If he is there at the right time in the morning he will get his ration of petrol.  But I would ask the Minister, either through his own office or through Bord Fáilte, to try to get a bit more discpiline and efficiency into the petrol distribution business.  I know it is a private enterprise area and because it is a private enterprise area it should be more efficient.  There is a lot of room for improvement.  I understand that the settlement of the industrial dispute will lead to a much improved situation.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte should be complimented for introducing the voucher scheme, rather than closing their eyes to the issue. I would ask the Minister to find out for us exactly what is going on in that area.  Is the scheme working?  Are there any grounds for believing that the overall solution to this problem is rationing?  If not rationing, what is the solution?  I think it should be possible to work out some solution.  Whether every petrol station will agree to open for an hour every day or for two hours every day, let us have something uniform so that at least, apart from our own difficulties as individuals, our visitors may have an idea of where they stand in both North and South.</P>
      <P>I think I have said enough by way of criticism in that area to keep the Minister busy.  I welcome the Minister's speech and the Bill.  I welcome the note of optimism.  I congratulate Bord Fáilte and I congratulate the Minister on his approach to the effort of solving the problems and improving our tourist situation despite the handicaps we have seen over the past six months.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what form of inspection system is being employed at present in relation to hotels and restaurants.  Most of our hotels are reasonably efficient, though there are the odd cases of toilets left dirty and so on. Unfortunately these are the cases we hear about; we do not hear about those who are doing their job.  Perhaps the Minister might have a talk with Bord Fáilte about the inspection system and how it is working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> I would like also to compliment particularly the Forest and Wildlife Service. They are doing an excellent job.  It is something we can boast of without the fear that we might be let down.  There are notices throughout the country about forest walks and people are beginning to avail of the service.  I would like to compliment the regional bodies on their efforts, particularly the directors of all the voluntary bodies who attend meetings regularly and try to do a worthwhile job.</P>
    <P>Without going into it too deeply, I would like the Minister to take up with Bord Fáilte the question of meal prices.  I have noticed a big difference in meal prices in hotels and restaurants in different places.  I do not want to pinpoint any particular area but it is something of which we should be conscious.  Over the last 18 months I have regularly been in different European cities, towns and country places, and in some areas in Ireland prices are not far behind prices in Europe.  Perhaps the Minister would look into this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony has been very critical of the ESB and, I think, justifiably so.  I am critical of another State service, namely CIE.  I boarded a train early this week well over 100 miles from Dublin at eight o'clock in the morning.  My first criticism is that the carriage was very old.  This might be justifiable in the sense that I understand CIE are looking for capital from the Minister to replace stock.  Perhaps the early hour of the morning would justify the use of the older rolling stock.  What could not be justified was the condition of that carriage. This was in July, in the middle of the tourist season.  There were beer bottles rolling from under the seats.  The windows were filthy.  It looked as if the carriage had not been washed for a month.  It is reasonable for any public representative to criticise those matters where a company have a very large number of employees.  There must be a serious defect somewhere.  It would not be fair to describe the location, but there might be more trains in that condition and I am letting CIE know.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for me to say that workers did not do their job; it goes <Col N="1461" /> deeper than that.  If a train in that condition leaves a station in a remote part of Ireland at eight o'clock in the morning to cross the country to Dublin, somebody in a supervisory area is responsible, apart from the people who have to do the cleaning.  It is a management responsibility. Good management makes for good workers, and responsibility starts at management level.  One could go too far, perhaps, in criticising public companies, but we need to see greater attention to management responsibility in public service organisations such as CIE.  That particular example is a frightening one in the sense that at many stations on the way to Dublin I saw tourists boarding that train.  I am not asking the Minister to take up the matter because I have taken it up here.  I hope that kind of inefficiency will be dealt with by CIE right away.</P>
    <P>There are major problems in connection with the energy campaign we need and how to dovetail an efficient tourist service with it.  There is a lot to be done there.  I would urge the Minister to get his staff, Bord Fáilte and CIE working in that area because it is of tremendous importance, particularly in regard to the young people who can get occasional employment in the tourist area during the summer when they are possibly idle.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister again for his efforts in connection with tourism, and I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBlennerhasset" hpid="Mr. Blennerhassett Mr. Blennerhassett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blennerhassett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, as I would welcome any Bill that provides more money.  This money was never more needed than at present.  The sum of £9 million is to be made available to Bord Fáilte to provide more rooms in hotels, and £5.24 million is to be used for other non-accommodation items.  I wonder how that £14.25 million is to be made available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome any money to expand our hotels because the tourist industry is a major one which employs many people. There are more than 100,000 people employed for quite a few months of every year.  I wonder if money would be made available through Bord Fáilte to the existing hotels who are in dire trouble. <Col N="1462" /> In my county there are many hotels, both big and small, which are half empty at the present time.  It would be far more important if Bord Fáilte could make money available to the hoteliers who are in dire trouble and who in the last few years have extended their premises and who are now paying very high rates.  If the Minister could instruct Bord Fáilte to help those hotels by paying something to them towards their rates or if the Government would remove VAT from all meals and accommodation in hotels it would help the industry and the owners of the hotels.</P>
    <P>There are some reasons for the hotels being empty.  One was the postal strike earlier on which lasted a very long time and hoteliers did not receive any communication from people who wanted to come into Ireland.  There is also the petrol problem at the moment.  When a tourist arrives in Tralee town he is informed that he has to travel 21 miles to get petrol vouchers but he may not have enough petrol to arrive in Killarney.  It is outrageous that something like this should happen because some of our garages open only two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening.  I have seen garages accommodating tourists without any vouchers whatsoever and I pay tribute to them.  However, many garages cater only for the local customers and this is particularly true of villages where the petrol supply is always taken up by the local people.</P>
    <P>In the past few years we have built up a huge tourist industry in Ireland.  For a few years before that we had a falling-off owing to the troubled times in the North of Ireland, but I am very happy to say that now we can see people from the North of Ireland and Great Britain coming again to our country and we welcome them.  However, I wonder if some of our hotels are killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  I say from my experience that some of them are charging very high prices, far too high for the average Irish family who would like their two weeks' holiday every year or for the ordinary working-class people of England who come here every year on holidays.  Many of them are of Irish descent and they come here regularly. Those people have a limited amount of <Col N="1463" /> cash and find themselves paying a large sum in hotels for bed and breakfast.  The Minister should look into this because it is happening in many instances.</P>
    <P>We have a great industry in the farm guesthouses.  I am happy to say the people concerned are doing a marvellous job and provide very good food at reasonable prices.  It is important that those people should be commended on the work they have done.  We also have caravan parks throughout our country and people who provide this amenity should be entitled to a much bigger grant.  In the past many of them were refused grants.  Many young married people with young families do not like to go to hotels or even to guesthouses and they come from all parts of Ireland to Kerry to stay in caravans.  It is important that we have properly laid-out caravan sites and that the money is made available.</P>
    <P>With regard to CIE, I have noted that a train leaving Tralee town at 8 o'clock in the morning had the seats completely removed from the carriage; just the frame was left and there were beer bottles rolling around underneath the seats. This has happened in the last three weeks.  Prior to this the train serving Tralee had the new type coaches but I do not know what happened to them.  I know of travellers who used the train yesterday; they went to the dining car to get tea and sandwiches and when they went back to their seats they found there was no place to put the food other than on the floor.  On the 8 o'clock train leaving Tralee at the moment there are very few carriages with tables.  Frequently tea is spilled on the floor and that is not pleasant.  I should like the Minister and his Department to instruct CIE to provide a proper train service because many tourists travel by train.</P>
    <P>Many hotels are facing serious problems.  Because it is getting late in the season, I ask the Minister to see if hoteliers would reduce their prices.  Why not reduce prices and have our hotels full? If they charge full price the hotels will remain half empty.  I wonder what amount of this £9 million will reach the hoteliers in 1979.  Will we have to wait until 1980 to see the result of this?</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Much of what the Minister is doing in this Bill is developing Irish tourism into the 1980s.  It may be a little too late to help the situation for this year, as Senator Molony asked the Minister to do.</P>
      <P>The tourist industry, which is very much a labour-intensive industry, is capable of employing 100,000 people. Our tourist industry has never been fully explored; there is great potential there. We should look ahead to the 1980s and develop a comprehensive plan for tourism over the next few years not only to attract more foreigners to our country, but to encourage more and more Irish people to stay at home for their holidays.  Bord Fáilte currently operate a very extensive programme called the &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; programme to encourage Irish people to discover other parts of Ireland.  Too few of our hotels and other general services needed to make a holiday enjoyable are involved in this operation.  How many hotels in Ireland, for example, provide the facilities that families, particularly young families, require to have a happy holiday?  Very few of our hotels have any baby-sitting facilities for young couples, many of whom wish to go out in the evenings but have nowhere to leave their children and nobody to look after them.</P>
      <P>In very many of our hotels the standard of accommodation is very poor and the prices are very high; it is cheaper for a family to go to Spain, Portugal, or wherever, than to stay at home in Ireland, which is a pity.  Perhaps it may be necessary, not only to encourage hoteliers to keep their prices down and to operate fixed price control here, but, in some instances, to subsidise holidays at home, for Irish people, in order that more and more of them, particularly from Dublin, can see parts of Kerry, Cork and the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People refer to the treatment often given to foreigners by Irish hotel staff and by people involved in Irish tourism. By and large, people in our hotels are kind and courteous and the hospitality that foreigners talk about is very much <Col N="1465" /> in evidence.  However, it has come to my notice in recent weeks that some of our hoteliers are only too willing to exploit the foreigner.  Maybe it is because he does not understand the language; maybe it is because he does not know the country too well.  The other evening, I had a drink with some American friends of mine who had spent the past two weeks touring the west of Ireland. They told me that in one hotel in the west of Ireland they were charged 20p for a glass of water.  It was an absolute disgrace that somebody would do that to people who obviously would not know if that was the general practice.  Instances like this, although rare, harm the image of the country and do not help the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is doubling the funds being made available for the farmhouse holiday project.  This is something unique to Ireland and which many foreigners enjoy.  They like to spend a week on a farm; they like to have their children involved in the farm. Many Irish farmers love to have foreign tourists on their farms, in their farmhouses and helping them and looking over their farms.  This is something we should consider more seriously and I am delighted that the Minister has doubled the funds available for this project.</P>
    <P>Very many Irish people thinking of going on holidays ask a tour operator for a brochure, and always a brochure for foreign holidays.  The time has come to encourage more and more Irish people by advertisements in the national press and on radio and television, by incentives like giving Irish tourists petrol vouchers for touring the country.  It is very difficult for people from Dublin, or any other part of the country, to get petrol in certain parts of Ireland at the moment.  It would be a great help if Irish tourists were to be given vouchers so that they, too, could get petrol here.</P>
    <P>Very many of the regional boards and the people involved in regional tourism co-operate with local authorities in providing the facilities that can make holidays more enjoyable both for our own people and for foreigners.  Dublin <Col N="1466" /> County Council, in conjunction with Dublin tourism, have recently opened up Malahide Castle and the surrounding land so that tourists can look over the castle, the paintings and so on, enjoy a cup of coffee and stroll around the parklands.  This sort of co-operation can do nothing but improve the whole tourism industry.  We are seen to be going out of our way to provide the facilities that up to now we have not provided for the tourist.</P>
    <P>In certain parts of the country it is very difficult, particularly for young people, to find something to do in the evenings. There is plenty in the line of going to pubs to drink; there are a lot of things to do during the day in the form of going out for tours around the different scenic routes but when it comes to entertaining, providing, for example, Irish traditional music, this is not available in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say that he will be making more funds available to An Oige to improve the standard of our hostels and develop them.  These hostels are particularly attractive to young people who like to go around from one place to another but cannot afford an expensive holiday.  It is nice to know that there is a properly developed hostel where they will be looked after.  I am also pleased that the Minister mentioned the development of caravan and camping sites.  Here again in the past we were very slow in providing attractive sites for the tourist, in the line of proper sewerage and water facilities.  These are new areas which we could examine and explore and which would go a long way towards improving the standards of our tourist industry, and attracting more people, particularly more Irish people whose custom we badly need.  If the caravan and camp sites were made more expensive and more attractive, and if tourists were guaranteed variety, in the form of entertainment, tours and so on, many more of our people would be willing to stay at home. That is something we should encourage by heavily promoting our own tourist industry in our own country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome any Bill which will provide funds for the much <Col N="1467" /> harassed tourist industry.  I do not wish to indulge in reiterating individual complaints about the tourist industry, in general, because other Senators have covered the points, which, I think, will be taken by the Minister.  I am tempted to think that, perhaps, this Bill has been prompted by the collapse in morale through the Irish tourist industry at present. Its contents may well have been brought forward for implementation to an earlier stage than was originally envisaged. I am tempted to believe this, because only about a year ago we were entertained here to a question and answer session by the top management of Bord Fáilte.  I remember asking, at that session, was it felt that the bed capacity rate in this country at that time was sufficient to meet future needs, that it took a certain amount of planning, say two or three years, to get bedrooms off the drawing board and into actual use.  I was assured that it was felt within the tourist industry and within the accommodation industry itself, that the needs could well be met.  Now we see a Bill coming forward which is to provide funds for additional bedroom accommodation. I am tempted to believe that the Bill and its contents have been brought forward due to the collapse of the tourist industry in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his selectiveness in the Bill as regards what bedroom accommodation will be granted financial assistance.  I see that certain hotels, particularly the larger ones, will not be included in the scheme to the extent that they might perhaps wish themselves.  The word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; has been mentioned in the Minister's speech, perhaps six or seven times.  It reminds me of the person who is always speaking of the future and perhaps not doing as much as could be done to make sure that that confidence is met.  Certain blame for this must lie with the tourist industry itself, with the hoteliers, guesthousekeepers, restaurant owners and so on.  We all seem to think that the future of Irish tourism is assured and that it will meet all our wishes, but we never seem to put enough effort and investment into the tourist business to make sure that our confidence is <Col N="1468" /> justified.  Year after year we look forward with great confidence to the future of the tourist business.  Unless we do something at each stage that confidence may not be justified.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill for the future, but it would be remiss of us not to comment on the present, as regards the tourist industry. The provision in the Bill for extra room accommodation and the improvement in recreational and educational facilities will take time to achieve.  It could be anything up to two years before their effects are felt.  In relation to the financial assistance to be given under this Bill when we consider how slow the local authorities work, and they will do a lot of this work, it could well take longer than two years before we feel the effects of these provisions.  The Minister should stress, through the Minister for the Environment, to all local authorities entrusted with moneys to carry out certain public amenity work that these jobs should not take three or four years to be completed when they could well be completed in one year.  There is something radically wrong at local authority level when jobs of this nature which can benefit the tourist industry, never mind the local community, are put off from year to year before they are brought to completion.  This happens, unfortunately, in far too many local authority areas.</P>
    <P>I compliment Bord Fáilte for the excellent literature they brought out at the beginning of this year, for the colour and variety of their brochures.  It is very sad that the great effort that they put into the illustration and presentation of what we have to offer here has not met with the results desired.  My sympathy goes to hoteliers, guesthouse owners and workers in the tourist business who have suffered immeasurably because of the crisis in the business this year.  The problems have not been of their making. The Bord Fáilte report for 1978 makes sad reading.  In speaking about 1978, which was an excellent year, the report states:</P>
    <P>...this optimism undoubtedly received early-season set-backs from industrial disputes at home and abroad.  The telecommunications difficulties, the Aer Lingus strike, the <Col N="1469" /> Sealink stoppage, and the difficulties caused by the Air Traffic Controllers' go-slow all were potentially damaging to the Irish tourism effort.</P>
    <P>It was fortunate that the major problems were resolved before substantial losses and bookings or goodwill were sustained,</P>
    <P>We cannot say that we were not given in advance a picture of what could happen as a result of any industrial disputes.  My sympathy goes to the people actually involved in working in the tourist business, because of what they have suffered through no fault of theirs.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunately a salvaging operation we must now consider at this stage of 1979.  I do not agree that it is too late now to do anything.  We can look at this problem even mid-way through the summer to see what can be done, and perhaps something can be contemplated. The visit of a few foreign VIPs to Ireland did more to sell this country on their native soils when their medias presented their trips to Ireland.  In the promotion of Irish holidays for the rest of 1979 a visit by a few of these personalities during the next month could, due to the resultant publicity, help to recoup a lot of the money lost to date.</P>
    <P>The gulf that now lies between the £ sterling and the punt is such that any holiday in Ireland is a wonderful bargain to UK holidaymakers.  I do not know to what extent we have tried to hammer home to them that a holiday in Ireland now is the best value they are likely to get when compared with the cost of a holiday in any other part of the Continent.</P>
    <P>In relation to home holidays over 50 per cent of overnight accommodation was filled by Irish people.  I do not know how that compares with other countries but for the remainder of 1979 we should make a special promotional effort to urge Irish people to spend even part of their 1979 holiday allocation at home, to give up their holidays abroad or even to spend long weekends on holiday within our shores.  The Irish people were not found wanting in that respect when they were appealed to before.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> When we speak of the tourist industry we must always remember that we operate within certain dimensions and that these dimensions are largely dictated by what happens abroad and by what happens politically and economically within our shores.  The national situation at a particular time can show how brittle the whole tourist industry can be.  Only in recent weeks a few bombs going off in Spain threw everything into horrible confusion there in relation to what it could mean for the rest of the holiday season.  We have had this situation for the past ten years and I compliment Bord Fáilte for coping wonderfully.  They have been hit now by industrial disputes which are not of their making and there is little they can do about them.</P>
    <P>The tourist business here can largely be determined by how we behave within our shores.  This extends not only to the economic and political situation but also to attitudes that we have towards tourism.  We have a sort of a split personality attitude towards tourism.  On the one hand, we want to be efficient but on the other hand we seem to take a certain pleasure in being casual and lethargic and we feel that these are the things that tourists like to see in us. Perhaps they are, but we seem to fall between two stools.  We cannot be casual and yet efficient in regard to promoting any business.  We must make up our minds to tackle tourism in an efficient manner or else we will just continue messing along from year to year, and I do not contemplate that with any pleasure.</P>
    <P>The international climate for travel is probably the most dominant feature as regards how well the Irish tourism business does.  Our economy can be doing well but if our fellow European economies are not doing well we will be on the losing end to a certain extent. That is why we must always try to get the maximum from our people in relation to how they spend their holidays.  If we can get them to spend their holidays at home even when our economy is doing excellently and they are tempted to go abroad their staying at home will make up for any shortfall there might be from foreign visitors.</P>
    <P>In relation to foreign visitors to <Col N="1471" /> Ireland Bord Fáilte in their annual report for 1978 said that 13 per cent of our visitors came from continental Europe. This figure trebled in the last decade; yet the number of visitors from North America went up only by approximately 25 per cent during the last ten years. Something has happened to the American market.  Maybe we are no longer appealing to that old ethnic association that we used to appeal to.  If the volume of continental visitors coming here can treble in ten years there is no reason why American visitors, who come from one of the most powerful economies in the world, should not also increase by much more than 25 per cent over ten years.  If that ethnic association no longer has the same appeal for the American market we shall have to play some other tune to entice them here. How many of our foreign visitors come back a second time?  This is a true assessment of what our tourist business is capable of and how it is performing.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a little ahead of what was envisaged, but it is welcome for all that. There is no point in crying over the difficulties that occurred in the early part of this year.  Let us hope we learned something from experience.  We were warned about them.  Bord Fáilte's 1978 report mentioned the damage that industrial disputes can do to the tourist business.  Fortunately, we were able to surmount them because the disputes finished early in the year.  Let us learn from what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reply to the points made in the debate, I would like to emphasise again, as I did in the Dáil, that this Bill is a declaration of the Government's confidence in the tourist industry and its future.  The industry has faced problem after problem over the past year but the quick and effective assistance that was granted to the industry by the State and by Bord Fáilte has resulted in the industry rallying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Molony's contribution, I am glad the tourist industry seem to have much more confidence in themselves.  I rarely have an opportunity to watch television, but I recently saw a <Col N="1472" /> programme on BBC Northern Ireland dealing with how the facilities available in the Republic were utilised.  I mention that programme because one might say that Irish interests might gild the lily, and one would not expect them to do it.  They interviewed people in the west and every one of them showed that, having overcome the problems which they faced in the postal strike and to some extent in the petrol situation, they had confidence and believed there was a worthwhile future for them during the coming tourist season.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony seemed to be asking whether prospective tourists in other countries were notified about the postal strike.  There is rarely need to inform people of bad news.  They were very well aware of it.  My confidence in the tourist industry was strengthened by the overwhelming interest shown in Ireland during my recent promotional visits in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. There is a very strong likelihood that the number of tourists coming from Germany and the Netherlands will improve on what were record figures in 1978.  I accept that it is going to be tougher in Britain but Bord Fáilte are engaged in an all-out effort in the British, Northern Ireland and the home markets.  There is every reason to hope that we may yet attain overall equality with the record 1978 figures.  I do not see any grounds for pessimism, and certainly no grounds for constantly speaking of disaster in relation to the tourist season.  With the peak period only now beginning, there is a profound need for an attitude which will inspire the industry in their efforts to seek a turnabout on the problems of May and June.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to the fact that this Bill relates to the future; so it does.  What we are referring to in respect of the future are capital moneys.  That does not mean exceptional efforts have not been made to promote tourism this year, particularly since the postal strike ended.  In the past few weeks Bord Fáilte have spent or committed £330,000 over and above their budgeted figures in the United Kingdom alone in getting the message across to the public that we are still very much open to business.  They have also launched a home holiday campaign <Col N="1473" /> in the Northern Ireland market. The board have been allocated a budget of over £12 million, which is no mean sum, to cover their general non-capital activities, including promotion and marketing.  The question of increasing the amount would not call for legislation, and there is no question of present promotional efforts being inhibited in any way by an inadequacy of funds. From what I said it is clear that a very considerable amount of money is being spent on promotion.</P>
    <P>References were made to the petrol voucher scheme for tourists.  The introduction of this unique arrangement is an indication of the high priority which the Government attach to tourism.  It is a pity there has been a disposition to make damaging remarks about the scheme which are bound to be picked up and publicised abroad.  I emphasised that in the Dáil and I want to emphasise it here also.  The complaints I heard about the scheme related mainly to the very first days of its operation.  These difficulties have been substantially overcome.  Until the recent petrol problems many tourists who had vouchers did not need to use them.  There have been many instances of tourists returning from their holidays and handing back the vouchers.  We do not hear anything about that; but if there is a single case in which something unfortunately goes wrong, it is turned into a major issue.  The response of the tourists to this scheme has been exceptionally good.  We got very worthwhile word of mouth publicity because of it. Many returning visitors were asked at the ferries how they managed for petrol and we got no complaints from anybody in respect of the voucher scheme.  Possibly in some areas tourists may have been turned away from filling stations where the owners said they were not designated to supply the petrol.  I deprecate this practice.  I should have expected that filling stations throughout the country have as big a stake in caring for tourists as those who either have shops or provide accommodation. Tourists are normal customers &mdash; that is how they would be described in ordinary times.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate private individuals and local bodies who got <Col N="1474" /> together to ensure that tourists get supplies, and I urge others to follow their example. There are vouchers available at 17 centres &mdash; the main regional tourism offices throughout the country.  There are 200 garages designated to make fuel available and in general they are open on every weekday and part of Saturday. They may not be open all the time, but we found that when the tourist goes to the local office and makes inquiries that the garage proprietor makes petrol available.</P>
    <P>When I found there were very considerable queues outside garages because of the recent problem I made inquiries locally and the girl in charge of the Bord Fáilte office told me there were still two garages in that area willing to provide petrol.  In those circumstances I repeat that visitors coming to this country need not worry in respect of the provision of petrol.  The situation has been improving in recent times.</P>
    <P>I went abroad myself to help out in the promotion of tourism and basically to explain to prospective visitors that the postal strike was over and that petrol is again available.  Unfortunately, we have had further difficulties here and I would hope that they would be overcome relatively quickly.  I must compliment Bord Fáilte on their activity over this entire period.  They very vigorously tackled the problems arising from the postal dispute. They employed all their normal resources in communications, service and publicity to assist the industry at home and to maintain contact with the market abroad.  They had very considerable success in their efforts, particularly in relation to block bookings and larger units in the accommodation sectors and in the STD areas generally.  I will accept, and I very keenly appreciate, that in some sectors particularly in the non-STD areas, serious problems were encountered and only limited help could be provided.  I am aware, though, in some such cases, that hotel and guesthouse proprietors by very commendable self-help managed to maintain their market contacts and they are now reaping the benefit in good bookings.</P>
    <P>I might also tell Senator Molony that on the Continent the bulk of the bookings <Col N="1475" /> are through the trade and the trade were kept fully informed by Bord Fáilte as to what conditions were like here.  I expect the traffic from the Continent to increase on what we had last year. Senator Brugha referred to the Bord Fáilte inspection system.  The fact is that Bord Fáilte have an inspection system and they grade hotels and if the level of service comes into question the grading is examined.  They have a task force on standards.  This was launched by An Bord Fáilte to draw attention to the ever constant need to look to standards in all aspects of the industry.  There are full-time Bord Fáilte staff involved in this drive for maintaining and improving standards.  During 1978, 24 seminars were held on hygiene and consumer relations and 18 are planned for this year. Advice and assistance are also tendered and in 1978 there were 12 self-help projects; the number this year is expected to rise to 78.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer the matter to Bord Fáilte on that aspect.  Senator Blennerhassett referred to the need for hotels to keep their prices as low as possible. I agree with him there.  On the other hand, he is aware that there is quite a variety of accommodation to suit all purses.  You have the hotels, guesthouses, town and country homes and farmhouses and bed and breakfast premises. As regards the suggestion that the hotels should reduce their rates, that is a business question and it is really a matter for themselves.  I would like, naturally, to see costs kept as low as possible so as to encourage as many people as possible to come to the country, but nevertheless it is a matter of economics and I would not like to interfere in that particular aspect of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harney referred to the need to encourage more Irish people to remain at home.  As I said, there is a very strong promotional effort being made by An Bord Fáilte to keep our people at home.  While it may be true that brochures for foreign holidays are <Col N="1476" /> handed out at the regional offices, perhaps they were asked for, but there is no question about the fact that they have brochures for home holidays and I am sure that these are made available on request. Perhaps I may suggest to Bord Fáilte that they would be made available in every case, whether requested or not. In so far as traditional music is concerned as a help towards tourism, I think that that is a worthwhile suggestion and not only that, but I think that it is something which is developing in the country at present.  I find that in the small town in which I live a group of people have come together over the past three or four years and they provide traditional music and it is very well accepted not just by tourists but by the local people as well.</P>
    <P>I would just say to Senator Markey that tourism has not collapsed and is very far from collapsing.  This is the first time in ten years that we have had a grant scheme for new accommodation. It shows the confidence that we have as a Government in the future of our tourism business.  Regarding the suggestion he made about the VIPs, certainly it would be a very good idea if we could get the VIPs to come.  I suppose he is referring to the visit of the Queen of Holland which was of value to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was quite a number.  We have built up a certain amount of goodwill with these people and I think something could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I fully accept that, but apart from that, Bord Fáilte have had on many occasions groups of journalists, people promoting tourism and so on over here and brought them around the country and showed them what was available, with very worthwhile effect when they went back.  While this Bill relates specifically to the provision of rooms and so on, which is something for, I would hope, the relatively near future, that does not mean at all that we are not making special efforts to promote tourism.  In fact we are making exceptional efforts, as I have pointed out, to ensure that the tourist industry will again be on the upward trend which we experienced over the last couple of <Col N="1477" /> years.  We were not at a standstill.  The numbers coming to this country from abroad were increasing each year and in fact last year we reached a peak which was the highest ever; the previous highest was in 1969.  There was a downward trend in the numbers coming to Ireland from 1969 onwards for a variety of reasons but we had again reached a situation in 1978 where we had more people visiting the country than ever before.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the overall, long term tourism prospects are good.  I think that the industry shares this view despite the fact that we had a temporary adversity this year.  While we have not been neglecting to promote tourism this year and, as I say, vigorous efforts have been put into promotion in which I myself took part, while not neglecting that we have nevertheless to plan for expansion; we cannot wait until the demand outpaces the available supply.  The present Bill by increasing the statutory limits will ensure that money can be made available to Bord Fáilte to stimulate growth in the accommodation sector and the ancillary amenities to cater for our tourists and I am glad to be in a position to commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I made a number of points to which the Minister did not advert in his reply and I am concerned about two specific ones.  I spoke at some length about the problems on Lough Derg at the moment.  One matter I would like the Minister to look at is the difficulties people are experiencing getting fuel for boats as they go up the lake.  I do not expect the Minister to reply to that now but I would ask him to see what he can do to relieve the situation.  My other point was in relation to the operation of the petrol voucher scheme for tourists coming here <i>via</i> the North of Ireland on the Stranraer-Larne ferry.

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The enactment of the present Bill is necessitated by the need to make provision for the capital and borrowing requirements of the B &amp; I Company in respect of a further passenger <Col N="1479" /> car ferry.  As announced by the Taoiseach on 18 May 1979 the Government have decided to authorise the B &amp; I Company to acquire a fifth passenger-car ferry from Verolme Cork Dockyard to be followed in due course by an order from Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>
      <P>Construction of the new ferry for the B &amp; I will begin without delay and the new vessel is expected to be available around mid-1981.  It is expected to cost around £21 million on current indications. This represents a very sizeable investment, reflecting the dramatic worldwide escalation in the cost of new ships in recent years.  The cost of acquiring new ships is a major problem nowadays for shipping companies.  Over the past ten years, the cost of new tonnage has quadrupled.  This places an insuperable difficulty in the way of financing new tonnage out of earnings.  I am satisfied that the B &amp; I Company could not finance this new vessel wholly by loan capital and that an Exchequer contribution in the form of additional equity is essential.  It is proposed, therefore, to allocate part of the additional Exchequer equity provided for in the Bill towards the cost of the new ferry.  The balance would be financed out of borrowings by the B &amp; I Company and in that connection the proposed increase in the State guarantee limit will provide for any guarantee which may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The B &amp; I were acquired by the State in 1965 mainly to secure a greater measure of Irish participation in cross-channel services in the interest of trade and tourism generally.  I believe that the company have gone a long way towards fulfilling this objective, despite the extremely competitive conditions prevailing on the Irish Sea.  The company now carry a significant proportion of all passengers, cars and freight moving on cross-channel sea services and are thus in a strong position to influence the competitiveness and the quality of service to Irish tourism and to Irish exporters and importers.  The company's well-established freight services to Europe have also assumed a greater significance with our membership of the European Community. <Col N="1480" /> If the company are to be enabled to continue fulfilling this obligation, they must continue to offer and maintain the best standards of service for passengers and freight.  Modern, fast and efficient vessels are a fundamental requirement for this purpose.  The company's existing ferries, apart from the new <i>Connacht,</i> were acquired as part of the extensive modernisation undertaken by the company in the late sixties.  These existing ferries will, of course, see the company into the eighties but forward planning is essential at this stage, taking account of the need to renew the company's fleet during the eighties.  Replacement of the company's earlier ferries could take several years to complete.  It is necessary in these circumstances to initiate the process of fleet renewal now and the provisions of the present Bill will enable the first concrete step to be taken in that direction.</P>
    <P>The fleet renewal programme forms an important element of the company's future development plans.  The implementation of these plans will gear the company to exploit the market opportunities of the eighties and provide for the expected growth in traffic.</P>
    <P>Features of the company's plans, apart from fleet renewal, include the introduction of a Jetfoil Service between Dublin and Liverpool early in 1980 and a new car ferry service on the Southern Corridor between Rosslare and Pembroke.  The company are also planning additional roll-on/roll-off freight capacity on the Irish Sea, which the company pioneered in the sixties, and which is now a significant growth area.</P>
    <P>The company will also be providing additional capacity on their continental services, a market which is also showing considerable growth potential following Ireland's entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these plans will enable the company to create an additional 400 jobs within the organisation with a considerable number of further job opportunities also arising in other areas associated with the company's developments.</P>
    <P>The report on the B &amp; I by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored bodies is a timely document. <Col N="1481" /> The Committee made a number of very interesting suggestions on a number of points and I have arranged for my Department to examine these critically in consultation with the B &amp; I.  The usefulness of the Committee's report to my Department and the B &amp; I Company is enhanced by the fact that the Committee's deliberations represent an independent look at the operations of the B &amp; I. Many of the points made by the Joint Committee in relation to such matters as the future rate of return on the company's investments and the funding of their future development plans are constructive and of direct relevance to the company's future development plans. There is no doubt that the company's future development proposals, including fleet renewal, will call for significant capital.  The extent to which the B &amp; I Company themselves will be able to fund part of their future capital requirements from their own resources will depend on the company's profit-making over the next few years.  My objective is that the company &mdash; through a combination of loan finance and accumulated profits &mdash; should aim at the highest possible level of self-financing.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic expansion in the activities of the B &amp; I Company since their passage into State ownership in 1965.  1978 was the company's most successful year to date.  Passenger, freight and car carryings rose to record levels.  A record net profit of £1.35 million was achieved, although the company consider that this could have been over £2 million but for net losses of nearly £900,000 caused by labour disputes outside the company's control at various ports to which the company operate services. The continued development of the company and the provision of new vessels and ancillary equipment to that end is important in the furtherance of national development.  Apart from the essential services which they operate in the interest of trade and tourism, the company activities are of very considerable direct benefit to the economy. For example, 65 per cent of their turnover is earned in the form of valuable foreign exchange while 71 per cent of their expenditure is made in Ireland thus maximising the benefits to the economy. <Col N="1482" /> They provide employment for nearly 2,000 people and their total annual payroll is over £10 million.  Between 1968 and 1978 they paid £31 million to Verolme Cork Dockyard for the construction of five new vessels and the conversion and overhaul of others.  The present car ferry order will provide full employment at Verolme Cork Dockyard for the next two years.</P>
    <P>The provision of the Bill will provide a basis for the continued development of the B &amp; I Company.  I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of extra capital and borrowing requirements for the B &amp; I seems to be a necessary undertaking on the part of the Government due to the commitment already made in regard to the proposed passenger car ferry.  However, because of the present tourist situation and as so much of the business of B &amp; I has consisted of the transport of cars and their passengers, particularly from the UK to here, I wonder what the long-term prospects of the company are?  Will this mean a greater effort by B &amp; I to make progress in other fields, namely, in the transport of freight?  A controversy arose in the Dáil with regard to the suggestion that the B &amp; I should be denationalised.  I studied that debate and the report of the Joint Committee which looked into the B &amp; I with particular regard to the proposal in relation to the car passenger service.  It appears to me that the criticism in the Dáil, and the volume of questioning at the meeting of the Joint Committee with B &amp; I personnel, was justified to a certain extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on reading the report of the Joint Committee I got the impression that the questioning of the B &amp; I personnel was a little light.  It appeared that many of the questions were known in advance &mdash; I do not know if that is standard procedure in the operation of that Joint Committee and I do not know whether the necessary expertise was available to the Joint Committee to help in the preparation of questions to be put to B &amp; I personnel.  The picture painted in that report does not come across as rosy as that portrayed in the Minister's <Col N="1483" /> speech with regard to past and future operations of the company.  Perhaps a little more probing by the Joint Committee would have enlightened us as to the future viability of the company.  That was the second report of the Joint Committee I read and it appeared to me that the Members of that Joint Committee are facing a problem in the questioning of personnel of semi-State bodies.  They appear to face a difficulty in regard to the social obligations of the operations of semi-State bodies as against the commercial role which they should also follow. The Joint Committee will find it difficult to get a true answer to that question. They will also have a problem arriving at a proper solution.  They will have difficulty in deciding whether there should be proper segregation between those matters and which should take priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair.  I question the criteria which apparently somebody applies with regard to the social role of the company.  Have the relevant Departments certain criteria in determining the success or failure of such semi-State bodies?  For instance, in the case of the B &amp; I is the criterion for success the return on capital employed or is it the number of jobs provided?  Is the criterion the spin-off the company can create in other sectors of the economy, the creation of jobs elsewhere?  We must decide that question sooner or later.  We all accept that the predecessor of that <Col N="1484" /> company was, to all intents and purposes, a lame duck.  When the State took it over it was developed by the State pumping capital into it.  I acknowledge that it has been turned into a relatively profitable enterprise but we cannot continue as a nation taking over enterprises that are not profitable when they run into difficulties and nationalising them because the view will continue to be expressed that as it is a semi-State enterprise it is performing a social obligation as well as playing a commercial role.  When that happens it is very difficult to determine which is the more important and which should take precedence.  We have come up against the question in relation to other semi-State bodies, like the B &amp; I, that when the social role assumes precedence over the commercial role more money must be pumped into them.  Whether that is the wisest course or not in the long term is something I cannot decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view there was some justification for the attitude adopted by a Member in the Dáil in regard to the operations of the B &amp; I.  He was critical, having read the report of the Joint Committee which investigated that company. Having read the same report, I believe his criticism was justified.  I am not saying that I agree with the suggestion put forward by that Deputy as being the option available to the Minister with regard to the future of the company.  The objective of the company in 1965 was to provide and develop a modern, efficient, profitable, national and comprehensive surface transport system to and from Ireland, glamorous words and worthy ideals, a worthy objective for any company, semi-State or otherwise.  The performance of the company last year in carrying almost 750,000 passengers and 150,000 cars to and from Ireland is highly commendable, but it is my view that the Joint Committee should keep a close eye on its operations.  The company has played a worthy part in the heavy freight transport system and pioneered the first roll-on/roll-off container operation here.  It has managed to increase its traffic over the years by 10 per cent annually and admits that its return on capital is, unfortunately, not adequate for the amount of investment <Col N="1485" /> involved.  I am not saying that the company should be condemned or criticised out of hand but they should work on that problem.  I would be interested to hear a comparison between the employment figure within the B &amp; I for this year and, say, ten years ago.  I accept the commitment of further capital investment to the company although I have some general reservations about the operations of the company, particularly with regard to the criteria that must be applied with regard to its social and commercial role and that of other semi-State bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <P>I support this Bill.  In a sense I suppose it is something of a relief to be dealing with a Bill in relation to a public semi-State body paying all its workers and showing even a modest profit at the end.  Certainly this is an area in which one can feel a little more optimistic and have greater confidence in the future.  That is the keynote of the Minister's proposal in providing the additional capital in time to enable the B &amp; I to continue to develop.  The directors and workers of B &amp; I are to be complimented on the progress of the company since 1965; at least it is one good story.  It may be, of course, that the existence of competitors in the same business is of considerable help in ensuring the success of a company like B &amp; I. Nevertheless, as a public company, it is showing signs of success and we should not be too backward in saying so.  It is a development along the right lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the B &amp; I Company give a reasonably good service. That is not to say, in spite of last year's profit of £1.35 million, that it is in an exceptionally sound financial condition. This point seems to be of particular relevance when they are contemplating now, borrowing or acquiring through share capital issued to the Minister, an extra £25 million of capital which, at current rates of interest at any rate, is going to be exceedingly difficult to remunerate.  On a rough estimate £25 million of new capital acquired today at a cost to somebody, the State or the company itself, of say 13 per cent, requires <Col N="1486" /> £3 million of profit just to remunerate it.  That sort of profit is certainly outside the compass of the company's experience to date.  Another aspect of that is that, if the State puts in equity, as the Minister says it must, and as the financial condition of the company makes imperative, to the extent of £15 million and that equity is not remunerated by way of dividend, that itself is the equivalent of giving anything between £1½ million and £2 million of annual subsidy to the company.  This may be desirable for various reasons. But I would join a previous speaker in hoping that the criterion that would be kept foremost in viewing the operations of the B &amp; I is the financial one rather than some hotch potch of social criteria which I do not think are really relevant in this case.  The company exists to provide an efficient transport service at the lowest possible cost and there should be continued insistence on its performing that role.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in the context of capital costs &mdash; such an important aspect of the finances of the company &mdash; whether the new ferry was the subject of invitation of tenders from various shipyards or whether, as seems to be implied by his opening speech, there was merely a Government directive issued to the B &amp; I to give the contract for the new passenger car ferry to Verolme Cork Dockyard.  What I am really asking is whether the expected cost of around £21 million for a ship supplied by the Verolme Cork Dockyard is a competitive price.  If it is not, then some social consideration is entering into this because more than the economic cost is being paid for the ship and a bigger subsidy requirement in future, at the expense of public funds, is being written into this contract than if the company were completely free to decide where to buy the new ferry on purely commercial considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for the manner in which they received the Bill and for the useful comments and points they made in relation to it.  The provisions of the Bill will provide a solid basis for the further expansion <Col N="1487" /> of the B &amp; I Company.  The progress of this company since they were taken into public ownership in 1965 is a vindication of the Government's decision to acquire the company at that time.  The continued development of the company is important &mdash; and I would emphasise this &mdash; both socially and economically.  The company's existing ferries, apart from the <i>Connacht,</i> were acquired as part of the company's fleet when the modernisation plans were undertaken in the late sixties.  These ferries will see the company into the eighties but forward-planning is essential at this stage.  The provisions of this Bill constitute the first concrete steps that we are taking in that direction.  I might point out that the B &amp; I operate under extremely competitive conditions which prevail on the Irish Sea.  To retain and, if possible, to improve their share of the market, shipping companies must continue to offer the best standards of service for passengers and freight.  Modern, fast and efficient vessels are a fundamental requirement in this respect.  There is no doubt that the future development of the B &amp; I will involve a very considerable challenge to the company.  It will call for a sustained effort on the company's part, aimed at raising profitability.  The level of the company's profits over the next few years will determine the extent to which the B &amp; I will be able to fund part of their future capital requirements from their own resources.  My objective for the B &amp; I is that the company, through a combination of loan finance and accumulated profits, should aim at the highest possible level of self-financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Markey referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies.  Whether or not the Committee's questioning was incisive I feel that the Committee's deliberations represented an independent look at the operations of the B &amp; I.  That enhances the usefulness of the Committee's report to my Department.  Many of the points made were constructive and relevant to the company's future plans.  To be quite frank about it, I was wondering when somebody was going to try to rescue the <Col N="1488" /> situation as it pertained in the Dáil; I must say the Senator did a reasonably good job.  In so far as the B &amp; I Company are concerned let me repeat that they made a profit last year of £1.35 million. They employ a couple of thousand people and are of very considerable assistance to tourism.  They demonstrated a social commitment in having ships built in Verolme Cork Dockyard Ltd. and their industrial relations are excellent. Taking everything into consideration, they are a very worthwhile and progressive company.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker referred to the fact that it would be difficult for the company to remunerate their capital and that the aim should be to provide an efficient transport service at the lowest possible cost.  The aim is, of course, to provide an efficient service at the lowest possible cost, but we do not rule out the social aspect.  Senator Whitaker asked whether we had sought tenders.  We did not.  The decision was to have the ship built at Verolme Cork Dockyard Ltd.  I have no doubt that the B &amp; I Company possibly could acquire a ferry cheaper from a foreign shipyard, but it should be understood that foreign shipyards are very often enabled to offer much cheaper prices only because they themselves are heavily subsidised.  We concerned ourselves not only with the building of the ship but also with the fact that by placing this order with Verolme Cork Dockyard Ltd., we could ensure that there would be full employment in the yard over the next couple of years. Perhaps, therefore, the best way to describe the situation is to say the B &amp; I Company have a strong commercial orientation coupled with a healthy attitude of social commitment.  The Bill will provide the necessary underpinning for the continued development of the company and I am glad that I have had the opportunity of bringing it before the House.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>
