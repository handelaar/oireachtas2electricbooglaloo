      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Charles McDonald be elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion I draw the attention of the House to Senator McDonald's experience as a parliamentarian. He was elected first to the Oireachtas in 1961 and has served continuously as a Member of either House since then.  In addition, Senator McDonald was a member of the European Parliament between 1973 and this year. That wealth of experience makes him admirably qualified to act as Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House and accordingly I propose his name with confidence and pleasure.</P>

    <Title>Dangerous Substances (Amendment) Bill, 1979: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dangerous Substances Act was passed in 1972 to amend and up-date the law relating to explosives, petroleum and other dangerous substances&mdash;as identified by statutory instrument&mdash;and gave considerable powers to the Minister for Labour to make regulations concerning them.</P>
      <P>These powers have not so far been exercised because, in 1972, the Government had to use the 1875 Explosive Act to prescribe ammonium nitrate, sodium chlorate and nitro-benzene to be explosives for the purposes of that Act. These substances were believed to be in use for the making of bombs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1972 Act could not be used to control the criminal use of explosives. An undertaking was given at the time of <Col N="1256" /> the passing of the Act that it would not be used in the criminal area.  Further, the three substances mentioned could not be regarded as explosives within the meaning of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>By means of the Bill now before the House I intend to operate those parts of the 1972 Act which relate to petroleum and other dangerous substances, leaving the legal position with respect to explosives as it is for the present, that is the Minister for Justice will continue to control this area.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of bringing the Act into operation in this way, last autumn I gave notice of intention to make four sets of regulations regarding petroleum and invited observations from interested parties.  These observations have been received and considered and where appropriate will be reflected in the regulations.</P>
    <P>These petroleum regulations and the Act will operate from the same date.  It is my intention that by virtue of these regulations the risks to persons and property in the conveyance, loading, unloading and storage of petroleum should be reduced to the absolute minimum if not entirely eliminated.</P>
    <P>In addition, I intend to introduce regulations to cover the transport by road of other dangerous substances which I shall specify, also by regulation. Further regulations will control their loading, unloading and storage.  I may mention that I propose to start by declaring by order 25 substances as dangerous, adding further substances as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the establishment of an advisory council.  I am sure Senators are well aware of the many interests involved in the area of dangerous substances including workers, employers and the public.  The volume, number, variety, dispersal and use of these substances have brought them to almost everybody's doorstep and there is an urgent need for indentifying them and providing information on the dangers, precautions and protective measures relating to them.  I am satisfied that an advisory body could be of great assistance in these areas.  The 1972 Act did not provide for such a body and in this Bill I propose to fill the gap.  Maximum <Col N="1257" /> flexibility is necessary and section 2 should enable me to obtain the best advice on all aspects of the safe movement, handling and storage in this country of dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the Bill which is urgently needed.  It is extraordinary that, even though the Dangerous Substances Act was passed in 1972, in the relatively short time since then, the dangerous element that exists in regard to dangerous substances has increased very much. This Bill may have been brought to the fore now due to the serious incidents which occurred both on the Continent and here in the past year particularly.</P>
      <P>In my constituency in Louth there was an incident of gas poisoning yesterday in a factory.  This type of thing is indicative of the dangerous elements that exist in industry.  It is also an indication of the march of progress in regard to science generally, that we have more explosive elements coming into use each year.  It is encouraging to see that in future there will be a much more regular review in regard to these substances and in regard to regulations relating to their control.</P>
      <P>The Dangerous Substances Act of 1972 gives considerable powers to the Minister for Labour to make regulations concerning dangerous substances.  I have no doubt that that Act will be fully implemented in the future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of an advisory council.  Having regard to the new dangerous substances coming on the market each year it is necessary to keep up to date with regard to the various substances and particularly in regard to the measures needed for their control.  I see that 25 substances will be listed by the Minister as being dangerous and I look forward to hearing what these are.  I am quite certain that that number will be increased as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has come largely as a result of the unfortunate incidents which have occurred not only here but in other countries in recent years.  In relation to the transport of dangerous substances and explosives, the roads that exist here at present are not an inducement to keep <Col N="1258" /> dangerous substances under control or to have regard to safety in the transport of these dangerous substances.  In other countries the quality of the roads does not prevent accidents happening but we take a greater risk due to the lower quality of the roads in general.  Every town here has seen an alarming increase in the amount of dangerous substances being conveyed through them in recent years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the regulations which the Minister will make under this Bill, certain measures will have to be taken at local level in regard to speed control for vehicles conveying dangerous substances. It is not unknown for very large articulated trucks and containers carrying dangerous substances envisaged under these regulations to travel at very high speeds through urban areas.  The Minister should ensure that the Minister for the Environment and also the Minister for Justice will do something in regard to the proper control of and the reduction of the speed of this highly dangerous transport.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill and are glad to see that an advisory council will be set up.  Such a council becomes more and more important in regard to Bills such as this because, with progress in science, reviews would have to be carried out much more regularly than hitherto as to what is dangerous and what controls will be needed in regard to conveyance, and with regard to general surveillance and control.  I look forward to seeing what exactly is included in the regulations with regards to the various substances and the powers the regulations will confer on the Department and on local authorities as regards controls.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I had considerable difficulty in understanding this Bill.  Its purpose is not in contention but it is very difficult to understand what the precise amendment achieves.  The first section of this very brief Bill proposes to amend section 1 (2) of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.  Subsection (2) of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> This Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may by order appoint.</P>
    <P>Instead of that subsection (2) we are substituting a different subsection (2) which says:</P>
    <P>This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may by order or orders appoint therefor either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions.</P>
    <P>That seems to give the Minister more flexibility about when he brings different provisions into effect but I cannot understand why the subsection has to be altered.  Was it badly drafted in the first place, was there a mistake that we are now correcting?  Perhaps the Minister would dwell on this with a little more detail.  Effectively, what we seem to be doing in this Bill is saying that the Minister can bring different parts of it in on different days for different purposes. I do not understand what the Minister meant when he said that an assurance was given in 1972 in relation to not using the Act for certain purposes, and perhaps he could also explain that.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of what appears to be the intent in enabling the Minister to make regulations in relation to the control of the transport of dangerous substances.  It has always seemed to be a gap in our safety controls, both for the employees involved and for citizens who may be affected by accidents caused by dangerous substances on rail or road or other means of transport.  This has become a particularly acute problem because of some of the industry which we have attracted to this country, which involves very dangerous substances.  I refer to the chemical industry, or to plants like the Asahi plant near Killala where very dangerous substances are transported by rail and by road.  Will the Minister give some indication, particularly in relation to the Asahi plant, as to whether the regulations will govern the transport of the material to the Asahi plant in Killala, and as to whether these <Col N="1260" /> regulations are already prepared and can be brought into effect immediately, or whether there will be a delay between the passage of this rather technical Bill and the implementation of the regulations for which the Minister seeks authority?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most commendable measure and I hope it will have a very speedy passage through the House.  More and more substances of a highly dangerous nature are coming into use at the moment and every step must be taken to ensure that dangers to life and property will be reduced to a minimum.</P>
      <P>As a people we are inclined to take risks in most things, the handling of dangerous substances, and so on, and even amateurs rewire houses and do electrical repairs.  It seems very often to be a sign of manliness to take unnecessary risks.  If a job has been half-done, one often hears the remark that it is all right, that it will do.  It will not do and every step must be taken in every area to make sure that risks to life and property will be reduced to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The key sentence in the Minister's speech was:</P>
      <P>Maximum flexibility is necessary and section 2 should enable me to obtain the best advice on all aspects of the safe movement, handling and storage of dangerous substances.</P>
      <P>Dangerous substances are becoming far more common, and new substances and new materials are being manufactured in more sophisticated ways and the Minister has very often to act speedily in these matters.</P>
      <P>Transport by road and sea was mentioned. There is a certain amount of anxiety as regards road transportation of dangerous substances.  People are asking why cannot these substances be transported by sea.  Perhaps the Minister would refer in his reply to the proposed transport of ammonia from Cork to Arklow by road rather than by sea.  I hope this Bill will get a speedy passage and I hope people will enter into the spirit of it and get well rid of this idea of associating manliness and bravery with utter carelessness in the handling of dangerous substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1261" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his concern for the public at large in this measure.  The updating of legislation is an on-going process.  The Minister, in a very real and practical way, had been concerned about safety problems in industry and elsewhere.  This Bill is a further extension of the Minister's concern.</P>
      <P>I would direct attention to the question of the transportation, the loading and unloading and storage of dangerous substances.  Very often nowadays dangerous substances are found in homes and on farms and I hope the Minister will direct his attention to the problems that this causes.  I wonder if in the Bill there is an omission in relation to not alone the loading and unloading and storage of dangerous substances but also of the dumping of dangerous substances which is a very real problem in a community where dangerous substances have been dumped, close to residential areas where the dangers from the fumes and so on have not become apparent for some considerable time.  In some cases, years afterwards, containers could explode or burst underground and then contamination could arise.</P>
      <P>I hope also that the Minister will take the broadest possible view in relation to the composition of the advisory council who are to be set up.  The council should not comprise only of academics, but housewives and workers, people who in a very practical way are dealing with the problems of safety at all times.  In this area, a very substantial advance could be made without just getting a one-sided glance at the problems.  In many factories at the moment grave concern has been expressed that some workers have been tampering with dangerous substances which puts other workers at risk. I am concerned and amazed that trade unionists sometimes put their fellow workers at risk by tampering with many of the dangerous substances because they feel that they are making a contribution on behalf of their trade unions. In fact they are causing grave problems and are in a way degrading the trade union organisation by creating problems. I appeal to responsible trade unionists and trade union leaders to desist from putting their fellow workers at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> In recent times, this type of terrorism has developed to an alarming degree. The newspapers tell us of sabotage in industry by workers tampering with dangerous substances and so on.  It is about time we awoke to the fact that there are saboteurs in our midst, who in the future will tamper with dangerous substances in order to impose their wills on the community.  That will be a sad day for us.  We must take immediate positive action now to ensure that people can live their lives in comparative freedom away from this terror tactic that has developed in recent times.  It is a sad reflection on trade unionists and employers who do not measure up to their responsibility and ensure that these saboteurs are removed so that people can live in comparative safety.  If people have problems, the necessary machinery is there to solve them, so there should be no recourse to this type of sabotage that we have heard of in recent times.  I hope every effort will be made by all responsible people to ensure that people who appear to be tampering with dangerous substances will be kept under proper surveillance and that responsible trade unionists, trade union officials, workers and management will play their part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Bill, where the Minister is making a positive effort to ensure the safety of everyone concerned, it is only fitting that we add our voice to this wide-ranging problem.  I have very positive feelings about recent developments and I would not like to see this Bill sabotaged in any way in the future. We should strengthen the Minister's hand and congratulate him on the steps that he has taken, even though they may be unknown to the general public.  This is a further step along the road and I wish the Minister the very best in the future.  I would ask the Minister to consider the composition of the board and to make it's composition as wide as possible so as to encompass the views of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this legislation as I would any legislation that <Col N="1263" /> would promote greater safety for workers, employers and the public generally.  The Minister's greatest task here will be to instil in the minds of the community the real danger that exists in the handling of some of these dangerous substances.  All of us see day after day the absolute carelessness which the public display towards the lethal power that is in many of the substances they are handling.  There is a real need for an awakening of public interest in this field.</P>
      <P>There are two fields to which the Minister should direct his attention. Transport of highly dangerous substances becomes a major problem on our highways and on our narrow county roads which are not suitable.  Because of their unsuitability and because of the traffic density on such roads, the danger is all the greater.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the anxiety of people in urban areas about the storage, loading and unloading of very large quantities of cylinders of gas and other substances.  While existing legislation does, to some extent, provide some controls in this field, the public anxiety should be allayed by the Minister at this time.  In every town or village in Ireland today huge trucks are being loaded and unloaded and those cylinders are tossed around as if they were mere toys.  When one considers the colossal tragedies that could result from carelessness one realises the necessity for statutory regulations.  In regard to the storage of very large quantities of gas, due to its widespread consumption today, the Minister should thoroughly investigate the desirability of having it well protected and safeguarded so that the resident community in cities, urban and other areas have the assurance that risks have been reduced to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation.  We all agree on the need for safety in the handling of dangerous substances and I am sure this legislation will be welcomed by the people working in this area.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> ...I intend to introduce regulations to cover the transport by road of other dangerous substances which I shall specify, also by regulation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the movement of these dangerous substances by road, particularly on narrow roads such as those in the west.  The Minister is probably aware of the danger on these roads.  Two years ago a container with a very dangerous substance fell off a lorry near Portumna, County Galway, and was not discovered for a week.  This kind of thing can happen when the road is poorly structured.  I would ask the Minister to encourage carriage of these dangerous substances by rail rather than by road.  CIE have discontinued the passenger service on many railway lines in the west which has resulted in extra buses travelling on the roads.  Surely there should be an opportunity for some of these dangerous substances to be carried by rail?  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the advisory council that is to be set up.  I hope this council will be able to inform the Minister about and identify other dangerous substances which may be coming on the market. Again, I should like to congratulate the Minister and I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Senators for supporting the Bill and for the expeditious way in which they have accepted this Stage.  The goodwill expressed for the measure was expected since we all share a common purpose in promoting the safety of persons and property.</P>
      <P>Senator Markey made a number of points.  I am not sure if he asked me to give him the dangerous substances that had already been designated.  I can do that, if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will have the list circulated later but I will briefly call them out &mdash; acetone, acrylonitrile, ammonia, benzene, butane, <Col N="1265" /> chlorine, ethanol, ethylacrylate, formic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide solutions, methanol, methyl acrylate, methyl ethyl ketone, nitric acid, solutions of potassium cynaide, potash lye, propane, solutions of sodium cyanide, soda lye sulphuric acid, toluene, xylene, and any mixture of butane and propane.  That is the list at the moment.</P>
      <P>Senator Markey and other Senators referred to transport, speeds, storage, loading and unloading.  Some items were mentioned specifically and I will refer to them.  Senator Cranitch referred to the transport of ammonia from Cork to Arklow, which had some press publicity recently.  CIE arrangements for the movement of anhydrous ammonia have been drawn up in accordance with the standards laid down in the international convention concerning the transport of dangerous goods by rail&mdash;(RID).  The special precautions being taken by CIE have safety as the prime overall requirement and include a specially designed train, special tank containers and specially trained staff engaged in the operation.  If, however, despite stringent precautions being taken, an accident should occur, co-ordinated emergency procedures have been established following discussions with appropriate Government Departments to deal with such a situation.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, I will have powers to require by-laws to be made in such a situation or in any similar situation.  This is a power not existing at the present time.  What exists at present is that by-laws must be drafted under the Transport Act, 1950 but I, as Minister for Labour, in the interests of safety and in the interests of safety of workers especially, may now require that such by-laws may be made and, having examined them, I can reject them if they are not adequate or satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The delay in the Bill was referred to. Senator Robinson specifically asked for an explanation as to the need for this Bill and what was specifically the difference. I thought I had explained it at the beginning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P>The 1972 Act, if brought in in its entirety, would have created difficulties in another area, as the Senator is no doubt well aware.  The purpose of the amendment is that I can bring in parts of the 1972 Act, in other words, the greater part of the 1972 Act, which I could not do because of the subsection being amended here.  As I explained at the outset, if I did not move this amendment, the Bill being brought in in its entirety would repeal most of the Explosives Act, 1875.  Under that Act the Government in 1972 prescribed sodium chlorate, which is a weedkiller, ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser, and nitro-benzene, to be explosives.  These substances are not explosives within the meaning of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.  They would cease to be regarded as explosives if the 1972 Act were brought into operation in its entirety because that would be, then, amending or repealing most of the Act of 1875.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substances I referred to, despite their peaceful uses, have been used as ingredients in bomb making.  The security situation demands the continuation of controls in the foreseeable future.  Accordingly, the Explosives Act, 1875 cannot be repealed at the present time and, obviously, I need this amendment so that I can bring in the greater part of the 1972 Act.  I, too, am disappointed in the delay that has taken place.  I was amazed and surprised when I assumed office two years ago, that no progress had been made in efforts to bring the Bill into operation during the preceding four or five years.  I immediately set about ways and means by which this could be done. This amendment is one of them.  I must thank both the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General for their co-operation and assistance in reaching the <Col N="1267" /> situation where we can now bring the 1972 Act into operation.</P>
    <P>There is another problem here.  Large volumes of regulations are required both under dangerous substances and under petroleum.  In the petroleum area substantial progress has been made in the last year or so.  As I said in my opening speech, last Autumn I made the draft regulations available, asked for comments from interested bodies and parties and such comments were forthcoming and were taken into consideration, and those regulations in the petroleum area are almost ready at this stage.  On the dangerous substances end, work is well advanced.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked what were the Ministers' intentions regarding transport to Asahi.  I intend to include this substance in the 25 substances which will be declared by order to be dangerous substances under section 24 of the 1972 Act.  I also intend to make regulations in the near future to deal with the packaging, labelling, transport, loading, unloading and storage of the 25 substances to be declared dangerous and acrylonitrile will, therefore, come within the scope of these regulations.  It should be mentioned, however, that a stringent code of safety measures, including emergency procedures, is in operation to control the carriage of acrylonitrile by rail between Dublin and Ballina and by road from Ballina to Killala.  It should also be mentioned that I now have power under section 62 (3) of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, to require a railway undertaker, as in this case, to make under statutory powers by-laws governing conveyance, loading and unloading.  The body transporting, conveying, loading or unloading are compelled to make these by-laws under the Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowling raised a number of points including the dumping of dangerous substances.  The dumping of such substances is a matter for the environment, but the Minister for Labour is concerned with the conveyance and loading of any such substances.  The Senator also referred to the transporting, loading and unloading, and expressed <Col N="1268" /> very genuine concern that must be shared by us all.  He mentioned unlawfully interfering, or tampering with dangerous substances.  This is very serious and is an existing offence under the Factories Act, 1955.  The loading and unloading of dangerous substances will be covered by regulations made under the Act.  That is a valid point.</P>
    <P>The advisory council have been referred to.  I, too, laid great emphasis on this council.  It is important that they be strong and representative, that the best possible advise be available to the Minister of the day regarding the various operations to which I have referred, and to the various substances that are in existence and used at present or that may be used in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt referred to the movement of dangerous substances.  As I said, in the regulations I hope to provide that as far as practicable the safest routes will be selected for the conveyance of any such substances.  He will appreciate&mdash;he recommended the use of rail rather than road&mdash;that this is not possible in all cases because railroads do not exist in all parts of the country.  That covers most of the points.  On the petroleum regulations, notices appeared in the papers last autumn, submissions were made by the interested parties and as a result of that operation these regulations are almost ready.</P>
    <P>May I thank Senators for their support and concern and assure them that this and other safety matters will always be a concern of mine during my time as Minister?</P>

      <P>Contravention of any provision of the Act, any instrument made under it, or any condition attached <Col N="1269" /> to a licence, will be an offence under section 47.  Occupiers and licensees will be guilty of an offence in respect of contraventions connected with premises, except where it is a contravention of a duty expressly imposed on some other person and where the occupier or licensee took all reasonable steps to prevent contravention under section 48.

      <P>Forgery, for example, could be an important area.  A person who forges a licence or certificate or anything of that nature, is covered under section 50.  An important section of the 1972 Act is section 52 because where no express penalty is provided, the penalty on summary conviction for an offence will be a fine of up to £100 or a month's imprisonment, or both.  The penalty for continuing offences will be £20 per day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Moynihan made a very valid point.  The biggest difficulty in safety is education.  The old saying, familiarity breeds contempt, is true.  People can <Col N="1270" /> become too happy when they regularly use any particular substance.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowling made the point about the importance of the trade union movement, employers and all such bodies continuing to impress on people the importance of safety, the danger of becoming too familiar when using certain substances and, as a result, taking short cuts and risks.</P>
    <P>There is a forfeiture clause also.  The court may order that anything which was the subject of an offence may be forfeited or may impose in addition any fine or penalty not exceeding the money value of the goods liable to forfeiture. There are some valuable trucks on the road and, in my view, the penalties are adequate in that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. There are very substantial regulations to be made, but when this amendment is passed, it will enable me to bring in the Bill in sections.  The only section it is not intended to bring in at this time is Part II.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that clarification.  I note that section 21 relates to the storage of petroleum spirit and, in particular, its storage in private houses.  Is it the case that this section has not been operative until now and will it become operative when the Bill is passed?  If so, would the Minister take steps to publicise the implications of <Col N="1271" /> this for people who are storing petrol in private houses?  Is he in a position to ensure that there is not storage of petrol in private houses in greater quantity than either the present law or section 21 of this Bill, when it comes into effect, allows? There are a lot of rumours and scare stories about large quantities of petrol being stored in people's garages or in the spare room or, in one instance I heard of, being stored in a bath.  This poses a possible terrible hazard for the householders themselves and for people in the area.  It is the kind of problem that could worsen if we continue to have shortages.  Are the provisions of section 21 to come into effect as soon as the Bill is passed?  As I understand it, section 21 (2) (a) provides that a person can store a quantity not exceeding three gallons kept in suitable leak-proof containers securely stopped and containing not more than one gallon each.  I would like the Minister to comment on this whole situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The fast answer to the Senator's answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, that is the intention.  It is timely to raise this point.  I cannot give the Senator an indication of how much, if any, quantities of petrol are held by people.  I, too, hear stories and rumours.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to express the seriousness of this action and the consequent dangers that could arise from storing petrol. Under the Department of the Environment the road traffic petroleum regulations 1964, made under sections 5 and 122 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, provide that, subject to certain conditions, a person may keep without a licence under the Petroleum Acts a limited quantity of petrol for the purposes of a mechanically-propelled vehicle owned by him.  The quantity of such petroleum is limited to four gallons when kept in a storehouse attached to a dwelling and 60 gallons when kept in a storehouse complying with more stringent requirements, including a requirement that it must be situated a distance from other dwellings.  In other words, these regulations are in existence at present without the introduction of this Bill.  Section 21, as the Senator <Col N="1272" /> pointed out, covers the storage of petroleum spirits.  We should all impress on people and bring to people's notice, the dangers and risks involved if rumours of persons storing petrol are true.  These persons may be creating problems for neighbours, for children and so on.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the importance he attaches to the establishment of this advisory council. They seem to be a weak body in their composition, security of tenure and their capacity to act.  They are appointed by, and hold office at the discretion of, the Minister.  Even if an inspector wants to attend a meeting, it appears that he needs the consent of the Minister to do so.  It may be that I am construing it too strictly according to the letter of what is in the section and that the Minister intends it to be an effective and useful advisory council to him.  What kind of work will this advisory council undertake? For example, will they be advising on the kind of precautions which would need to be taken in relation both to the labelling of dangerous substances and to the safety precautions, if a container which contains dangerous substances has an accident on the road or rail?  This is a problem other countries are coping with.  There are particular ways of labelling substances to ensure that if, for example, the fire brigade or other emergency service are called, they do not use the wrong method of tackling the particular substance.  There are a number of other areas where we need a great deal more warning.  To reinforce Senator Moynihan's point on education, will the advisory council advise the Minister on ways of improving public awareness and public education in relation to dangerous substances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the desirability of having maximum flexibility under this section.  The way it is worded, it appears that that maximum <Col N="1273" /> flexibility is not being given to what should be a very important advisory council.  The last line of subsection (1) says: &ldquo;which the Minister may refer to the advisory council&rdquo;.  This appears to mean that the Minister will tell the advisory council what he wishes them to investigate, and that they may not meet or discuss, except when the Minister refers certain matters for discussion and investigation to them.  This is making the whole thing rather inflexible and is also putting the advisory council under certain constraints.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a point which Senator Robinson referred to.  The advisory council are subject to the consent of the Minister in requesting some inspector, or other persons, to come before the council and discuss matters with them.  As I see it, the advisory council are to concern themselves with a very wide field, not only in the identification of what are dangerous substances but also in regard to how these dangerous substances may affect workers in their employment, the public generally and the environment through pollution.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister's comments on the two points I have raised.  First, is he not constraining this advisory council by the wording of subsection (1) which says &ldquo;which the Minister may refer to the advisory council&rdquo;?  I would prefer that the advisory council should be an on-going council and should meet as they wish on certain matters.  Second, is he not also constraining them by making them seek his consent to invite people to come and discuss matters with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my wish that this advisory council would be as flexible as possible, for obvious reasons.  Certain interests would have to be represented. There are advisory councils at present in respect of factories and under other Acts.  Representation will have to be from bodies such as trade union and employer bodies but there will have to be representation from a much wider field. For example, transport and the chemical industries are involved.  A good point was made in the Dáil yesterday that the community should be represented.  I said that point had a lot of merit and should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> In the terms of reference of the advisory council it would be in the Government's interest and the community's interest to have as much flexibility as possible, bringing on to the council any expertise that may be needed from time to time.</P>
    <P>The question of the attendance of an inspector has been referred to.  This is, in most cases, very desirable but there has to be a protection on the basis of the Minister's responsibilities to ensure that information in regard to matters relating, for example, to prosecution cases pending, is treated as absolutely confidential. In other words, it would not be right for this House or for me as Minister to give <i>carte blanche</i> to an inspector's attendance in a situation where there was a prosecution pending where he could be a vital witness.  There could be an interested party or a commercially represented person on that advisory council and the inspector would be facing an inquisition or a haranguing about a pending prosecution.  This is merely a protection in the case of responsibilities in the general run of the advisory council's working.  I would see no reason why discussions could not go on or why an inspector should not attend, but at the same time his attendance has to be protected in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned labelling, to which I had referred earlier. Labelling is a very important part of this operation.  It will be provided that tankers carrying dangerous substances will be suitably marked and will also carry warning signs.  Emergency services will readily identify the substances which are being carried and will know how to cope with an incident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to accept that an inspector from the Department would need the Minister's consent before he could attend before the advisory council, can we also take it that the Minister would not prevent the advisory council inviting in experts in the field of petrochemicals and so on without necessarily having to seek consent?</P>

      <P>Detailed information about this Bill has <Col N="1276" /> been set out in the explanatory memorandum.  In the circumstances I propose to confine my statement to the Seanad to a broad outline of the general intentions of the measure.</P>
      <P>In general, the Bill is intended to validate changes made, in anticipation of legislation, in the housing grants, subsidies and loans provided for in the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1970.  Included in the Bill are provisions which will enable such changes to be made in future by statutory regulations rather than by special legislation on each occasion.  The Bill will also strengthen the statutory controls over the prices of new private houses and flats.  It will introduce an optional arrangement for pre-sale structural works to local authority houses and will enable certain land now vested in the Minister for Health to be transferred, principally for housing purposes. The Bill will enable the Minister for the Environment to direct a housing authority to sell, or not to sell, houses of a specified class.  The purpose here is to ensure that houses specially designed and constructed for the accommodation of categories such as elderly persons or physically or mentally handicapped persons will not be lost to the local authorities' housing stock.  At the same time, changes are being made also in the Building Societies Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>Senators may be aware that the administration of the new house grant scheme was delegated on a trial basis to Meath County Council in May 1973.  In Counties Longford and Westmeath the schemes of grants for reconstruction work and the installation of private water and sewerage facilities in individual houses were also devolved to the county councils in the following August.  These experiments in devolution ended when the new grants schemes for new houses and house improvements were introduced in July and November 1977, respectively, in order to ensure consistency in operation and to avoid duplication of administration.</P>
      <P>Section 2 will enable similar exercises in the devolution of the administration of housing grant schemes to be made in the future if the circumstances so warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 will allow me to make a grant towards the administrative and <Col N="1277" /> general expenses of an approved body which represents, or promotes the formation of, co-operative housing groups or voluntary associations.  I would like to see this form of activity expanding.  The success of co-operative housing depends largely on the dedication and initiative of the groups or associations involved.  One body who has been to the forefront in this regard are the National Association of Building Co-operatives who were established in 1970.  The Government are anxious that this association be given every encouragement and have approved a grant towards their administrative and general expenses in 1979.</P>
    <P>The grant provisions of the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1970, are inflexible in that the amounts of grants payable and the detailed qualifying conditions are specified by the Acts, so that changes which were found to be desirable from time to time in the grant schemes required amending legislation.  To meet this situation, sections 4 to 6 of the Bill will confer a broad general power on the Minister or a housing authority to pay a grant for specified purposes, subject to such regulations as may be made.  It is intended that the proposed regulatory powers will be broadly in line with similar provisions in the 1966 to 1970 Acts and the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, but modified to take account of changes made since 1972 in anticipation of amending legislation.  Future changes in grant schemes can be effected by regulations under these sections.  In accordance with section 5 of the 1966 Act, every regulation made under the Bill will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and it may be annulled by resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides a statutory basis for new house grants payable by the Minister.  Subsection (2) outlines the aspects of a grant scheme which may be incorporated in regulations and varied subsequently.  Subsection (3) enables the Minister to lay down technical standards. Subsection (4) provides for certain cases of hardship.  Between July 1977, when the £1,000 new house grant scheme for first-time owner-occupiers <Col N="1278" /> was introduced, and the end of May 1979, 18,557 grants were approved and 10,860 grants paid.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with house improvement grants payable by the Minister and follows the same approach as section 4. It will enable us to get away from a legislative code containing separate detailed provisions relating to ordinary reconstruction grants, further grants, essential repair grants, improvement grants payable to housing authorities, water and sewerage grants, and so on.  In the Bill, I have described a wide range of grants as house improvement grants and my aim is to simplify still further this grant scheme in the future.  Incidentally, section 5 (1) will enable the Minister to pay a grant to a housing authority for improvement works to their rented houses; this replaces section 24 of the 1966 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will enable a housing authority to pay a grant to a person providing a new house and to pay a grant or make other assistance to a person carrying out improvement works to a house, subject to such regulations as may be made.  The Minister may also contribute to the expenses incurred by a housing authority in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 6, when taken with section 22, validates the payment of grants by the authorities and the making of contributions by the Minister since 1 February 1972 in respect of improvement works to houses used for the accomodation of physically disabled persons.  This worthwhile scheme was extended to include accomodation for severely mentally handicapped persons from 1 July 1975 and I increased the amounts of financial assistance substantially from 1 November 1977.  Apart from that special scheme, and certain transitional cases, grants or supplementary housing grants have not been generally payable by housing authorities since 1977.  Section 6 is, therefore, mainly an enabling provision to cater for any schemes which might be considered appropriate in the future.</P>
    <P>Another important scheme provided for in the Bill is the making of grants to approved bodies providing housing and caretaker accommodation for elderly persons.  In April 1978 I announced <Col N="1279" /> details of a package of financial assistance for these cases, comprising grants, loans and annual subsidies. These financial aids were improved with effect from 1 February 1979.  Section 7 will empower the Minister to pay grants to bodies approved under the scheme, subject to such regulations as may be made.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with house improvement loans and replaces section 40 of the 1966 Act and section 4 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962.  It will enable a housing authority to make a secured or an unsecured loan to a person carrying out improvement works to a house, subject to such regulations as may be made.  The maximum unsecured loan, which is being increased from £200 to £600, can be varied by regulations in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will authorise the Minister to pay subsidy to housing authorities towards the annual loan charges incurred by them in providing sites for private housing, subject to such regulations as may be made.  The section largely replaces a corresponding provision in section 44 of the 1966 Act, but it is less restrictive as regards the amount of the subsidy.  I have taken steps to increase the supply of serviced land available by increasing substantially the allocation for sanitary services this year and, in August 1978, I asked local authorities to consider the development of part of their land reserves with a view to making sites available for private housing, particularly as an incentive to tenants or prospective tenants of their houses to secure their own accommodation.  To stimulate this activity, I increased the site subsidy available.  I regard this scheme as an important element in our efforts to curb increases in house prices.</P>
    <P>Subsections (1) and (7) of section 10 validate the subsidy system, which applied in the period from 1 April 1973 to 31 December 1976, under which most of the loss on local authority housing provided for letting was transferred on a phased basis to the Exchequer.  Up to 31 March 1973 the payment of housing subsidy to local authorities was governed by section 44 of the 1966 Act, which is being repealed.  Since 1 January <Col N="1280" /> 1977 the loan charges incurred by housing authorities on the provision of houses for letting are generally met in full by the Exchequer.  Section 10 (2) provides for the payment of subsidy in accordance with the arrangements in operation since then, subject to such regulations as may be made.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 (5), subsidy payments can be made either to the housing authority or directly to the agency from which the loans were obtained.  In the case of moneys borrowed from the Commissioners of Public Works, subsection (6) will allow subsidy to be effected by writing off moneys owed to the commissioners by housing authorities. This would result in savings in administrative costs, but, unfortunately, it is not feasible to introduce this change just yet.  When the change is made, it is intended that the amount written off should be clearly identifiable in the Estimates and in the Appropriation Accounts for my Department and that the Minister should be answerable in the Dáil for the sum involved.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill will provide a statutory basis for the low-rise mortgage scheme, which was introduced on 22 November 1976.  Earlier this year I modified the scheme so that certain two-person families, comprising one parent and one child, can qualify.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides statutory authority for the payment by the Minister of an interest subsidy from 1 June 1977 on certain house purchase loans made by a building society and guaranteed by a housing authority under section 42 of the 1966 Act.  The loans were made between 1969 and 1972 to householders, mainly in the Donaghmede, Finglas, Kilbarrack, Kimmage and Tallaght areas of Dublin who qualified for the normal local authority house purchase loan at a fixed interest rate of 9 per cent.  The societies charged their normal variable mortgage rates. Section 12 will enable the Minister to subsidise the mortgage interest rates, so that in effect a flat 9 per cent is payable.</P>
    <P>Section 106 of the 1966 Act requires a housing authority to put each of their rented houses into good structural condition before selling it to the tenant.  In order to speed up the arrangements for <Col N="1281" /> purchase, a new optional procedure is proposed in section 13 whereby the authority and the tenant can agree on the nature, extent and cost of the works necessary to put the house into good structural condition, and the tenant may, within a specified period, carry out the works directly or arrange to have them carried out.  The authority would pay the tenant the agreed cost of the works when they have been satisfactorily completed. In the absence of an agreement, the normal arrangement whereby the works are carried out by the housing authority will apply.  The section also provides for statutory rights of appeal to the Minister under both arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 14 extends the general power in section 5 of the 1966 Act to make regulations by enabling them to be applied either generally or to specified classes of areas, houses, loans, persons, works or other matters.</P>
    <P>Section 15 validates rates relief given before 1 January 1978 arising from the introduction of improvement grants in 1972 and 1975, respectively, in respect of houses occupied by physically disabled and severely mentally handicapped persons and provides for rates relief consequent on the restriction of new house grants between January 1976 and 6 July 1977.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that a housing authority may exercise a discretion as to whether or not they should obtain a report from a medical officer of health of the local health board when determining the order of priority to be followed in all letting of houses in accordance with their approved scheme of letting priorities or only in cases where priority is claimed by an applicant on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>At present, a housing authority have power to decide under section 90 of the 1966 Act about the sale of any of their houses.  I want to ensure, however, that special purpose-built houses which would normally be unsuitable for family use&mdash;for example, elderly persons' houses&mdash;are not lost from the rented local authority housing stock.  On the other hand, I feel that most local authority tenants should be given the opportunity of purchasing their houses. Towards this end, section 17 enables the Minister to direct an authority to offer <Col N="1282" /> for sale, or not to sell, as the case may be, houses of specified classes.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 18 are rather complex and I want to explain them in some detail.  There is an obvious need for controls on the prices of new houses.  This view is shared by the main political parties and, indeed, by many builders.  I want to emphasise, however, that I do not envisage that whatever form of house price control is implemented following the enactment of the Bill will remain unaltered indefinitely. A flexible approach must be adopted and controls adjusted, in consultation with interested bodies, to take account of changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 18 replaces section 35 (2) of the 1966 Act, under which the system of certifying reasonable value in respect of the prices of new houses and flats has operated up to now.  It is generally agreed that the existing provisions do not provide an adequate statutory framework for the control of house prices.  Under them, the Minister simply refused a grant for a house where the consideration being charged was greater than what was, in his opinion, reasonable value for the house.  I have become aware of abuses and circumvention of the CRV system and I feel it is incumbent on me to take action to stop these malpractices, particularly to safeguard the position of conscientious builders who are prepared to comply with the spirit and the letter of the law. These abuses have been mentioned by public representatives in the media and in complaints made to my Department by aggrieved house purchasers.  The controls which I propose to introduce under section 18 of the Bill were welcomed by practically all the Deputies who spoke when the Bill was before the Dáil.  I am sure that they will commend themselves also to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Section 18 has two main purposes&mdash; first, to empower the Minister to prohibit lending agencies from advancing loans for the purchase of new houses unless a CRV is obtained for each house; and secondly, to oblige builders who have got CRVs to abide by the terms of the certificate and to enable the Minister to take effective action against those who fail to fulfil these obligations.  Subsection <Col N="1283" /> (2) gives effect to the first purpose.  This subsection is an enabling provision which will apply only to such categories of loans and for such periods as the Minister may by regulations provide, having regard principally to trends in house prices, costs and earnings, the availability of mortgage finance and the national housing programme.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the section deals with the second purpose I have mentioned as well as making general provisions relating to the issue of CRVs.  The broad concept of reasonable value, as enshrined in the 1966 Act, is not being changed in any material way nor does the section introduce innovations in the approach to the determination of what constitutes reasonable value.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (4) contains an enabling provision relating to the question of whether or not site costs are reasonable. Section 18 (5) provides for an appeal to the Circuit Court against the refusal of a CRV.  This is the first time that provision has been made for an appeal against such refusals.  I understand that there are practically no delays at Circuit Court level at present.  Officials of my Department will be as informative as possible about reasons for refusals in discussing CRV applications with builders.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) requires a builder to ensure that a house is constructed in accordance with his application for a CRV and that the price charged is in accordance with the terms of the certificate.  It also obliges the purchaser to see that where a CRV has issued and he enjoys the attendant benefits, the price paid by him corresponds with that specified in the certificate.  This should deter any collusion between the builder and the purchaser to circumvent the CRV requirements.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) will allow the Minister to refuse to consider for a period not exceeding five years any application for a CRV from a builder who has got a certificate and has supplied false or misleading information or failed to fulfil the requirement under section 18.  The Minister will have to notify the builder of his intention and the reasons why he intends to take the action.  The builder will then have an opportunity of making <Col N="1284" /> representations in the matter and he also has a right of appeal to the High Court against the Minister's decision.  This should prove an effective deterrent against abuses of the CRV system and I envisage that the power will be invoked only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 18 should provide an effective statutory framework for the operation of controls on the prices of new houses and flats which benefit from State funds or which are financed by mortgages from the main leading agencies.  The purpose is to strike a fair balance between the interest of the public authorities, the householder, the builder and lending agencies.</P>
    <P>Section 19 will extend the categories of persons who may take and receive a statutory declaration for the purposes of an application for a grant, loan or subsidy under the Bill.  This will facilitate applicants.</P>
    <P>Section 20 proposes to amend section 30 (2) of the Building Societies Act, 1976, which governs the powers of the Registrar of Building Societies to investigate the affairs of building societies. The point at issue is similar to that for which provision was made in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979.  The section will extend in certain respects the Minister's power to make regulations under section 77 of the 1976 Act in relation to the amounts and purposes of building society loans.  The amendment proposed has been found necessary in the light of experience since the coming into operation of the 1976 Act.  For example, from time to time, it is necessary to reconcile the anticipated level of mortgage lending for new houses with the financial needs of the national housing programme.</P>
    <P>Section 21 will allow the Minister for Health to transfer, mainly for housing purposes, about 54 acres of land held by him at Navan Road, Dublin, to Dublin Corporation and the Commissioners of Public Works.  That Minister at present holds the lands in trust under section 21 (3) of the Saint Laurence's Hospital Act, 1943, and amending legislation is necessary to allow the lands to be transferred for other public purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 22 validates the payment of <Col N="1285" /> grants or subsidies made by the Minister or by a housing authority from the date of commencement of the particular grant scheme or subsidy arrangement.</P>
    <P>Section 23, the Schedule to the Bill, repeals those sections of the Housing Act, 1966, and of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, which are superseded by various provisions of the Bill.  In all, 30 sections are being repealed, wholly or in part, and ten sections of the Housing Act, 1970, will be spent when the Bill becomes law.  Section 23 also repeals sections 90 (6) (a) and 98 (5) of the 1966 Act, which allowed a housing authority to require payment to them, generally referred to as a &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo; payment, of part of the profit made on resale by a tenant purchaser of certain houses.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 24 of the Bill relates to the Title, collective citation, construction and commencement.  It provides that different provisions of the Bill can be brought into operation on such day or days as may be fixed by order by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to place on the record that before presenting this Bill to the Seanad or recommending or getting Dáil approval to certain amendments, I had special regard to recommendations made to me by the Construction Industry Federation. The Federation's press notice of 1 June 1979 criticising the Bill contained several inaccurate and misleading statements. I do not wish to repeat all the points which I made in a press rejoinder issued on 1 June.  I want simply to reiterate that, since this Government resumed office, there have been numerous meetings between the CIF, the Minister, the Minister of State, and senior officers of my Department, at which various aspects of the CRV system were discussed.  I informed the Federation, as recently as 23 April last, that as soon as the Bill was published, any observations they might wish to submit in the matter would be carefully considered.  On 25 June I was informed that the Federation did not wish to add to their views as set out in their press notice of 1 June.</P>
    <P>In similar circumstances, the Irish <Col N="1286" /> Building Societies' Association, who are concerned about aspects of section 20 of the Bill, also submitted to me a memorandum setting out in considerable detail why they felt that the section as originally drafted should be changed.  To meet their request for changes, the original section was amended when the Committee Stage of the Bill was before the Dáil to provide that the question of the mortgage rate applicable to building society loans shall not come within the scope of regulations made under section 77 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, as amended by section 20 of this Bill. Other amendments at that stage provide that, where the Minister refuses to grant a certificate of reasonable value, pursuant to subsection (5) (a) of section 18, the applicant will have a right of appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>We have already seen the practical advantage of this Housing Bill.  As from 9.30 this morning an explanatory memorandum and application forms are available to the public about the new imaginative scheme of house improvement grants to reduce dependence on oil.  I have arranged that copies of these forms will be available today to Senators and Deputies.  Heretofore this change should strictly have been effected by a new Bill but this would inevitably lead to undue delays.  The oil situation is serious.  It requires urgent action and we have taken that.</P>
    <P>The Bill was generally welcomed by all parties in Dáil Eireann and I commend it now to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that we get a better type of house and that we will get it built quickly or at least it should be the main purpose of the Bill.  The first difficulty facing young people who are thinking of getting married and who wish to build a house is the purchase of a site.  That can cause many delays.  Then there is the question of planning permission and when they get over that difficulty they have to apply for a loan either through a building society or a local authority. There is a delay there as there is in respect of the £1,000 grant from the Department of the Environment and now we have the CRV system which is <Col N="1287" /> going to cause greater delays.  The Minister has the power by regulation to do something to speed up this.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto before the general election stated that a £1,000 grant would be provided but if one looks at the cost of houses today compared to two or two-and-a-half years ago one realises that figure will have to be substantially increased.  In addition, the amount of loan, despite the fact that it has been increased in the past few months, will have to be increased again as will the income level for loans.</P>
      <P>The figures in respect of housing costs have not yet been channelled into the Department of the Environment.  I am one of those unlucky enough to be a builders' provider.  Since January or early February cement has gone up by 25 per cent.  The retail price of a ton of cement at the moment is £44.50 and this is the main material used in the erection of a house.  I say this for the information of the Minister of State: during last year cement has been in very short supply and it is in shorter supply today than at any time during the year.  I know that is not a matter for the Minister's Department but they should interest themselves to see that supplies are made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past few months cement has been imported from many countries and naturally the cost of blocks has increased by 25 per cent.  These increases have come in only since the end of January or early February and they have not been channelled through to the Department of the Environment.  Plaster has increased by 25 per cent and chip-board which is used for dividing rooms has gone up by 20 per cent.  Polythene, roofing felt and damp-proof courses which are used on the floors and walls have gone up by approximately 50 per cent.  Wall insulation which is used in cavity walls to keep out dampness has gone up by 50 per cent.  Glass has gone up by 20 per cent, roofing tiles by 20 per cent, gutters of all types and sewerage fittings have gone up by 40 per cent and copper piping and copper fittings which are used to supply water through the houses have gone up by 50 per cent. Timber has increased by 15 per cent, <Col N="1288" /> paint by 15 per cent and there are increased carriage costs.</P>
    <P>In addition, importers and manufacturers have more applications with the National Prices Commission for further increases and I wonder where the Minister is going to find the money.  It is his obligation to find it to keep the building programme even up to what it was last year despite the fact that it has dropped.  Wages have substantially increased and contractors' charges have increased due to higher premiums and insurance and to costs of oil and diesel oil.  The Dublin local authorities applied to the Department of the Environment for £17,150,000 and they got £10,300,000.  That figure will have to be increased by 50 per cent to give the same number of houses built in Dublin this year as were built in Dublin last year.  That is a very substantial increase and we cannot shut our eyes to it.  If the money is not increased the number of houses being built will continue to drop.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the building societies.  It is a pity that the Minister should touch building societies.  They have served a useful purpose down the years and any interference with them by the Government could be dangerous.  I am sure the Minister of State in his reply will tell us that there is no danger of any interference but I have no doubt that he would not be taking this power unto himself without some type of interference. For instance, some younger people at the moment are channelling their money into a building society with a view to getting a loan to build a house when the time comes.  They might interest themselves in a £15,000, £20,000 or £25,000 house but the Minister could say at any time that the building society cannot lend any more than £15,000. Under this Bill there is nothing to prevent him from doing that.  That would be a very dangerous situation and would discourage other young people from channelling their money into the building societies.  For that reason the Minister should have a serious look at this.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out various proposals and schemes that have already been introduced and in respect of which guidelines and circular letters have been issued to local authorities.  Regrettably, it <Col N="1289" /> has very little in it to meet the present housing needs of a number of local authorities.  As regards improvements and extensions to local authority houses and accommodation for growing families, there is no money available to local authorities to put extensions to those houses which were originally built for a husband and wife but where there is now a large family.  In my area a three-roomed house was built 13 years ago for a man and his wife.  They now have 10 children and there is no way that the local authority can provide money to build extra rooms.  Local authorities have been told that they cannot use council revenue funds to do these jobs nor can they use the capital allocation for this purpose.  That is a pity.  The Minister should provide the money for this type of work.</P>
    <P>Disabled persons also need extensions to their houses, whether for the purpose of getting wheelchairs through the house or for other reasons.  Again, local authorities cannot provide the money. The grant payable to a disabled person is £2,500.  That is the maximum amount of money they can get.  Some 50 per cent of this is paid by the local authority and 50 per cent by the Department.  For instance, if there is a mentally handicapped child in the house or if somebody gets a heart attack, £2,500 will not go far in providing special accommodation for such person.  We are prevented from spending money from our capital allocation or from any other funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland a number of houses built over the years do not have any sanitary services.  On numerous occasions local authorities all over the country have made requests to the Department to make money available for the purpose of putting sewerage and general services into these houses but without success.  The Minister will have to give some thought to this.</P>
    <P>Legislation by regulation as provided in the Bill is not satisfactory or desirable. When the Minister took control of the local authorities' finance he then had tighter control on everything to do with the local authorities.  The limited amount of money that they can collect or that is made available to them by means of <Col N="1290" /> grants from the Department is not sufficient to meet their housing and other needs.  There is also a danger in this Bill that the power to regulate could be taken from this House or from the Dáil.  As far as I know, a regulation cannot be amended; it must be withdrawn.  On reading the Bill one cannot be blamed for thinking that there is the danger of a means test coming in for housing grants for repairs or reconstruction.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will assure us that there will not be any means test, that people, no matter what their income, will get the £1,000 grant and reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>The number of houses being built is declining each year.  In 1976, 7,263 local authority houses were built, in 1977 the number was 6,333 and in 1978 it was 6,073, a drop of 1,190 on the number built in 1976.  I cannot help but wonder what the position will be by the end of 1979.  How much further will it have declined?  What number of houses will be built in the coming year?  I think it will have dropped much more substantially. I hope I am wrong because there is a danger in letting the building industry ease up.  A number of contractors in this city and in rural Ireland fear there is going to be much unemployment in the building industry and naturally none of us wants to see that happen.</P>
    <P>Income limits for small dwelling loans recently increased to £4,000 for a maximum loan of £9,000.  It will be a considerable burden on any man with an income of £4,000 to meet the repayments on this because on a rough calculation the repayments would be in the region of £1,000 per year which is a bit more than a quarter of his income and he will also have to pay some income tax.  He may get some relief on the interest but he will have still to pay some income tax on his £4,000 which leaves him with very little left.  The only answer I can see there for people on that type of income is that their interest charges should be subsidised in some way.  At the moment from the figures available the cost of a house is £16,000 in the rural parts of the country and over £20,000 in the larger towns or cities.  In those circumstances the £1,000 grant is not much and I certainly think that the <Col N="1291" /> Minister should look at this to try to increase substantially this grant and the loans.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people who try to build their own houses.  In their off-peak periods farmers and people who are employed on the land do a lot of this work themselves.  They pour foundations, lay the blocks, they probably employ somebody to help them put on the roof and they complete the inside work and that is a rather long, slow job. Some of these people have been sanctioned a loan of £4,500 and some of them have been sanctioned £7,000.  Now the maximum is £9,000.  The people who were sanctioned £4,500 when that was the maximum amount of loan or the people who were sanctioned £7,000 when it was the maximum amount have applied for an increase but there is no way they can get it.  The Minister should have a look to see how they can be helped because they find themselves now in all sorts of financial difficulties.  They are not able to find sufficient money to complete their house.  There should be some means of helping these people.  I am not saying they should be given the full £9,000 but certainly they should get a portion of it to make sure they get the house completed.  The main purpose of the Bill should be to get as many houses built as possible.</P>
    <P>To deal with the certificate of reasonable value, we all know that there have been a number of complaints about the issuing of approvals in these cases. These delays have held up payments of grants and the sale of houses.  I think there will have to be some type of limit introduced on this, say, 21 or 30 days, but certainly no longer than 30 days.  It is ridiculous that people should be held up for grants.  It is unfair to the contractor, to the purchaser and it is unfair generally.  Something has to be done about the delay in issuing approvals.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the CRVs and said that people or contractors had a right to appeal to the Circuit Court, but according to the Bill the Minister need not give the reason for refusal of a CRV.  I do not think that is fair.  I think if a contractor or a house purchaser applies for a CRV he should <Col N="1292" /> be told, it should even be put in writing, the reason he was turned down.  There is no point in saying that people have a right to appeal to the Circuit Court.  The Minister says that there is no waiting list in the Circuit Court now.  He may be right&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but if he is it is the first time in my life there was not a waiting list.  We hear various debates on the Department of Justice in the House and there is always a reference to delays in the courts.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is about the letting of local authority houses.  Up to now when the houses were advertised the county manager normally sent the applicants to his chief medical officer.  He or his health inspectors investigated the applicants and he sent back a recommendation to the manager as to who should get the house.  I am sure it works satisfactorily in every county but in reading the Dáil Debates I see that there may be one county that has a complaint about the system. However, I do not think that county should be allowed to make up the mind of the Department of the Environment. This is one area where the local authority must be seen to be fair.  The system works satisfactorily and it should be left as it is.  I doubt if I would be prepared to give the power to the county manager because the MOH has more information available to him with regard to sickness in the house than the county manager.</P>
    <P>I want briefly to make a remark about houses for the elderly.  I happen to be a member of one of these bodies who have built a number of houses for the elderly. We built 17 houses in 1969 and the cost per house to the local St. Vincent de Paul Society was £150 per house.  Under the proposed new scheme we hope to build 11 houses and the cost per house is going to be £2,290.  You can work out inflation how you like; you can work out all your calculations, but the net result of it is that we were much better off under the old scheme than we are under the present one.  Ten years ago we were able to build houses with a local contribution, plus grants, plus all the aids that we got at the time from the Department of Local Government and from the local health authority and from the local <Col N="1293" /> authority.  Our costing was £150 as against £2,290 and I certainly think the Minister will have to have another look at this scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on this note.  We all want to see itinerants housed but none of us wants to have them beside us; I think that is a fair enough statement and most people will agree with it.  There has been no mention at all in this Bill of itinerants.  They are a problem all over the country, in rural Ireland as well as in our big towns and cities, as anyone can see.  The Department of the Environment are generous enough to local authorities; they give them 100 per cent grants.  That does not mean much now, with the change of the rating system, but one suggestion that would help the local authorities would be if they build houses for itinerants that that amount of money should not be taken out of their allocation. That would not be a great gesture on the part of the Department of the Environment who are very loud at times about helping these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech and the Bill.  It is a very comprehensive and rather intricate piece of legislation and it takes a bit of grasping.  I would like briefly to ask a couple of questions in order to enlighten myself.  Section 18 is a very intricate section and I agree with what the Minister has said.  The principal aim is to try to keep down the price of houses and that is a community ideal which we all welcome, but it seems that some difficulties are emerging.  First of all, the Minister, in the Dáil, agreed to an amendment allowing for an appeal to the court against refusal to provide a certificate of reasonable value.  As far as I understand it, the Minister does not give the reasons and the question I would put to the Minister, practically speaking, for his reply at this stage or at a later stage, is how can the court deal with it if the information is not available?  In other words, what is the court going to decide in relation to an appeal?  On what grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question that arises relates mainly to small developers.  How is a developer to know how much he should pay for land?  This is very important and I have had some correspondence about <Col N="1294" /> it.  If a developer is going to be refused a certificate of reasonable value that refusal may be based on the price of the house, or of the houses, or may be based on the price of the land, but the builder cannot build on the land unless he buys it and the Minister should provide some means whereby a developer would be able to calculate how much he should pay for the land and where he would have to stop.  Otherwise I can foresee here a slowing down of the whole business of house building, which is something we do not want and I am sure the Minister does not want.</P>
    <P>I welcome the memorandum which has been available since this morning and I would like to raise one or two points in connection with it.  I am sure the Minister knows that solid fuel burners, can, in some circumstances, be dangerous.  Even the old type of solid fuel anthracite burner that was in use here until oil became popular could go out of order in the sense that you could not stop the coal from burning, in the way you can switch off a central heating system.  It is possible that there may be dangers here to which the Minister should draw attention in the data that has been circulated.  For example, I understand that if the central heating pipes are indirect there is a danger that if the circulation of the water is dependent on electrical pumps and if the power is cut off and the fuel does not stop burning you can have problems.  It strikes me, first of all, reading what has been in the papers over the past week or so, and also reading through the memo, that there may be quite widespread demand for the very generous grants which the Minister is offering, because the whole question of energy is a topical one; everybody is talking about it.  In those circumstances you may have quite literally many, many thousands of applications for grants.  It is doubtful that there will be available a sufficient number of competent people to do this kind of work.  You could have a sort of build-up of the number of people getting in touch with small builders, getting in touch with plumbers, here, there and everywhere.  The Minister should be alert to the dangers of inadequate work being done, leading to more serious dangers, <Col N="1295" /> dangers of explosions, and so on, in houses.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he consider house inspection, or the provision of some kind of certificate.  I know it is not reasonable to require people to have an architect's certificate in order to obtain a grant, but if it is not practicable for the Minister to have the local authority inspect the work &mdash; and it does not seem to be practicable if you get 40,000 or 50,000 applications &mdash; at least there is a need for more care with solid fuel burners because they are not the same as oil or gas burners.  One of the responsibilities of the Minister would be to ensure that the work is done competently by competent people.  It would be a tragedy if there were dangers involved in providing grants for such fires and I commend the Minister to look into this situation.</P>

      <P>We are here today dealing with very important legislation in connection with housing.  For a substantial number of Oireachtas Members and local authority members housing is a priority responsibility.  This is quite understandable as housing is such an elementary human requirement, following food and clothing.</P>
      <P>The proposals before us will be more fully debated on Committee Stage, when each section can be fully examined.  We are all conscious of the changing trends in society.  Earlier marriage and earlier demand for housing have thrown tremendous responsibility demands and challenges on to the Minister and the housing authorities.  The community today falls back mainly on the three bases for the provision of housing &mdash; private development, local authority housing development and voluntary co-operative development.  All three are making and will, of course, continue to make, a major contribution in meeting the needs of an expanding community, demanding housing at a substantially earlier age than heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, the challenge of providing adequate reasonable housing is a very formidable one and has been for a considerable time.  I am sure it is <Col N="1296" /> well known to the Minister, as it is known to every housing authority, that the list of applications for rehousing by local authorities is growing at a frightening rate.  This must be related to two factors &mdash; and Senator Brugha has mentioned one &mdash; not only the price, but the difficulty of getting suitable and adequate building land facing the private individual, the private developer and the housing authority.  This must be the chief basis on which the Minister and the housing authorities must plan an adequate housing policy.  As of now, having regard to inflated land prices, with such a variety of frightening prices for sites, ranging from £20,000 down to £3,000 or £4,000, people with average Irish wages are scarcely in a position to compete in that type of market.  Therefore, with housing being such an elementary requirement, the responsibility falls jointly on the Minister and on the housing authorities to develop a comprehensive plan to provide an adequate area of building land.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in this country that there is more than adequate land to satisfy our housing needs.  I am conscious of the difficulties, as everybody in this House is, of drafting the necessary legislation to bring into effect a comprehensive scheme of land purchase for housing development at prices that our level of incomes can meet.  This is a fundamental requirement that the Minister will accept has to be faced in the fight to secure proper housing for all.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge on the Minister that the private sector is a fundamental part of housing policy and, as an inducement, half the £1,000 grant should, as heretofore, be paid when the roof is put on the house, the balance to be paid when the person occupies the house. This should not involve any great change.  It would make no change in the Government's financial contribution for private housing grants.  It would be a tremendous help and incentive to persons in the private building sector, especially wage and salary earners.</P>
    <P>The other important aspect in dealing with private housing is the loans structure. I would agree with Senator Reynolds &mdash; and I am sure the Minister is aware of this from his knowledge of <Col N="1297" /> local authority housing &mdash; with the present level of wages and salaries, taking current negotiations into account, where total earnings are taken into account by local authorities in the granting of loans, there is, despite the recent increase of £500, an urgent need to raise the limit to at least £4,500, otherwise the number of qualifying applicants will decline substantially. I am seeking not to have the £9,000 loan increased, but the qualifying ceiling.  Repayments on the £9,000 loan will continue to have a fairly substantial impact on the incomes of the numerous applicants.</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to develop a comprehensive building programme in all three sectors &mdash; private, public authorities and voluntary bodies &mdash; in order to build the maximum number of new dwellings, the Minister and the local authorities, jointly, should have a comprehensive review of all existing houses.  This is an area where there has been considerable neglect over the past number of years. Every experienced member of a local authority here who is conversant with the operation of essential repair grants and handicapped persons grants, will realise that the limitation of these grants has contributed to a substantial number of dewellings becoming uninhabitable, and being condemned.  More liberal regulations and extra finance could have salvaged such dwellings for many future years.</P>
    <P>The existing essential repairs grant is governed by regulations that mean it would keep a house together for the lifetime of the resident, which is important for the resident concerned, but given present housing needs, to have included possibly a toilet and bathroom at the time the essential repairs were carried out could have salvaged that dwelling for many years to come.  These are points which we will go into with the Minister in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the handicapped persons grant.  It is well known to local authority members in this House that a substantial number of applicants for the handicapped persons grant are persons who are incapable of carrying out the necessary adjustments and repairs to their houses. In many instances, they have not the <Col N="1298" /> competence, or the initiative, to get contractors to do the work.  I would strongly urge on the Minister that in implementing the essential and desirable handicapped persons grant, local authority housing organisations should be given the power to carry out this work because in many cases the applicant has neither the resources nor the capital to do it.  He struggles on and the house becomes derelict and is condemned, a house that with care and some extra finance and maintenance by the local authority could have been preserved for future families.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is that of the layout of open spaces and play areas.  Today, many people passing through our older housing estates would conclude that housing authorities had recreated slums to a greater or lesser degree.  With adequate land available today, we should give greater consideration to open spaces and play areas.  We are all aware of the vandalism, delinquency, violence and psychiatric and other forms of ill-health prevailing today.  Statistics will show that these occur in the areas with the highest density of population.  Substantial sums are being provided to improve the situation and to eradicate many of these evils.  It would be a fitting gesture if more substantial sums were made available to provide better layouts in local authority housing schemes so that there could be more play grounds and so on.  This more than anything else would contribute to a more law-abiding society.</P>
    <P>The Bill stipulates that through the housing authorities the Minister proposes to sell houses to the tenants.  I think this is superfluous.  As members of local authorities are aware, the authorities in the country have been most intelligent and generous in their approach to tenants' representations in regard to purchase schemes.  However, in the final analysis the decision to purchase remains with the tenant, whether he will purchase or whether he will vest his cottage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to special category houses and he specifically mentioned houses for the elderly.  In my opinion no housing authority could ever consider selling such houses.  It would be <Col N="1299" /> illogical and unrealistic for them to do so.  I never came across any authority which had any disposition to do so and I hope I never will.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will say that in comprehensive legislation like this one would have thought there would have been a focus on the matter of housing itinerants.  Everybody knows that this programme in some areas has met with substantial success and in others with only part success.  We all agree that mistakes have been made and that a new thinking and a new approach will have to be made in the matter.  The full impact of the resettlement of the itinerant community has rested with the housing authorities up to the present.  I suggest that possibly there are very many private housing developments in which one or two itinerant families might be accepted. The Minister should provide for the right to purchase either new or older houses in areas where this would be acceptable to the community for people who have had no housing and no shelter. Acceptability is a real essential in the housing of itinerants as well as the good will and help of the community.</P>
    <P>I hope that on Committee Stage we will have further beneficial discussions with a view to making this really workable legislation in the matter of providing houses for our people.</P>

      <P>As a member of two authorities in County Donegal for 24 years I can claim to have some experience of the housing records of various Governments, particularly as far as my own county is concerned.  I was amused at the crocodile tears which Senator Reynolds shed today when he expressed disappointment in the fall in the number of local authority houses being built in recent years.  Senator Reynolds said that in 1976 over 7,000 houses were built but that in 1977 the number dropped to 6,333 and dropped even further in 1978 to 6,073.  Is Senator Reyolds seriously suggesting that the Fianna Fáil Government which assumed office in July 1977 were responsible for the drop in the number of houses completed in that year, or is he suggesting that Fianna Fáil could be held responsible <Col N="1300" /> for the drop in the number of houses completed the following year, because they had begun before the election?  The allocation for houses was issued in May 1977 and houses completed in 1978 had to have the money provided for them by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Letterkenny Urban Council and next week we hope to allocate 34 houses.  I was present at a meeting in October 1973 when the plans for those houses were approved by the council.  For four years we beseeched the Coalition Minister for Local Government and his Department to sanction those 34 houses.  We failed to do so, and the general election came and we still had no houses.  The Coalition record, as far as Letterkenny is concerned, is that in their four years in government, not one single local authority house was built in the largest town in County Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was discussing the failure of the Coalition Government to build houses particularly in my native county.  I pointed out that in the four years during which the Coalition were in government not one single house was built in Letterkenny, the largest town in County Donegal.  When the new Government were elected, we found that the 1977 allocation for housing which was made in May of that year provided no money whatsoever for us but in 1978 the present Minister provided funds for 34 houses and this year funds for an additional 20 houses on 31 developed sites. I appeal to the Minister to provide extra money for housing because as a result of the failure of the Coalition during those four years we now have a situation where we have 148 applicants for 34 houses.  Many people who are very deserving of houses must wait possibly for years for homes that they are entitled to, because a Coalition Minister was not prepared to provide homes for them over a long number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing record of the Coalition, despite what Senator Reynolds suggested, was disastrous.  Not alone was money not provided for housing, but <Col N="1301" /> local authorities were ordered to stop buying additional land.  Up until a few years ago, we had a pool of land which was bought when land was cheap.  As a result of the order made by the Coalition Government, we could no longer buy extra land for houses.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of discussion about grants today and we also remember that during the lifetime of the Coalition, anyone earning over £2,300 per year could not obtain a grant because the Government of the day believed that anyone earning over £41 per week did not need a grant to build his or her home.  I wonder how many people earning under £41 per week considered themselves in a financial position to build their own homes.  When Fianna Fáil were re-elected, the £1,000 grant for new house purchase or new house building was introduced.  This was a very desirable measure at that time.  Since then, the SDA loans were increased to £9,000 and the improvements grants were increased to £600.</P>
    <P>The new house grants and the improvements grants are not in line with modern costs.  I have often felt that reconstruction or improvement grants should be higher than new house grants so that people would be encouraged to preserve old houses.  If they got a reasonable financial injection more old houses would be improved.  Across the Border some years ago there was no such thing as a reconstruction grant, but the grant there now is in the region of £3,000 and it is resulting in many old houses that otherwise would be allowed to decay being preserved.  The gap between the SDA loan of £9,000 and the present costings of house building is too large.  Young people should be encouraged to provide their own homes, relieving the local authorities and the State of this responsibility.  It is very difficult for young people to buy sites costing in the region of £4,000 to £5,000 even in rural Ireland and to build houses costing in the region of £15,000 on the £9,000 SDA loan.  The low rise mortgage scheme introduced by Deputy Tully, as Minister for Local Government, was a very good thing and was certainly an encouragement to people on the housing list to provide their own <Col N="1302" /> houses.  The Minister should expand this scheme and should increase the subsidy payable to people on the housing list.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister carefully consider the question of guarantors for SDA loans?  In some counties, the local authority insists on only one guarantor but in other countries, including Donegal, applicants for SDA loans have to give two guarantors.  This is completely unnecessary and is in many cases an embarrassment and a hardship to the applicant.  If an applicant were to default in his loan and leave the country the local authority hold the deeds of the house and all they have to do is take possession of it.  Why, then, is there need for guarantors?  People are slow to sign a guarantee because they do not understand the implications.  They mistakenly think they are being saddled with a very heavy responsibility.  Once their names are given to the local authority along with the names of their banks, their financial standing is immediately under scrutiny by the local authority.  This can be a source of embarrassment to guarantors.</P>
    <P>The Donegal county manager at one time introduced a rule that a person could not act as guarantor for more than one or two loans.  In small villages this could have meant that there were no guarantors available.  Under pressure, this rule was changed, but we still have the situation where an applicant for an SDA loan must have two guarantors. The time has come for the Minister to remove the need for guarantors.  It is a disincentive to persons seeking money from the local authority when it should be a priority to encourage as many people as possible to provide their own homes.</P>
    <P>Young people planning to get married may not be in a position to provide their own homes right away and should have facilities provided for them.  The Minister should encourage local authorities to build more flats for newlyweds.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years Army barracks have been opened in all the Border counties. In Donegal they have been opened in Letterkenny and in Lifford.  It has been our experience that several hundred soldiers based in these barracks are on the waiting list for houses. <Col N="1303" /> The need for additional houses in these areas has increased as a result of the Army presence.  The Minister should consider building, or having the NBA build houses for the Army in towns where military barracks have been provided.  To build houses for the Army would not be wholly desirable in that a soldiers' ghetto should not be established, but extra housing should be encouraged in towns where there are Army barracks, with a stipulation that a certain number of those houses should be provided for soldiers.  Housing is certainly one of our more urgent priorities. In most towns and villages there is considerable frustration.  People living in bad, overcrowded conditions cannot visualise themselves getting houses for many years to come because a sufficient number of houses is not being built.  I hope that in areas where the Coalition Government failed to provide houses this Government will give recognition to that fact and will provide extra money to make amends for the past.</P>

      <P>This Bill was first presented by the Minister for the Environment in April of this year.  It is now, three months later, coming before this House.  It was debated in the Dáil on the eve of their recess.  One would have thought that, it being such an important matter, it would have been given much more time than has been allocated to it by the relevant Minister.  Having regard to the time it has taken to get through the Dáil and the changes that have been effected in the Bill there, one must conclude that it might well have got through without many of those considerable changes in it but for the vigilance applied to it in the Dáil.  It is regrettable, it being such an important measure, that in this House also it comes before us on the eve of a recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an important Bill, as is any Bill relating to housing.  The importance can be gauged from a number of aspects. The Government are faced with a problem in regard to housing which is largely of their own making.  They have adopted a certain philosophy and attitude towards housing in the public sector which I do not agree with and which <Col N="1304" /> is creating more problems than it is solving.</P>
    <P>One must go back to the manifesto produced on the eve of the General Election of 1977 to see where this problem first arose.  In that manifesto Fianna Fáil gave a specific undertaking that they would increase local authority house purchase income limits and maximum loan limits to realistic levels and that they would review the whole system of housing finance.  I now invite Fianna Fáil to adopt realistic levels in relation to both income and loan limits and to undertake a review of the whole system of housing finance.  While this Bill contains certain commendable amendments to our existing housing legislation, there is still quite a lot which it has not yet tackled.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of the Government is at fault in regard to the problems which exists in the housing area.  When one does a few sums in regard to the number of local authority houses that have been started and completed in recent years, there is no doubt that the capital allocation given for local authority housing in the past two years does not add up to a very pleasant outlook for the future of local authority housing.  In regard to housing starts, figures supplied by the Minister in response to a parliamentary question show that for 1978 the figure is 5,805, which is the lowest figure since 1971.  Indeed, during the years 1976 and 1977 it exceeded the 7,000 figure and it now falls below the 6,000 level mark. That fewer local authority houses have been started than hitherto means that fewer will be completed.  The figures supplied in the White Paper as regards houses completed over the past four or five years indicate this trend.  The number of local authority housing completions in 1978 was estimated to reach 6,000.</P>
    <P>This compared with a figure of something in excess of 8,000 and 7,000 for the previous couple of years.  One can get some indication why this has happened and where it will lead not only from the manifesto but also from the White Paper and the Green Paper which the present Government issued after they took office in the summer of 1977.  There was a rather extraordinary <Col N="1305" /> statement under the heading of housing in the Programme for National Development.  It said on page 70:</P>
    <P>... there is a general lessening in the degree of urgency of local authority housing needs, even though there has been little or no falling off in general demand and significant arrears still exist in some areas.</P>
    <P>This is a rather contradictory statement. That statement says that there is no great reduction in demand and that there are still substantial arrears of housing. That would have led me to a different conclusion than that reached in the White Paper, which said that there was a general lessening in the degree of urgency of local authority housing needs.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for local authority housing for 1979 was given by the Minister as being approximately 6 per cent over the figure for 1978.  In response to a question in the Dáil the Minister said that local authority housing completions overall would be of the same order as in 1978 when over 6,000 houses were completed.  When one looks at all these figures one realises that we started off with a low rate of housing starts in the local authority sphere, a low rate of housing completions afterwards, and that the capital allocation for 1979 was only 6 per cent above the figure for 1978.  Bearing in mind those figures, when one sees that there has been an extraordinary increase in the cost of housing one must conclude that the allocation is not at all adequate for the needs.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to look at the figures presently applied to housing grants, and even reconstruction or house improvement grants, to see how they compare percentage-wise with the overall cost of housing now and ten years ago.  Ten years ago one could build a detached bungalow above the minimum specifications for £3,500.  The new house grants obtainable could amount to £600, which would represent approximately 20 per cent of the total cost of the house.  In other words, 20 per cent of the total cost of a new bungalow ten years ago could be obtained in grants.  The £1,000 new house grant, taking into account that a <Col N="1306" /> similar type bungalow can cost today anything ranging from £18,000 to £25,000, works out at 6 per cent of the overall cost of providing a new bungalow.  One immediately sees that the level of grant <i>vis-à-vis</i> the total cost has deteriorated alarmingly, from something in the regions of 20 per cent of the overall cost to the present 6 per cent. There is certainly a need for the Government to have a more realistic look at the level of grant.</P>
    <P>The same sums can be applied in regard to house improvement or reconstruction grants.  The figure now is £600.  The same sum can be applied in regard to house improvements or reconstruction grants.  The figure now is £600.  Adding a room and kitchen to a house can cost anything from £7,000 to £10,000.  When one compares the percentage relationship there with what was applied, say, ten years ago, one sees that again there is a very alarming reduction in the allowance available to a person carrying out house improvement work.  There is not only a need for an increase in the level of grants applicable for new houses and also house improvements, but there is a case for the indexing of such grant levels to the cost of housing from year to year. That should be more or less automatic. When the cost of housing increases the rate of grant should increase accordingly if we are to maintain the same proportion as applied in recent years. There are between 30,000 and 35,000 families awaiting housing.  I do not envisage any reduction in that number in the light of the capital sum allocated and the rate of house completion and house starts in the local authority sphere.</P>
    <P>No later than the next decade we will be faced with a problem which has not confronted us since the foundation of the State, namely, the replacement of the existing stock of local authority houses. Many existing local authority houses were built in the 1920s and 1930s, and are still relatively young houses.  When they move into the 60-year bracket, one has to envisage replacement.  That will be a problem in addition to providing new houses.</P>
    <P>The replacement of existing housing <Col N="1307" /> stock raises a number of questions.  This Bill could have contained measures to improve the situation so that we would have better housing stock available in future.  For instance, derelict sites still exist to an extraordinary extent around this country.  Notwithstanding the cost of housing sites on the fringe of towns, one finds, within towns and urban boundaries a considerable number of derelict sites, in respect of which local authorities have not obtained compulsory purchase orders so as to make them available for local authority housing.  A speeding up of the procedures for compulsory purchase must be encouraged and this may require legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the Planning Act, 1976 if there was failure to erect houses within five years there would be a withering effect in regard to the planning permission.  I had the reservation at that time that five years was too long a period.  With the demands for housing today five years is too long.</P>
    <P>There are some commendable sections in the Bill but even in some of them, I notice a certain reservation on the part of the Minister.  He is unwilling to go as far as one would have liked. Section 2, which contains reference to the devolution of administration of housing grant schemes to local authorities, is merely a continuing of the power that has been there since 1977.  I do not see written into that section any indication of a willingness on the part of the Minister and the Department of the Environment to devolve much more in the future.  Such devolution avoids the delays that take place between local authorities and the Department carrying out separate and duplicated inspections of housing sites, plans and all the problems that go into the administrative procedures involved in creating a new housing scheme.  The duplication would be avoided by more devolution.  I would like to have seen more willingness on the part of the Minister for this to happen than is indicated by his speech and by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is welcome.  It gives an indication of help to co-operative housing groups and voluntary associations.  Unquestionably, much more could be done <Col N="1308" /> in this respect.  How much help is given at present, or has been given in recent years, to co-operative housing groups? This avenue should be explored and utilised more than it has been in the past. Local authorities are notorious for the time it takes them to plan schemes in conjunction with the Department.  If they are given authority for a housing scheme of 60 houses, they can do a certain amount of the planning procedures themselves.  There are still lengthy delays involved, and the more encouragement we give co-operative housing groups the better.</P>
    <P>Land banks have always presented problems for local authorities.  It is good that subsidies can be provided under this legislation.  County managers, and too many local authorities, have not been willing to project present and future housing needs within their own jurisdiction sufficiently to encourage local authority members to take the plunge and buy land in anticipation of future requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the low-rise mortgage scheme.  While the low-rise mortgage scheme has worked satisfactorily to date, it needs a review in regard to the restrictions applied.  From the outset I felt there were too many restrictions to what was a commendable mortgage scheme, for example the length of time an applicant has to be on the waiting list, and also the provision in respect of children.  We should review these restrictions.</P>
    <P>My sympathy goes out to childless families because they suffer psychologically from these restrictions.  To prohibit childless families being seriously considered under these schemes is unjustifiable. The new procedure under the low-rise mortgage scheme where instalments rise on an incremental basis for the first ten years is a welcome new measure.  I would strongly urge the Minister to take this matter up with building societies and other lending agencies to see if they would follow in line with this local authority measure.  It is very helpful.  It means that more people are able to take local authority houses on a purchase scheme from the initial allocation date.  This is what we all want to see.  A scheme whereby a bigger <Col N="1309" /> local authority housing loan would be given commensurate with the amount of savings the applicant was able to show would be an incentive to people to save from an earlier age.  Young people generally do not see any great value in saving money.  They do not see the intrinsic national benefit in it.</P>
    <P>It has always amazed me that there is always a wide divergence between the capital allocation for housing requested by local authorities and the amount allocated. The most recent figures available to me show in some instances the amount allocated by the Department was only about 60 or 65 per cent of the amount requested.  I should like the Minister to give a reason for this.  I should have thought local authorities are responsible enough to propose a figure which can stand on the basis of their projections as regards their housing needs for the future, and the amount of work they can do within the coming 12 months.  That they always received only 60 or 75 per cent, on average, of what they sought seems strange.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say at this stage. We will be able to debate a few other points on sections of the Bill.  This is a worthy Bill.  It does not contain as many incentives as I would have liked.  I have tried to indicate the incentives there could be.  The philosophy and attitude of the Government in regard to housing will have to change.  It is well to provide facilities for housing in the higher price bracket, but our housing problems arise mostly where persons have neither the means nor the ability to provide their own housing.  That generally arises in the local authority sphere.  I hope the Government will review the requirements of local authority housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It gives housing grants and assists persons to get houses and to repair and improve houses.  It also provides incentives and thereby assists the building trade and the provision of jobs so sorely needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points I would like the Minister to interpret.  The important change wrought by this Bill is that it allows grants to be varied by regulation, without the necessity for legislation.  This will make for speed and efficiency.  The <Col N="1310" /> Bill provides measures to keep down the cost of land.  Many years ago local authorities were asked to buy as much land in their area for development as possible.  There is one question I would like to ask in connection with the interest repayable to local authorities.  As far as I know, the Government are responsible for recouping to local authorities interest paid on moneys borrowed to purchase land.  Is the repayment of this interest made within the financial year or only when building starts on the lands so purchased?  If it is withheld to the stage of building, it may encourage local authorities to speed development.  On the other hand, if a local authority have to provide not only the money for purchase of land but for servicing that purchase, the powers of the local authority may be weakened.  I would like the Minister's opinion on that.</P>
    <P>On the question of the CRV, say there is a case where a person is about to purchase a house, and, using an arbitrary figure, the builder says that house will cost £17,000, and produces the CRV for £16,000 and that CRV is 12 months old, in which case there has been a 12 months' lapse in which there has been inflation, can the person concerned still get the grant, and pay the builder £1,000 more than the figure on the CRV?</P>
    <P>In some areas there is a shortage of land for local authority housing.  Cork city is one of those areas.  A survey carried out in Cork city found that there is an amount of accommodation over business premises which for a small expenditure could provide flat accommodation which would suit newly-married couples, or maybe couples whose families have grown up and gone away, thus releasing houses for larger families.  One would have to persuade the landlord to spend money on these premises.  It probably would not be a very good financial investment, but under this Bill is it possible for an owner of such premises to get a grant to do such work?  Is there any means test in relation to that?  Section 5 (2) (e) says:</P>
    <P>... requirements in relation to the financial and family circumstances of the person to whom the grant is paid, ...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> If there is a means test, there would not be much chance of persuading a company who owned a commercial building that it would be a good financial investment to provide living accommodation in that building for persons.  There is one other point on the question of grants. There is the right of housing authorities to impose conditions of their own.  I would like the Minister to illustrate what that means.  I welcome the Bill and I am sure everybody here could give reasons why there should be more money for everybody under the Bill, but in present circumstances everybody is seeking to increase his income.  Small groups are seeking to increase their incomes, irrespective of how they affect the economy.  Everybody is seeking to have taxation reduced.  Everybody would like the Government to spend more money for him.  How you relate all that, I do not know.  We have to accept, in a Bill such as this, that the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Finance has to decide how much money he can give and we have to accept it, although we would like a lot more.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators, I regret that this Bill comes before the House at the end of this parliamentary session.  It was ordered for today, with six other Bills, and we know the Dáil is adjourning this evening for the summer recess.  This does not make us optimistic that amendments would be acceptable to the Minister because he would have no other House to go back to until October. It is a feature of this time of the year that there are a number of Bills, normally fairly technical Bills, that the Government try to get through before both Houses adjourn.  I regret that this Bill is one of them because it is a Bill about housing, and the housing crisis is one of the greatest political problems and challenges before all of us in Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it is called the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979, the Minister stated in his opening speech that a large part of the Bill was intended to validate changes which are already made in anticipation of this legislation in the housing grants, subsidies and loans which are provided under the Housing <Col N="1312" /> Acts of 1966 to 1970.  Then there is the controversial attempt to control private house prices through tightening up the CRV system under section 18 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The initial anticipation that any of us must have in seeing a Bill called the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill coming before the House is somewhat dampened by the minor aspects of the problem the Bill proposes to deal with. We, in this House, must begin by trying to assess the Government's housing strategy in the light of the problem as we see it and can identify it.  On both sides of the House it has become very clear that we are aware of the dimensions of the problem and that this Bill will do very little to meet the basic urgency and dimension of the housing crisis that exists in Dublin city, county and elsewhere in Ireland.  All we can hope is that the expression and strength of view held by various Senators will impress itself upon the Minister and that at the start of the next parliamentary session we will have a genuine attempt to begin to cope with this problem and to introduce the kinds of reforms that are going to be necessary if we are not to have a terrible social upheaval and a great outcry and disillusionment from homeless people, from young people who cannot get houses, from people living in substandard and inadequate housing conditions and from families waiting for years on the local authority housing list.</P>
    <P>We have to begin by looking at and assessing the housing strategy of the Government.  This is not easy because we are not faced with a clear and coherent overall strategy, rather we can look at certain aspects of it which have become very plain.  There is a clear shift from local authority housing to reliance on the private sector.  This was part of the overall approach of the Government. It was evident in the manifesto and has been carried through to the White and Green Papers.  This reliance on the private sector was to provide a stimulus and to ensure that more houses would be built and would be available.  Unfortunately, this has come unstuck in many regards.  First, it would appear the private sector has gone up market and there are fewer ordinary houses being built.  There is more of a tendency to <Col N="1313" /> concentrate on the upper end of the market, on luxury houses which are now selling at increasingly high prices ranging from £40,000 to £100,000 and in some cases in excess of £100,000.  There has been a decline, even in the private sector, in the building of ordinary houses, even though the cost of ordinary houses has also risen at a phenomenal rate.</P>
    <P>Despite the evident failure by the private sector to do what the Government hoped they would do and provide a resource of housing stock at reasonable prices, the amount of money available to local authorities has declined in real terms to a very serious extent in comparison to the sharp rise in building and site costs.  The result has been a severe and persistent decline in local authority housing.  For example, the number of local authority houses built in 1976 was 7,263; in 1977 it declined to 6,333 and in 1978 it declined to 6,073.  Will it fall below the 6,000 mark in 1979?  The pattern is the same in relation to the numbers of houses started which have also declined and are fewer than in other years in the seventies.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where neither in the private sector, for the reasons I have given, nor in the local authority or public sector, is there the kind of concentration on ensuring a rapid increase in the number of houses available that one would think would be a logical response to the gravity of the situation and to the genuine housing crisis which exists in Ireland at the moment.</P>
    <P>Parallel to that there is the spiralling phenomenon of the rise in house prices. These figures have behind them a weight of social distress and division.  The price of an average house financed by building societies has increased dramatically over the last few years.  The average price in 1976 was £12,113.  For the first quarter of 1979, this had risen to £21,774, an absolutely phenomenal increase in the average price of houses financed by building societies.  The average price of a building society house in the first quarter of 1978 was £17,139.  For the first quarter of 1979 it had gone up to £21,774&mdash;an increase of £4,635 in one year, from March 1978 to March 1979. If we are talking of an increase in the <Col N="1314" /> average price of a house from March 1978 to March 1979, we see how totally inadequate and unresponsive the £1,000 grant for couples buying a new house is. That has not only been absorbed but absorbed almost four times by the rise in the cost of housing.  We should not spend too much time on figures.  They have to be seen in a social and housing context&mdash;in the context of our policy towards ensuring that families will have adequate housing.  That should be a major priority and we should divert sufficient resources to it.</P>
    <P>I have moved from the problem of the focus of the present Government's housing strategy, the focus on the private sector, the failure of the private sector to meet that challenge and the tendency to concentrate on the upper end of the market, on the provision of more luxury houses, the decline both in allocation of money in real terms to local authorities, and the decline in the building and completion of local authority houses and now I would like to turn to another aspect of the problem, that is, the high cost of sites and the necessity for radical reform in the capacity of local authorities to acquire sites.  It has been a fairly widely shared view for a considerable time that the fact that people can make large speculative profits, which are now relatively untaxed, out of sites in urban areas by being cute enough to buy up a run-down or derelict site in anticipation of it being needed for building purposes, is socially undesirable. It is very divisive and the kind of policy which most other countries have rejected for understandable social reasons.</P>
    <P>The Kenny Report in the early seventies tackled part of this problem by recommending the possibility of controlling the prices of sites on the perimeter of cities and towns.  This was an inadequacy of the Kenny Report because it is just as important, and in many instances more important, to control the price of sites in the inner and centre city areas. We need to tackle this problem in a radical and dramatic way because it has now assumed extraordinary proportions.</P>
    <P>The entire land bank of sites available to Dublin Corporation is adequate for 2,000 houses.  These sites are in the possession <Col N="1315" /> of Dublin Corporation.  The number of houses being built is approximately 650 to 670 and Dublin Corporation have now in excess of 8,000 families on the housing list.  Even if the corporation got enough money tomorrow to build on every site available to them, they could not provide houses for even half the families on the housing list.</P>
    <P>That is what I call a housing crisis. That is what all of us who operate as public representatives and who do advisory work in our constituencies hate to have to tell individual families: &ldquo;Yes, we know you have been five years on the housing list.  Did you know that there are 8,000 other families on the list and that if Dublin Corporation took over active control of every site available to them, we still could not meet the needs of half the families on the housing list?&rdquo;  That is the dimension of the crisis.</P>
    <P>Then we see other figures emerging from another source, a survey of the derelict areas in Dublin.  This again shows some phenomenal characteristics because this survey has shown that 9 per cent of the land area in the city of Dublin is derelict.  That is a fairly high percentage and it amounts to something in excess of 2,000 acres.  Apparently a great deal of this derelict land, about 40 per cent, is in unknown ownership. Through neglect or oversight or a lack of adequate policy in relation to housing, we have an inadequate land stock and yet the phenomenon of a large number of derelict sites.  This is because of a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude towards the whole problem.  We are not approaching housing as the most important priority for families in the city of Dublin specifically and in the country generally where the problem is comparable and where others can point to similarly dramatic figures.</P>
    <P>If we concentrate for a moment on the city of Dublin, which is the major local authority area, we see that we tolerate very ugly and despoiling derelict sites in many areas.  Local communities do not know who owns the sites and see them now as breeding places for rats, because they are used informally as dumping grounds.  They are unable to get adequate information about what is planned for these sites and it is clear from this <Col N="1316" /> survey that in about 40 per cent of the cases the corporation themselves do not seem to know who the owners are.  All of this would be dramatically different if we approached the potential housing land in any urban area, either in a city or a small town area, as part of the natural resource, as part of the potential housing stock of that community and if the local authority were in a position to buy the sites at reasonable cost so that they would be available for housing in the future.</P>
    <P>When the subject is raised the tendency is to say that it raises all kinds of constitutional problems relating to the acquisition of property.  Are people not entitled to their full profits?  Must they not be able to make any profits they can if the land is wanted by the local authority?  Unless it can be compulsorily purchased within the narrow confines of the CPO, then is that not the end of it? We have been living with this kind of constitutional shadow for long enough. Either it should be seen that the ownership of private property is not unlimited but is very substantially circumvented by the provisions of the Constitution or else we should have a constitutional referendum.  We should not put before the people the need for land to be available to the local authorities for housing or other amenities.  If it is felt that the constitutional provision relating to private property presents a major problem, then let us put it to the people of Ireland.  I have no doubt at all that the thousands of people without adequate housing at the moment, the thousands of young couples who cannot get a home, the thousands of people who for years have been on the lists of the local authorities would be an overwhelming voice for making any necessary change in the Constitution.  I have some doubts as to whether it requires a constitutional amendment but if so that would be an important issue to put before the people by way of referendum.</P>
    <P>We come to the other ways in which people try to get the money for houses and there was reference to the question of mortgage interest and SDA loans.  I was pleased to hear Senators on the Government side of the House criticising the inadequacy of SDA loans under present <Col N="1317" /> circumstances.  It is important in a matter like housing that there is less political sniping from one side of the House to the other and a greater effort to show the inadequacy of the loan system in present circumstances.  One has to look at the actual figures and how they translate into the reality of workers with families in the country.</P>
    <P>The problem with the SDA loan system as it is operating at the moment is that it is totally inadequate for the current housing needs.  The regulations confine the availability of the loan to a person whose income is in the region of £80 a week and then the amount that can be obtained on the loan is £9,000, necessitating payments in the region of £20 a week.  Any site that a person might try to acquire must now cost between £1,000 and £2,500.  I cannot think of any sites that would be available under £1,000; the price is more likely to be up to the £1,500 mark and the SDA loan will only be paid over when the house is completed.  The person is faced with the cost of the site and it is a most unlikely eventuality that the house could be built for less than £15,000 under present conditions. How is somebody to bridge the gap between the £9,000 and the cost of the house and meet all the other costs such as the cost of acquiring the site in the first place?  We are now seeing a catch 22 situation in regard to the SDA loan system: if you qualify for the loan you cannot find the capital to bridge the gap between the amount of the loan and the cost of getting the house built.  There are people who are getting themselves into very serious debt problems.  They borrow beyond their ability to repay with recurring problems for them and for their families.</P>
    <P>The picture as it is painted is one which requires a radicial appraisal by the whole of our society.  I do not think that the whole question of the provision of housing is one that should be left totally to the Government and then that a Government at any point in time should be blamed solely and <i>in toto</i> for a failure to meet demands.  Housing demands are the hardest demands to meet and form a very substantial portion of the requests and the applications coming through to anybody operating an advice <Col N="1318" /> centre.  What is needed is a better sense of awareness among the public themselves.  It is important for local communities to think in terms of the housing stock for that local community and the need for a minimum standard of housing for every family.  The Government should be able to command that a sufficient proportion of the overall funding is diverted to this particular need.  That is where successive Government have failed to get the message across.  They have, perhaps, glossed over the difficulties and failed to bring home the number of families in grossly substandard housing or in flats.</P>
    <P>Each of us could probably give graphic pictures of the conditions that families live in.  Certainly the state of the private accommodation in which some families live in the Rathmines area is something of which we would be very ashamed if it were written up in the <i>News of the World</i> or some other lurid paper in another country.  Yet that is the reality which we allow to continue. There are families living in overcrowded, damp, substandard, appalling conditions and with no hope.  The real problem is that, as an elected representative hearing these problems or going and seeing people in these conditions, it is very hard to offer them any hope.  It is very hard to know, in what amounts to such an emergency now in the city of Dublin, if you will get an offer of housing within any reasonable time.  This is something that is not sufficiently appreciated by the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I was struck very much by the very widespread reaction to the PAYE marches in Dublin and in other cities around the country in recent months. There was a sort of spontaneous feeling among people that they wanted to go out and march because they believe that the PAYE worker is being victimised and is bearing too great a share of the taxation burden.  They believe that others are being favourably treated and that they are being discriminated against.  So far as a genuine order of social priorities is concerned, it is on the housing question that tens of thousands of Irish people could well get out and march.  Housing is totally inadequate and substandard at the <Col N="1319" /> moment for so many families, yet there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  There is no hope.</P>
    <P>Every time a young couple think they may be getting together enough money to get a house they see another record broken in another town in Ireland. Looking at the papers, particularly the property pages, in the last few months, there has been a kind of sick pleasure taken in the fact that a new record has been broken for the cost of a house in Limerick or Galway or Dublin.  We are up to a six-figure mark.  We need to examine how socially divisive, how unacceptable and how contrary to the spirit of a republic in any real sense those kinds of figures are and the gap they promote between families.  The social issues underlying this should be examined in great detail.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to spend a great deal of time assessing the detailed provisions of this Bill because it is such a limited measure.  It does not begin to take the kind of radical steps that I was talking about.  It will do nothing to increase the land stock available for houses.  It only continues and validates a system of grants and loans which already exists.</P>
    <P>There are one or two interesting and useful things in the Bill.  One of them has been referred to by a number of Senators and relates to specific grants to co-operative housing organisations.  I would appreciate figures from the Minister of how much money has been made available to voluntary co-operative housing organisations, to what extent this is a growing phenomenon in the housing area and to what extent this particular section can be used to increase significantly the housing available.  If there was any way of doing it, I would urge the Minister to try to exercise his influence to prevent the decline in the capacity of local authorities to provide housing and instead to turn the tide and to place them in a position to improve the new housing stock.</P>
    <P>This Bill refers to maintenance grants and grants for restructuring.  We need a great deal more emphasis on the maintenance of existing housing stock. Here again the picture is a very gloomy <Col N="1320" /> one.  There is far too little funding available for maintenance and the conditions under which it is available often favour those who are better off and actually discriminate against those who cannot put together enough money to meet the rest of the cost of any renovation or reconstruction.</P>
    <P>There is one area not specifically mentioned in the Bill where the Minister or the local authorities would make available grants for improvement of houses to cope with the energy crisis, placing a proper emphasis on conservation, insulation and ways in which houses can be improved so that they do not require the same amount of energy to heat them, thus cutting down on present wasteful uses of energy in the home. The Minister recently announced a grant for the building of a fireplace if a house does not already have one or the installation of a boiler to be heated by solid fuel.  This is a step in the right direction. It is the kind of thing that the Government should be promoting.  However, it is limited in its application and it does not highlight, in a way that I believe we should highlight in a Bill of this kind, the need for emphasis on improvement of the existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>Another reason for laying much more emphasis on this aspect would be that it has a very substantial employment element. There are jobs and skills involved in insulating houses and in investigating the whole area of district heating.  These kinds of improvements are necessary for us, faced as we are with the severe energy crisis, and also would be an important way of ensuring that the existing housing stock is maintained and improved.</P>
    <P>This problem is worse in the inner-city areas and in the poorer areas of the outer city, where there is the difficulty of getting any kind of minimum maintenance.  I know there is a particular difficulty at the moment because of the present go-slow.  The lack of incentives for people living in these houses to carry out maintenance themselves has resulted in a substantial wastage and decline of the existing housing stock.  This makes no sense at all, given the overall crisis in providing new sites and new housing stock.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Since the subject is such an important one on which one would like to hear the views of every Member of this House, I regret that the legislation itself is not really focussing on the major problem and is coming to us with a number of other Bills at this tail-end of the year.  I repeat what I said at the outset.  I would welcome a Bill from the Government at the start of a new parliamentary session which would genuinely begin to meet the various kinds of problems which go together to form the major political crisis facing us&mdash;the housing crisis, which is evident all round us today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of the many Senators who have already expressed their opinions on the Bill.  I have much in common with some of the comments that have been made on both sides of the House.  Where social concern is a factor Members on all sides of the House express themselves fully and effectively. On this occasion we have heard many contributions and many suggestions that I trust the Minister will take into consideration in the on-going development of legislation.  The real factor of grave concern is the promotion of better family life by better housing and job opportunities. Having said that and having agreed with the social concern of the Senators on the Opposition benches, the first thing we should do is put the situation in order.  We should bring reality into the housing situation and bring into focus the true problems and the cause of the situation as it is today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the capital programme for 1979 and capital expenditure affecting the building construction industry between 1975 and 1979.  In 1975 there was £115.14 million available for housing; in 1976 it fell to £105.18 million and in 1977 it fell to £99.29 million. These are years of the Labour Minister and the Coalition Government.  There was a reason for this decline which was responsible in no small way for the situation as it is today.  If we look at the figures we see that in 1978 the budget estimate was increased to £142 million from £100 million.  In 1979 it was further advanced to £165.30 million.  So we see the real concern of a Government <Col N="1322" /> in making the necessary finance available to meet the particular crisis.</P>
    <P>We know that in the years of the decline during the Coalition Government, under their Labour Minister, the local authorities were told to stop buying land.  If there is no land available we know the difficulty that could arise in the development of a programme.  It takes at least three to four years from the time land is purchased to the time a development takes place.  So we have a carryover and a legacy of decline from the Labour Minister in the last Government. When we took over in 1977 we found that the building construction industry was wrecked and the unemployment content within that industry was very substantial.</P>
    <P>Considerable strides have been made and the Government have done a substantial service in the development of a forward-looking programme.  I should like to compliment some of the speakers from the Opposition on the selection of reading material because apparently they have studied the Fianna Fáil manifesto in great depth and detail.  I am sure they learned much from this when they examined it against the problems of their own Government during that period.  However, I am sure Senator Robinson will read the report of my speech and in the course of the discussion I hope to give the answer to some of the problems she raised.</P>
    <P>Having explained and put on the record the true facts of the situation, we must move along from there.  I am concerned, as the Minister and the Government are concerned, about the people who require local authority accommodation. Dublin has been mentioned and some erroneous figures have been presented.  I have been a member of the housing committee of Dublin Corporation for nearly 20 years.  I know the problems of society here.  I know the situation with the development of the city and with the increase in population. This increase in population comes from many counties.  Dublin is a complete entity which must be examined on a separate basis because there is not the inflow in other counties that there is in Dublin.  I felt, as indeed did Members of <Col N="1323" /> the Opposition, that enough money was not being made available to meet the development problems of society.  They are ours because of the trends and we must face up to them.</P>
    <P>There is a housing programme and there is a housing shortage, but in every city there is a housing shortage.  That is one of the signs of a living city.  If there was no housing shortage in Dublin we could say that there were other problems.  When we go through the country and find empty houses, we know the reasons.  We see the decline in population and the problems that bring about this situation.  Nevertheless, we should strive to ensure that we eliminate this problem at the earliest possible moment. An effort has been made.  These are the facts of life that we read from the capital programme dealing with the years from 1975 to date.  I hope this trend continues.  If so, we will get somewhere towards the elimination of the problem here.</P>
    <P>There are many other problems.  I agree with Senator Robinson when she speaks about the question of land prices and about some form of control.  The basic factor is the price of the commodity. If somebody indicates that this land will now be used for housing development, it should not mean that there will be an excessive increase in the price of that land.  We must look at this situation in its entirety to see how we can improve it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the certificate of reasonable value, I am not so sure that it has not put up the price of houses.  It is a certificate of reasonable value for whom?  Is it a certificate of reasonable value for the person who wants to buy a house at £12,000 when the builder looks for £14,000 or £15,000?  Very often the builder will look for the last ounce out of the last sod.  He is not concerned about the purchaser who wants reasonable value.  I hope that in time to come we will have another look at this situation and give reasonable value to the person with the capacity to meet a reasonable situation. He has been disregarded in the past. <Col N="1324" /> While the certificate of reasonable value in theory and in practice in many cases has been a success, it has not got to the root of the problem.  If we have no £12,000 houses on the market and if people are going to strive for the upper limit, we will have a serious situation. Once they apply and the house is of reasonable value at that particular figure, it disregards every other factor along the line.  Every builder will try to get the maximum from the certificate of reasonable value.  There has been an amount of connivance and fraud and I hope people who are deceptive in this way will be brought to heel.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated in the course of his speech that he is aware of many of these factors that have caused distress and grievance.  I hope the people responsible for these grievances will be brought to heel and that the unfortunate people who are purchasing their houses will be compensated.  That is the only way to deal with unscrupulous people. Builders as a whole are a responsible group of people operating sometimes under very difficult circumstances. Weather factors, price factors and so on should be taken into consideration together with the employment factor.</P>
    <P>Have the construction industry been fair or reasonable in their approach to the whole problem of the training of personnel to meet a situation where work forces are required that cannot be obtained? They, too, have to look at their own situation and put their own house in order.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we have a part to play.  With the upward and downward trends in the trade cycle we are going to meet periods of prosperity as we are going to meet periods of depression.  There is going to be a lot of money available and there is going to be less money available during certain periods.  We must make adequate provision to meet the circumstances as they develop.  Over the period they have been fluctuating upwards and downwards. Sometimes Governments are not really responsible when there is a cutback but on other occasions they are responsible. From their point of view a positive approach <Col N="1325" /> to the problem is to cut back for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>A number of items have been mentioned in the Minister's Bill &mdash; all very valuable steps.  A forward-thinking Minister will always meet a situation, examine the problem and move forward. Legislation itself is an ongoing process and we are going to have the deficiencies and shortcomings of this Bill amended in future Bills.  Perhaps some of the factors require a trial period to sort out the problems and to ensure that their operation is effective.  I hope that many of the items that have been mentioned by speakers on all sides of the House will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is no solution to place the blame on the present Government or indeed on the previous Government.  We have a collective responsibility here to ensure that our social conscience is reflected in legislation and it is our duty in this House to stimulate the Government into taking the necessary actions.  While there will be political sniping from time to time, this is part and parcel of our set-up. Nevertheless everyone is really concerned about the real problem, namely that a man should have a house to live in, at a reasonable price.  It may mean, as Senator Robinson said, that a radical transformation will have to take place.  If that is the way that the problem has to be solved, we will have to measure up and see how radical we can be within the limits of the law to meet this ever-increasing problem.  The population increase in the city is a problem and there is no doubt that the general trend, if it is not impeded by previous legislation, is that there will be an upward surge in the population in other sectors.  Therefore, the problems of Dublin today are the problems of other sections of the community tomorrow.</P>
    <P>It is important that we take note of the problems of other areas, whether they are areas that are depressed and run-down, or whether they are areas that have the same type of problem as Dublin city.  I am sure when these matters are examined in the future that we can give the same type of sympathy and understanding to the problems of other counties as indeed we give to the capital city <Col N="1326" /> here.  Different counties will have different problems from time to time.  These have to be tackled not on a blanket basis but on the basis of the need that exists in the areas at that particular time.  We want to see everyone with a home, a proper home where family life can develop in the way we would hope it would develop.  The basic factor of a home is indeed most important.</P>
    <P>I must come back to the question that has been neglected, the training of skilled operatives.  I hope that both AnCO, who are doing a substantial job, and the building industry itself will have a new look at this problem.  There are problems within the industry that have brought about other problems.  There may be slow-downs that are not the responsibility or the result of Government action but are the result of action outside Government or indeed Opposition control.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of providing accommodation for the young and the newly-married and assistance to the local authorities to ensure that the aged are effectively looked after, because far too often these people are forgotten because they are unable to fend for themselves.  We have a huge responsibility to these people who have served this nation wisely and well in many ways during the years.  I hope that where additional aid, facilities and moneys are required to make them happy in their present accommodation or in their future accommodation, that all the necessary aids and assistance will be at their disposal. It is sad on some occasions to see well-equipped dwellings provided for the aged and some item of equipment that could be of great assistance, either by way of warning devices or by way of communication with other people in the same building or the same complex, omitted because of cost.  Nothing is too good for the people who have served this nation over the years.  Members on all sides of this House have expressed their concern for the aged and the young people who are about to make their homes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take into consideration the whole question of the cost factor in the provision of accommodation for the people who intend to purchase their own homes.  If section 18 <Col N="1327" /> needs to be amended in the future, the Minister might take into consideration some of the problems that I have mentioned. To me it is a one-sided situation at the moment where the man looks for the maximum amount of profit from a given space.  Maybe in the future we would say that houses of a particular price group should be built in a particular area so as to facilitate people who are anxious and willing to purchase their own homes but have not got the capacity to meet the higher cost.  Who is to get the benefit from the certificate of reasonable value&mdash;the builder or the purchaser?  I would say it should be the purchaser.  As house prices are escalating, it is sad to say that they are moving away from the grasp of the average individual.  I think Members of this House and Members of the other House might even find it difficult to purchase a house in the future judging by the vast escalation of prices.</P>
    <P>I know there are many other problems that I have not touched on, but nevertheless I feel the views that I have expressed are views of concern in relation both to the aged, the young people and the people who wish to purchase.  I hope the Minister takes all these factors into consideration, perhaps not in this legislation but in the future, and that we will have a solution to the problem at the earliest possible moment.  Then we may say that we in this House collectively have made a substantial contribution to the development of housing policy. Whichever Government are in power, if they take note of our pleas and of our considered opinions, many of them based on many years experience, I am sure that they will not go wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in the theory that it is an advantage to the passage of successful legislation that those on the Opposition side of the House, while welcoming the features of the legislation that they will find worth while should, at the same time, not hesitate to criticise aspects of it that fail to measure up to the expectations of the people.  I intend to pursue that course as constructively as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> There are parts of the Bill that I welcome and that are necessary.  The reservations that I hold in regard to it could best be expressed by saying that in general terms I do not accept that it offers hope or prospects of housing to many thousands of people, particularly young couples and those living in unfit and over-crowded conditions.  The people that I refer to can own or become tenants of a house through three separate channels.  They can buy a house, they can build one or they can apply to the local authority provided their income is not greater than £4,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authority housing, being a member of a local authority myself and having a few weeks ago been on a local election canvass, I am acutely conscious of the need and the requirements of many people in relation to housing.  We cannot avoid accepting that local authority houses are not being built in the numbers that are genuinely required. I want to refer to the 1978 programme of Clare County Council. The amount sought and the whole policy of this county council in regard to house-building is done entirely on the basis of need.  In 1978 the application for a housing allocation was for £1.1 million. The amount provided by the Department was just under two-thirds of that figure.  The cost of a local authority housing unit, taking in site costs and so on, in County Clare is £12,700. Therefore, the shortfall represents about 40 housing units, or approximately 40 families in need of housing who will not be housed as early as they would be had the full allocation been granted.  I am referring to the problem solely as I have seen it in my own county.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson spoke of a time-lag of something like five years in relation to the length of time a person remains on the housing list of Dublin Corporation before he is housed.  It is not quite as long in County Clare but it is in the region of three years.  Even that I regard as an unreasonably long period.  Bearing in mind the high proportion of young people in our population, we must recognise that the question of the housing needs of our people is going to be a crucial issue <Col N="1329" /> in the years ahead.  Unless we are prepared now to take the steps necessary to deal with that problem we will face a crisis of frightening proportions.</P>
    <P>Those people whose income exceeds £4,000 a year or approximately £77 per week are not eligible for local authority housing and have either to buy or build a house.  The market conditions at present do not make it realistic for people who are just above that borderline to contemplate either option.  To buy a house in a housing estate in my town would cost upwards of £20,000.  If that full amount had to be borrowed, which of course would not be the case, it would cost something in the region of £60 per week to service it.  Assuming that a person contemplating buying a house costing that much money could from his own resources provide, say, 20 to 25 per cent of the cost, he is still faced with a weekly repayment bill of something in the region of £50.  That on an income from £80 to £100 is not realistic.  Still referring to local conditions, he can build a house provided that he qualifies for the SDA loan which is subject to an income limit of £9,000 and provided he does not have to purchase the site.  If he needs to buy a site and requires a builder to construct the building, there is no way that £9,000 or even £14,000 would be adequate for his needs.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the time has arrived for the Minister and the Government to look very thoroughly at this £9,000 limit.  It should be raised to a minimum of £15,000.  I suggest that the income limit should be raised from £4,000 to £7,000 or £7,500 because there is little point in providing a loan of upwards of £15,000, which is the requirement of a person who is going to build or buy his own house, unless the income limit is also raised.  A person on a lower income will not have the capacity to meet the repayments that the higher loan will require.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the fact that housing costs have doubled in a little over two years.  In County Clare housing costs have risen from an average of £11,000 in early 1977 to something like £20,000 to £22,000 today. The result is that the demand for <Col N="1330" /> local authority housing has increased. The pressure is on local authorities to construct houses.  If they make an application based on need&mdash;as in the case of Clare County Council&mdash;it is wrong of the Department to reduce that allocation. By doing so they are depriving people of houses at a time when they require them.  I do not think sufficient recognition is being given to the reality of the situation that is being posed by the high proportion of young people in our population. We must recognise that.  We must take steps to cater for their housing needs.  If we do not do so there will be a crisis of severe proportions in a few years time.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 3 of the Bill.  That is the section which will enable the Minister to make payments of expenses towards housing co-operatives and voluntary associations promoting housing. I want to ask the Minister if that includes, as I assume it does, for example, the rural housing organisation in Clare and in certain centres in the west?  I hope it does because that organisation in the past four or five years has pursued an ideal that deserves total support from every quarter.</P>
    <P>Their ideals and objectives are to build low-cost houses in rural towns and villages on a non-profit-making basis. Where this has taken place it has the effect of rejuvenating these rural towns and villages.  It is a concept that is worth supporting.  I am conscious that the RHO would benefit and indeed their finished product would benefit if they could be assisted under this section.  I hope that the Minister has that in mind.</P>
    <P>Section 4 covers the £1,000 house grant.  There is no doubt that when this grant was introduced two years ago many people gained the impression that if you were building your house for the first time you were eligible for this £1,000 grant.  The reality for some people has been otherwise.  Many people have found that for one reason or another they have been ruled out as being eligible for this grant.  For example, people found that because of some slight technicality or some rigid interpretation of the regulations, they lost the old grant and did not qualify for the new <Col N="1331" /> one.  Hardship was involved in these cases.  There has been correspondence between myself and the Minister, some of it successful and some not.  I hope that the Minister will avail of this opportunity to see that these people who got caught between two situations and who found that they were not eligible for either grant are helped and that in fairness and justice their problem is looked after.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that steps are being taken to facilitate residents in Finglas and Kilbarrack and other areas in Dublin.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a situation in Shannon which is unique in the sense that the tenants there are tenants of SFADCo houses.  I am not making a political point when I say this, but during the general election these people were given the distinct and clear impression that if they were to purchase these houses they would qualify for the £1,000 grant.  When they attempted to do that the reality was otherwise and they were refused.  If we are to make provision for certain benefits to go to areas that have been mentioned, I would like to ask the Minister to consider that particular situation because the tenancy and the houses in question are unique.</P>
    <P>It is only fair at this point with the escalating cost of housing that we measure the effectiveness of the £1,000 grant. When it came into existence other grants were abolished.  Some of these other grants could be as high as £900 for farm workers and for people in sub-standard houses and in reality the gain there was a mere £100.  There were others who qualified for a State grant of £325 plus a supplementary grant from the local authority.  If you compare the value of these grants, as Senator Markey did earlier, of, say, £700 to £900 when the cost of housing was perhaps half what it is today, it is obvious that the £1,000 grant needs to be revised upwards. As a proportion of the total cost of house building it does not represent what the old grants represented when they were in existence.</P>
    <P>I wonder if section 4 (2) (d) or some <Col N="1332" /> other part of the Bill would provide the Minister with the power to deal with a situation that has arisen in some housing areas.  I am referring to houses that have been occupied for a few years and then sold and restructured &mdash; or even reconstructed by their original owners &mdash;into flats.  There is a planning permission factor involved there but some people succeed in evading it.  This development is causing annoyance to neighbours in those areas.  In addition to the annoyance to the neighbours there is also the fact that it is downgrading their property, or at least the neighbours think so.  Therefore, I ask the Minister if he has power under this Bill to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>I have read the Bill and I have listened to most of the discussion here today and there is one aspect of the Bill which has caused me concern.  That is section 5 (2) (e).  I do not feel that it has been highlighted to the extent necessary. There are very wide implications in that subsection.  It raises very clearly the question of a means test.  I understand the Minister has stated elsewhere that it is not the intention to use that subsection in that way but if that is so why is it included in the Bill?  It reads:</P>
    <P>requirements in relation to the financial and family circumstances of the person to whom the grant is paid,...</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister indicated elsewhere that it was not his intention to apply a means test.  If that was the case, why is it necessary to include that subsection in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I fully support section 9.  It is the section which enables the Minister to subsidise local authorities in the provision of sites for private housing.  The Minister should insist that the local authorities should make these sites available at cost to the people who are building houses, without any inclination, or any intention, or desire on the part of the local authority to make a profit on these sites.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that local housing authorities may, if they so desire, dispense with the county medical officer's report when it comes to the allocation of local authority houses to people on the <Col N="1333" /> housing list.  I would regret to see councils and local authorities dispensing with the county medical officer's report as being an essential part of the letting system of local authority houses.  The system has worked well and, by having the county medical officer's report as the central point, or one of the primary parts of the letting system, you ensure that houses are let on the basis of genuine need.  I would honestly feel that if local authorities were to dispense with the medical officer's report, there would be a certain risk that people would be housed on the basis of whom they knew, rather than on the basis of real and genuine need.  I would strongly urge the Minister, and genuinely suggest to him, that he should withdraw the section.  I would like to see that power or insistence remaining that the county medical officer's report will continue to be a central part of the letting system of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 17 enables the Minister to direct local authorities as to whether they should sell, or not sell, houses under their control.  I am not entirely happy about it.  I believe that it represents a further erosion of the powers of local authorities and it is another step in the sequence of events which has over the years, succeeded in taking away power from local authorities and lodging it in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I come to section 18 and the CRVs.  I have a feeling that I might be ploughing a single furrow because of the views I intend to express on the CRVs and the Minister's proposals in relation to them. I feel that there is a valid reason why the other side of the case should be presented.  The Minister in his speech today said &ldquo;...to empower the Minister to prohibit lending agencies from advancing loans for the purchase of new houses unless a CRV is obtained ...&rdquo;.  That represents sweeping powers.  I know that the objective of the CRV is to control the soaring costs of housing, but in there is an implication that the responsibility for the soaring costs of housing can be left squarely at the door of the builders. It would have been desirable for the Minister to indicate to us, or give us an analysis of, the reasons why housing prices have doubled in the last two years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> The Minister also referred to words like &ldquo;abuses&rdquo; and &ldquo;circumventions&rdquo; and, indeed, gave a compelling reason why the CRV system should be strengthened. If this power to prohibit lending agencies from advancing loans for the purchase of new houses unless a CRV is obtained is applied ruthlessly&mdash;that may be a strong term to use, but assuming that it is&mdash;then I fear one of the effects will be to discourage builders from engaging in the building of houses for resale.  If that happens, and if they are encouraged to direct their building activities to other types of construction, it does mean and will mean that the number of houses available will be correspondingly reduced; it could mean fewer people employed and it could mean less activity in the building industry.</P>
    <P>While there is a compelling reason to strengthen the CRV system, nevertheless, this danger to which I refer exists, and I doubt if it has been given the consideration it deserves.  Again if the CRVs are used, as I say, ruthlessly, where the margin of profit available to a builder is not sufficient, to his mind, to cover the risks involved, again it will be a compelling reason why some, and perhaps even many, will discontinue house building.  If that should be the case, then it imposes a far greater burden on the local authorities, or on other agencies, to provide these houses.</P>
    <P>Some categories of people are ready and obvious targets for a bit of bashing from time to time and the builders are, of course, no exception to this.  People who often engage in that bashing, which is not entirely confined to builders, have always a tendency to look at the top tier of the profession or the group they are discussing, to look at the giants of the trade.  They seldom consider that down along the scale, the middle and lower ranks, there are people for whom that type of criticism or bashing is totally undeserved. Unless the powers the Minister is seeking are very carefully operated&mdash;and I, of course, accept that provision is made for the certificate for exemption&mdash;it will discourage house-building to some degree; there will be a drop in output and, in the end, it could create very serious problems.  I recognise <Col N="1335" /> that this is, perhaps, taking quite an unpopular line but, nevertheless, I am genuinely concerned about the dangers that are there and am worried about these sweeping powers that are involved in this legislation.  I will look for reassurance from the Minister that he is conscious of the fears I have expressed in this regard and that they will be borne in mind if and when the powers that this Bill proposes to bestow on the Minister are being implemented.</P>
    <P>Finally, during the course of the Minister's statement and of other speeches here this afternoon, reference was made to the progress in providing houses for old people, disabled persons and so on, very worthwhile progress, necessary and deserved, and even more so in the years ahead of us. There is, however, one category of people that seem to be left aside, they are a category of people whose need local authorities, even perhaps at a higher level, have a reluctance to recognise. Over the past few weeks, we were devoting our time to another Bill not entirely unrelated to what I am referring to, and that is the case of unmarried mothers.  I have noticed&mdash;and I have raised this point elsewhere&mdash;that local authorities do not recognise, or do not respond, to the courage of an unmarried mother in attempting to rear her child and often rear it in very unsuitable accommodation. The social conscience of all of us should be large enough to recognise that, in a housing programme at local authority level, the needs of these unfortunate people would be given attention.  As I said in the beginning, there are good points which I welcome and there are points about which I have reservations.  I have expressed my views on these and look forward to making a further contribution on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is a validating Bill.  It is desirable that every married couple should have and own their own home. Living in unfit and uninhabitable dwellings leads to very unhappy marriages <Col N="1336" /> and upsets the whole social status of our society.  Many surveys done by social workers and those involved in combating crime in our cities have indicated that a large part of the trouble is caused by the fact that people live in old houses in bad condition, overcrowding and so on.  The housing programmes that our Government undertake, not only affect, in a very real way, the standard of living of many people but will affect the whole social fabric of our society.  It is only right and proper that a Bill of this nature should get the attention that it got in the other House, and the attention it is now getting in Seanad Éireann.  It is important that we, as a society, should provide low cost houses for young married couples. Most people on an average income could not possibly afford the luxury of a home, with such high interest rates.  It is time we considered the subsidising of interest rates, so that young married couples would have some real hope, within a short time of getting married, of owning their own home, providing a sound basis for their marriage.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding in this House about the money spent on housing over the past few years.  If I could just recall the amount spent by successive Governments between 1975 and 1979, the figures speak for themselves.  In 1975, £115.51 million was spent on housing; in 1976, £105.18 million; in 1977, £99.29 million.  In those three years under the Coalition Government the figure declined each year.  In 1978 it rose again to £135.46 million and the estimated amount to be spent in 1979 was £165.30 million.  It is important to recall those figures because there seems to be some misunderstanding whether or not the present Fianna Fáil Government are keeping up the level of expenditure in housing.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson rightly referred to what has now become known as the Kenny report.  This was a committee set up by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1971 to examine the high cost of providing serviced land for houses.  The terms of reference of that committee were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  To consider, in the interests of <Col N="1337" /> the common good, possible measures for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  controlling the price of land required for housing and other forms of development,</P>
    <P>(b)  ensuring that all or a substantial part of the increase in the value of land attributable to the decisions and operations of public authorities... shall be secured for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>2.  To report on the merits and demerits of any measures considered, with particular reference to their legal and administrative practicability.</P>
    <P>3.  To advise on what changes in the present law may be required to give effect to any measures recommended.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government set up that committee because between the years 1963 and 1971 the average price of a serviced site in County Dublin rose by 530 per cent as opposed to a 64 per cent increase at that time in the consumer price index.  That committee reported on 7 March 1973, shortly after the Coalition Government took office and it seems to be a pity that none of their recommendations was considered or implemented by the then Government.  If they were, the problem that the present Government now face, where houses are rising by an average of £4,000 per annum, would in some way have been alleviated. When we are talking about housing policies and about two Governments and their different housing programmes it is worth considering those measures.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson said that the Kenny report recommended that building land should be controlled.  We all agree that the price of building land in the past few years has gone out of all proportion and that it is a substantial factor in the high cost of providing houses.  It is worth noting what the committee said on page 27, chapter 6, section 56 of their report:</P>
    <P>We have been unable to find any workable system by which the price of all building land could be controlled.</P>
    <P>It is important that we recognise that fact because if it were possible to control the price of building land it would be <Col N="1338" /> very easy to keep the cost of housing down.  Unfortunately, it is not possible, because, as the committee went on to point out, land, unlike other commodities, has unique features, each acre depending on its situation, which decides on the price in that area.  The only way one could control the price would be to establish a tribunal, which would be costly and cumbersome.  The cost of it and the time it would take would probably mean that the land would still be the same price after they had made their investigations and recommendations.</P>
    <P>That committee went on to recommend that the only possible way the price of land could be controlled was under what they called a &ldquo;designated areas scheme&rdquo;.  It is worth implementing their recommendations.  Under this scheme a new jurisdiction was to be conferred in the High Court to which areas in all our major cities were to be designated and the court would decide how the land was to be used for the following ten years.  After an area was designated a local authority could acquire the land within the ten years at the existing use value plus a certain percentage for the inconvenience caused to the owner having to move and so on.  The use value would be decided upon by one High Court judge with two assessors, one assessor having valuation experience and the other having town planning experience assisting him.</P>
    <P>Unless we have some control over the price of land there is no way in which we will ever be able to keep the high cost of houses down.  It is worth examining the possibility over the next few years of setting up that detailed system which the report outlines.  If that were done in 1973, when the report was submitted to the then Government, many of the problems that we now face would not be with us&mdash;for instance the cost of houses which is rising by £4,000 per annum, an unprecedented figure, which no young couple with average incomes could possibly afford to keep pace with.</P>
    <P>When we discuss housing we must consider the fact that so many of our developers have left housing estates in unfinished conditions.  They have built <Col N="1339" /> their houses, taken their money and gone off and left the estate in an absolutely dreadful condition for people to live in. In our local elections manifesto the Fianna Fáil Party recommended that builders give some sort of bond to the local authority which they would only get back if they left the estate in a finished condition.  It is worth implementing that scheme so that the housing estates are left fit for people to live in, so that the roads are finished, lighting and so on is provided, walls are built, dumps are not left and so that the housing estate is left in a proper order for people to have a reasonable standard of living and a reasonable place in which to live.  What happens in many cases is that the builder leaves, the local authority does not take over the area for a number of years and these estates are absolutely dreadful sights, they are terrible places to live in and they put very many pressures on young mothers with young families in those estates.  I recommend the Government to introduce immediately a substantial bond system whereby private developers would give the Government this bond and would only get it back when they had shown that they had left the estate in a reasonable condition and fit for people to live in.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is simply validating what has already been in operation for some time.  It is time that we seriously looked at our whole housing policies, and that we made it possible for all young couples to own their own homes.  I agree with Senator Howard who urged that more recognition should be given to unmarried mothers to provide houses for themselves and their child or their children as the case may be.  It is important that they too be seriously considered by local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is not enough just to have a comprehensive form of public house building, it is important to encourage young people to invest in their own houses, to save money, and to make it attractive for them to own their own homes within a few years of starting work.  The only way we can do this is by controlling the high interest rates and the high mortgage rates that we have at the <Col N="1340" /> moment and by making some real effort to give our young people some chance of owning their own home which is the basis of a happy marriage, which is the basis of a sound family system which will help in no small way towards alleviating the many social problems in the form of crime and so on that we currently have in very many of our big cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leas Chathaoirleach on his election to his new office, and I wish him very happiness and success in his post.</P>
      <P>The number of contributions made on this Bill and the length of time given to it in the other House, together with the number of times that housing matters appeared on the agenda of all of our local authorities, is a clear indication of the importance with which people regard the housing situation.</P>
      <P>While there are some very welcome measures in the Bill, there are some disappointments and some omissions. Much has been said on both sides of the House as to which of the Governments have the better record in house building. Each side can quote figures to support their own argument.  One set of figures that we should not lose sight of is the 1978 capital allocation for local authority housing, where there is a very great difference between the amount of money requested by the local authorities for housing needs in their respective areas and the amount allocated.  I am a member of both Cavan County Council and Cavan Urban Council and I know the amount of thought put into the preparation of lists of applicants for house and for reconstruction grants. When these applications were being compiled they had due regard to the needs in the particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Cavan the amount requested was £1.134 million and the amount allocated was £642,000&mdash;56 per cent of the amount requested.  The amount of money allocated to that local authority for housing development amounted to little more than half of what was considered necessary by the executive in that county.  A number of other counties are at the 70 per cent mark.  Sligo is at 63 per cent, Monaghan-Leitrim <Col N="1341" /> is 70 per cent and a large number of local authorities find that their allocations lie somewhere between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the amount of money that they consider necessary so as to have an adequate housing programme carried out in their area.</P>
    <P>In urban areas the same thing applies. In Clones the amount requested was £134,000 and the amount allocated for the year was £4,000.  In Ceannanas Mór £145,000 was requested and £60,000 was allocated.  In the Cavan urban area where there is an acute housing problem, the amount requested was £523,000 and the amount allocated was £400,000.  The undeniable trend shows that the housing programme for this year will not come anywhere near meeting what the executives of local authorities consider necessary.  That is supported by the fact that, while in 1976 7,263 local authority houses were built, only 6,333 were built in 1977 and 6,073 were built in 1978. From figures available this year there are no indications that we are on the upward trend.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this Bill has little to offer in relation to improvements and extensions to local authority houses in order to accommodate growing families, and little to offer with regard to higher grants in providing houses for disabled people or with regard to providing further sanitary services to local authority houses that were built without these services in former years.  There are a very big number of local authority houses without running water or sewerage facilities.  This applies to a degree even in some urban areas.</P>
    <P>In any area where there is a great shortage of houses people are paying very exorbitant rents for poor flat accommodation. In some of these flats on second and third floors it is a more than difficult job for parents to bring up young children.  The accommodation provided is wholly inadequate, in some cases it is insanitary and at the best of times it is difficult for mothers to bring up young children in these high up second and third-storey flats.</P>
    <P>There is also a dire shortage of old people's dwellings.  Because of the failure <Col N="1342" /> in the past, and little sign of improvement at the present time in providing old people's dwellings, we have a demand on hospital space for old people.  If we had old people's dwellings in sufficient numbers we could often interchange houses where the family have grown up and left the parents, so that they could move out to an old person's dwelling, which would be easier to heat and more suitable for them in every way, and a larger family could move into the larger house.  Because of the failure to provide a sufficient number of these old people's dwellings this interchange of tenants cannot take place.</P>
    <P>The points system, which operates in the allocation of houses and which is basically very fair, operates in most parts of the country.  However, under that scheme in areas where houses are in short supply parents with one child have little hope of getting a house and childless couples have none at all. Childless couples are living in flats, in poor housing accommodation, for as many as ten and 15 years with not the slightest hope of getting a house under the points system where houses are in short supply.  One can add on to that the cruel fact that because of the type of housing these people must live in a childless couple have not the slightest hope of ever being able to adopt a child under the conditions laid down by the Adoption Board.  That imposes terrible suffering on those people.  It is the duty of local authorities to see to it that people in that situation should not, in addition to not being able to secure a house themselves, have to go through the agony of being denied the opportunity of adopting a child because of the housing conditions under which they are forced to live.</P>
    <P>It was stated by a speaker from the other side earlier today that during the time of the National Coalition Government an order went out from the Labour Minister to local authorities that they were not to purchase land.  I do not know in what part of the country that happened, if it happened at all, but it did not apply to County Cavan.  During the period of the National Coalition Government, hundreds of acres convenient <Col N="1343" /> to different towns in County Cavan were acquired for housing and industrial development.  In the period before the coming into office of the National Coalition Government relatively little land was acquired for that purpose in County Cavan, so I would like to correct that matter right now.</P>
    <P>With regard to certificates of reasonable value, fundamentally it is a good idea that we should have such a provision.  How it will operate is an entirely different matter.  Some builders, maybe not many, give very bad value. They build houses with inferior materials, the workmanship is often substandard and soon after buying these houses people find that major repairs are necessary.  That is not the general pattern; the vast majority of builders give good value, but it is too bad that the other type of person is allowed to operate at all.  There is no doubt whatever that in various parts of the country people have purchased houses at very high prices and found then that repairs costing in some cases up to £2,000 and £2,500 were necessary within a period of three to four years.  People who perpetrate that kind of trick on the general public should be put out of business as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The escalating cost of housing will mean in the near future that local authorities will be called on to provide more houses.  The only way to get away from that is to increase the grant to the private builder.  The percentage of occupier-owned houses here, is very high in comparison with other countries in western Europe.  Irish people take great pride in being the owners of their own dwellings.  Tenant purchase schemes introduced in later years, have added greatly to the number of occupier-owned houses.  That was a very welcome development, but the cost of building a very moderate house at present is going beyond the capacity of young married couples.  We have had a phenomenal increase in the price of sites.  Sites convenient to some towns which could have been bought five, six or seven years ago for £1,000 are now costing between £5,000 and £7,000.  That imposes a <Col N="1344" /> tremendous burden at the very initial stages where a couple set out to buy or build a house.  When we take the cost of the house and the high percentage increase in housing materials and labour costs, the cost of building quite a moderate house runs into £15,000 or £16,000.  That means that the average couple has to borrow a very big sum of money.  If people are forced to borrow as much as £9,000, then the repayments amount to £1,100 per year.  That is over a quarter of the income of that applicant. It was an old maxim that housing should not cost more than one eighth of a person's income.  We are now reaching a stage where in some cases the cost of housing is costing more than one quarter of the income.  That should command the attention of the Minister and all public representatives.  We are approaching a time when the cost of housing will be simply prohibitive for a very big section of the people.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell on the £1,000 grant which was already referred to but everybody must admit that £1,000 which was part of the election manifesto of the Government, and was introduced by them soon after assuming office, does not go anyway near paying as big a percentage of the cost of a house now as the £900 grant that was available to certain sections of the people, did before that time.  It would probably be quite reasonable to say that a £2,000 grant would not afford the same relief as a £900 grant did for some sections of the people some years ago.  If the Government are in earnest about encouraging private sector building, the grant must be substantially increased; otherwise an ever-increasing number of people who would in better circumstances set about providing a home for themselves will be forced to turn to the local authority for housing.  That would be a most unwelcome development.</P>
    <P>The only way to prevent that development is to give a substantial increase in the grant to people building their own houses, and to develop the scheme of subsidies outlined in the Bill, to enable local authorities to provide serviced sites to intending builders at a cheaper rate. Nobody can deny the escalation that has <Col N="1345" /> taken place in the cost of building materials, the price of sites and in the cost of wages.  Nobody can deny that there has been a vast increase in housing costs.  There is no sign of that stopping. Costs continue to grow, so that the increase in the number of people who will have to turn to local authorities for housing accommodation will in the near future present a very big problem.</P>
    <P>I sincerely urge the Minister to have a look into that and to do whatever can be done under the provisions of this Bill, or by way of a future amendment if necessary, to prevent a rapid increase in the growth of the number of people who will have to turn to local authorities when they could be in a position to set about building their own home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are parts of this Bill that I welcome but there are others that are not nearly ambitious enough to solve what is becoming a very major national problem.  Over the years housing has always been a problem for every Government but it is certainly more acute now for a few basic reasons that were mentioned in the Bill.  I am afraid that this Bill will not solve them. However, the first and most important aspect of housing is that it is quite a reasonable aspiration for any young man and his wife to have the comfort of reasonable housing accommodation in their lifetime.  Unfortunately due to the growth we have had over the years, thousands of people will never be able to own their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I see a new category of persons about to enter the scene&mdash;a category I classify as the new poor. They are the people who heretofore could reliably be counted on to get a loan and be able to service the loan and build their own house.  For some of us who were new to politics in 1977 I will recall some facts briefly.  When we were told that in order to stimulate the building industry and to arrive at a situation whereby first-time house purchasers would be given £1,000 of a grant, it appeared on the surface to be a useful type of development, tempered by the fact that it came at the time of a general election. It is easier to be wise after the <Col N="1346" /> event, but in my view the housing situation has got a lot worse since that £1,000 grant came into operation, not because of the £1,000 on its own but because it seemed to influence other factors.</P>
    <P>When there is an upsurge in the economy, as we witnessed in 1977, and to a lesser degree in 1978, a certain type of house will be made available, but the profits accruing from such a development will not come back to the people actually buying the houses, in other words, the middlemen, the bigger type operators, get away with the gravy most of the time.  I cannot understand the situation where the cost of building materials rose by about 11 or 12 per cent in 1978, and the cost of housing increased by almost 36 and 37 per cent.  Who got the gravy in that situation?  I can assure the Minister it was not the house purchaser, and the £1,000 grant was of very little use to him.  We will have to get away from the mentality that the £1,000 grant in the last general election manifesto was the cure for the evils confronting house purchasers, that it was the answer to the problem of house builders.</P>
    <P>I believe, with my colleague Senator O'Brien, that as far as possible it is important that people should be encouraged to build their own houses. There are many good reasons for this, not least of which is that when the onus is put on a person to provide his own house in the private sector, taxpayers' money will not be used to the same extent. What has happened?  Take the local authority loans at the moment&mdash;a maximum of £9,000.  From a rural point of view the loan is £9,000 and the maximum income is £4,000, or £80 a week. To service that £9,000 loan for 25 years works out at approximately £23 a week. I cannot understand where most of the people are getting the difference between the £9,000 loan and the actual cost of the house, which can easily be at least another £9,000.  We are finding, in constituency work, that this is becoming a real problem.  For the first time in the last two or three years I have heard people say that while they could get the £9,000 loan there was no way that they <Col N="1347" /> could build a house.  This has to be very poor music in everybody's ears, because this means that those people will now turn to the local authority for a house. While I have no doubt it is vitally important for the local authority to gear themselves that way, I think this is a step in the wrong direction for this Government.</P>
    <P>The time is ripe for another look at the £1,000 grant itself and the cost of houses and sites.  The time must also be ripe for a hard look at a subsidy on interest charges.  I have no doubt that current interest charges on vast sums of money&mdash;£15,000 or £16,000 or even up to £20,000&mdash;are crippling house purchasers or builders.  If there is to be any type of reasonable development in housing in the next year or two it must come from this quarter.  We have to balance that against the fact that every day our interest rates are rising rapidly. We are now at the beginning of a credit squeeze.  Only two days ago I heard that the Agricultural Credit Corporation refused a farmer a loan to build his new farmhouse&mdash;a first-time house&mdash;in return for the deeds of his land, which would have been worth well over £120,000.  I regard that as a terrible credit squeeze.  I have reason to believe that the building societies are putting the boot in at the moment.  In most cases one is required to have £2,000 lodged with them for a period longer than six months.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that subject.</P>
    <P>While interest rates are extraordinarily high, I cannot understand why building societies are not in a position to give a full loan to persons eligible to build a house.  At the moment they give 85 per cent or 90 per cent.  Some countries on the Continent give 100 per cent loans.  If a man is eligible for a 90 per cent loan why is he not entitled to a 100 per cent loan in return for the deeds of his house?  This is causing great difficulty with many new house buyers because the marriage age is beginning to lower every year and young people are finding it very difficult to get the necessary 10 per cent deposit.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of housing I <Col N="1348" /> am very concerned about, that is, the building of what used be known as the rural cottage scheme&mdash;local authority housing for small farmers.</P>
    <P>I find now that this new poor category of persons, small farmers with poor returns from their acreages, are living in very bad housing.  They are in a catch 22 situation.  They are not able to build a house themselves; they may be entitled to the £9,000 county council loan, but they would not be able to meet the repayments.  Several applications have been filed with one local authority. While some are being built quite slowly, I have a fear and a dread, that if this particular scheme is not stepped up, particularly in the small farm areas, the designated areas in the west, families will not live where they should be living, and we will have more problems in the big towns and cities.  I would ask the Minister to make sure that in forthcoming budgets there will be sufficient money made available to local authorities to ensure there is an upswing in that particular scheme.</P>
    <P>In the last two or three years a certain category of farmers were unable to build their own houses.  From a social point of view, it is vitally important that they are allowed to live in their own area because rural depopulation suits nobody.  I will be asking the Minister to ensure that, in forthcoming budgets, the necessary finance will be made available to ensure that this scheme will be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a few other points to the Minister.  Some of the occupants of local authority houses which have neither sewerage nor water would be delighted to reconstruct their houses, but unfortunately they are unable to finance a project big enough to instal sewerage and water and to carry out the necessary reconstruction to qualify for the Department of the Environment reconstruction grant.  Half a loaf is better than no bread. The Department should look favourably on persons who put up a reasonable amount of money on their own behalf. People in the lower income bracket cannot afford a big instalment.  I assume the Department would look favourably on an increased grant for those people. They are on the differential rents scheme <Col N="1349" /> and are paying for the house, but they are not getting the normal facilities one would see in an ordinary house.  One would hope that the law governing this would be changed first of all to give such people the incentive and the initiative to get on with the job, and that houses of this nature would be reconstructed, and maybe at some later date, water and sewerage would be added when those people could afford it.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of mentioning the vexed question of ESB connection, which is a deterrent to many young people building their own houses. As far as this Bill is concerned, one might say this is a separate problem for the ESB, but it is not because it is a constituent factor as far as house building is concerned.  ESB connection charges have soared.  I know several people in County Galway who have to do without electricity because the charges are too high.  This is a factor as far as house building is concerned.  I would ask the Minister to take it up with the relevant authorities because, at the moment it is a huge problem in some areas, particularly in backward areas.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned in the Bill that a number of people have been caught out between the old grant scheme and the new £1,000 scheme.  I would like to place it on the record that whatever rules might have to be made or interpretations bent in some way, there are a certain number of people who built their houses in the last couple of years, who are residing in them but have not got a grant.  I made representations on behalf of those people and was told that unless an application had been received for the relevant grant in question, whether it was the old or the new, these people are not entitled to a grant.  Strange things happen our post, and have been happening for years.  The most important evidence anybody can have that a house is being built is to go to see it.</P>
    <P>Some of those people&mdash;I can think of four or five of them, and I will supply the Minister with their names in relation to the wording of the Bill, and maybe there might be a chance for them&mdash;built their first house at great expense and inconvenience to themselves, and did not <Col N="1350" /> get a grant, either the old one or the new one.  That is not good law.  I believe they have been discriminated against, even though I understand that rules have to be made and certain dates have to be set. In fairness, we have to accept that they built the house, paid the same amount of money as anybody else, went through the same trouble, and they should be entitled to some form of a grant.  I ask the Minister to take note of that.</P>
    <P>A number of my constituents built houses that happened to be a few square feet above the maximum allowed, through no fault of their own.  I have no doubt that, at the beginning, most of those house builders were guided by architects, builders and so on, and they had little, if anything, to do with the dimensions.  I know a few cases where the houses were ten or 12 or 20 square feet over the limit.  It is hard luck for anybody who finds himself at a loss of £1,000 because of somebody else's mistake. Perhaps there could be a reduced rate, provided that the square footage involved was not too great.  At that stage we would be talking about the type of housing that should not be grant-aided, and I accept that.  I am talking about the genuine mistake because when a house is built there is nothing one can do about it. It is not possible to reconstruct it or to have the dimensions brought back to a stage where you can be grant-aided.  I ask the Minister, in view of this Bill, to take upon himself to review this area. There cannot be that many cases which would be worthy of consideration but where they are only a few square feet over the guidelines, they should be reviewed with a view to giving some type of grant, if not a full grant, because they deserve it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see it is proposed to give some assistance to housing co-ops. I hope that the Minister, through the local authorities, will pass the message that building land should not be hoarded where there is a hunger for housing and that the land will be made available at a reasonable price.  There is no doubt that the value of sites has increased out of all proportion.  It is vitally important that sites be made available as cheaply as possible.  Taking everything into consideration <Col N="1351" /> we are entering a period when we will have fewer people building their own houses.  There will be tremendous pressure on the local authorities to provide housing for them.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that every possible help is given to people who want to build their own houses and to ensure that the local authority programme is stepped up so that the less well off, who will never aspire to owning their own house, will have proper accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend saying a great deal on this Bill, but in the light of the present housing situation I feel compelled to make a few observations relative to the economic pressures being placed on people of any age in the lower income group.  I mean the people from the middle class down, who are eligible to borrow and who would be in need of and anxious to build their own houses. The circumstances of these people have deteriorated immensely within the past couple of years.  It is accepted by all who are aware of the housing programmes and the expense of housing, that it now costs at least 70 per cent more to provide a house, even in rural areas where labour is not as scarce, as specialised or as controlled as in a place like Dublin.  These people in the middle income group got a grant of £900 which was related to roughly three-fifths of the amount houses are now costing.  That is putting housing at the lowest possible calculated increase.  For that reason, it is necessary for the Government to bring the amount of grant aid into line with the proportional increases in costs.  It is to aid people to procure houses that we give grants.  The payment of a £900 grant, under what is now known as the old scheme, was more beneficial, relative to present-day costs, to the builder.  It is important that encouragement and aid be given to young persons establishing a home by giving them an adequate grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in need of houses today are the flat dwellers in towns and cities. Anybody acquainted with the living conditions of flat dwellers in any large town&mdash;not to speak of Dublin city or any other city&mdash;is aware of the inhuman <Col N="1352" /> circumstances in which these people live. In my own county a number of houses were let out in flats.  When these couples had children, the local authority found it necessary to give them preference for new houses when they were available. Hardly had the people who occupied those flats left them than there was another set of flat dwellers living there&mdash;at almost double the weekly rent. That is a discouraging situation.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I find it costs so much to buy a site at this time that most young people getting married take a flat, although they have to pay an exorbitant rent&mdash;up to £25 and £30 a week.  This is dead money. They will never own this accommodation. This will be a tragedy for the whole family&mdash;parents and children.  Young people should have an opportunity to buy a site on which to build their own houses.  This could be subsidised.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that a nominal charge be set for a site and the balance of the actual charge could be subsidised.  This is the real way to encourage young people to acquire their own sites and to set up their own homes.  The problem is not very great if a person owns the site on which the house is to be built.  I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to subsidising sites, particularly for young people.</P>
    <P>Borrowing is a formidable problem for all people, irrespective of whether they are building or buying a house.  I know a person who bought a small house at £12,000, repaying the loan over 30 years.  He hopes to do it in less time, but, nevertheless, he will have to repay more than £30,000.  Transferring this house, looking up the title and having it checked cost him in solicitor's fees over £500 and almost a quarter of that also went to the local authority.  That is in full accord with the system of local authority loans to a person who builds a house.  I can give details of this to the Minister should he wish.</P>
    <P>Younger people who have yet to build a house and who buy a site are faced with this situation.  What encouragement have they?  What hope have they?  Does society intend making any adjustments <Col N="1353" /> to make it possible for these people to set up a home?  Is it the Government's intention to make conditions in society such that it will be possible for them to set up a home?  These are the real difficulties facing young people today. I would suggest to the Minister that the policy of siting homes and industry in large cities and towns, which has been pursued by different Governments over the years, might be looked at and altered or reversed if necessary.  Industry should be centred over the country generally so that the hundreds of young people who travel to Dublin every Monday morning on trains to take up employment here could find that employment in the locality where they live.  That should be a long-term policy of the Government.  It would be a remedy for this terrible problem that confronts the people who need houses in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other large cities and towns.</P>
    <P>It is not for the purpose of painting a black picture or for what political kudos I can get from making such observations that I am speaking.  I am speaking justifiably, fairly, and as far as I can, with an analytical outlook.  I am making suggestions which should be immediately apparent to the Government and they should apply them to remedy the problems.</P>
    <P>Housing has shifted to the private sector in the last couple of years.  The number of people who needed houses and the number of people who availed of the opportunity of going into house building were such that it was a matter of who was in first.  People believed that it was only a question of putting one's name down and one would get a £1,000 grant.  Unfortunately this was seen by many as a marriage gift because it was referred to by the Taoiseach as a grant for newly-weds.  We know that that is not so.  It was merely an increase of £100 on the grant they had been receiving. As far as the ordinary man is concerned, if he was given the opportunity of reasonable employment in his own locality, it would automatically ease the pressure on housing in the bigger towns and the significance of this £1,000 would be greater instead of which it has <Col N="1354" /> become insignificant in the face of the spiralling costs that we have witnessed over the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of people in need of local authority housing seem to become more difficult as time goes on.  It has been observed here, and as is evident to everybody, there is a generation of people marrying at an earlier age.  Even if we are to have a <i>pro rata</i> increase in employment, we are barely keeping step with the needs that arise.  The arrears that have arisen over the past 20 years are still with us and will be with us as long as we pursue the policy we are pursuing.</P>
    <P>Houses are being built on the basis of need and the people who are in a position to invest money will be looking at the implementation of a housing scheme on the basis of how much money they can get out of it.  It is a feature of society. Everybody who is at present in need of a house has to contend with this attitude on the part of the builder and on the part of the people who may be fairly described as speculators, people who buy up large tracts of land and leave them on the sidelines for years until such time as a boom comes, as happened in an area that I know well.  This should not be allowed to continue and it has been happening over the past four of five years.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson stated correctly that a large area of Dublin is derelict and there is no ownership and it might be used for housing.  There are areas in County Longford where planning permission has been granted.  These planning permissions have been there three or four years and the people have not built on those areas.  At present there is a demand and a need for housing and a real effort and a genuine approach to the whole question of housing is required.  I would not like a situation to obtain where everybody would expect to have a house overnight.  I would like to see a system whereby employers or Government agencies would save a certain amount of money out of the wages or salaries on behalf of every young person to be put away towards providing a home for him.  If people started to do this at 16 or 17 when they get their first <Col N="1355" /> employment they would have a reasonable nest egg which at 22, 23 or 24, when they would be getting married, would put them in a position to have in their own coffers a good proportion of what it would cost to build a house.  It would be giving them the incentive and the thrift habit and would enable them to provide a home rather than going elsewhere and spending their money on non-productive entertainment.</P>
    <P>I will not keep the House much longer.  The small farmer who has been resident in what was known as the old thatched cottage, or the old farm house where he had 15, 20 or 30 acres of land for two or three generations, generally is not in a position to build his own home without aid.  The kind of home that he would have to build today at the cost incurred in doing so is very discouraging to him.  The question of title has been a serious barrier to people anxious to build houses in those circumstances.  His grandfather or his father may have owned the place and title was not transferred.  I have suggested to Longford County Council that the appropriate thing to do would be to get the Government to issue a directive that where such title was not good and the person was not in great financial circumstances the local authority should obtain a CPO for a site and build a small farmer's cottage or house.  The non-operation of such a scheme has left rural Ireland denuded.  If the Minister applied himself vigorously to this it would alleviate the position.</P>
    <P>Many other cottages that were built in 1932 for people who emigrated to England and who, as a result of growing old, did not continue to occupy them, are locked up and not occupied.  The need for houses exists side by side with this situation.  An inventory was taken by a Minister some years ago of the number of unoccupied vested cottages in the country.  In the various countries the numbers were tabulated and submitted to the Minister.  Where such cottages exist, an approach should be made to the people who have not occupied them for many years, and they should be bought by the Minister after free negotiation, or <Col N="1356" /> by the local authority.  That in itself would put the country in a position where the ordinary man needing a house of the kind referred to would be able to get it and, instead of having locked-up houses and people living in flats, there would be an easement of the problem of housing.</P>
    <P>There are some things in the Bill which I welcome and there are others which I do not welcome.  I do not like the idea of the test for eligibility for a house being in the hands of an authority other than the county medical officer.  Health standards and the family circumstances are the real test of a person's need for a house.  In the case of a bad house and a young or large family, or in the case of certain illnesses, first preference should be given.  The person qualified to give direction effectively in this regard is the county medical officer.  It will be a sorry day when we will have houses allocated not by medical officers because of health qualifications but by somebody else, who will write to the Minister&mdash;not necessarily the present Minister&mdash;saying: &ldquo;There is no longer any judicial approach to this matter: you can fix it up for me.&rdquo;  This is something that can come in consequence of this kind of exercise. I would appeal to the Minister not to implement this provision but, whenever he feels there is a need to be met, let him tackle this problem without bringing about the position that can arise in consequence of this section being applied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief in my contribution as we have had a very full debate on this Bill with some 15 or 16 Senators contributing.  Practically every valid point that it was possible to make in regard to housing has been made. Therefore, I should like to confine myself to one or two points that my colleagues have omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my experience I find the new practice of ribbon building in every part of the country will create tremendous and expensive problems, especially for the local authorities, in the years ahead. From a scavenging point of view the country is now more and more ecology conscious.  The cost that our local <Col N="1357" /> authorities have to bear in providing a service up to a standard that the public require now and will certainly demand in the future will be increased.  Also, from a sewerage and water point of view it adds to the cost.  It increases the danger of people coming out on to the road every 50, 60 or 100 yards from their homes. On the arterial road system there are planning regulations that apply.  Even on those roads, for example the Dublin-Cork or Dublin-Limerick roads, you find new houses being built.  This is not in the interests of long term future development.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the Senators who have appealed to the Minister to be more generous with the elderly and expedite the building of either maisonettes or flats in the vicinity of churches and shops for them.  In that way we would be able to provide more local authority houses for young families.  We ought to be very conscious of the fact that we have the highest percentage of owner-occupation in the EEC.  This is something that we should be proud of. We have always had that tradition of people wanting to own their own hearths and homes and they very rightly take a pride in it.  We have a category of people, either disabled or incapacitated in some way, who have to be looked after. Although it is very costly the Minister and his Department should endeavour to be as generous as possible in providing grants either for reconstruction or adaptation so that people who are incapacitated can be assisted to stay in their own homes as long as possible and not have to rely on institutional aid.</P>
    <P>There is another point worth mentioning as far as local authority housing is concerned.  If you have the opportunity of visiting certain regions in the European Community&mdash;for example, the border region between the Netherlands and the German Federal Republic&mdash;you find the fantastic contrast in local authority housing even in areas where the border is the roadway.  You see the variations which their architects are able to include in a housing scheme.  In every town one goes through in this country one finds that the architects, even though they are paid a percentage on the total cost of the construction, seem to get away with <Col N="1358" /> designing houses with absolutely no variation.  Unless we step up the variations and have some sense of ecology I can see these larger housing schemes quickly becoming concrete jungles.  It will not cost the State any more to insist that the architects and planners use some imagination at the very beginning so as to provide a better environment for the people who are living in local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Kilbride when he asks for the provision by the local authority of subsidised serviced sites. Young people nowadays who seek to provide their own accommodation are taking on a tremendous task with the ever-increasing cost of housing.  We should go to meet those people as far as possible.  It is one way for them to save. Serviced sites would be an advantage and an encouragement.  If anybody wants encouragement at this present time it is the young people who are thinking of settling down and getting married.  We should do everything in our power to ease this burden and give them encouragement in facing their future lives in good and decent living conditions.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be encouraged to provide more maisonettes and flats for the older people.  The Minister is perfectly right in the Bill where he is going to ensure that these will not in all cases be vested so that the local authority will continue to have houses available for this category of people. I wish the Minister continued success.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their contributions to the Bill.  The overall national housing programme is developing generally in a satisfactory way. There were 24,000 houses built in 1976; 24,548 in 1977; 25,444 in 1978 and in 1979 at least 25,500 houses will be built. No authoritative source has established that we need to build more than 25,000 houses a year but we are committed to building between 23,000 and 27,000 houses a year up to 1980.  This was clearly set out in the White Paper published some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> Senator Reynolds expressed concern about increases in building costs.  He referred to items such as the price of cement.  Costs in the building industry are expected to increase by 15 per cent this year.  This compares with an increase of about 35 per cent in building costs during the first year of office of the Coalition Government in 1973-74.  The estimate of 15 per cent of increases in costs this year is based on increases already made and in the pipeline in relation to building material prices.  It also takes into account increases in earnings broadly in line with the current draft national agreement.  The estimate was based on consultation with representatives of the building material sectors and with the industry generally.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds spoke about a means test for grants.  An essential feature of the grant provisions is flexibility. It will enable increases to be made in amounts of grants and in conditions or even for the introduction of a new grant scheme like the house improvement grants to reduce dependence on oil.  On the other hand, the flexible provisions in the Bill will enable a means test to be applied.  I have no plans for the introduction of a means test.  I do not wish to introduce a discordant note but I would like to put on the record of the House that the Coalition introduced savage means tests and valuation limits for new house grants and reconstruction grants in 1976 and early 1977.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds referred to the question of an applicant for a house purchase loan who got approval for the then maximum loan of £4,500 and inquired as to whether that applicant would have been eligible for the current maximum of £9,000 by the time the house was completed.  The answer is no. Maximum loans are related to the date of either the pouring of the foundations of the house or the signing of the house purchase contract.  The maximum loan of £7,000 which related to loans for houses where the foundations were poured or a contract signed after 26 May 1977 was increased to £9,000 in the case of foundations poured or contract signed after 1 September 1978.  To have been approved <Col N="1360" /> for a loan of £4,500 the applicant would have had foundations poured or the contract signed on or before 26 May 1977 and it would have been immaterial when his house was completed thereafter.  As I have said, the date of the pouring of the foundations or the signing of the contract is the important date for the purposes of maximum loan approvals.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha referred to the fact that reasons should be given for refusing applications for CRVs.  He also inquired about how a builder should decide how much to pay for land.  As regards a builder not knowing what to pay for sites, regulations specifying the maxima for different areas, densities and so on which could be acceptable for CRV purposes would, of course, be known to those engaged in the selling end as well as those involved in the purchase of sites.  Therefore, no builder could argue afterwards that he bought the site in ignorance and was being penalised unfairly.</P>
    <P>If subsection (4) is invoked there will be a right of appeal to the Circuit Court against a refusal of a CRV on the grounds that the value of the site is not considered reasonable.  Paragraph (b) of subsection (4) expressly gives the Minister power to issue an indication of whether the price proposed to be charged or paid for a site represents reasonable value.  This is to ensure that, in the event of paragraph (a) of the subesection being brought into operation, a small builder purchasing sites will know where he stands <i>vis-à-vis</i> a CRV application before he pays for the sites. This will be welcomed by many small builders.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha mentioned the question of possible faulty workmanship in connection with solid fuel installations. In the explanatory leaflet on the new grant scheme which was released this morning, it was pointed out that the Department strongly advises that work should be carried out by competent people. It was also stated that it is particularly important that a back-boiler system should be suitably vented and also fitted with a safety release valve. The onus is completely on the owner of the house to ensure that the back boiler is properly installed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> In regard to section 18 of the Bill, Senator Reynolds made two main points, namely that the Minister be required to give a decision on a CRV application within a period of 30 days and that the Minister be compelled to give the reasons for refusing to grant a CRV. I will deal first with the question of imposing a statutory time limit and spell out the reasons why I am opposed to the idea.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory standard of service has been provided to date and this is partly due to the absence of rigid time limits and the consequent flexibility which the present system allows.  Last year, almost 2,400 decisions were issued and the average time taken for a decision was only 15 days.  In May of this year, the average time taken was only 12 days. The number of cases taking more than a month is very small&mdash;about one in 20 according to a recent check&mdash;and would usually involve some abnormal aspects which might necessitate a site inspection.</P>
    <P>Even if one were to accept the idea of a time limit, it would have to run from the date of receipt of all necessary information, not from the date of application, since applications are frequently incomplete. The level of information required may vary from one case to another depending on the amount of detail needed to justify the price, unusual aspects and so on.  At present many of the requests for further information and clarification are made on the telephone or during interviews where it is easier to explain what is involved and quicker than making formal written requests, as the amendment would require.  For example, during the recent postal difficulties, the informal approach was of benefit to builders.  A time limit like 21 days might in exceptional circumstances be impossible to meet with resultant granting of CRVs by default.  I am sure Members would not welcome such a development.  I am talking about a short term situation which might arise following a decision to extend the CRV system with a resulting increase in the volume of applications.  Here also we have to be realistic and recognise that it is extremely difficult to recruit the professional staff, particularly quantity surveyors needed.  In any event, the Minister is <Col N="1362" /> answerable in the Dáil for any undue delays.</P>
    <P>At present the only reason given for a refusal is the obvious one, that the price exceeds the amount appearing to the Minister to represent reasonable value.  I am aware that many builders feel that they should be given particulars of the reasons but I am afraid that it is not as easy as it may seem at first sight.  I might mention that my predecessor, Deputy Tully, resisted similar requests.  Strictly speaking, the concept of the house and site as one unit being reasonable value for a certain price does not permit one to give a specific reason, such as that the land was too dear or that overheads are too high, because in the final analysis the cost of the various elements is irrelevant so long as the total price is reasonable.  It often happens that a builder has paid over the odds for a site but because of economy of building and management operations he succeeds in getting a CRV.  Indeed, the information given by builders is often so inadequate or the price breakdown is so different from the Department's approach to the calculation of reasonable value that it is impossible to pinpoint accurately which elements are making the price higher than what appears to be reasonable.  Other factors such as efficiency, good buying practices and so on are also relevant.</P>
    <P>A further point is that to go into detail about reasons for rejection would be tantamount to publication of the Department's criteria for the assessment of reasonable value so that builders would know the Department's figure for reasonable value before they ever applied. In other words, builders would know our system, they would know our little secret, and would always apply for the maximum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We will discuss that on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>To impose a statutory requirement about particulars of reasons would mean that the Department would in every case have to look for much more detailed information from the builder than he has to submit at present or even than he may have at his disposal, even though such information may not be necessary to enable a CRV to be granted as is the case in the vast majority of applications at the moment.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Seanad that this section of my Department shall be as helpful as possible to builders in processing their applications for CRVs.  They meet the builders and their representatives quite often to discuss applications but they cannot give the reasons for the refusals at present; they ask them to submit a fresh application or a fresh figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Reynolds mentioned about a shortage in the supply of cement last year.  He was somewhat worried about the state of the building industry.  The building industry is back again on the right road.  Due to the massive injection of capital by the Government out put in the building industry in 1978 exceeded the 1973 level for the first time.  I do not wish to labour the industry's difficulties in 1974 and 1976 but last year output increased by 14.4 per cent to reach an all-time high level.  Output will increase by a further 7 per cent this year notwithstanding the problems caused by the oil sheiks.  Output is one aspect. What is also important, of course, is the fact that since July 1977 the number employed directly in the building industry has increased by about 7,000.  We expect that there will be a further 2,000 jobs this year.  Over and above those figures, there have been increases in employment in ancillary industries.  To sum up this point, the building industry is in a healthy state.  We are keeping in close touch with the suppliers of cement to ensure that short-term and mediumterm <Col N="1364" /> needs are met.  For the first time we have given certain indications of prospects for the industry in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Senator Moynihan referred to essential repair grants, but I think he tended to confuse this category of grants with the ordinary improvement grants scheme.  The essential repair grant scheme is designed to help prolong the life of houses in rural areas, usually occupied by elderly persons, which it would not be possible to bring up to the normal standard of habitation at an economic cost.  These grants have an important part to play in rural areas and I should like to point out that when we resumed office in 1977 the maximum grant from the Department was £80, a meaningless amount in the light of current costs.  We have increased this maximum to £300.  There is no limit on the amount which local authorities may contribute or spend on the execution of the works.</P>
    <P>Senator Moynihan also mentioned the disabled person's grants scheme.  A number of points have been raised in relation to these grants for the adaptation of houses occupied by persons suffering from physical disability or mental handicap.  To clarify these points, I would point out that there is no limit, statutory or otherwise, on the amount of grant assistance which local authorities may make available for this purpose up to the full cost of the works.  The present maximum contribution from my Department is £1,200 per house which represents a trebling of the £400 available under the Coalition.  Local authorities may, if they think fit, arrange to have this work carried out on behalf of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey raised an interesting point in relation to the guarantors for housing loans.  The position refers to Donegal County Council where, apparently, guarantors are sought for local authority house purchase loans.  I would like to make it clear that my Department never insisted on a local authority seeking guarantors. However, the question of incorporating a guarantor clause in their house purchase loan scheme is a matter for each local authority who have power to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> My Department generally express disapproval of the practice of requiring guarantors for local authority house purchase loans.  Circular letter 5/67, which issued to local authorities in 1967 in relation to the Housing Act, 1966, clearly indicated that the seeking of guarantors was against the spirit and intention of the house purchase loan scheme.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which might appropriately be taken up by Senator McGlinchey with his own local authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey spoke about the inadequate levels of new house and improvement grants.  While we would all like these grants to be higher, we must bear in mind that the taxpayer must in the end carry the cost of these grants. This year's Estimate for the Department includes an allocation of £30 million for private housing grants and when one compares that figure with the £4½ million budgeted for that purpose by the Coalition in 1977 one can see the considerable improvements in grant assistance that have been effected over the past two years.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator Jago's question about a person paying a price in excess of the CRV price, I should like to refer him to section 18 (8) (b).  From that it can be seen that one is only entitled to depart from the CRV price in order to meet a legitimate charge under a price variation clause or to take into account the provision of items not included in the original price.  I should confirm for Senator Jago that one of the primary intentions of this Bill is to provide that in the future grants can be altered by regulations rather than by legislation.  It will mean that the amount of grants can be increased and alterations effected faster.  If Senators or Deputies are not satisfied with them, the regulations can be annulled by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Jago's query about the interest on money borrowed by local authorities for the purchase of land, that interest is recouped to them. The system is rather tricky.  They are recouped at the time when they pay off the first instalment to the Commissioners <Col N="1366" /> of Public Works in respect of the loan for the overall development of the scheme.  I shall write to the Senator on that matter explaining it in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Jago and with other Senators that there is a shortage of building land being provided by some local authorities.  But my Department have been in touch with local authorities requesting them to purchase building land and to endeavour to ensure that they would have at least a five year land bank in reserve.  That is the target or objective.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson said that the Bill validates changes effected since 1972 and deals with minor aspects.  In her view it will do little to meet housing problems.  It seems from her comments that she took a superficial glance at the Bill.  The Bill validates changes but, more importantly, provides a flexible legal framework for house improvements grants, new house grants, house improvement loans, the low-rise mortgage scheme, the site subsidy system, the scheme for the subsidisation of local authority housing.  To suggest that such is minor, illustrates a lack of appreciation of housing on her part.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides also a flexible CRV system and introduces a number of other changes.  I do not wish to reduce the tenor of the debate to a political level, but the Senator's contribution generally was in this vein.  I feel disinclined to bore this House with too many statistics, but it is only fair to say that she was very selective in her approach.  She made no mention of the public capital programme on housing.  This expenditure dropped from £105 million in 1976 to £100 million in 1977.  The provision for this year is £165 million.  She referred to increases in house prices since 1978.  I suggest that she might take a look at Table 19 of the last edition of the quarterly bulletin of housing statistics regarding trends in house prices, house costs, the CPI and earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson spoke about the need for a shift in emphasis to house improvements. In January, 1977 the Coalition <Col N="1367" /> Government imposed restrictions on eligibility for grants for this work.  In November, 1977 the present Government introduced a simple grants scheme. This year expenditure under the scheme is estimated at £17 million, excluding expenditure on the new scheme to reduce dependence on oil.  This compares with some £2½ million in 1977.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of the rehabilitation of itinerants.  As the House is aware, the programme for the rehabilitiation of itinerants has been in operation since 1964.  The main objectives of this programme are to provide opportunities for a better way of life for itinerants, to promote their absorption into the general community and, pending such absorption, to reduce to a minimum the disadvantages to themselves and to the settled community resulting from their itinerant way of life.  I know that strenuous efforts have been made in this respect by many local authorities over the years.  Available information indicates that, to date, almost 1,222 families have been accommodated.  Of these 805 families have settled in standard houses and seem to be adapting well to their new surroundings.  A further 250 families are living on serviced sites and 67 families in trailers, or mobile homes, on approved sites.  I know that many more families wishing to settle have not had an opportunity of doing so. The most recent survey shows that 946 families were still on the roadside.  I am advised by those in close touch with the problem that perhaps one-third of these would have no ambition to settle at present. The remaining two-thirds are willing and anxious to do so.  The community has a responsibility towards these people.  The championing of travelling people has required courage and dedication at local level when one bears in mind that quite often proposals to settle itinerants are actively opposed by the settled community.  I would appeal to those people to study the positive achievements of the settlement programme and to help and encourage itinerant families to overcome their early difficulties of settlement.</P>
    <P>The provision of training centres for <Col N="1368" /> teenage itinerants constitutes a relatively new and necessary extension to the itinerant rehabilitation programme.  I would consider the work carried out at these centres, organised by voluntary groups and local authorities, as being a key factor in terms of the ultimate solution of itinerant settlement, education and employment.  The industrial and vocational training provided enables itinerant teenagers to avail of the opportunities offered by society and in return to contribute to the benefit of society.</P>
    <P>All local authorities have been asked to intensify their efforts on all aspects of their programmes in regard to travelling people.  Particular emphasis was placed on providing halting places for transient families.  The importance of appointing social workers has been stressed also as they are of tremendous help in this progress towards settlement and in assisting the travellers to adapt to new conditions.  Senators will be aware by now of the generous financial assistance available from my Department for the provision of accommodation for itinerant families, including 100 per cent grants to local authorities for the provision of residential sites or halting places. More recently I extended the scheme to allow for the 100 per cent recoupment to local authorities of expenditure incurred in the provision of premises for use as industrial and vocational training centres.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard expressed concern about what he called the sweeping powers conferred on the Minister in section 18, in particular, the power to prohibit the granting of loans of specified classes.  In the first place I should stress that the provision in question is an enabling one.  I can assure the Senator that the extent to which these powers will be invoked by this Government will be minimal.  Certainly they will never be used to damage the housing programme or reduce the capacity of the house building industry.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned the price of land and the Kenny Report.  As a result of a survey carried out, and which was reported to my Department, on the Kenny Report, we are submitting proposals to the Government for consideration. <Col N="1369" /> Senator O'Brien referred to the lack of building by local authorities of homes for elderly persons.  We are encouraging local authorities to work within their budget and to provide as many homes as possible for elderly persons.  Within the past few weeks my Department have cleared a number of schemes to provide for elderly persons.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton stated that people should be encouraged to build their own homes.  The Government are doing everything possible in this direction.  He criticised the £1,000 grant and the £9,000 loan.  I have met constituents who are quite happy to be able to build a new house with the £9,000 loan and the £1,000 grant.</P>

      <P>During the last quarter £16 million was approved in respect of new house loans for local authorities.  Senator Connaughton also mentioned that he could not see the reason why building societies and other agencies could not give 100 per cent loans.  He should realise that building societies must keep a reserve in accordance with law and that they must also be in a position to repay at very short notice money borrowed.  They cannot lend any more than they borrow, so it would be impossible for them to give <Col N="1370" /> 100 per cent loans.  The Senator said that this is done in certain areas in Europe, but we must bear in mind that here in Ireland we have the highest owner-occupier situation in relation to housing than has any other EEC country.</P>

      <P>As regards the people who fell between two stools when the grants were changed, particularly when the means test was introduced on 1 January 1976, the period for applying for those grants was extended on a few occasions. There were newspaper advertisements and other public announcements were made also that people could apply again for those grants within a specified period.  I cannot accept Senator <Col N="1371" /> Connaughton's suggestion that a mistake of a few square feet in the size of a house should be ignored just because the mistake was made by an architect or an engineer.

      <P>Senator Kilbride referred to the cost of transfer of sites for loans.  No matter what the loan is, the cost of the transfer will be much the same, and usually the higher the loan is the higher the legal fees are.</P>
      <P>Senator Kilbride raised also the interesting question about the provision of more employment at home for young people.  It is the Government's policy to decentralise and we are moving in that direction.  He also raised the question of old council houses falling into disrepair and he mentioned houses which were unoccupied. The housing authorities have full power to recover these vacant council houses that are falling into disrepair, to repair and to reallocate them to deserving tenants.  It is their duty to do so.</P>

    <Title>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Bill, 1979: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has a number of separate provisions, each of which is related to the programme for the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis from the national cattle herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eradication of these diseases is possibly the most urgent problem facing the Irish livestock industry today.  We have for some time now been operating on the basis of derogations from the EEC's rules on animal disease, especially as they apply to intra-Community trade in bovine animals.  These derogations have afforded us some borrowed time&mdash;but this is rapidly running out. Currently the derogations are valid only to the end of the present year and the position after that is uncertain.  As well as that, the Community has drawn up rules relating to trade in liquid milk and <Col N="1373" /> these are likely to foreshadow similar rules relating to trade in manufactured dairy products.</P>
    <P>If all these measures are applied in full before we have our disease levels down to acceptable EEC standards the effect on this country's export trade in cattle, beef and dairy products could well be disastrous.  When we talk about the urgency of eradicating disease, therefore, what we mean is that the future of the farming industry is at stake.</P>
    <P>That is one part of the background against which this Bill must be looked at. The other part is the time and expenditure which have already gone into disease eradication.  We are 25 years endeavouring to eradicate bovine TB and no one can be satisfied with the progress we have made&mdash;bearing in mind that in the 1979 round of testing one herd in 25 was found to be infected with bovine TB.  The campaign to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis from our herds has already cost the State about £130 million.  Even in historical terms that is a huge sum. Translated into present-day values it represents an enormous amount of money.</P>
    <P>The first of the main provisions in the Bill is for payment of a levy on all milk supplied for processing and on all cattle slaughtered in the country or exported live.  This is designed to implement the Government's decision announced in the Programme for National Development last January that farmers should in future make a direct contribution to the costs of disease eradication.  The rates of levy, 0.5p per gallon of milk and £3 per animal slaughtered or exported, will amount to a farmer contribution of £10 million in a full year.  This compares with an estimated expenditure of £22 million on disease eradication this year&mdash;but the level of expenditure must increase over the next few years as full compulsory brucellosis eradication measures are extended to the whole country.</P>
    <P>The Bill next contains enabling provisions on the operation of a price differential between milk from disease-free herds and that from infected herds.  I have already mentioned EEC proposals to regulate intra-Community trade in <Col N="1374" /> liquid milk.  These could effectively exclude from trade all milk derived from herds which are infected with disease. Our trading partners are concerned especially with the public health aspects of bovine TB and brucellosis and are therefore strongly suspicious of imported products from countries like ours where the levels of disease are still high.</P>
    <P>I would stress again that the provisions relating to the milk price differential are only of an enabling nature.  It seems to me that a reduction in the price of milk coming from diseased herds could be an effective way of getting the owners of these herds to make a final determined effort to get rid of disease once and for all.  Price reduction in the short term would certainly be a better alternative than the total exclusion from the market, which might in the longer term be in store for suspect milk.</P>
    <P>I have no fixed views as to what the amount of any price differential might be or when it should be introduced.  I intend to consult the various interests concerned before deciding to avail of the enabling provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A third provision in the Bill allows information to be obtained about the ownership or control of lands where cattle are held.  It is often impossible to say who is the real owner or user of lands let or rented or to ascertain the ownership and health status of cattle on the lands. This can frustrate the operation of disease control measures and it is necessary therefore to be able to get the relevant information in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to extend to two years, instead of six months, the time limit for taking proceedings for offences under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  Many of the offences under the disease regulations do not come to light for some time after they occur.  For example, the illegal movement of animals might be disclosed only several months later in the course of a routine herd test.  Other apparent breaches of the regulations require detailed and painstaking investigations over a period of time.  There have been many cases where the six month time limit has prevented prosecutions being taken.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for substantially <Col N="1375" /> higher penalties for offences under the Diseases of Animals Act.  There has been widespread criticism of the present maximum penalty of £100 for summary conviction as being entirely too low by today's standards.  This is being increased to £500 and in the case of conviction on indictment there will be a maximum fine of £2,000 and/or imprisonment of up to two years for offences such as tag-switching or falsifying certificates.  Abuse of the disease control regulations has been all too common in the past.  Although the abuses may have been perpetrated only by an unscrupulous minority of those involved with cattle, that minority can do untold damage.  They have no concern for the damage they might do to the majority or for the future security of the industry from which they make a living.</P>
    <P>The penalties now provided for in this Bill are aimed at tag-switchers and other miscreants who continue to flout the regulations and who must realise that time is about to catch up with them.  The majority of farmers, together with the genuine cattle traders and the meat processing interests, already realise that the operations of these criminal elements are detrimental to the best interests of the livestock industry.  I expect, therefore, that the usual silent majority who want to get on with the job of rooting out disease will become more and more intolerant of those who put their livelihoods at risk.  The increased penalties envisaged in this Bill must be seen as an added warning that trafficking in diseased animals will no longer be profitable.</P>
    <P>The saver provision in section 24 of the Bill arises from a particular court case.  In that case the action at issue was dismissed, so that the court in fact did not decide that any particular orders or actions were invalid or otherwise. However, in the course of the hearing a doubt was raised as to whether a declaration in the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State) Order, 1965, to the effect that the State was an area where bovine TB was virtually nonexistent had been properly made.  The 1965 order has since been replaced by a <Col N="1376" /> comprehensive new order made last September so that any doubt in the matter has been cleared up.  The purpose of the saver provision is solely to remove any doubt about the situation that obtained prior to the new order.  There are, to my knowledge, no court proceedings in train at present that might be affected or prejudiced by the saver clause.</P>
    <P>I have given a brief outline of the main provisions in the Bill.  The other sections of the Bill which I have not mentioned relate to keeping and examination of records, the making of returns, the prosecution of offences and so on and they are consequential to those main provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a necessary step in the drive to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis from this country as quickly as possible. The accelerated programme to hasten the achievement of that goal which I launched last September has been well received and is already proving effective but we still have a long way to go before we will be rid of these two diseases. The process of getting rid of them may well be painful for some, but it is a process we must face up to for the benefit of farming in general.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation, therefore, in recommending the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, from a party and personal point of view, I want to voice my complete and absolute opposition to this Bill.  I do so for a number of reasons.  It is a crippling levy.  It should not be placed on farmers at a time when the industry is contracting.  It is being imposed in a way which allows no escape for anybody, irrespective of whether he is big or small.  The Government, from what I can see happening in relation to farming in the last 12 months, are making a dartboard out of farmers and every so often they give them a dart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of about ten darts that farmers have got so far as taxation is concerned in the last 12 months.  There has been a litany of levies.  There was the infamous 2 per cent farm commodity tax which was changed several times but finally imposed indiscriminately across the board.  Farmers have to pay the co-responsibility <Col N="1377" /> levy.  Now we have a halfpenny per gallon on all milk sold at farm level irrespective of where it goes and for every animal that is slaughtered there must be paid a levy of £3 whether it is to the butcher, at the factory or for that matter at the point of export but I will be coming back to that in a moment. We will have another Bill before us tomorrow providing that a tenth of a penny goes towards the cost of milk inspection.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago before this House we had a Bill to increase vet charges at the factory by nothing less than 200 or 300 per cent.  Not too long ago we had the introduction of the 30-day test, not that there was anything particularly wrong with the 30-day test, but farmers had to pay for that test, too.  That was nothing to what happened farmers on budget day, particularly in the western areas, The threshold for dole was reduced This resulted in 6,000 farmers becoming ineligible for unemployment assistance.  The agricultural grant was removed from farmers with £40 valuation and over.  I am asking the Minister at this stage how many more darts will the agricultural industry be able to take?</P>
    <P>Most farmers who are genuine in their efforts to develop are asking the question, &ldquo;Who am I doing it for?&rdquo;  Nobody will deny the importance of the eradication of TB and brucellosis so far as the nation is concerned.  The health of the people must come first.  But for another reason, too, we must have a disease status second to none so far as our cattle exports to markets around the world are concerned.  However, to impose a levy in respect of testing which is inequitable and which certainly militates drastically against small farmers and store cattle producers is certainly not the answer to the problem.  I agree totally with the Minister's efforts to nail tag switchers and dodgers in the cattle trade who for their own selfish ends would break all the rules relating to animal health eradication schemes.  But why were we not told at the last general election and even in more recent times that such levies would be imposed on the farming community?  I certainly did not hear anything about them in the 1977 campaign <Col N="1378" /> and every time the Minister comes before either House, it is for the purpose of introducing legislation aimed at getting more money from farmers, regardless of their ability to pay.</P>
    <P>It is most important that if the agricultural industry is to grow and prosper there should be a proper tax structure, whereby at the beginning of the year, or indeed for a period of years, farmers would know exactly what they are expected to pay.  I have no doubt in the world that any farmer when taxed on the basis of his ability to pay will gladly pay but at the end of 1979 farmers will not forget what this administration have done to them in terms of taxation.</P>
    <P>The policy would now seem to be that instead of the overall taxation structure some Government Ministers are always talking about, there is a policy now of snatching finance whenever it seems to be wanted, and in this administration it seems to be wanted every day.  The economy has overspent itself.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out, too, on a more global note that while farmers will certainly have to carry a fair responsibility and a fair share of the costs for the eradication of animal disease the problem is a national problem.  When the Industrial Development Authority are given millions of pounds a year to ensure that our industrial welfare is looked after, nobody asks who actually will pay that.  It all comes from the taxpayer in one way or another.  We all realise that for the economy to prosper generally, it is absolutely necessary to have a thriving and prosperous agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say today that because of the taxation proposals and policies being pursued by the Government there is no doubt that we are reaching a stage where many farmers are becoming totally disillusioned.  As I suggested on the occasion of the implementation of the 30-day test, the day is not far off when every farmer in Ireland will be paying totally for disease eradication. What we are legislating for here is merely the thin end of the wedge and within the next 12 months or two years at most, farmers will be paying the full cost of disease eradication.</P>
    <P>It is peculiar also that in the very year <Col N="1379" /> that the Minister came back from the price-fixing meeting in Brussels&mdash; without almost a single increase&mdash; where he had been arguing that the co-responsibility levy should be reduced, he should produce proposals that are much harder on farmers than is the co-responsibility levy.  Surely his colleagues in Europe must have now come to the stage where they would say that there is not much point in debating this subject with the Irish Minister for Agriculture because every time he goes home he has a new levy for farmers.  The outcome of price-fixing meetings in Brussels in respect of agricultural products was never as bad as it was this year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the pricing structure in the Bill, the imposition of a levy of £3 per animal in respect of animals worth £600 or £700 is not particularly crippling but I come from an area where one does not find too many £600 animals.  We have a fair share of £250, £300 and £350 store cattle and we have a very good live export trade to Northern Ireland.  The situation now will be that at a mart in Galway, Mayo or Roscommon where an animal first of all has to be tested for the 30-day test, the farmer will have to foot the bill which could be anything from £4 to £8, depending on the number of animals and the veterinary surgeon concerned.  The farmer pays the mart fee.  Then the purchaser of the animal, the exporter, will be required to pay £3 at the Border.  The farmer will pay that £3 indirectly.  Most animals, at the point of sale, will be costing western farmers between £15 and £20.  That is a large fee by any standards.  It is most unfair to the small farming population.  The ½P per gallon of milk does not take into account the ability of the farmer to pay.  A number of fairly big milk producers have committed themselves deeply by borrowing from the banks and they are finding the profit margins quite tight. These are farmers with young families and huge overdrafts.  This is another fierce blow to them.  There are no limits on this, which I find difficult to understand also.</P>
    <P>Another part of the Bill which is very <Col N="1380" /> difficult to accept is the section which says that farmers who are identified as having milk from reactor herds will be fined a certain amount of money.  This could well be a hammer blow to the people who are unfortunate enough to have disease in their herds.  Over the years I have never come across a farmer worth his salt who wanted to have disease in his herd.  Farmers do not think that way. There might be a careless farmer in a area.  Brucellosis can be brought into a man's land by wandering dogs or even birds, and he will be fined an unspecified amount.  I understand an amendment was tabled in the Dáil to the effect that that penalty should not be any more than 1p a gallon, but it was not accepted by the Minister.  Reading between the lines it may be that the Minister is thinking about a sum far in excess of 1p.  If that is the case, it is even a greater hammer blow.</P>
    <P>One of the most disastrous things that can happen to a farmer is to be told by his vet that he has either TB or brucellosis in his herd.  As the reactor payments stand at the moment, and having regard to the price of clean cattle, there is no doubt that that man's hardships are only beginning.  I shudder to think what would happen to a small dairy farmer with, say, ten, 15 or 20 cows, who is solely dependent on their milk and calves for his income.  The normal procedure is to get his animals tagged, killed in the factory and paid for, and then he gets the Government grant.  He could be told he will be penalised to the tune of anything up to 3p a gallon on milk sent to the creamery.  If that is not bureaucracy gone mad, I do not know what is.  I want to put it on record here this evening that if the Government, or any other Government, are interested in clearing the dreaded disease, there are a number of fundamental steps to be taken, and I have yet to see them being taken.  The 1979 round of TB and brucellosis testing in County Galway was due to start not later than February-March at the latest.  It was into the first week in May before the vets were told they could begin.  What type of disease eradication scheme is that?  To make matters worse, we had the postal strike&mdash;something farmers had nothing <Col N="1381" /> to do with either.  I am afraid the disease figures will be anything but good in many areas in 1979.  There is another problem, and I am surprised nothing has been done about it.  It is a well-known fact that many thousands of calves are ferried in lorries from the southern counties to the west every year.  They are allowed access to the west.  Animals of that type should be tested on their way to the west.</P>
    <P>Even now when the factories are working under capacity there is the question of getting reactors to the factory on time.  I know about the 30 days provision, but it has often happened that the officials have not come to punch the animals, to identify them among the herd, and get them away from the place to avoid the risk of re-infection.  Things which could be done are not being done in the fight against TB and brucellosis. While we are winning to a certain degree, there is still a certain percentage of the dreadful disease around.  Let no Minister or Government tell me that the proper way to eradicate TB and brucellosis is to nail the farmer to a cross. Any farmer who ever had these diseases in his herd will know what happens and we should not add to his problems by the provision of a levy, the amount of which is unspecified at the moment.</P>
    <P>The moneys collected from this levy do not necessarily have to be earmarked for disease eradication.  They will go to the Department of Finance and no guarantee will be given that they will be used for disease eradication.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance did not like the idea of another 2 per cent &mdash; he is not likely to forget the last one.  With the acceleration in the disease eradication programme, in four or five years' time one would expect to have these diseases at a reasonable level.  We will never be able to eliminate them altogether.  What will happen to the levy at that stage?  Will it be discontinued? Could we get an assurance from the Minister that it will operate for three, four or five years only?  Could we get an assurance from the Minister that the levy will not be raised substantially in the next four or five years?  It will be possible to increase it by ministerial regulation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> Is this the thin end of the wedge?  Will it be £3 this year, £5 next year, and £10 the year after?  Most farmers are asking those questions at the moment.</P>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning is that between 30 and 35 per cent of the milk consumed in this country is unpasteurised. Surely that cannot be good from a human health point of view.  The Minister should comment on that situation. Why is the sale of unpasteurised milk allowed when there is no doubt that it affects the health of the people?  This tax is the eighth or ninth such one and I believe that we are not finished with taxation. In the next 12 months farmers can look forward to increased taxation in several ways.  Whatever else the Minister or the Government might try to tell farmers, let no one tell me that the proper way to eradicate disease is to penalise further ordinary farmers who have the misfortune of having brucellosis in their herds by a lesser price at the creamery for their milk.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider this Bill.  He should consider the amount of tax already piled on farmers and consider the farmers who are unable to pay. Taxation creates problems for the store cattle producers of the west.  He should consider the overall implication for the growth of the agricultural industry, and ensure that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.  There is no doubt that, in the best times and in the worst times, if anything goes wrong with agriculture everybody feels the pinch. It is unacceptable to levy the cost of disease eradication programmes on farmers.  We must remember that three out of every five persons in this state are employed either in agriculture or industries related to agriculture.  If we continue to impose these levies we will become a much poorer nation.</P>
    <P>It is no excuse at the moment for the Minister for Finance and the Government to say that the only reason they are doing this is that they have no money. The reason they have not money is that they misused the spending of it in the 1977 and 1978 budgets.  There is little use in telling a small farmer in the west that he is only being penalised because the Government of the day have run out <Col N="1383" /> of money.  At this late stage I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the Bill.  Some aspects of the Bill could not be good for agriculture and will create hardship for the unfortunate farmers whose herds are diseased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Connaughton in regard to the importance of the elimination of TB and brucellosis from cattle.  I should like to know who will pay for the elimination of these dreadful diseases.  We know how much money has been spent in eradicating disease and we know of the efforts of the present Minister for Agriculture to deal with these problems.  The Minister will have to continue to try to solve these problems because more work has to be done and we only hope that he can do more.  I would remind the House that former Ministers have tried to solve this problem and we had not much success under the last Government either.  The vets strike delayed the eradication of disease and many farmers, particularly in the west, were very unhappy at the way in which the situation was handled.</P>
      <P>Senator Connaughton raised so many political points on this Bill that one would think only one Government were dealing with the eradication of these diseases. One thing we are happy about is that prices for cattle are still good.  In 1974 calves were being given away.  The industry was very depressed.  The then Minister for Agriculture did not introduce a subsidy for farmers, who were expecting him to do so.  Senator Connaughton said that farmers will never forget this Fianna Fáil Government. They are more likely to think about the depression in the cattle industry in 1974. As we have a better market structure, I think that the silent majority of farmers the Minister referred to are determined to play their part in eradicating disease in herds, particularly bovine TB and brucellosis.  They know that the scheme has to be paid for, that a great deal of taxpayers' money has already been spent on the eradication of disease. These diseases affect humans as well as our national herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that there will be a <Col N="1384" /> tightening-up in regard to information on ownership of cattle and in regard to land where cattle are held.  It is disappointing that non-farmers are not taking the same interest as farmers in eliminating disease.  It is very difficult to find out who owns cattle on land let by the Land Commission.  The switching of cards means that diseased cattle have been allowed onto these lands.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a provision in the Bill that will allow information to be available in regard to the ownership and control of land.  The Land Commission, to their credit, have been more strict since the Minister asked them to allow only male animals onto the land.  When there is not sufficient numbers of male animals, I understand that the female animals have to be certified free from disease.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on some points raised by Senator Connaughton.  He talked about the Government using the farmers as a dart board and referred specifically to the fact that farmers had lost their unemployment assistance.  The Government, he said, had run out of money.  I would like to point out that in relation to the changes in unemployment assistance for farmers&mdash;farmers' dole as it is called &mdash; the Government did not save money because there was an overall increase of £250,000 in payments to small farmers.  It was the less well-off farmers who got the increases.  Some farmers did lose, and I would be the first to admit that, but farmers who are in poor circumstances can have a factual assessment of their means to see if they would be entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on matters outside the Bill before us.  Other speakers may refer to other levies but, as far as I am concerned, this Bill deals with payment for disease eradication.  While we all agree that the elimination of TB and brucellosis is imperative, we have to ask where the money will come from.  There has been a big investment by the State in disease eradication and genuine farmers will not mind paying a levy of one-halfpenny on a gallon of milk and £3 per animal slaughtered when they know that there is a determined effort by the <Col N="1385" /> Minister to get rid of disease once and for all.  I support the Minister in his programme.  He needs the support of everybody concerned to get rid of these dreadful diseases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear that I, with all Senators in this House, am in favour of the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis.  There is no doubt that all Senators and Deputies, irrespective of the side of the House on which they sit, are in favour of the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis. We know it is essential for the state of the nation, as well as for the export of cattle, that we get rid of those two diseases. All over Europe it is known that we have a high rate of brucellosis and bovine TB infection and the laws are now being made very stringent to ensure that we would look into those problems and do something about them.  There is do doubt that past Governments, when it was made quite clear the problems those diseases were creating, were concerned to eradicate them.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, oppose the levies that are now being introduced to supplement the cost of disease eradication.  We also oppose the powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners of access to records kept by the meat factories and meat processing plants.  The commissioners will have power to examine each supplier's financial account without the presence of the supplier himself.  Those are the two main provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a farmer but I work in the dairy industry and I know that this industry is already deeply involved in advising the farmers what to do and in advising them that quality milk and meat are required to get the highest price for our products.  We must take seriously the advice we are getting, not alone from the Department of Agriculture, the agricultural advisers and from the veterinary inspectors, but also from the main farming organisations.  Help must be given to farmers in some way or other to assist them to get rid of those diseases. The help being proposed by this Bill is a levy of 0.5p on every gallon of milk supplied for processing.  That is the <Col N="1386" /> encouragement being given to farmers to get rid of cattle infected with brucellosis and bovine TB.  The Bill also proposes a levy of £3 on every head of cattle slaughtered and on every head of cattle exported live.</P>
    <P>One thing that is so unfair about this legislation is that so many farmers have already made the effort to make their herds free from brucellosis and TB.  It has cost those farmers much money; but now, even though they have got rid of disease, there is a levy on them of 0.5p on every gallon of milk supplied to the creamery.  Anybody here who will tell me that is fair legislation in my opinion is not being true to himself.  Why should we levy farmers who have made the effort to get rid of the diseases?  Nobody would stand for that type of legislation.</P>
    <P>Why should we ask farmers to pay £3 on every head of disease-free cattle slaughtered, the same as the levy that will be put on diseased cattle slaughtered?  That is the purpose of this Bill.  Senator Connaughton and others have said it is a form of taxation.  It must be a form of taxation on farmers who have made the effort.  For what other reason do we tax those people to the limit that is now being proposed?  I cannot see any reason other than a tax on the farmers to bring in revenue even though that revenue may not be spent on the proposed scheme for the eradication of disease.  The major part of the money will come from the farmers who made the effort to clear themselves of the disease. Is that fair?  If it is, I should not be here.  I do not believe it is fair and as a Member of the Seanad, I will oppose it because of its unfairness.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the farmer taxation that has been imposed by the Government over the past two years. The farming organisations were right to resist this taxation because everybody, whether he is a farmer, a professional person or a trade unionist, will oppose extra taxation.  We cannot say now that the farmers are wrong for opposing extra taxation.  The organisations have a duty to safeguard their members and to get the best possible price and value for their products out of any scheme that has been introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> We must get rid of bovine diseases. The best way of getting rid of those diseases is to give back confidence to the farming organisations and to the farmers themselves, to show that there will be a future for them.  Presently there is an erosion of that confidence.  This can be seen from the newspapers and announcements by the presidents of the farming organisations to that effect.  I do business with farmers and know them very well; many of them tell me that they are going to get out of milk altogether. These farmers are some of the largest suppliers to the creameries but they are seriously considering getting out of the business.  We have an obligation as people who work in the industry and who have the interests of the industry at heart to try to convince them that they should remain in the dairy industry.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that that is the right advice to give them and if the Minister for Agriculture were here he would also say that that is the right advice to give those farmers.</P>
    <P>Unless we have the farmers deeply involved in the dairy industry and producing the milk we will not have the value of the exports that come from the industry. If the substantial value that is accruing from those exports does not come back into the country we will be in a poor state.  It will not only affect the farmers but also those who work directly or indirectly for the farmers.  Now is the time to encourage farmers to invest, to get them more interested in the dairy industry and to create a better environment. There is still plenty of room for farmers to increase their dairy herds and to take up that extra supply.  The advice being given to the farmers by the managers of the industry is not to lose confidence, to develop and produce more.  Now is the time to encourage the farmers, not to discourage them as this Bill is about to do.</P>
    <P>I am in favour, as is every Senator and Deputy, of eradicating bovine TB and brucellosis but the way we are going about this is discouraging.  The farmers have been taxed so much up to now that they see this levy as a tax also.  Whether it is a tax or not, it has to be paid by the <Col N="1388" /> farmers to the Exchequer and in anyone's thinking that is taxation.  I accept it is taxation for a purpose that is necessary because we must get rid of bovine TB and brucellosis, but the timing of the introduction of this Bill is all wrong because of the mood the farmers are in and also because of other taxation measures that have been introduced.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Lough Derg Water Level.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this matter to be discussed in the House this evening and the Minister for making himself available to discuss this important matter.</P>
      <P>I must, at the outset, say that the matter being discussed here is but a part of what has developed into a very serious problem on the River Shannon&mdash;and Lough Derg in particular&mdash;over the past few weeks.  In case Members of the House are not familiar with the specific matter I have raised, I shall give a very brief background to what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of last month the water level in Lough Derg was reduced by about five feet.  I understand that there is in existence a statutory right to interfere with or lower, the level of any part of the Shannon, when it becomes necessary to <Col N="1389" /> do so for the purposes of generating electricity.  I am not familiar with the source of that statutory right.  I realise that it is not the Minister's direct responsibility. I should, nevertheless, be grateful if he or some of his staff, would refer me to the particular statutory foundation for this right.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the level of water in Lough Derg was reduced.  A number of consequences flowed from that.  First, the level of the water was reduced at such a rate that a bank, or dam, at Fort Henry, near the Ardnacrusha generating station, subsided, as a result of which the water level will have to remain low for some weeks in order to have repairs effected. I understand that attempts have been made already to repair the bank, but that, because of the difficult conditions, it has not been possible to effect repairs properly.  The actual reduction of the level of the water in Lough Derg has had a number of other very serious consequences, one of the major consequences being that none, or almost none, of the harbours around Lough Derg is navigable.  Consequently, traders&mdash;be they publicans, or restaurateurs, or shopkeepers&mdash;operating from these little villages and hamlets around the lake have been denied access to a very large market of visitors who are cruising on the Shannon.  To give the House some idea of the extent of that market&mdash;in 1978 about 22,000 people enjoyed a cruise on the Shannon, 20,000 of whom were foreigners, Continentals.</P>
    <P>Another problem that has been created is that the rocks beneath the water level are now more hazardous and many boats are actually becoming grounded on rocks and sandbanks. The buoys that are there to mark these danger points on the lake have moved, or have been displaced, as a result of the lowering of the level of the water.  Severe dangers are created now for people who observe the buoys and who are not familiar with the river, or with the lake. People who now take the buoys at their face value and go to one or other side of them as may be appropriate can, in fact, manage to go directly onto the point against which the buoys should be warning them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> Farmers are being put to great difficulty. Many new acres have been created as a result of the lowering of the level of the water and cattle can travel from one farm to another now with great ease, by simply walking along the newly created shoreline.</P>
    <P>Very many of the hire-boat operators have been put to great cost.  Their marinas along the lake are unusable.  I have witnessed the sight of two cruisers, worth something in the order of £44,000, never used, lying in a harbour, at a loss to the boat owner of revenue of £500 per week per boat.  They just cannot be got out of the harbour. The harbour they are in was the subject of an investment of £100,000 last winter; that harbour is now lying idle and useless.</P>
    <P>Visitors from the Continent, who read in the travel brochures about the delights that can be experienced by visiting various places in Lough Derg, come to find not only are there difficulties with telecommunications and petrol but also, to their horror, that there is difficulty with the waters that they have come to use.  They are frustrated and annoyed.</P>
    <P>I freely acknowledge the necessity to use water supply to generate the vital power of electricity&mdash;particularly in the circumstances of the present energy crisis&mdash;but whoever is responsible should, at least, have engaged in a proper public relations exercise to explain to tourists what has happened and what the difficulty is.  At the moment, the hire-boat operators are trying to explain to people what happened.  I understand that the majority of visitors are taking it very well; they are enjoying the extra adventure involved in getting them to their boats.  However, some of them are annoyed and believe that there is a con-job behind the boat-hire business on the Shannon.  For example, many of the boats are now only accessible by using dinghies to get people from the marinas out to the boats.  I know of one German visitor who was unfortunate enough to break his arm in the course of travelling across other boats to get his luggage on to the boat that he had hired.</P>
    <P>A very great deal of inconvenience and a major loss in revenue have occurred <Col N="1391" /> as a result of this lowering of the water level.  If it were counted up in terms of the loss of use of the harbours, on which so much public money has been spent, add to that the amount of money that is being lost to boat-hire operators as a result of their boats being aground and being unusable; add to that the amount of damage that has been done to boats which have gone aground; probably the biggest loss is the lost revenue to traders in all the ports, coves and hamlets around Lough Derg&mdash;if that is all added up I believe that the loss of revenue to the State would literally amount to millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Office of Public Works are responsible for the maintenance of the lake.  By that I would understand that they have a responsibility for the maintenance of the banks of the shoreline; that they would have a responsibility for harbours that are public, rather than private, or marinas that are public; responsibility for the proper marking of danger spots on the lake, and for any other matters that would arise in relation to the navigation of boats on Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>So far as I can judge the Office of Public Works have taken no steps in relation to this matter.  There is one boat owned by the Office of Public Works, which is normally on Lough Derg kept there for any maintenance that may arise.  I understand from one of the hire-boat operators that a couple of days after the crisis, this boat disappeared up river and has not been seen since.  I should like to ask the Minister whether, before the ESB took the action of lowering the level of the water in Lough Derg, they consulted with the Board of Works. They certainly did not consult with anybody else.  I know several hire-boat operators who were never consulted about this matter, and were taken completely by surprise when the level of water was reduced literally in the course of a couple of days.  These people have been put to a great loss.  If the Office of Public Works had been informed, they could have taken steps certainly to correct the displacement of the warning buoys that took place and also to help some of <Col N="1392" /> the harbours of the little villages that benefit from the market created by the people who cruise in boats on the Shannon. In relation to two or three of these villages the least amount of help, the least amount of dredging, over a very small distance of water would enable these boats to come in to dock for the night and would enable the visitors to use the facilities afforded by the villages for the mutual benefit both of the visitors and the traders.  Why was no attempt made by the Office of Public Works to help to alleviate the problems that were created?  Was the Minister or the Office of Public Works given notice of the action that was taken by the Electricity Supply Board?  Has the Minister had consultations with the ESB since this action was taken?  If so what results might everybody affected by this expect as a consequence of those consultations? Will the Minister say how long it will take for the water level to be restored to a more reasonable level, or what steps it is proposed to take in the future to ensure that the ESB do not take action of a similar nature without putting people on notice?  Is there any possibility that this might recur in the future?</P>
    <P>The ESB have been very slow to indicate the reasons for having lowered the level of the water by so much.  For example, we were led to believe at the start that the reason was the necessity to increase the output in Ardnacrusha hydro-electric station.  We then heard the rumour that the bursting of the bank caused a great wastage of water and that this was the reason why the water level had to be reduced by five feet.  We were led to believe then that an industrial dispute at the Poolbeg generating station caused the difficulty.  If in fact it is because of the industrial dispute at Poolbeg one can hope that there will not be a recurrence of this, but if it is the general energy problem that has been occurring within the ESB&mdash;day by day we are suffering power cuts at the moment&mdash;is it likely that the level of water in Lough Derg is never going to be restored to a reasonable level?  Before the ESB decide on matters of this nature do they consult with any other bodies so as to measure the worth of the electricity they produce against the loss of revenue <Col N="1393" /> that accrues to so many other interested parties?  If there is a danger of this sort of thing recurring will the Office of Public Works embark on a programme to ensure that the harbours around Lough Derg&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My major difficulty is that there has not been an explanation from anybody as to precisely what happened, as to what the situation is now and as to what will happen in the future.  I would stress the necessity for some immediate action at this stage.  The loss of revenue has been quite enormous.  There is a lot the Office of Public Works can do and I would urge the Minister to take whatever action he can at this stage.  I would also like to know what consultations, if any, took place with the ESB beforehand and since.  Can the Minister also indicate whether the ESB or whoever reduces the level of the water have a statutory right to do so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain interest in this waterway.  The matter we are discussing is the corrective measures being taken by the Office of Public Works following the lowering of the level of Lough Derg.  I do not know if any of these measures have commenced yet.  I gather from Senator Molony's information that <Col N="1394" /> until the breached bank is repaired, they cannot take place.  It is quite clear that the most urgent corrective measure will be to raise the water level in Lough Derg.  The water level in Lough Derg can only be raised by releasing water from the northern Shannon, and the first part of the northern Shannon to be effected will be Lough Ree.  I emphasise the importance of making sure that the level in Lough Ree, while it can afford to be reduced because it is higher at the moment for this time of the year than it normally is, is not reduced so as to bring to Lough Ree the appalling state of affairs that presently pertain in Lough Derg.</P>

      <P>Senator Molony must be under some misunderstanding about the whole position there.  I am glad of the opportunity to clarify some of the points he raised.</P>
      <P>First of all, the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the Shannon Navigation are derived from the Shannon Act of 1839.  This Act empowers the commissioners to manage and maintain the Shannon Navigation as a public navigable river. However, when the Electricity Supply Board were formed they received overriding statutory powers which enabled them to lower the water level on the Shannon for hydro-electric purposes and indeed to prohibit navigation on the river.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>These powers are derived from the Shannon Electricity Act 1925 and the Electricity (Supply) Acts, 1927 and may be exercised notwithstanding any enactment declaring the River Shannon <Col N="1395" /> to be a public navigable river. Before exercising these powers, the ESB gives ample notice to the affected parties by way of newspaper advertisements and explanatory letters.  I understand that their public relations are quite good in that respect.  Everybody is fully aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our engineers are advised in advance of any change in levels and it is done through the press.  We have checked this out.  However, we beg to differ on that.  We will check that out again to make sure.</P>
      <P>The position at present is that the ESB have lowered the level of Lough Derg to 105.5 feet above sea level which is four feet below the normal summer water level.  This lowering was necessary to meet the present high demand for electricity and to offset the power losses occasioned by an inter-union dispute at Poolbeg Station and also the ESB's regular plant maintenance programme. During the course of the lowering of the water the ESB Fort Henry embankment was damaged.  Any damage is the responsibility of the ESB.  The ESB have indicated that it will not be possible to restore the water level until the necessary repairs to the embankment have been completed.  This is expected to take approximately four weeks.  Any subsequent raising of the levels will be dependent on the extent of the demands on the ESB's power capacity.</P>
      <P>Despite the lowering of the levels it is still safe to navigate on Lough Derg, provided one stays in the main navigation channel.  The Senator mentioned some boat being grounded.  I would assume that it was not in the main navigation channel.</P>

It would be extremely expensive to deepen all these centres to allow for their use in this type of situation, In view of the fact that the level of Lough Derg was lowered to this extent only once previously, in 1933, it is considered that the carrying out of such works is not a priority.  I want to assure the Senator that the situation is kept under constant review by the officials of my Department who will take all possible remedial action within their scope to meet any problems on the lake.
