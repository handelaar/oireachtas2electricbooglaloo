      <P>Before we enter on Report Stage of this Bill, I should indicate to the House that amendments Nos. 9 and 10 in the names of Senators Robinson and Keating are out of order on the ground that they are outside the scope of the Bill as read a Second Time. The Senators have been notified accordingly. <Col N="1164" /> Amendments Nos. 1 and 8 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;abortifacient&rsquo; means an appliance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing which terminates a human pregnancy;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments were down on Committee Stage and I agreed to table them again on Report Stage so that there could be further discussion on the amendments and what they are all about.  It is common case between all sides of the House that we do not want to admit, through the medium of the Health (Family Planning) Bill, any element of contraceptive practice that could also be abortifacient.  The Minister says that the protection against anything of an abortifacient nature is contained in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  Sections 58 and 59 of that Act deal specifically with the offence of abortion. I would remind the House of the terms of those sections.  Section 58 says that:</P>
      <P>Every Woman, being with Child, who, with Intent to procure her own Miscarriage, shall unlawfully administer to herself any Poison or other noxious Thing, or shall unlawfully use any Instrument or other Means whatsoever with the like Intent</P>
      <P>&mdash;the first part of it deals with the woman and the second part deals with a third party&mdash;</P>
      <P>and whosoever, with Intent to procure the Miscarriage of any Woman, whether she be or be not with Child, shall unlawfully administer to her or cause to be taken by her any Poison or other noxious Thing, or shall unlawfully use any Instrument or other Means whatsoever with the like Intent, shall be guilty of Felony,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and penalties are provided.  Section 58 makes it an offence for a woman or for a third party to procure an abortion by administering <Col N="1165" /> poison or by using an instrument. Section 59 says that:</P>
    <P>Whosoever shall unlawfully supply or procure any Poison or other noxious Thing, or any Instrument or Thing whatsoever, knowing that the same is intended to be unlawfully used or employed with Intent to procure the miscarriage of any Woman.... shall be guilty of a Misdemeanour,</P>
    <P>Section 59 prohibits the supplying of the means of procuring an abortion.  Those two offences are perfectly clear, but an essential ingredient before those offences can be committed in the eyes of the law is that there must be an intention to procure the miscarriage.  There must be an intention to cause an abortion.  The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the person being prosecuted had the intention of procuring a miscarriage, either the woman who takes the abortifacient, the third party who supplied it to her, or the third party who administered it, before an offence can be committed under the 1861 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of this Bill reads:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorising&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the procuring of an abortion;</P>
    <P>That is quite clear because that is already the law under the 1861 Act.</P>
    <P>(b) the doing of any other thing the doing of which is prohibited by section 58 or 59</P>
    <P>Of the 1861 Act which I have just read out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c) the sale, or importation into the State, manufacture, advertising or display of abortifacients.</P>
    <P>The section does not go on to provide that the sale, importation or display of these things shall be an offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister relies on the 1861 Act as providing a defence to the dangers that might ensue if abortifacients were sold, imported into the State, manufactured, advertised or displayed, because the 1861 Act prohibits abortion.  It does, but it only prohibits abortion when the State can prove that the abortifacient was taken, administered or supplied for the purpose and with the intention of <Col N="1166" /> procuring an abortion.  What we are trying to guard against is the type of device, the effect of which is not clear, a device which could have an uncertain effect, which stifles the act of conception before conception takes place, in which case it is a contraceptive as commonly understood by that term or, alternatively, which might abort a conception immediately it has taken place.  It is that sort of device that we commonly refer to when we speak of abortifacient.</P>
    <P>Consider the situation in which that sort of device is on the market and is being supplied and it is not scientifically clear as to what its effect is.  As the law stands, even if the scientific effect of that device could be established, although I am suggesting it cannot be established because of the confused nature of the subject and the imprecise state of scientific knowledge on this subject, there is a grave danger that the effect of some so-called contraceptives is to procure a miscarriage in the wording of the 1861 Act.  The Minister says that his defence against the supplying of such devices is the two sections in the 1861 Act.  If the Minister calls the 1861 Act as a defence and a prosecution is mounted and that prosecution is brought by way of indictment which must follow the wording of the 1861 Act and must allege that the noxious thing, poison or the instrument, was taken or administered or supplied with the intent of procuring a miscarriage, that is the case that the Minister will have to prove.  The Minister is bringing this case in relation to these instruments that we are calling abortifacients, instruments or things, whose precise effect is not certain, because we do not know whether it is a miscarriage inducing instrument or whether it is a contraceptive. The immediate defence of a person charged under the 1861 Act for supplying, using or taking this type of device, is to say, &ldquo;I did not take, supply or use this device with the intention of procuring a miscarriage or causing an abortion; I took, used or supplied this device purely for contraceptive purposes&rdquo;. Once that defence is made the Minister's prosecution must fail.  It is no longer relevant whether the device or thing did cause an abortion or whether it was an abortifacient.  That is the law as it <Col N="1167" /> stands at the moment and that will be the law after the Minister's Bill passes through this House and is signed by the President.</P>
    <P>That law, if passed in that fashion, is defective in doing what many people want it to do, that is, closing the loophole on devices which are supplied for apparently contraceptive purposes but which are abortifacient in their method of operation.  This is something desired by everybody; this is what we want to achieve when this Bill becomes law.  This Bill will fail to achieve that because it fails to deal with the type of situation where the device being used allows the user to raise the defence that he did not have any intention for that device to be used as an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>That loophole can be closed only by providing specifically for a definition of an abortifacient that will leap this imprecise boundary between contraceptive and abortifacient so as to define abortifacient in so far as it can be defined.  I admit that this is something which from the drafting point of view is impossible in absolute terms.  To close that loophole I am proposing in amendment No. 8 that a committee be set up to advise the Minister whether a device is an abortifacient even though it is also being presented as a contraceptive.  Accordingly, when the sale or importation or display or supply of an abortifacient is prohibited in the statute, we will know to what thing or instrument the prohibition refers.  We will know that it is a thing or instrument defined in accordance with amendment No. 1 and the subject of an opinion by this committee in accordance with amendment No. 8.  Then there will be a further provision making the supply and so on of that abortifacient so defined to be unlawful and to be a specific offence so that we will not have to rely on the 1861 Act where one must prove intent.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the allegation of intent is rebutted automatically by the fact that the instrument in question can be alleged to be a contraceptive.  The changes I am proposing in the amendment can remove that defence by removing the plea that it is a contraceptive if, <Col N="1168" /> after the committee have decided that the thing is abortifacient, there was a presumption under the 1861 Act that the person intended the natural consequences of the action.</P>
    <P>The 1861 Act cannot be an effective defence until the loophole which is left by the failure to define &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; is closed.  Until it is closed it is a perfect defence for anybody prosecuted to say, &ldquo;This was not an abortifacient, this was not taken as an abortifacient, this was presented to the public as a contraceptive and was so used&rdquo;.  Once that defence is open the 1861 Act is not available to safeguard against backdoor or incipient abortion.  For these reasons I would strongly urge the Minister to look at these amendments and to accept them.  It is common case in this House and throughout the country that no loophole whatever should be allowed which would admit in the slightest degree the principle of abortion through the implementation of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am rather unhappy about these amendments.  It is sometimes, without going into the technical details of it, perfectly normal and proper and necessary to terminate a pregnancy.  There are various procedures, various drugs and instruments which could be called abortifacients which may be used and are used by doctors of all denominations. Such procedures are often essential to the health and the life of not only the mother but also the child.  There are many problems involved and I am unhappy to see an amendment worded as this at present, and I cannot support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Committee Stage concluded I have given a great deal of thought to this matter and have sought advice from the draftsman and the law officers.  I am quite satisfied that the procedure adopted in the legislation is the right one and that to adopt either of Senator Cooney's amendments, particularly the <Col N="1169" /> first one, would not alone be unnecessary but it would be unwise and could lead to very great difficulties.</P>
      <P>I will first deal with the question of abortion and abortifacients raised by some other Senators in this context. &ldquo;Abortifacient&rdquo; is a specifically defined dictionary word which has a very definite meaning.  The meaning of it clearly connotes causing an abortion. There should not be any difficulty about that.  &ldquo;Abortion&rdquo; is also a very specific dictionary word with its own special meaning.</P>
      <P>Senator Conroy had a very important point in that the definition of abortifacient here could not possibly be accepted because it would apply to all sorts of things which would have a completely legitimate medical use.  I am told that the way in which the definition is framed by Senator Cooney in his amendment would cover all sorts of ordinary everyday items, so that it would be a completely inapplicable sort of definition to import into the Bill.</P>
      <P>To come to the situation that we are legislating for, the approach in the Bill is the right one.  The section in the Bill as it is before us, as I have already explained on a number of occasions, saves the situation in regard to abortion and abortifacient. Section 10 makes it absolutely clear that nothing in this legislation relating to sale, supply, importation, authorisation and prescribing can in any way interfere with the situation as it obtains in regard to abortion and abortifacients. This legislation makes it crystal clear that the position in regard to abortion and abortifacients is preserved adequately and absolutely as laid down in the 1861 Act.  Therefore, the law on the total prohibition of abortion and abortifacients in the 1861 Act stands unimpaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that is the right way to deal with this matter.  The parliamentary draftsman would be very worried, indeed, if we were to attempt to introduce into this legislation a definition of abortion or abortifacient and thereby detract to some extent from the power of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. My advice is that if the law on abortion or abortifacients is to be changed it should be done as part of criminal law <Col N="1170" /> and as an amendment or a redefinition in the 1861 Act.  That is the way in which it would have to be done.  I am not at all convinced by anybody that there is need to do that or indeed that it would be wise to do that.  The 1861 Act was carefully drawn and has stood the test of time.  To set about changing it in any way at this stage is something that would have to be approached with very great caution and very great skill.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney seems to persist in making the same mistake in his interpreatation of section 59 of the 1861 Act.  Senator Cooney constantly referred to the fact that the drug, appliance, or whatever, would have to be supplied with the intention of causing an abortion. That is not what is in section 59 of the 1861 Act, and it is deliberately not in it.  The wording of section 59 is very specific; it says:</P>
    <P>Whosoever shall unlawfully supply or procure... knowing that the same is intended.</P>
    <P>The person receiving it must have the intention. The supply of the thing is not related to intention.  The supplier must have knowledge that is intended but the intention would be on somebody else's part, obviously the person procuring the abortion.  Section 59 was very carefully and specifically drafted on those lines and has stood the test of time.  If it is to be changed, if somebody finds something wrong with it, then it would have to be changed on its own merits in relation to that piece of legislation.  If we want to do anything about this we would have to go to that 1861 Act and reframe it.  That is certainly not necessary for the purposes of this legislation and is indeed something which would have to be approached with very great caution.</P>
    <P>I rely on the argument which I have been making all along that section 10 is quite adequate for the purposes for which it is intended, namely, to deal only with contraceptives, contraception and family planning.  Section 10 ensures that the law in regard to abortion and abortifacients is still firmly and specifically dealt with in the 1861 Act and is not in any way weakened or impaired by the passing of this legislation.</P>
    <P>One other argument put to me in relation <Col N="1171" /> to amendment No. 8 is that it seems to incorporate into itself a basic error.  It speaks of something, apparently, as being both an abortifacient and a contraceptive. My advice is that that is impossible. A contraceptive is one specific thing and an abortion can only take place after conception has happened.  A device cannot be a contraceptive and an abortifacient at the same time.  I am further advised that, even if that were not so, the saver in section 10 of the Bill makes it crystal clear that a thing which was a contraceptive could not be sold imported, manufactured, advertised or displayed as such if it were also an abortifacient. For these reasons I am compelled to refuse both amendments Nos. 1 and 8.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister and to Senators representing both sides of the House I am happier today than I was when this Bill was introduced. I am glad that both Senator Cooney and the Minister can say that this Bill does not allow the introduction of abortion here.  In their minds it is very clear that abortifacients should not be allowed to be sold legally.  That, in itself, gives me great confidence that the family and the child come first.  Having listened to this debate I am now certain that abortion is out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment does not make sense.  It says that:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;abortifacient&rsquo; means an appliance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing which terminates a human pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pregnancies can be terminated at eight months, eight and a half months, seven months and six months.  There is no indication here as to what stage pregnancy can be terminated without it being an abortion.  If all these words define an abortifacient, then abortifacients are being used every day by some person or other in the termination of pregnancies. Where the amendment refers to abortifacients only and the termination of human pregnancy without any further explanation it does not make sense.  It could be said that at any stage an appliance, drug or whatever used by a <Col N="1172" /> person to terminate a human pregnancy for any reason can be termed an abortifacient. That does not make sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that the word &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo;, in its ordinary meaning, means causing an abortion.  If that is so, amendment No. 1 can be withdrawn.  It does not follow however, that amendment No. 8 could also fall to be withdrawn for the same reason because that amendment gets to the heart of the difficulty I am trying to deal with in these two amendments.  The difficulty concerned the device, the effect of which is not clear.  I take the Minister's point that if something is a contraceptive, then obviously it cannot be abortifacient because conception never took place, it was stifled.  I understand there are devices on the market and it is not clear at what stage in the conception process they operate.  Do they operate to prevent conception?  Do they operate immediately conception takes place, and thereby cause an abortion? I understand there are devices on the market that fall into that category and one is not sure what is their effect.  If one was sure that they operated to cause an abortion&mdash;that is, operate immediately after conception takes place&mdash;they could be caught by the 1861 Act, and if the Minister's interpretation of section 59 is right, they would be caught by the 1861 Act, provided it would be possible to prove that the device in question operated after conception took place,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us deal with the Minister's interpretation of the 1861 Act, section 59, which deals with the party supplying the means for procuring an abortion.  The Minister read out the section and it says: &ldquo;whosoever shall supply&rdquo; and so on &ldquo;knowing that the same is intended to be unlawfully used or employed&rdquo;.  The Minister made the point that the word &ldquo;intended&rdquo; referred to the recipient of the thing and not to the supplier of it, and that consequently the intention of the person supplying it was irrelevant. He said it would not be necessary to prove intent on the part of the person supplying it because the intention in the section refers to the recipient, not to the supplier.  I disagree with that interpretation <Col N="1173" /> because the section says: &ldquo;Whoever shall unlawfully supply a thing knowing that the same is intended&rdquo;; the word &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; refers to the supplier and not to the recipient.</P>
    <P>It is a well settled principle of interpretation that <i>mens rea</i> is necessary in the statute when the word &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; is used.  The word &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; here can mean only that the person supplying it knew what it was going to be used for, in other words, that there had to be intention or knowledge, or <i>mens rea,</i> a general guilty intent on the part of the person supplying the abortifacient. There would be a serious disagreement of interpretation between the Minister and me on the element of necessity for <i>mens rea</i> on the part of the person supplying the abortifacient.  I would have no doubt, having regard to well settled principles of interpretation, that when the word &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; is used in reference to the person supplying, this requires the State to prove <i>mens rea</i> before that person can commit the offence.  I would disagree with the Minister's interpretation of that section, and with respect, I would disagree with the advice he received in that regard.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I disagree with him when he says that the position is preserved by the 1861 Act.  It is preserved where the device is supplied and intention can be proved, but that is as far as the position is preserved; it does not preserve or protect the position where the device is in this grey area, a scientifically imprecise area, as to whether it is a contraceptive or an abortifacient. I concede that there are devices and it is impossible to tell which they are, whether they are contraceptives or abortifacients.  If this Bill passes, as it is drafted at the moment, it will not be an offence to supply these doubtful articles because (a) there is no way of knowing what they are and it is open to a person to say they are contraceptives.  I am suggesting that amendment No. 8 plugs that loophole by a committee saying this is a doubtful thing, this is an abortifacient under this Act and therefore out of bounds.  If you do not provide for that committee, there is no way in which a court can be told that the thing is one or <Col N="1174" /> the other and the benefit of the doubt must go to the defendant.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is totally unnecessary if the Minister's case is right, because the 1861 Act is law and is there in the Statute Book.  Why does the Minister have to come in with this section 10 and tell us what we already know, that the 1861 Act is the law against abortion.  I cannot see any need for section 10 unless there is some residue of doubt in the Minister's mind, some worry that there is, unwittingly perhaps, some new situation arising from this Bill that the 1861 Act does not cover or might not be seen to cover. The doubt is caused by the availability of a device, the effect of which nobody can be sure about.  I am asking the Minister to agree to set up a committee to advise him as to whether a particular thing is, or may be, an abortifacient even though it is, or is also presented as being, a contraceptive.  If he agrees, if this committee come into operation they may say that this thing is an abortifacient, even though it could have all these other effects.</P>
    <P>What we need is a provision in this Bill to make the supply, importation and so on of that doubtful device an offence, because it is not an offence under the 1861 Act as the law presently stands for two reasons.  One, intent would have to be proved, and that would be well nigh impossible because it could be refuted by the defendant saying &ldquo;this is a contraceptive and it is not intended to procure miscarriage&rdquo;, or, secondly, &ldquo;the 1861 Act does not apply at all because there is no scientific way of proving that the particular device is abortifacient&rdquo;. That is why I say that if the Bill becomes law, as it presently stands, there will be no sanction whatever against persons who supply articles and who do not know and do not care, whether the effect is contraceptive or abortifacient.  Such articles can be supplied with impunity if this Bill goes into law as presently drafted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 23, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments have been tabled for the first time on Report Stage.  They arose from the long discussion on Committee Stage on section 3 of the Bill relating to family planning services and relating in particular to the future, or what appears to be a lack of future, of the family planning clinics.  There was a very long drawn-out discussion.  It appeared to irritate the Minister that the discussion went on for so long but it was very difficult to get from him any clear idea of what his intentions were in relation to the powers he was taking under this section, and, in particular, how he would exercise those powers in relation to the family planning clinics.  However, after a considerable period it seemed to become clear that there had to be a certain gap between the coming into effect of the Act itself and of this section and the possible future licensing or consent for the operation of a family planning clinic, even if that family planning clinic fully satisfies the regulations and the criteria contained in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people, even in the Fianna Fáil Party, who do not appear to realise that the section as it stands appears necessarily to mean the ending of all family planning clinics in the State who give advice on artificial contraceptives unless, at some future time, the Minister decides to consent to them operating within the terms of the Act either purely on an advisory basis or on a basis of being able to sell contraceptives if there is a pharmacist and a pharmacy actually physically located on the premises of the family planning clinic.  I think many people still think the situation is that, after the Act comes into being, the Minister may reflect on the matter and decide that he will or will not consent to the operation of some or all of the family planning clinics.  Perhaps the Minister felt, when he originally brought in this Bill, that he had reserved himself that much discretion in the matter. It seems clear that the wording of the relevant subsection as it stands would preclude the Minister having any discretion and that he would necessarily have <Col N="1176" /> to wait a period of time before he could favourably consider any application from a family planning clinic to continue to offer a service to the public.  When we discussed this the major clarification came from the Minister himself.  He explained what was meant by the two phrases on which he would have to satisfy himself under section 3 (3) (b). Section 3 (3) has two parts to it.  Paragraph (a) provides:</P>
    <P>A person other than a health board may, with the consent of the Minister and in accordance with regulations for the purposes of this subsection, make available a family planning service, not being exclusively a family planning service such as is referred to in subsection (2).</P>
    <P>meaning a family planning service that extends to advice about contraceptives. Paragraph (b) provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not give his consent to the making available of a family planning service under this subsection unless he is satisfied that it is in the public interest to give it and that the service is reasonably required to meet a particular need.</P>
    <P>Under this section the Minister has to satisfy himself on two counts, first, that it is in the public interest and, secondly, that it is reasonably required to meet a particular need.  When pressed by a number of us on Committee Stage, the Minister expressed the view that a particular need in that subsection meant that the system which he proposed to establish under this Bill had broken down or had proved to be inadequate.

      <P>When the official Report comes out, I hope tomorrow, we can all look to see what the Minister said about a particular need.  If in his reply he gives some other definition of what is meant by a particular need then perhaps <Col N="1177" /> some of the concern which I feel about the operation of this subsection may be removed.  The Minister said that&mdash;or I understood him to have said&mdash;a particular need meant he would have to be satisfied that there was an inadequacy, or a loophole, or a failure in the system which he was establishing under the Act which would be operating through the GP and the pharmacy with family planning clinics offering a natural family planning service and the health boards offering this kind of service.  The difficulty we identified on Committee Stage was that this would necessarily involve a gap in time, perhaps months, even years, before the Minister would be in a position to comply with the subsection and to satisfy himself that it was in the public interest and that it was reasonably required to meet a particular need.</P>
      <P>Senator Keating put it to him at that stage that it was a very unusual provision to have it phrased in the negative, &ldquo;that the Minister shall not give his consent unless he is satisfied&rdquo; on the two counts.  He suggested it would avoid this problem of necessarily requiring dislocation if the section were recast in a positive sense that the Minister &ldquo;shall give his consent to the making available of a family planning service under this subsection unless he is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to give it and that the service is not reasonably required to meet a particular need&rdquo;.  I understood the Minister to say he would be prepared to accept an amendment along those lines, except that it would necessitate going back to the Dáil.  Once again I suppose we will have to wait for the Official Report to see if my understanding was correct, I thought I heard him say that he would be prepared to accept an amendment, which has now been tabled for Report Stage, which would express the particular requirements of this subsection in a positive rather than a negative way, and would avoid this problem of dislocation of the services of the family planning clinic before the Minister could, in the future, license them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the subsection read as this amendment proposes, it would read that &ldquo;the Minister shall give his consent to the making available of a family planning <Col N="1178" /> service under this subsection, unless he is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to give it and that the service is not reasonably required to meet a particular need&rdquo;.  This, we believe, would have a number of advantages.  It would be less brutal and less abrupt in its operation than the present subsection.  The Minister would be in a position, if he was satisfied at some future time that the operation of a particular family planning clinic was not in the public interest and did not satisfy a particular need, to withdraw his consent or he could refuse a future application for consent.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is saying here&mdash;and it is a very unusual provision&mdash;is that once this section comes into effect, the services being offered by the family planning clinics cease, or certainly cease to be lawful, cease to be able to be operated under the terms of this Bill until and unless at some future time either the people involved in these existing clinics, who at that stage will be out of a job and out of lawful activity, or some other people in some other town or city in Ireland, apply to the Minister and seek to satisfy him that there is, in the public interest and to satisfy a particular need, a necessity to have a family planning clinic in that area.</P>
    <P>When we were teasing out the implications of this section on Committee Stage we went a very long way to try to understand the Minister's intentions.  It would be putting it politely to say he was coy.  He was determined not to let the House know what his intentions were in relation to the family planning clinics. As we pursued the matter, and as we looked carefully at the small print, clause by clause, it became clear from the point of view of legal interpretation that the Minister appeared to be deliberately ensuring that there would be dislocation.  He appeared to be intending that, as soon as this section came into effect, the family planning clinics would be unlawful if they continued in their present activities and that there would have to be a period of time before he could lawfully exercise a statutory consent and license any family planning clinics, even to offer an advisory service in the State. If that is his intention, it would have <Col N="1179" /> been more forthcoming, to say the least, if, when the Bill was introduced in the Dáil for Second Reading, he had made this intention clear.  Then the people who were examining the impact of the Bill could have assessed the situation in a much more accurate and clear manner.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a number of members of the Government party, either in the other House or in this House, appreciated that this section appears to sound the deathknell of family planning clinics and that it will be only at some future time, if the strict statutory criteria are satisfied, that the Minister will be in a position to exercise a statutory discretion and license a family planning clinic or enable a health board to exercise the broader family planning services, including both natural and artificial methods of family planning, in a particular area.</P>
    <P>The real problem is that if this is an accurate assessment of the impact of this subsection we will have a very difficult period over the next few years for many women who seek artificial contraceptives, who, until now, have been able to go to the family planning clinics to get them or have been able to import them, through the post, for their private use. The difficulty is that even if the alternative system of the general practitioner and the pharmacist is established straightaway, it is not going to operate in the full and supportive sense of a comprehensive family planning service.  It will depend on the training and disposition of individual GPs.  As was pointed out at great length on Second and Committee Stages there is not full medical training in methods of family planning for general practitioners; there are some general practitioners who are very well equipped to take on this responsibility; there are others who are not properly trained or equipped and who may avail of the conscientious objection clause in section 11.  There will be very real problems for women who are seeking help.  There will be the arbitrary factor that they will be dependent on the training and disposition of their doctor.  They will not have any alternative source of supply, or any alternative advisory body to go to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> It seems, in all humanity and compassion, that the Minister ought to have framed his discretion in such a way that if he does not agree with the operation of family planning clinics&mdash;he is entitled to his view on the matter, he is the Minister for Health&mdash;he could at least exercise his statutory discretion in such a way as to allow them to continue in operation until an alternative system is working well and until he can be sure that these who seek and who need advice on family planning and on the methods of family planning involving contraceptives, will get that kind of advice.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of this legislation should have been on minimising the degree of disruption and tension for people in this intimate area of their family life.  If the Minister feels, as he is entitled as Minister for Health to feel, that it is a better system to have family planning services offered and operated through the general practitioner, to increase the training and so on of general practitioners, and to legalise the sale under the particular provisions of the Bill through pharmacies, once there has been an authorisation or prescription from a general practitioner, I should have thought it would have been much more in conformity with his responsibilities as Minister for Health to provide an interim period when people could go, as they have done in the past, to the family planning clinics.  After a period of time, when he had satisfied himself that it was no longer in the public interest, and that there was no longer a particular need for the family planning services of the clinics, he would then say he would not license any future family planning clinics because he wanted the services to be offered in the way prescribed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In all his contributions in the Dáil and in this House I have not heard him make the case that the family planning clinics &mdash;one, two or all of them&mdash;are, at the moment, operating in a manner that is contrary to the public interest.  I have not heard him make the case that they are not deserving of any consideration from him.  I have not heard him make the case that they are contrary in a definite way to the public interest.  What he has said a number of times and in a number of different ways is that he would prefer to <Col N="1181" /> have the family planning services operating under his scheme under the Bill, namely, through the services of the general practitioner and the sale of contraceptives by a pharmacist.</P>
    <P>It is a unique instance, as was emphasised on Committee Stage, that people's jobs, future employment and commitment&mdash;there is a great deal of commitment involved on the part of the people who run the family planning services&mdash;are being brutally disregarded by the operation of this subsection.  From the moment the subsection comes into effect, their activities will be unlawful. The only alternative for them, if they choose to make an application, or for somebody else who chooses to seek to fill the gap, would be at a future time to apply to the Minister when he would have had sufficient time and opportunity to satisfy himself positively on two counts: that it was in the public interest and that it served a particular need.</P>
    <P>The Minister may try to say that any statutory provision which refers to the Minister being satisfied gives him a discretion and that I am splitting legal hairs by pointing out how narrow that discretion appears to be and the particular sequence of the way in which he has to exercise that discretion.  There has to be a gap in time before the Minister can satisfy himself on the two counts&mdash;that it is in the public interest and that the service is reasonably required to meet a particular need.  If the Minister looked at the subsection in a different way and said that as long as he is satisfied he can consent, and when he did consent to the operation of a family planning clinic, simultaneously with the coming into operation of this section, might that consent not be challenged?  Might it not be possible for those who would seek to challenge the exercise of the services of a family planning clinic to claim that the Minister could not, in law, have satisfied himself that it was reasonably required to meet a particular need?  The Minister explained that the particular need in those circumstances means the failure of the overall system in the Bill to operate in a particular area, either because doctors or chemists have pleaded conscientious objection or because there are not enough doctors in the area who are <Col N="1182" /> trained in family planning services, or for some other reason.  The Minister, even though he gives himself wide power under this section and even though he has a lot of discretion throughout this Bill, cannot invent statutory requirements. They have to exist.  If there is a sequence provided in a subsection the Minister is bound by that sequence and has to operate under it.</P>
    <P>These amendments are tabled in the hope that the Minister will be prepared to go back to the Dáil on this one section, that he will be prepared to accept the amendment, which he appeared to find no difficulty in accepting in principle on Committee Stage, and that he will remove the threat of the inevitability of termination of the legal activities of the family planning clinics as they operate at the moment.  They are under a very unusual threat for a body carrying out a service which many people, many doctors, many women in the State regard as essential.  They are doing so with great commitment and good faith. They are entitled, I would submit, to continue in operation unless the Minister is positively satisfied after due inquiry that the continued operation of these clinics is not in the public interest and does not serve a particular need.  They should have the benefit of the doubt unless the Minister is satisfied that they are positively contrary to the public interest. Instead of that, this is a brutal and abrupt measure which will terminate their existence but make it possible at some future time for the Minister to consent, if he is satisfied on two counts, to some family planning clinic operating in the future.</P>
    <P>I am still convinced that members of the Fianna Fáil Party do not appreciate the full impact of the subsection.  I know this from a private conversation with one or two of them in the past week, including one Cabinet Minister.  I do not think that was the intent of this section. Unlike so many other sections of the Bill it does not seem to have any loophole in it.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator FitzGerald when he pointed out that it would appear to be both lawful and possible under this Bill to sell contraceptives to an unmarried person.  There are lots <Col N="1183" /> of ways in which this can be done under the relevant section of the Bill but this particular provision appears to be draconian and watertight.  It appears that once this Bill come into effect the family planning clinics will not be able to continue in lawful operation.  They are not being given any benefit of the doubt or any opportunity to justify themselves and show that the service they offer is in the public interest.  It is very hard to find in any other like measure such a brutal and inevitable provision against which they appear to have no comeback, even a comeback of justifying themselves in the interest of natural justice.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. It is an awful pity that we cannot sit around a table and negotiate on this matter.  It is anyone's argument as to whether the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; should be removed having regard to the following subsections.  I would favour the deletion of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the point of view I expressed in my Second Stage speech that a very substantial minority were being discriminated against, I feel the present wording does not give an unequivocal declaration of public policy on this question of family planning services. It does not give support to those of us who do not wish to discriminate and because of the way it is worded we now feel compelled by social pressures to do so.  I am a little concerned as to whether it is not discriminatory in the sense that there is very little redress for the substantial majority, if the Minister uses the very strong word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; particularly when it is followed by the word &ldquo;not&rdquo;. The difference of a word would be the suitable way to deal with it.</P>
      <P>If we were talking across the table about this matter we might be able to reach a position where there would be greater reassurance that the point I made is not as big a worry as it might appear to be, that there would be the availability of redress and that some prejudicial behaviour could be discouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the removal of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; and the subsequent substitution of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; in other areas of the subsections, this would do the three <Col N="1184" /> things that I suggested and would form an unequivocal declaration of public policy.  It would give support to the minorities who feel they are being discriminated against and it would not put under social pressure those who do not wish to discriminate against the idea or the concept of family planning services. It would also do something to let the substantial majority know that there is redress and that the behaviour that issues from prejudice will be discouraged by the Minister in the sense that he will recognise that a need exists.</P>
    <P>If the words were changed those concerns would be met.  We are not negotiating; we are talking about it in public. Perhaps some further views from the Minister in this particular area might go a long way to allay the concerns I expressed.</P>

      <P>It was quite clear to me after the Committee Stage debate, which confirmed my reading of the section, that following the passage of the Bill the so-called family planning clinics will have come to the end of their day.  Lest there be any doubt about that I would urge the Minister to use the occasion of this further amendment to reassure the vast majority of the public that this will be the case after the Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>I read the Second Stage debate in the Official Report and I was quite horrified on seeing the figures and statistics which Senator Robinson quoted as to the people who are being accommodated in these clinics.  It is appallingly clear that the contribution of these clinics to casual or, indeed, even planned promiscuity is not insignificant.  I have no doubt that the Minister would be striking a welcome note for the majority of the people in the country if he were now to assure them that these clinics are coming to an end.  In that connection I would urge the Minister at this stage to be prepared for an outcry when he comes to enforce the law against them, but nevertheless to take reassurance of the fact that in enforcing the law against them, he will have the backing&mdash;albeit silent&mdash;of the vast majority of the people.</P>

      <P>I must say the prospect of myself being a coy little fellow is a new dimension which I was fascinated to consider.  It is an improvement on being divisive and sectarian and all the other pejoratives that were hurled in my direction during the course of this debate. Coyness is a delightful little trait which I would not entirely reject.</P>
      <P>There is no particular significance in amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4.  I do not think they would add to or take from this section in any way.  The purpose and effect of the section are crystal clear.  Section 3 is to the effect that, if the Minister is satisfied that there is a need for it in the public interest, he may arrange for the provision of a family planning service by somebody other than a health board. The section happens to be put in the negative way but, allowing for all the negatives in it, that is exactly what it means.  If one takes out all the negatives I have in the section and put in the negatives Senator Robinson wants to put in by means of the amendment, the section still means exactly the same thing.  It is perhaps arguable that there would be a slight difference of emphasis in Senator Robinson's recast section, but it would be no more than that.  The basic meaning of the section would still be exactly as it is, that the Minister for Health of the day can only license a family planning clinic if he is of the opinion that it is in the public interest and that there is a need for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that I am being in any way obstructive in not accepting any of these three amendments.  They do not really alter the position as it will be when the legislation is passed.  The position about family planning services will be that if there is a need in an area or for a class of people or from any other point of view for a family planning service being provided by way of a clinic, this can be done.  The only stipulation will be that <Col N="1186" /> such a clinic will have to conform with the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by referring briefly to the contribution by Senator Cooney which is very much at the other end of the spectrum from my own approach to this problem.  He said he was horrified by statistics that I had put on the record of the House emanating from a study by Dr. Eimer Bowman of single people attending the family planning clinics.  Senator Conroy rightly pointed out it was a small sample; there were 50 people involved.</P>
      <P>I am often interested in the reaction of Senators to statistics, which they do not like, put on the record of the House.  This was a factual study; it dealt with the reality.  The reality is one which Senator Cooney and Senator Cranitch do not like at all.  I would make the same response to Senator Cooney as I did to Senator Cranitch.  What does he think these people will do when this legislation is passed?  Does he really think they will change overnight their moral attitudes, their own decisions and their relationships?  Does he not think that there is far more likelihood that they will seek alternative methods of getting contraceptives within the State?  I would agree with Senator Alexis FitzGerald that it will be possible for single people to get an authorisation or prescription for contraceptives from practitioners under the relevant sections of the Bill.  That will be more difficult and they will, no doubt, be substantially discouraged from that particular route unless they are fairly satisfied that they will get an authorisation or a prescription.  Those who are fortunate enough to travel may bring back a quantity in their private baggage or some of them may risk the severe penalties in the Bill and try to import contraceptives through the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that a certain number of young people will take a risk of pregnancy and then will be faced with the very considerable pressures in our society which influence and come close to compelling young girls or women when they have an unwanted pregnancy to seek the only other alternative open to them and go to England and have an abortion.  This will be a grave problem <Col N="1187" /> for us all.  Senators and Deputies on all sides of the Houses in the course of the passage of this Bill have deplored the existing abortion statistics.  When we look at the fact that we cannot legislate for morality in legislation like this we must be very aware that reality will continue but will seek other ways of accommodating itself.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the statistics compiled by a medical practitioner with an expertise in an area who had done a study of people visiting a family planning clinic should be the subject of moral condemnation and a justification in themselves for the legislation, so that we can all go home happily realising that this Bill is going to end all that.  Surely we must have a greater understanding of the situation of a number of young people who make their own choices, have their own ideas about what is moral for them or what is going to be their practice in their sexual relations.  This legislation will not affect them at all, although it may be more difficult for them to take the kind of precautions which other societies spend a great deal of time trying to bring to the attention of young people.  What we are doing is closing off a number of options which are open to young people at the moment.  By doing so we may be facing a much graver problem and may put those young people under very considerable pressure indeed. I do not think that reference to statistics like that can really be evidence that the family planning clinics are not acting in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not really answer that point.  He seemed to be prepared to condemn the family planning clinics as they exist at the moment without giving them an opportunity to justify the service they have provided over the last decade and without even giving to the thousands of women who availed of the service an opportunity to express their view on the matter.  There is no doubt, in talking about public opinion, that the most relevant view in Ireland is that of women of child-bearing age.  Unfortunately, because of the structure of our democratic institutions it is not a view which is expressed fully enough or with the weight which it deserves on this issue. <Col N="1188" /> It is the male view&mdash;and a conservative male view at that&mdash;which tends to get expression.</P>
    <P>If we thought that we were presiding at the trial and the apparent condemnation of the family planning clinics, in all fairness we would seek to know more about the work they have done, the services they offer and about the kind of supportive advisory work they have given to women on all kinds of issues, not just advice on methods of contraception but also advice on sterility, on natural methods of family planning, advice on frigidity and the whole area of sexual relations and sexual behaviour. They gave an enormous informative support to women in Ireland who had sought it and travelled great distances at times to get this type of help.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues to be coy&mdash;I will use that polite term that seems to appeal to him.  He refuses to say outright what has become clear both to Senator Cooney and to myself, though obviously we greet it with different reactions.  He refuses to say outright that this is the deathknell of the family planning clinics as they operate in our society.  He makes it clear that what he has reserved for himself in the subsection is the power some time in the future, if he is satisfied on the two counts that it is in the public interest and that there is a particular need either in a particular area or among a particular class of persons, to consent to the operation of a clinic provided it abides by the regulations under this section. I come back to the point I was making.  This amendment does not mean the same thing as the section as it is drafted.  The section as it is drafted necessarily closes the family planning clinics the day this section comes into effect. The amendment would require the Minister to consent to the continuance of the operation of the family planning clinics unless he was satisfied that it was not in the public interest and that there was not a particular need for the services offered by the family planning clinics.</P>
    <P>I believe that the operation of the family planning clinics has been in the public interest for the last decade.  One can be prepared to examine the advice that they have been giving and the services they have been offering; there can <Col N="1189" /> be regulations to control standards and age limits or any other kind of regulations. The service they have offered is in the public interest and it has satisfied a genuine need in our society.  There are thousands of women who are extremely greatful to the family planning clinics for the services they have offered.  They are being condemned without a hearing by the operation of this section.  All the Minister is saying is that if he is satisfied some time in the future, then he may license a body other than a health board to offer a family planning service in a particular area or to a particular class of person.</P>
    <P>It is a very callous dismissal of the services and the commitment of a considerable number of doctors and paramedical people who have given of their time and expertise and have done it not for any material gain on their part but because they saw, understood and felt the need.  I regret that the attitude of the Minister is one of dismissing this as not being a matter of concern to him.  This is something which is unique in my experience in looking at legislation.  The position is that as of whatever date in September this section will come into effect the activities of a considerable number of people will be unlawful and a whole service which has operated for nigh on ten years will be closed and considered to be illegal, leaving open just this residual possibility that in the future people who come together to open a family planning clinic, if they can satisfy the Minister that it is in the public interest, may obtain a licence.</P>
    <P>When a service is in operation and when tens of thousands of Irish women have gone along for advice and help to this particular service, why should it not have the benefit of the doubt that it serves a particular need?  Why can the Minister not approach the whole problem by saying that he will ensure that there is an alternative service offering family planning advice; that he will build this up over the next few years and then if he is satisfied that that method fills the need he will not continue to allow family planning clinics to operate as they have done?  That seems to be the approach which would be based on a sense of justice and humanity, based on <Col N="1190" /> a respect for people who have a commitment to offer medical services and advice and help in this area and who have given of their time and their efforts over the years to it.</P>
    <P>This is a much more cruel and brutal provision than has as yet been appreciated and I hope at this late stage that the ordinary woman of child-bearing age will realise just how brutal and how abrupt it is.  The family planning clinics will be rendered unlawful instantly this Bill is passed without a hearing or an opportunity to justify their activities in the public interest, without any guarantee that there will be an effective substitute and with only the gradual building up of this alternative system involving the general practitioner and the pharmacist.  This will not be a welcome alternative to a considerable number of couples in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If one looks again at the evidence from the Ballinteer survey to which I referred on Second Stage, it is clear that the people in this area, when they were seeking to have professional advice on family planning, did not feel that the GP offering that advice was preferable to a family planning clinic within their health service.  That is what they wanted because they know that a family planning clinic can be more approachable, more supportive and can have a climate which is less intimidating and has more time for them and for their problems, which is more understanding in drawing them out and in helping them to understand their own sexuality and to have confidence in themselves.  It is very sad that this whole possibility is being closed to women in this very abrupt and nuanced way.  It is only in the final Stages of the Bill in this House that the full impact of it becomes clear.  The majority of people still believe that it will be possible for the Minister to consent to the operation of the family planning clinics, that they may very well apply for a licence and will probably continue in operation side by side with the general practitioner and pharmacist.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister still refuses to say so, his intentions are now perfectly clear.  He cannot in any case consent to the operations of the family clinics for a period of time and there will inevitably <Col N="1191" /> be the shutting of the doors of the existing clinics and consequently the loss of the expertise and the loss of the premises.  One cannot help keep up premises without being able to offer a service and remaining viable by accepting payment or contributions for that service.  Without giving them any opportunity of justifying themselves in the public interest we in passing this section are necessarily deciding that the clinics have no merit, should not be able to continue and should not be able to reopen in the future unless the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest and that there is a particular need.  They do not have the benefit of the doubt that they are operating in a way that shows a need.  Tens of thousands of women do not seem to be able to justify the need for this type of service.</P>
    <P>The Minister is turning a blind eye to the hardship, tension and dislocation which will occur over the next few years. I hope the women of Ireland are aware of this; if nothing else it will show the unreality in which this entire debate has taken place, the non-issues that we have been largely discussing and the lack either of willingness or, perhaps, ability of Members of this House to see a situation as it really is and to try to provide legislation which would be helpful and supportive and which would show a concern that couples who wanted to seek advice on the whole range of family planning methods and all the other matters relating to the relationship on which they might seek advice, would have it readily available to them.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister is dodging this yet again; he is not going to spell out the full impact of this section.  It is clear to all of us&mdash;it is certainly clear to Senator Cooney and myself&mdash;than when this section comes into effect it is the end of the family planning clinics in any activity at all, even in the advisory activity.</P>

      <P>This amendment was tabled to cater for a problem which was identified by Senator Alex FitzGerald on Committee Stage.  Once again it is regrettable that we do not have before us the Official Report of the Committee Stage debate. It would be helpful to be able to refer to the passage where Senator FitzGerald made, at considerable length, the point that in section 4 of the Bill there is a provision for the making of regulations but it only relates to regulations under subsection (1) referring to sale.</P>
      <P>The Minister in this section is taking power to make regulations relating to the sale of contraceptives but he is not seeking any power at all in relation to regulations for the prescribing of contraceptives. Senator FitzGerald pointed out that this is a serious loophole in this legislation which was of particular concern to him.  It seemed to leave open the possibility not only of contraceptives being prescribed to single people&mdash;I agree with him here, I think that is open under this particular section&mdash;but also the possibility of contraceptives being prescribed to people of any age.  It does not fit into the rest of the structure of the Bill where the Minister takes very wide power to make regulations.  It is hard to understand, since that is his approach and since he is concerned to have safeguards in the Bill, why he has omitted to give himself the possibility of introducing regulations to provide that contraceptives would not be prescribed to persons below a certain age.  Perhaps he has some reason for doing this.  In any case I thought it was important when the problem had been highlighted by Senator FitzGerald to table an amendment for Report Stage so that we could hear the Minister's view on this point.</P>

      <P>Section 4 indicates that the Minister may make regulations dealing with the sale of contraceptives.  The effect of the amendment would be to give the Minister power to make regulations on matters arising out of subsection (2), namely, the prescribing and authorisation of contraceptives.  I gather that Senator Robinson does not disagree with the need to have regulations governing the sale, so that side of the section as it stands is apparently all right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the amendment now.  We are really concerned here with whether or not it would be necessary for the Minister to take power in this section to make regulations governing the circumstances under which medical practitioners could issue prescriptions or authorisations.  I do not think that is necessary.  Section 2 is quite clear.  It indicates the circumstances under which a registered medical practitioner can issue a prescription or authorisation and it also indicates the effect of issuing such a prescription or authorisation.  I would not deem it appropriate that the Minister should attempt by regulations to limit or control or interfere in any way with the exercise by a medical practitioner of his professional functions.  In fact, the Bill is very specific in another part of it that nothing in the legislation should interfere with the clinical relationship between a doctor and his patient.  If that principle is to be upheld, and I believe it should be upheld, then the idea of making regulations governing the issue of prescriptions or authorisations would not be sensible.  On the one hand, we would be indicating that we do not intend to interfere in this legislation with the clinical right of a doctor to deal with his patient as he sees fit in accordance with his medical opinion and professional capacity and, on the other hand, we would be saying we should make regulations governing his <Col N="1194" /> capacity to issue prescriptions and authorisations.</P>
      <P>If there is any question of doctors not behaving properly under this section or indeed in any other circumstances, we now have section 45 of the Medical Practitioners Act which deals with the behaviour of doctors and their adherence to professional codes of conduct and ethical behaviour and any matters which would arise in regard to the behaviour of a doctor would be dealt with under section 45 of that Act.</P>
      <P>For all these reasons there will not arise any need for the Minister for Health to make regulations governing these matters and, secondly, it would not be desirable that he should do so. Therefore, I do not think that the purpose of the amendment to give the Minister power to make regulations governing the activities of registered medical practitioners under subsection (2) is called for.</P>

      <P>As I explained, I tabled this amendment because of the deep concern expressed by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  He made it clear that he would not be in favour of legislation which tried within itself to confine the availability of contraceptives to married people; in other words, he made what the Minister would call a liberal contribution in this matter.  He went to some lengths to express his concern at the fact that the Minister had not reserved any power to make regulations providing for any control of age in respect of which they might be prescribed.  Moreover, the impact of the section was that once the prescription or authorisation was made, the pharmacist would have no discretion to question the particular prescription or authorisation and it does not appear that it could be questioned in any other forum.  However, the purpose of tabling the amendment was to ensure that the Minister was satisfied that there is no danger arising out of the section or no undue cause for worry or concern.  I am satisfied that the tabling of the amendment has given the Minister a further opportunity to look into the matter and I am not going to press the amendment any further.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 35 and 36.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 4.  It seeks to delete subsection (3) of section 4.  Subsection (3) provides:</P>
      <P>a person shall not supply contraceptives otherwise than by way of sale under and in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the kind of problem that I referred to on Committee Stage could not happen.  On Committee Stage it was clearly established that the effect of this section as a whole was that if a medical practitioner was approached by a woman who sought a contraceptive that would require fitting, for example, the contraceptive cap, she would not be able to take away with her the cap that he had fitted.  Instead there would be the burdensome and expensive, and what appeared to be the ridiculous, process of the woman going to the doctor and after discussion and explanation deciding that she wanted to use the contraceptive cap which, as Senator Keating said, is regarded as a much more desirable kind of contraceptive than the contraceptive pill because it does not have any similar side-affects or any potential dangers for a woman.  If the decision was taken to choose the contraceptive cap as the form of contraceptive and the doctor fitted the woman, she would then have to hand back to him the particular cap with which she had been fitted.  She would then have to get from him a prescription or authorisation, go to the chemist, acquire the particular item, come back to her doctor&mdash;therefore paying for a second visit&mdash;and have the cap fitted this time as her property so that then she could take it away with her and use it whenever she wished to in her marriage relationship.  This is so contrary to the present practice and is so artificial and absurd that it seemed desirable to table an amendment to remove this new prohibition on the supply of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is the kind of situation which does arise in the medical approach and medical practice, whether in the general <Col N="1196" /> practitioner or family planning clinic context, that when a patient is being advised on the particular form of contraceptive if it requires to be fitted then the patient normally takes that particular contraceptive away because it is one that has been fitted, one that is safe and secure and one in which the patient would have confidence in the future. Therefore, as I say, this amendment is designed to cope expressly with that particular situation and also to remove the prohibition on supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his opening speech to the activities of commercial multinational bodies and the profits being made.  We need not be concerned here about the profits of multinationals because we are talking about the supply of contraceptives in the context of their being supplied by doctors and by those who have expertise in the area. Therefore, as I say, this would remove one of the further anomalies of the very cumbersome mechanism devised by the Minister for the administering of family planning services in the State.</P>

      <P>In page 4, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 42 to and including &ldquo;use&rdquo; in line 44.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again, one attempts even to the last to remove some of the more weird and wonderful provisions from this legislation and one of these has to be the subsection dealing with the quantity of contraceptives which people may import in their private luggage.  As was emphasised, I think on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, the whole idea of discriminating in favour of those who are in a position to travel raises important questions in itself.  Those of the middle classes and the upper middle classes who are able to travel outside the country have access to contraceptives which those within the country will not have.  The rather limited purpose of this amendment, tabled as it is on Report Stage, is to remove the more ludicrous and ridiculous part of the subsection.  As <Col N="1197" /> it reads at the moment subsection (5) (1) (a) provides that &ldquo;a person shall not import contraceptives into the State unless they are part of his personal luggage accompanying him when he is entering the State and their quantity is not such as to indicate that they are not solely for his own use&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to drop all the words following the word &ldquo;luggage&rdquo; so that a person would not be able to import contraceptives into the State unless &ldquo;(a) they are part of his personal luggage&rdquo;.  This is a discriminatory and undesirable limitation but at least it makes some kind of sense.  It is clear that a person can bring in contraceptives in his or her personal luggage.  The problem with the formula as it is contained in this subsection is that it leaves it open to the customs official to assess, presumably, the sexual prowess, or the marital fidelity, or some other strange criterion, of the person seeking to import the contraceptive and can refuse to allow that particular person to take either the whole of the quantity or half the quantity of contraceptives that the person was seeking to import.</P>
    <P>The even more ludicrous part of it all is that there is no time scale here.  It does not say they are part of his personal luggage accompanying him when he is entering the State and constitute a month's supply or a year's supply. Presumably, a person can turn to the customs official and say, &ldquo;This is a supply which I envisage I need over the next ten years&rdquo;.  I am sure this would be of great interest to the tourist as he listens to the conversation between either a citizen returning to the country or a foreigner coming into the country having to justify himself to a customs official. The subsection as it stands is riddled with ludicrous anomalies.  It is an undesirable provision in the first instance and the amendment is to try at least to cut out some of its more bizarre aspects.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment and endorse Senator Robinson's plea for the removal of these ridiculous words and this daft criterion.  I had sympathy with the Minister when he described his <Col N="1198" /> Bill initially as &ldquo;an Irish Bill to meet an Irish problem&rdquo; but I think he is bringing the matter into the realm of an Irish joke if he leaves these words in the subsection.</P>

      <P>The only thing I can say about it is that if it were not put in here Senator Robinson would have a field day drawing our attention to the ludicrous situations which would apply if visitors and travellers were not allowed to import any contraceptives in their luggage. So, it is &ldquo;Heads you win and tails I lose&rdquo;.  I am not madly in love with this wretched paragraph (a) but I have already described it as the line of least embarrassment, of least difficulty.  If we are going to have control of importation and the whole Bill is based on that principle, then we must have control of importation by persons, by individual travellers.  So either we have a total prohibition on travellers bringing in artificial contraceptives into the country&mdash;I know that would be very acceptable to Senator Cranitch; he would very much like me to propose the deletion of the subsection altogether&mdash;or alternatively we try to have some sort of reasonable compromise and indicate that travellers, visitors, tourists and other persons coming into the country may bring some reasonable number of these things for their own use.  That is all there is in the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what approach I adopted, no matter what I attempted to do to deal with this situation, of course the proposal I would put forward would attract merriment on the basis of <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i>  However, I know our customs officials, I know their training, their courtesy and their experience in these matters, and I am absolutely certain, as certain as I am of anything, that this subsection is not going to cause any particular difficulty.  It is going to be dealt with in a normal, routine, reasonable, common-sense fashion and <Col N="1199" /> there will be no particular difficulty about it.</P>

I am not clear how this provision saves either this House or the country embarrassment. It is a very embarrassing measure to have to justify to anybody outside the country but that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wanted to provide for importation for private use, which was the position following the McGee case, then the way in which it would have been logical to do so would have been to provide not just for this discriminatory provision of being able to bring in a certain amount in one's private luggage, which implies that one has been able to travel abroad, but also to import by post for one's private use.  This was a freedom established following the McGee case and there was no clear evidence of massive abuse of the provision.  The Minister has instead substituted a discriminatory, illogical and ludicrous provision.</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 21 to and including &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; in line 23.</P>
      <P>These are amendments to remove the provision in relation to imprisonment from the relevant section of the Bill. As pointed out on Committee Stage, the penalties under this Bill are very severe indeed for the conduct which the Bill seeks to control.  I was amused when the Minister, in declining to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Cooney for a definition of abortifacient, stated that that is a matter for a Bill dealing with the criminal law&mdash;a matter for the Offences Against the Person Act, or an amendment of that Act under the criminal code.  He seemed to have forgotten that the penalties provided for in this Bill are extremely draconian penalties, which one does not often find in Bills under the criminal law and, as was pointed out on Committee Stage, the Minister is creating 23 criminal offences under the Bill and is providing blanket penalties. He is not distinguishing between what he regards as more serious or less serious offences&mdash;whether the offence is importing a packet of condoms in the post, or operating a family planning service which is not in conformity with the Act; whatever the offence may be, a person is open to the penalties set out in section 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of the discussion on this section on Committee Stage was about what was the normal procedure in stating the fines that might be levied for breaches of the Act.  The Minister clarified a point, of which I certainly was not aware, and of which I think Senator Molony was not aware, that it is now Government practice, when inserting a penalty clause in a provision of this sort, to provide for the possible maximum of the summary jurisdiction&mdash;a fine of £500.  The Minister then tried to suggest that it is also customary not only to provide a fine as a penalty but also to accompany it by a term of imprisonment. That is not the case, nor would it make any sense as Government policy. The Government must always have open to them the possibility of deciding whether the particular penalty for breach will be a monetary sum to be paid, or whether it will be open to the <Col N="1203" /> courts also to have an alternative of imposing a term of imprisonment.  The choice has been made, as it stands in this provision, that not only might a person under this Act be open to a fine of a very considerable amount of money, but also open to the possibility of six months' imprisonment on a first offence and a year's imprisonment for later offences. The fact that a section relating to penalties leaves open a term of imprisonment can reflect a legislative purpose and can be seen as condemning the particular activity and saying that anybody who commits an offence under this Act is somebody who may well be condemned to serve a sentence of six months', or a year's imprisonment if the offence is repeated, or if there is a second or subsequent offence.</P>
    <P>The amendments tabled for Report Stage are amendments which leave to the Minister the full monetary penalty under the Act.  We did attempt to amend this on Committee Stage and failed, so we leave it to the Minister to insert in the sections that, on a first offence, a person may be liable to a fine of up to £500 and on a second or subsequent offence, may be liable to fines up to £5,000, but we seek, even at this late stage, to remove the prison sentences because of the fact that so many of the 23 offences under this Act are new offences and make offences out of conduct that is perfectly lawful today and will be lawful until this Act comes into effect&mdash;the offence of supplying contraceptives; the offence of importing in the post; the offence of operating a family planning clinic that does not comply with the conditions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The difference between the provision in the Family Planning Bill, 1978&mdash;which I would be delighted to be discussing and which is still on the Seanad Order Paper&mdash;and this Bill, is that the only penalties in that particular Bill were penalties which did not relate to the moral choices and individual conduct of persons.  It did not seek to prevent people importing contraceptives for private use.  It sought only to have offences relating to the type of advertising of contraceptives that might be hurtful to, or might encroach on, young people, and it sought to give the Minister for Health a power to control genuine abuses and to safeguard the proper considerations in the matter.  It did not provide that individuals, in their individual choice and conduct, and people operating a family planning clinic which was genuinely filling a need in a particular area, would be open to criminal penalties, including imprisonment. It is not open to me on Report Stage, as I am sure the Cathaoirleach would be the first to say, to enter into a detailed analysis of the differences between the approach and the penalties in the Family Planning Bill, 1978, tabled by the Labour Party, and this Bill, riddled as it is with new offences, making conduct illegal which was not illegal before, making people open to criminal penalties for what is perfectly lawful for them under present circumstances.  The conduct is not&mdash;as it would be described in criminal law&mdash;<i>mala per se;</i> it is not bad in itself.  We are making it bad; we are making it criminal in this Bill.  There is nothing criminal in itself in importing a packet of condoms; there is nothing criminal in itself in a doctor supplying contraceptives to somebody, by fitting them and then giving them some extra contraceptives, or giving them the contraceptive that would fit, if it be a contraceptive cap.  There is nothing tangibly criminal in this activity and it is wrong to open people to the blanket risk of a term of imprisonment for any offence committed under the terms of this Bill.</P>

    <P>I feel very strongly about this because imprisonment is obviously the most <Col N="1205" /> serious incursion into the freedom of the individual.  This is the kind of penalty which is coming under very serious and legitimate questioning in other jurisdictions for any activity.  The degree to which we would impose sentences of imprisonment and confine people in institutions in that way is a measure of civilisation. There are alternative penalties open for breaches of a statute, in particular when the breaches are of the kind that I have described, where the conduct is, at the moment, perfectly lawful but will become criminal and illegal on the passage of this Bill, when it is not endangering the health or welfare of others and when it is the kind of conduct that stems from different views of morality and different attitudes towards sexual relations&mdash;the kinds of attitudes which another society might well tolerate within itself and not make criminal at all.</P>
    <P>Since we are choosing in this Bill to introduce a whole series of new crimes either the Minister should select one or two of these offences which are particularly grave and say that they would be offences for which a term of imprisonment could be imposed, or else he should remove the blanket provision that for any offence under this Bill, when it is passed&mdash;however legitimate and justified it may seem to the individual&mdash;a person could be open to the possibility of a term of imprisonment and for a repetition of the offence that a person could be open to a year's imprisonment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already gone to some trouble to explain that there is nothing particularly vindictive or punitive in this penalty section.  In any legislation that mounts itself to set up a statutory arrangement&mdash;statutory control, statutory provisions regarding sale, importation and all these various matters &mdash;it is essential to have some penalties to ensure adherence to the provisions of the legislation.  There is absolutely no point in providing controls and limitations and licensing provisions and so on, unless you are going to enforce them. <Col N="1206" /> There is nothing involved in section 14 except very normal enforcement provisions. There is no condemnatory aspect involved; there is no punitive aspect involved. Somebody earlier on on Committee Stage talked about making the punishment fit the crime.  There is no element of punishment involved here.  What is involved here are penalties appropriate to the provisions, penalties which are pitched at a level which will ensure that people obey the provisions of the legislation, otherwise there is no point in passing the legislation.</P>
      <P>I am afraid Senator Robinson is hoist on her own petard on this one.  I am sorry that Senator Harte has left us because he formally seconded this amendment, but in the Bill of 1978, introduced by Senator Robinson and supported by Senator Keating and Senator Harte, I think in the interests of the Labour Party, almost exactly the same type of provision was made as is made in my Bill because whoever advised the Senators on the drafting of that Bill realised that this sort of provision is normal and necessary.  For instance, under Senator Robinson's own Bill you can have a fine of £100 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.  It is exactly the same wording as is used in my Bill except that in my Bill £500 now replaces £100 but the six months stands. That fine and that sentence of imprisonment attaches to the offence of importing for sale, selling or offering for sale, or inviting offers to purchase contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, where is the difference? Of course, there is no difference because Senator Robinson's case does not stand up in regard to the legislation now before us.  Whoever helped Senator Robinson to draft the 1978 Bill inserted the penalties for the very same reasons as I have put the provisions into this Bill. They are simply penalties which are designed to ensure adherence to the provisions of the legislation.  They are there to ensure that the provisions will be enforced.  It is a very normal procedure these days, and indeed has been for a considerable time, to associate the maximum <Col N="1207" /> penalty imposable by the District Court with six months imprisonment.  It used be £100 as equated with six months imprisonment; it is now £500 equated with six months imprisonment. Senator Robinson, I hope, will note that I have not increased the six months.  The six months imprisonment in my Bill is exactly the same as it was in her Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to make the point which I made <i>ad nauseam</i> on Committee Stage that these are maxima.  Practically all the offences set out in the Bill are offences which are capable of different degrees and levels of gravity. Therefore, the sensible approach is to lay down maxima in the legislation and leave it to the courts in their interpretation of the statute to apply whatever fine is appropriate having regard to the gravity of the particular offence.  The penalties provided in section 14 are reasonable and normal and are included simply to ensure that the terms of the legislation are enforced when the legislation comes into being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister thinks he is being clever in comparing the penalty provisions in these two different Bills.  In fact, as I pointed out, the problem with the Minister's Bill which was not the problem with the Family Planning Bill, 1978&mdash;which provided for regulation but did so only in controlling what were obviously potential abuses in a major sense&mdash;is that this Bill creates 23 different offences, many of them making criminal what is perfectly legal at the moment.  That is the difference. For those 23 offences there is no distinction being made in relation to the penalties; there is no difference to reflect what the Minister tried to say in his contribution, that the penalties are pitched in such a way as to ensure that the activity will be prevented, or that the regulations will be effective.  They are not pitched at all to meet the particular conduct; they are blanket offences and the penalties are pitched at the maxima. The Minister has certainly conceded that.  That is precisely what we are trying to amend.  If the Minister had selected one or two serious offences and had tagged a term of imprisonment on to a <Col N="1208" /> breach of these, I do not think there would be any amendment tabled.  He has not done that.  He has left people open to the savagery of the maximum penalty of the law for what at the moment is perfectly legal activity.  The Minister referred to the fact that there is provision for a penalty for importation for sale. That penalty would have been open under the Labour Bill&mdash;the Family Planning Bill, 1978&mdash;for importation for commercial exploitation.</P>

      <P>That is the whole point, the whole distinction, and the Minister well understands it.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The 1978 Bill did not create new offences out of what was regarded by many people as perfectly innocent conduct.  There are many people who think it is a perfectly innocent thing to import a packet of condoms in the post.  They will now find themselves, for a first offence, open to six months' imprisonment, or a £500 fine, or both.  If they try it a second time they could receive a year imprisonment and a £5,000 fine.  It is the unwillingness to differentiate, or distinguish, between the 23 different types of offences that is the major problem, in relation to these penalties.  We tabled these amendments to be considered on Report Stage because on Committee Stage, the Minister regarded this as a matter of no concern to him, that he was just putting in these penalty sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> It is important that any Minister who is creating a number of offences out of conduct that was not unlawful beforehand should pay particular attention to the kind of punishment or penalty that may be incurred by the individual if that individual is charged with the offence and comes before our courts.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that these are automatic penalties, or that he is acting on the advice of the law agent, or that he is not particularly concerned, or to attempt to equate them with penalties in a completely different Bill which did not create these new offences, which did not make criminal activity which is perfectly lawful now and which confined the whole range of offences to the minimum under that Bill.  It is a completely different approach.  Within that context the offences do not bear the highly punitive quality they do under this Bill.  For that reason, we tried on Committee Stage to reduce the penalties across the board.</P>
    <P>We try now, on Report Stage, at least to omit the threat of imprisonment as a blanket penalty for even minor infringement of this Bill, or any regulation which the Minister may make under the Bill.  It is a conservative estimate that there are 23 offences to be reckoned with.  When the Minister has issued regulations, the count will probably be a good deal higher.  It is a fairly standard practice in legislation to attempt to distinguish between what are minor infringements&mdash;they may be dealt with in that section and they may give rise to a comparatively small fine&mdash;and what are regarded as real dangers or acts that are so anti-social, so dangerous to the community, so dangerous to the whole structure of the Bill that there must be the more serious penalty of imprisonment. The Minister clearly declines to make any distinction in relation to the penalties; he is clearly not concerned that what is at present perfectly lawful activity he is condemning to these penalties of new prison sentences by the passage of this Bill.  There is no point in persisting further in the matter.  The Minister has certainly had time to concern himself, but does not appear to have changed his attitude with regard to the penalties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On Fifth Stage, I should like to make some general comments on the Bill and on the manner of its passage through both Houses.  I sympathise with the Minister in the difficulty in legalising the availability of contraceptives and doing it in a mature and reasoned fashion.  It is an emotive subject and views, both inside and outside this House, differ very widely on it.  It is sad that, in 1979, a Minister should have chosen to structure the Bill in such a conservative and backward-looking fashion.  This is a Bill that brings us back to the examining of luggage, to the squinting windows, wondering what the prescription is for in the chemist shop, to the lack of privacy of access to family planning clinics which is a feature of the present situation.  This is very regrettable. If the Minister had chosen to tilt the scales the other way, if he had chosen to bring in a Bill which genuinely legalised and liberalised the availability of contraceptives he would undoubtedly have taken on a lot of criticism and he would have paid a certain price for that. However, the Minister has a secure majority in the Lower House and he would have been more than capable of weathering the storm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will be a millstone around his neck throughout his political career; it will always be there.  It will always be pointed to as a Bill which gave in to pressure from particular quarters and put the Minister in such a position that, even when reasonable amendments were offered in the Dáil and in this House, he had no discretion in the matter; he had entered into a prior arrangement with various interest groups and lobbies which deprived him of the necessary discretion to be able to consider reasonable amendments.  That is one of the reasons <Col N="1211" /> why we have had such a thorny and difficult debate, particularly on Committee Stage.  It must have been frustrating for the Minister to hear reasonable arguments and reasonable amendments being put forward and to know that he was not in the position to accept these.  I should like to refer to one amendment which I tried to table today but which the Cathaoirleach ruled out of order on Report Stage.  It was an amendment which would have made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill at the moment provides that the Censorship Board can exclude books or periodicals which are either indecent or obscene, or would advocate abortion.  The reality is that the Censorship of Publications Board have not been able to operate properly and have not been carrying out their functions since 1977, because of the difficulty which has arisen for the board, out of the Supreme Court decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are amending the Censorship of Publications Act of 1946. We are asking the Censorship Board to ban books which are either indecent or obscene, or which advocate abortion.  If this was a normal Bill, if we were genuinely trying to achieve an improved solution by having a debate in both Houses, the Minister would have met this point half-way a long time ago.  The Minister would have gone to the Censorship Board and ascertained that they have a problem and he would have tried to meet that problem.  This is not an ordinary <Col N="1212" /> Bill.  There is no flexibility in it and there is no desire to know.  The Minister does not want to know that the Censorship Board are not functioning properly under the present system; he does not want to know that they cannot carry out the legislative intent in this section, and he probably has not made inquiry of the Censorship Board because he does not want to accept any amendment; he does not want to go back to the Dáil and that is the end of it, so we can talk until we are blue in the face.</P>
      <P>I have only one major regret about this Bill and that is that it will sound the deathknell of the family planning clinics without any hearing, without any opportunity for them to show that they serve a need and that they are acting in the public interest.  It will wipe them out without even an opportunity to present their case.  They will not be able to make submissions that they should continue in operation until it has been established that they are contrary to the public interest or do not serve a particular need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have anything like the same concern about the other provisions of the Bill because, as a number of Senators pointed out, particularly Senator Alexis FitzGerald, the Bill is full of loopholes.  There is no doubt that under section 4 doctors will be in a position to prescribe contraceptives for people who are not married, or will have a broad discretion in this matter and will be able to make both contraceptive advice and contraceptives available.  What will happen, presumably, will be that people will learn that certain doctors are more liberal in this regard than other doctors and their waitingrooms will be fuller, the queues will be longer.  What will be missing for the people, whether married or unmarried, who seek advice in relation to contraceptives will be the kind of supportive atmosphere and help that so many of them received in the context of a family planning clinic.  This is something that we should regret.  It is sad to hear a moral condemnation of the activities of these clinics.  I would place a bet on it that most of the moral condemnation has come from Senators who have never been inside the door of a <Col N="1213" /> family planning clinic.  They are probably afraid to enter the door of a clinic, their feelings on some of them are so high&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the moral condemnation has been the kind of unreal description of a situation which presupposes that provided the activities of the family planning clinics are sufficiently condemned and are then made illegal by the Bill, that this conduct will stop.  It is a totally unreal situation.  The Minister will have to accept that in this Bill, whatever else he is trying to do, he cannot legislate for the morality of our citizens, he cannot prescribe in the legislation for their conduct afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a great many young people the debate that has taken place in both Houses is unreal, artificial and does not in any way meet their needs or the needs of Irish society.  It is passing the whole problem by.  It is one of the difficulties of trying to debate an issue of this sort on which there are differing views by the vehicle of a Bill that actually moves us backwards.  As Senator Keating said, the general thrust of legislation is to move a situation forward, for a Government to give a lead and for a Minister for Health in bringing in the legislation to give a lead.  It is uniquely difficult to make that kind of progress in relation to family planning and in relation to access to advice and services in family planning when the structure is one which creates new offences, moves back into an era of prohibition and does not see the problem as one of trying to ensure that people have the kind of access to trained help, advice and services, so that they, as citizens, as couples, can exercise their human right and make their own choice as to the number and spacing of their children, as to the type of family planning they wish to adopt, the methods they wish to have available, and the kind of advice they wish to have available on those methods.  This is a very sad example of legislation moving us back into an ear of over-regulation and over-concern <Col N="1214" /> which to some extent shows how cut-off the Houses of the Oireachtas and even politicians can become from the real situation in the country.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that we have the youngest population in the European Community.  This is not in any way to suggest that all our young people, or even the majority of young people, want access to contraceptives, or want advice about contraceptives, or are going to have extra-marital relationships, or are going, even within their own married relationship, to want to use artificial contraceptives. What it means is that, for a lot of young people, this whole subject is a non-issue.  It is a non-issue at the moment because if they want advice they know how to get it and if they want to avail of contraceptives they know how to avail of them.  If only we could have had legislation which would be based on a mature faith in our citizens, in particular a mature faith in our young people, which would have made this a non-issue as far as criminal regulation and penalties are concerned, and would have put the emphasis on providing the basis for a full and comprehensive system of family planning, and ensured that those in need of advice, help and access to education would have all these, and would be secure in the knowledge of it.</P>
    <P>My deep regret in relation to this legislation is that section 3 appears to result in the peremptory closure of the family planning clinics, once it becomes law, and that is something which does not seem to be open to any doubt or to any loophole.  The rest of the Bill, is, as the Minister so christened it, an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  We are a little bit more ludicrous and we are a little bit more ridiculous to some of our citizens and to some of the people from outside who are comparing our approach in our legislation to what they find in other countries.  Many of the prohibitions and strictures will be evaded and we will find a further Irish solution to this Irish Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that this Bill has reached its Final Stage, possibly it is on its last legs, there are mixed feelings about it.  I must confess that one of my fixed feelings is relief that at long last <Col N="1215" /> this subject is about to leave the Oireachtas and hopefully we will not be troubled with it again.  The amount of administrative and legislative time this subject has taken up has been quite inordinate over the years.  This is not surprising because the views on it are many and varied, as the Minister indicated.  The Minister found many varying views in his consultations when he was considering what form the Bill would take; he found people totally opposed to any changes, some mildly opposed, some mildly in favour and possibly even some strongly in favour.  In finding all those different views, the Minister had to compromise between them.</P>
      <P>With so many compromises, and when so many people found their views compromised in the resulting legislation there had to be a feeling of dissatisfaction about it.  I say to those who feel that this Bill is selling out the past on many of our traditions, to those who feel afraid that this Bill will admit to our society what is called &ldquo;the contraceptive mentality&rdquo; that this Bill is now to become law and that it is up to them, by their teaching and example, to ensure that the so-called contraceptive mentality, will not come to pass.  I have no doubt that there is nothing to fear in that regard, because 90 odd per cent of the people subscribe to the teaching of a Church whose teaching on this subject is quite clear.  I have no doubt that the vast majority will adhere loyally to what they are taught is the truth, so that none of us need have any fear of this contraceptive mentality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, some sections of the population will feel that this Bill is a total negation of their rights and freedoms and will feel that certain practices which have been tolerated up to now and which henceforth will be banned are their right and there may be an understandable tendency on the part of those people to want to fail to observe the law that we are about to pass.  All I can say to those people is that this law, imperfect thought it may, has been passed by both Houses of a democratically elected Oireachtas and that it is now the duty of every citizen to ensure that so far <Col N="1216" /> as he is concerned, he will obey the democratically passed law.</P>
    <P>The Minister will now have the job of enforcing this Bill.  In the course of the debate he mentioned that one cardinal principle is enshrined in the Bill.  That is that the Bill in so far as it makes artificial contraceptives now available and, for the first time in the history of our State, gives them legislative sanction, that availability will be within the context of the family as recognised by the Constitution.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that in the implementation of this Bill that principle which he enunciated will be carried out in the full spirit of what he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue in the restrained idiom of Senator Cooney who at earlier stages in the debate was very vigorous in his critique of the legislation which is about to be passed by the Seanad.  I pay tribute to both parties on this side of the House for their very vigorous and strenuous assault on the Bill and their attempts to find its weaknesses, to draw attention to its inadequacies. I felt at certain stages that this critique was excessive and a bit repetitive, but that is the duty of an Opposition in the adversary system we have.  The Government put forward their measures, the Opposition mount their critique, and ultimately the vote goes through.</P>
      <P>I found myself in a special kind of position this time.  I do not often vote with Governments.  I am not a member of a political party and I tend to vote against a Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not under any obligation, moral or otherwise, nor was I under any whip. When I first saw this legislation I was appalled by it.  I almost felt some of the sentiments so powerfully stated by Senators Keating and Robinson.  Then I looked closer at it and at our history in <Col N="1217" /> the matter of contraceptive legislation.  I have voted for every contraceptive or family planning Bill that has come through.  I backed Senator Robinson's and Senator Cooney's to the best of my ability.  I felt for a long time that it is a national scandal that our legislation does not really meet the realities of the situation with regard to contraception.</P>
    <P>I regard contraception as a freedom and a human right.  When I looked closer at this Bill, I saw that that human right is being met.  Unlike the other Bills on family planning that have gone forward, this Bill tried very hard to learn from the experience of those who tried to bring in family planning Bills in the past.  The shipwreck of the Family Planning Bill brought forward by Senator Cooney in the Dáil was a national disgrace.  I was ashamed of it as a legislative performance. It was clear that Bills as radical and progressive as those of Senator Robinson would simply not get acceptance in the Oireachtas.  One can say that the country is very backward, that Senators and Deputies are very backward, but in a democracy the will of the people is implemented through the Legislature.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this case, both by his instinct, and by a very careful series of consultations with interested parties, came up with a Bill which was firmly planted in the middle of the road, roughly where the average citizen would wish it ultimately to reside.  It has been strenuously attacked from the left and from the right&mdash;not from the right and left of the House.  It was attacked by, for instance, Senator Cooney who would like to see the clinics closed down, and by Senator Robinson who feels that the Bill will close them down.  The Minister has been suitably delphic on this matter, he has not been in the least equivocal. The Minister said that the Bill speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is an enabling section no matter what the Opposition says.  Section 3 (3) (b):</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not give his consent to the making available of a family planning service under this subsection unless he is satisfied that it is in <Col N="1218" /> the public interest to give it and that the service is reasonably required to meet a particular need.</P>
    <P>That is an enabling provision.  It means that a Minister can either sanction, set up, or allow to be set up, a family planning clinic if the circumstances require it. Senator Robinson said that this is a step backwards.  Taking a common-sense view, society and its consensus at this moment in Ireland is not moving backwards.  It is moving forward with extraordinary velocity.  If the Minister were to try to bring in the police and break the clinics overnight he would be in serious trouble.  The Bill recognises an on-going situation.  I hate that phrase.  It is a kind of contradiction in terms.  The very fact that this legislation has become imperative, the fact that a Government can no longer hold back on contraceptive legislation now, is a sign that public opinion is moving forward inexorably in that direction towards a greater openness and a greater freedom.  The openness of the media and so forth are all concerned with this.  The common-sense view will ensure that this Bill will provide increasing freedom, not the freedom towards which we all aspire, but the freedom to achieve more freedom.  When this principle has found its way on to the Statute Book, it will be perfectly susceptible to sane adjustment and amendment as the requirements of society demand. The Bill does not go far enough because it does not sufficiently provide for the availability of contraceptives to those who are not married.</P>
    <P>From this side of the House there has been a demand from the Minister that he clarify this, that and the other; that he spell everything out in detail.  The Minister has resisted this on the principle that what legislation should do is lay down principles which will be interpreted and developed as we go on.  A legislative instrument of this kind, particularly in an area as ambiguous as this, should be a fairly flexible instrument.  I am very glad that the Minister has not yielded and that he has left to the Bill its flexibility. I am glad that the Minister has left to certain terms of the Bill a certain ambiguity.  Precise definitions in the future would defeat the very purposes <Col N="1219" /> towards which Senator Robinson has been pointing.</P>
    <P>If the Bill were dealing with industrial relations I would look for a far greater clarity on it, but not in a Bill dealing with sexual relations in which there is very little clarity.  One example of this is the question of family.  The Minister was harried a great deal to say whether he would regard a stable unmarried couple with children as a family.  I have no doubt that very soon such will be regarded as a family, but it would be to follow a very irresponsible red herring to be drawn into that area.  If the Minister had been drawn into the question of the representation of the author's intention in the censorship of publications it would be to follow another red herring.</P>
    <P>The Bill confines itself to a fairly clear statement of purpose, and to fairly broad strokes of legislation to end an anomaly which has existed and has embarrassed us over the years.  Does the Bill meet the needs of Irish society?  It certainly does not meet the needs of everybody in Irish society.  Does it meet the needs of the broad consensus of Irish people at the moment?  I suspect it does.  When Senator Robinson's Bills were going through they encountered extraordinarily stormy passages in the press, but apart from a few rather extreme and rather innocuous demonstrations outside Leinster House, this Bill has not affronted the Irish public.  It seems to be a Bill which has gone for the moderate mien.  To be able to hold the centre position in a fairly stormy debate and to get this legislation through is an admirable performance.  I never met the Minister socially so there is no friendship there and I have no particular affection for Fianna Fáil so I am unbiased in this. However, I must draw attention to the fact that Senator Keating, contrary to what Senator Robinson thinks, thinks that the Bill is a step forward.  He has said that twice and even said that it was a courageous Bill.  It does not go nearly as far as Senator Keating wants it to go. It goes as far as public opinion would countenance at the moment.  Certainly, the situation that it will create is by no means a step backwards.  Most of its provisions have been governed by that <Col N="1220" /> cardinal virtue of commonsense which is the primary equipment of a legislator.</P>
    <P>There are many things in the Bill that I do not like.  It does not go nearly as far as I would like it to go.  I was rather tepid in my praise for the Bill earlier on but it is a Bill that we will look back to as a watershed in Irish legislation.  This issue of contraception which has so bedevilled us over the past 12 years with its awful technical jargon, surrounding condoms, IUDs and devices which are to be fitted or not to be fitted and so on is the kind of thing which I objected to. Senator FitzGerald attacked me the other day with his usual eloquence saying that I was a prude and quoted the Bible at me saying, &ldquo;Blessed is the womb that bore you and the paps that gave you suck&rdquo;.  The Senator said that he had no trouble at all speaking about wombs and paps and so on.  They do not embarrass me at all, that is not what I was talking about.  I was talking about this whole range of very technical appliances which belong to the privacy of the individual in consultation with his or her doctor.  I am still a bit squeamish about that side of the public debate.  This Bill will get that out of the way, and other more important legislation may come before us.</P>
    <P>Since I joined the Seanad the question of family planning has absolutely dominated the airwaves.  It has even displaced Northern Ireland as a subject for discussion. This Bill will set it in proper perspective.  It is an enabling instrument and a step forward.  Far from being ashamed of this or regarding it as a millstone in years to come, the Minister and the House will look back on this Bill as a modest victory for commonsense.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting that this legislation ended its long tedious passage through the Oireachtas in almost exactly the same way as it began.  It was fascinating for me to see that on one of the amendments on Report Stage, on the final closing Stages of the long discussion, on the front bench of the opposite side of the House, Senator Robinson and Senator Cooney found themselves on opposite sides of the fence.  I recall that almost exactly <Col N="1221" /> a similar situation prevailed when the Bill was introduced in the Dáil when the Second Stage was being debated.  On the one hand, Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan gave trenchant expression to one point of view and on the other hand Deputy Noel Browne gave equally cogently an entirely opposite viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson is absolutely wrong when she suggests that the Houses of the Oireachtas were divorced from the public in this debate.  I have never seen a debate in the Oireachtas in which the different segments of passionately-held opinions of members of the general public were so accurately reflected as they were in this debate.  The various strongly held opinions in our society today were consistently and cogently expressed here during the course of the debate.  They were expressed perhaps more extensively and more cogently in the Seanad than they were even in the Dáil where they were extensively reflected.  That is one criticism which cannot be made of the Oireachtas in regard to this discussion. We have had totally opposing views on practically every aspects of this Bill.  The way those views were expressed reflect the manner in which those views are held throughout the community by different sections of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some of the more detached observers in the Seanad, it must have been amusing and fascinating to see Senators voting aggressively against particular provisions for exactly the opposite reasons.  A very large number of these sections, amendments and provisions attracted into the same lobby different Senators for entirely different and opposing reasons.  From that point of view, it has been a very interesting debate and discussion.  In so far as I at any stage disclosed impatience, irritation, tedium or boredom I apologise to the House for any such lapses.  Perhaps they could be attributed to the long drawn out debate which has taken place on the measure.  I was unhappy to be accused of various motives and intentions when, as Senator Martin so accurately put it, all I sought was to find something <Col N="1222" /> that would be acceptable to the broad mass of responsible, reasonable and mature opinion in the community.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that I am terribly fond of this proposition that I kept to the middle of the road.  Aneurin Bevan pointed out some years ago that the man who kept to the middle of the road invariably got knocked down by the traffic. In any event, the legislation is now on its way to the Statute Book. Whatever views Senators may hold about it, I want to give the House the assurance that, as far as I am concerned, it is the starting point for the inauguration of an adequate and comprehensive family planning service for the people.  This is one of the serious gaps in our health services. It is something that is so desirable that it is a tragedy it has not been provided before now.  It is something that affects the lives and happiness of ordinary men and women in such a fundamental way that it is something to which we should have, long ago, awarded a very high priority.</P>
    <P>It is my view that this legislation gives me the structure, provides me with the basis, on which to construct an adequate family planning service and I intend to proceed to do that.  I hope to be able, in the months ahead, to provide on a comprehensive basis for the community in a form acceptable to everybody, a comprehensive family planning service.  I mean a family planning service which provides for every particular section of the community the type of family planning service they want&mdash;not what somebody else thinks they should want, not what somebody else thinks would be better for them, but the sort of family planning service that is acceptable to them, that they are happy with, and that meets their requirements.  If this legislation gives me the statutory basis to provide such a service then it will be worthwhile legislation and I hope it will live up to the approval which I know the greater majority of Senators and Deputies have afforded to it.</P>

    <Title>White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo;: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the White Paper: Programme for National Development 1978-1981.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;Senator W. Ryan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment of the House on 21 March last, I said the White Paper did not fulfil its supposed role as an instrument of economic planning because of the lack of decisions on important issues and the lack of any specific targets for individual sectors of agriculture.  The paper's authors are muddled by increases in gross agricultural output.  They seem unaware of the fact that certain categories of farmers and certain lines of production have lagged well behind others.  The possibility of changing the eligibility for and the method of payment of grants under the farm modernisation scheme is raised but no final plan is announced.  As a result, the farmer does not know whether it would be better to go ahead and invest under the existing scheme or wait to see if he would be better under the new scheme.  In this uncertain situation, the balance always tends in favour of inaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is strong evidence that notwithstanding the general prosperity of the sheep industry, mountain sheep production has not benefited.  The Government should have committed themselves to an intensive educational and advisory campaign to improve production systems in mountain sheep to make sure that mountain sheep producers can benefit from access, which is available, to the French lamb market.  It should also be noted that the Government still have not fulfilled many of the promises they made in their election manifesto.  I should have expected that they could have made a decision on these in time to include them in this White Paper.  Some of the promises which have not been implemented are, first, the provision of higher grants for farm storage and handling facilities for grain.  Another was the establishment of <Col N="1224" /> a grain and marketing information board which we have not had yet.  There was also the promise of the 3 per cent subsidy on interest rates for farmers who come within an expanded development category in an agricultural loan scheme for long-term financing of farm development. We heard nothing further on that point.  Another was the setting up of a farm inheritance counselling scheme and a domestic marketing council to set standards for farm production.  There was also the promise of the establishment of a potato marketing and development board with strong producer and consumer representation.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to take decisions on such a significant list of measures indicates that they intend to drop this section of their election manifesto.  Nothing has happened under any of these promises given to the agricultural community even after more than two years in office.  All the goodies were promised in order to get Fianna Fáil into Government.  I have listed a few of the unfulfilled promises.  Is it any wonder that the people are losing faith in a Government which had been given the greatest majority any Government got since the foundation of the State?  It is not surprising that there are complaints throughout the country today about rising prices right across the board and industrial unrest.  There must be plans, but planning should be positive.  After two years it is high time the Government realised that the people who gave them the majority they enjoy expect them in return to fulfil the promises they made prior to June 1977.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister why the promises I have mentioned have not been fulfilled.  I take it that now, after two years they have been thrown aside and the people will not get what they were promised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of speaking in this debate on the Programme for National Development, 1978-1981.  I should sympathise with the Minister.  It was Winston Churchill who said that a week is a long time in politics, but seven months is a long time in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> The figures in this publication would need to be revised.  Being in a generous mood I want to say that perhaps the Government were over-optimistic last year when they were writing this programme or perhaps for a number of reasons, both external and internal, things have caught up with them.  I hope the Minister will take the bull by the horns and, as expeditiously as possible, revise and revamp these figures, targets and projects.  I believe the country needs leadership in our efforts for national development.  We must have very clear policies.</P>
    <P>We must be able to ask our people&mdash;to ask all sectors&mdash;to stand behind the drive for national development, to provide the necessary finance, to ensure that people will be entrusted with the task of providing greater job opportunities, especially for the young people, to reduce the large numbers unemployed, to have at last a unified, national movement, to ensure that we maximise every possible benefit, and to ensure that we are able to bring the country and its people through the rather difficult economic period we appear to be sailing through at present.</P>
    <P>In regard to national development, we have admirable organisations capable of doing great work and achieving much more.  I cannot say these people do not have the will or the expertise to do a better job because I am convinced they have.  There seems to be a governmental order of priorities which necessarily restricts the flow of funds to organisations like the IDA or CTT.  The IDA are doing a worthwhile job but they appear to react to the political needs of whichever party are in power when they come to deciding questions of additional new factories, advance factories or whatever.  This is a pity.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have been disappointed with the way successive Governments handled the regional development fund.  It is unpardonable that we have not been able to maximise the flow of funds from Europe for regional development. In other words, we have not got the infrastructure or the administration which ensures that we are able to draw <Col N="1226" /> and allocate 100 per cent of the moneys earmarked for payments from that fund in any one year.  This is something for which the Government must take full responsibility.</P>
    <P>The regional development organisations cover the entire republic.  They are staffed by members of local authorities&mdash;administrative and technical officials, county engineers, architects and county managers.  Those organisations are the best equipped to order the development priorities for the various counties.  The development must take place on a county basis rather than on a national basis.  We must have an overall plan.  The Government have refused to utilise the tremendous fund of knowledge and expertise that is available to our economic planners through the regional development organisations.  For the expenditure of the regional fund grant aid, these organisations should be given a say.  They should be asked to identify their order of priorities because I think the county development teams in any county would be in a better position to indicate which are the job creating projects, the centres and so on, that would bring the best and the sharpest relief to underdeveloped areas or to areas in need of additional employment. Unhappily this has not happened up to now.  I hope the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will look at that area and take these people into his confidence because this can only be for the common good.  Nobody can seriously suggest that an official, whether he is in the Custom House or in any other office in Dublin, will have the same firsthand knowledge in selecting sites for development as the county engineer or the county manager who is living with the problems of rural Ireland.  This is where we need to get the regional development funds.</P>
    <P>Last year we were able to avail of only 44 per cent of the payment commitments. This was not necessarily the fault of the Government.  It was the fault of the policy of the present and previous Governments.  We must be able to get our administration equipped so as to be able to avail fully of the European funds earmarked for this country.  This cannot <Col N="1227" /> be because we lack the matching capital, because if we look at the capital budget, it must be possible to produce a set of statistics, or books, so that we can claim our full allocation each year.  This is happening in every area.</P>
    <P>FEOGA grants which are for infrastructural development in agriculture are even worse.  Last year we took only 15 per cent of the moneys earmarked for payment in 1978.  This is unacceptable. Whether it be the co-ops, private industry or whoever is at fault, these people are doing the country a tremendous disservice.  They are obviously not contributing what we require.  Everybody should do his part to ensure that we are able to provide the maximum amount of new job opportunities right across the board, and that includes the private and the public sectors.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have come in contact with CTT and the tremendous number of industries, large and small, they have been able to help and for whom they have provided an excellent service in foreign markets.  I am convinced that this organisation are grossly underfinanced and under-staffed.</P>
    <P>I have not always been happy that CTT work closely enough with the Department of Foreign Affairs and our foreign embassies.  The Continent of Europe is covered, but we do not have a CTT office in every country in which we have an embassy.  The co-ordination between those two services leaves room for improvement.  I hope the Government will bear this in mind.  In countries where we do not have a CTT office, there should be, on the embassy staff, a senior civil servant from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy to assist our exporters who may need their help.  It must be remembered that many of our exporting firms are quite small and not all of them are able to provide their own foreign sales representatives. These are people the public service would need to assist with foreign languages and so on.  This is an area where the public service should be able to make a better and more dynamic contribution.</P>
    <P>When we think of exports in the role of national development our transport <Col N="1228" /> infrastructures fall sadly behind.  While the programme deals with the various sectors of transport infrastructure and development, we cannot get away from the fact that only 17 per cent of the rolling stock&mdash;the juggernauts and lorries that are taking our exports out of this country&mdash;are Irish owned.  This puts us at a disadvantage.  The reason for that is that our taxation system is high.  There is a 30 per cent tax on those vehicles, plus a very much higher road tax than our competitors in Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom or the Continent pay. This puts our transport industry at a considerable disadvantage.</P>
    <P>People who succeed in getting licences to work on the Continent should be given some tax rebates to allow them to be more competitive.  There are some excellent Irish firms working in this field and they have to take on an entirely new environment.  They have not got the recognition from the State they should get.  We must be in control of a greater percentage of our transport facilities.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough in Europe to find COMECON squeezing the international shipping lines out of business.  In a few years we will find we are at the mercy of the USSR shipping companies for practically all European exports.  Their rates will then shoot up and our unfortunate transport situation will be the same as our present energy situation. We should recognise that we are an island country.  From a European point of view, we are in the most peripheral area.  Transport should get a higher rating in our national order of priorities than it has up to this.  Transport in the Community, represents something like 7.7 per cent of the gross domestic product whereas agriculture, which gets all the headlines and most of the finance, represents something like 5.4 per cent. We have neglected this area.  This is a key area.  If we want to get our exports flowing we must do everything in our power to ensure that the people directly involved are given the best possible chance to achieve that.</P>
    <P>The projections for the agricultural industry will indeed fall far short of the view expressed in the White Paper as to <Col N="1229" /> its future prospects.  In this case it is mainly because of the Government's own policies, especially in regard to the imposition of levies and taxes on the means of production itself.  This is something that will affect the national economy.  I will not deal with this now because we will have an opportunity of discussing it on one of the other Bills tomorrow or later this week.</P>
    <P>On some agricultural commodities we have up to six levies at present.  It is not possible for even the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to suggest that the imposition of so many levies on any line of production will encourage people into greater production. The White Paper falls short in dealing with agricultural development and I hope that the Minister will as a matter of urgency review the entire agricultural sector in his priorities for national development.</P>
    <P>We must at least set our targets and have some clear idea of where we want to go <i>vis-à-vis</i> agriculture, which still must be one of our most important industries.  If we are thinking about increased job opportunities we cannot exclude an important sector of the community such as agriculture.  Admittedly this White Paper is seven months old but nevertheless, having regard to the Government's budget and the levies and the new imposition of taxes in the agricultural sector, I do not think it is realistic to accept simply what the Minister sets out.  It will not be possible to achieve what he sets out as simply as that.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous opportunity for a large increase in the number of jobs to be provided through a proper forestry development programme.  The Forestry and Wildlife Service have been a tremendous national asset.  Successive Governments over the past 40 or 50 years acquired, planted and developed our national forests and we must be grateful to them for that.  Looking at the industry at present it is quite outrageous that last year's statistics show that we imported no less than £1 million of sawn timber for our building industry each week. This is certainly unacceptable in a <Col N="1230" /> country which has so much forestry and so many mature trees of very high quality.  I know it is proposed that the IDA should now be in a position to grant-aid the development or the readaptation of sawmills.  There are about 160 sawmills in the country and I would hope that in each county one or two sawmills would be developed with drying facilities so that the building industry would be able to have adequate first-class timber sawn to a specific standard. We would then be able to do without the importation of such a very costly amount of sawn timber for our building trade.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate, too, that the Government's statistics in this seem to be a little dishonest.  In a year when we have lost almost 500 jobs in the wood processing industry the Government talk of producing something like an additional 28,000 jobs in this area before 1981.  This is really pie-in-the-sky.  The Government already this year have refused to come to the assistance of a number of wood processing plants.  Most of them were in a loss situation only for the last three or four years, mainly because of dumping from eastern European countries and from Spain and Africa, which the Community for some reason allowed.  I am disappointed that this Government did not take a very strong stand and insist on anti-dumping provisions being implemented to protect those jobs, not only in Athy but also in Scarriff and in Piltown.</P>
    <P>This does not get away from the fact that the Government have huge amounts of mature timber available for harvesting.  While it is fair to say that the Forest and Wildlife Service are doing a good job, the management of many of our forests needs to be improved.  If the Government cannot directly provide the finance to pay an adequate staff to manage our State forests at least they should come up with a scheme whereby they could, perhaps, allocate squares of forestry to small farmers and their families who might, for an annual fee, be able to carry out the kind of management that is necessary if the trees are to grow to maturity.</P>
    <P>We have a ministry for forestry and it is very difficult to see any specific advances <Col N="1231" /> being made.  I have not seen where the Government made any great efforts to secure replacement industries for the ones that have closed down. Surely there must be somewhere some people with the proper expertise and finance who would be interested in assisting, either as part of a semi-State organisation or entirely in the private sector, in the management of this industry and the provision of proper employment.  This would save the country the huge annual cost of imported timber.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry should apply his mind to this and come up with a new set of proposals.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development is unrealistic in the section of the White Paper which states that it is intended that up to 900 additional workers could be employed in timber processing by 1985 with a further 900 in logging.  That is a total of 1,800 extra jobs.  I would like to see the basis for that, having regard to the fact that in one town alone we lost 200 jobs.  We lost possibly 200 jobs in three factories in as many months this year.  There was very little Government intervention and there was not even the political will to take a deep interest.  Obviously we have the raw material there.  With proper management it can grow mature and its value can be enhanced.  The climate here is excellent for the growing of timber and we must surely have the expertise.  If we are under-capitalised in this area the Government in a White Paper should be able to spell that out more clearly.  I have met during the year representatives of more than one multinational company who expressed an interest in getting involved in processing Irish timber.  I am rather surprised that the Government or an agency such as the IDA have not been able to bring in people to see if they could salvage this industry and to retain the expertise we obviously have in a number of areas of this important industry.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also deals with youth employment.  This is an area that has not been tackled wholeheartedly by the Government since they came into <Col N="1232" /> power.  Looking at their election manifesto on youth employment, it becomes obvious that they not done much to implement their thoughts while in Opposition.  It is very important that we should make a determined effort to ensure that our young people are offered worth-while employment.  A country could never be completely satisfied with its services.  Nevertheless, the young people enjoy enhanced educational facilities, certainly compared with any period in the past.  It is regrettable if we have not got the industrial or agricultural development that would provide jobs that would keep them gainfully and happily employed in this country.  Unless we are able to do so we will have a very uneasy young population in the next few years.</P>
    <P>On the question of the EMS it is difficult to reconcile the aspirations of the White Paper which with what has actually happened was printed at the same time we joined the EMS.  I would hope that the Minister would be in a position to assure the House that the projections and the hopes he had and the positive expectations that the Government had on our joining the EMS will be realised.  I should like to put a couple of questions to the Minister on this topic.  I would like to ask if the Government have received the transfer of resources from which we were to benefit under the EMS.  If so, do they offset the obvious disadvantages of the higher prices our importers have had to pass on to the consuming public over the past couple of months?  To what areas have those resources or funds been allocated?  Have they been allocated solely for infrastructural development?</P>
    <P>This is important.  There has apparently been an acute shortage of cash in Government coffers because even the large road maintenance programmes have been three or four months late starting this year.  This is quite disturbing. There appears to be in many areas a shortage of funds.  The normal large roadwork schemes in many of the counties I have been visiting over the last few months do not appear to have started at the beginning of summer as has traditionally been the case.</P>
    <P>I regret that the White Paper does not mention incentives which would encourage <Col N="1233" /> people to work for a better future for themselves and for the country.  There is nothing in the paper to encourage people to save and thus assist national development in a very positive way.  This is possibly the first time this country has had a Minister specifically assigned to national development and economic planning.  One would have expected some novel ideas.  Inflation continues to rise and people on PAYE feel aggrieved that they are not getting a tremendous return for taxation.  The Government should be in a position to provide incentives for the PAYE contributor to save some tax through savings. There are a number of examples from countries in Europe which the Government might usefully consider.</P>
    <P>The French Government have a system whereby the ordinary taxpayer, if he agrees to put money into Government stocks or saving bonds for a definite period, say, four years, does not have to pay income tax on that money and, in addition, he gets a bonus at the end of the four-year period.  This money goes chiefly towards national development.</P>
    <P>There are small saving schemes, possibly somewhat similar, but we should be able to devise schemes that would encourage people, especially young people, to save for the time when they will buy a house.  It is very difficult for people who are on PAYE even to think of that. Nevertheless, a considerable number of people are doing so.  The incentives are not sufficient.  I would ask the Minister to consider a scheme that would encourage people to invest in their own future, to save in a novel kind of way.  I am sure that the Department would be able to find in the more progressive countries in Europe very many novel schemes that we could adapt to suit our particular situation and which would be of tremendous benefit to the young energetic people who want to be independent and to save for their own future.  At present they have not got the facilities to do that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give us an idea of the kind of revamping now required for this Programme for National Development.  All of us should do our <Col N="1234" /> best to assist in the task of national development.  It will be a momentous task to keep this country from going lower than it is.  We must all do our share to provide for the young population. We should assist in providing decent and well-remunerated job opportunities for them, so that they will not have to emigrate, as many unfortunate generations of Irish people had to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the many Senators who spoke during this debate for the generally constructive and positive approach which was adopted and for a number of suggestions, as well as the usual questions or criticisms that naturally arise in discussions of this nature.  Inevitably, it would take me too long to attempt to reply to all speakers in the detail which they would merit.  I trust I will be forgiven, therefore, if I concentrate on some of the more important points that were raised and reply to those in a reasonably brief way but, hopefully, with sufficient content to demonstrate that I regard the issue before the House as an important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that the whole approach of setting out fairly detailed&mdash;not by any means comprehensively detailed&mdash;statements of future policies and of the targets which are hoped to be achieved by those policies is a relatively new departure, a relatively new approach.  I know there are many people who still question the wisdom or the validity of that approach.  Naturally, I would take the view that it is important and necessary.  In introducing this debate, I said there are two kinds of options open to us.  One is that we could pursue the existing or traditional policy approaches and the more cautious attitude in which one never really commits oneself to any very ambitious or difficult targets so that one can never be proved wrong by subsequent events.  While that course undoubtedly appeals to many as containing a much greater degree of worldly wisdom, it is an approach which has to be rejected in the circumstances of Ireland at this time, facing into the 1980s, because whether we like it or not, <Col N="1235" /> and irrespective of which Government are in office, those fundamental characteristics and fundamental issues will not go away.</P>
    <P>The underlying characteristic which is vital and, therefore, the one that gives rise to the most important policy issue &mdash;one I have stressed over and over again both inside this House and elsewhere&mdash;is the characteristic of a rising population, a growing number of young people.  It is a fact of which we should be historically very proud because it is the first time in more than a century that we have had a growing population and a growing proportion of young active people within that population. That characteristic, however, poses the overriding policy requirement: can we find a satisfactory role, a satisfactory place, for these young Irish men and women in their own country?  The Government have attempted to rise to that challenge by setting out the very ambitious goal of full employment within a five-year period.  I know there are Senators on both sides of the House who would regard that as, perhaps, an over-optimistic approach to the problem and would ask whether we should not be more prudent in our planning and set our sights at somewhat lower targets and ones which would be more realistic.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is a satisfactory option open to the Ireland of today.  Can we seriously, as responsible leaders of our community, say that we do not really think we should embark on ambitious programmes for achieving full employment because that represents a radical break with our past history and traditions and a kind of change-about in our patterns of behaviour and in our attitudes and would give rise to so many difficulties that it really would not be worth the bother?  Can we say it is much better to settle for a more cautions conservative limited approach under which we could pat ourselves regularly on the back if we were able to chalk up rates of progress that exceeded the previous best?  It would not be very difficult to exceed the previous best because all one has to do is look over the past half-century of independence and look at the <Col N="1236" /> average increase in employment which took place.  We all know what the average increase was&mdash;it was nonexistent.</P>
    <P>Even if one scrambles around frantically to find the years in which there was any increase in employment, one finds that those years were few and far between and that the few occasions on which there was any positive increase in employment gave rise to numbers that were paltry, almost absurd in relation to the magnitude of the problem which Ireland faced.  One can find something like three years in more than a half-century of independence when the total employment in the country rose by something more than 5,000 people a year.  In none of those three years did the increase ever reach 10,000.</P>
    <P>When people say they think we are being over-optimistic or imprudent or foolish or anything else when the Government start talking about full employment as a necessary goal for our people, what they are really saying is that we should go out and tell the young people that there is no hope and no scope for them in their own country, that their leaders have decided the prudent, sensible course of action is to continue the age-old remedy of the emigrant boat, or perhaps its modern counterpart, the emigrant aeroplane.</P>
    <P>If people want to opt for that course I would like to hear them say so openly and carefully.  I want to see them advocate it and tell the people that that is the policy they have in mind.  I do not like the insidious, underhand approach which will never come out and say that this is the prospect one has in mind but rather simply concentrates on describing as the new foolishness any attempt to promise our young people a reasonable prospect in their own country.  If that is the new form of foolishness I am happy to be associated with it.  If one looks back at our history there were other times when other objectives were regarded as foolish and beyond the ambitions or hopes of realisation by our people.</P>
    <P>We could never look ourselves straight in the face, we could never take ourselves seriously as a Parliament purporting <Col N="1237" /> to lead the people, if we could not set out to tackle and to overcome any major problem which confronts this country.  The problems will changes from decade to decade and from generation to generation but the approach should never change.  Surely the whole argument for an independent country, for an independent Government, is that they claim the ability on behalf of the people to deal with their problems and to deal with them in an adequate way?  That, ultimately, is what is at the heart of all these discussions about planning and policy for our future into the 1980s.  We are not talking about numbers games in the sense of whether the growth of living standards is 4 per cent or 5 per cent or whether inflation is X or X plus 2 or X minus 2 or anything else.  In the final analysis we are talking about whether we can, as I have said, offer our own people a reasonable role in their own country or whether we have to say, &ldquo;No, that is too great an ambition, you must look elsewhere as in the past you were compelled to look elsewhere.&rdquo;  If that strikes people as being too melodramatic, so be it.  One can only state one's attitude and one's beliefs and one can then only go on to seek to explain why one holds them.  I will be coming back to some of the numbers involved in this discussion later on, but I think it is important to get that right at the outset, that the primary emphasis and policy-making not only for this year and next year but for many years to come, must be trying to so order our economic and social policies that they can produce this desirable result.</P>
    <P>Inevitably there has been a tendancy, genuinely in some cases and less genuinely in others, to obscure some of these issues and reduce them to trivial issues of arithmetic.  People saying they do not understand or are confused by the relationship between increases and numbers at work, reductions in the numbers on the live register, what has been happening to emigration and so forth.  I propose, if I can, to avoid going into that in any contentious manner here this evening because I am happy to say that, in general, references in that regard in this House were of a constructive and positive nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> The speaker who most particularly referred to difficulties in this area was Senator Harte.  He quoted a number of statistics and he said that he did not quite see how we had arrived at the claim for increases in employment last year and how they could be related to trends, both in the increase in the numbers seeking work, reductions in the numbers on the live register and to what is happening to emigration.  He admitted that he was not an expert in this area.  He actually said thank God he was not an economist and he hoped to God he would never become perfect.  I share his aspiration of never wishing to be regarded as perfect, but on the economic side I may respond to his request to give some clear explanation.</P>
    <P>He says that the man on the shop floor talks about these things in his own fashion.  He says that in January 1978 there were 113,000 on the live register, then he adds on the additional people who would be looking for work, 14,000 redundancies in industry, 5,000 outflow in agriculture, plus 9,000 people coming onto the labour market, that is the additional number of young people coming out of schools and colleges exceeding the numbers of older people retiring and he says 7,000 emigrated.  That is the one error in his arithmetic.  He arrives at his tot which is excessive.  Let us look at it on the basis of his calculations; the people on the live register numbered 113,000, add the redundancies in industry, 14,000, the 5,000 outflow from agriculture, the 9,000 increase in the labour force and that would give a total of 143,000 looking for work.  At the end of the year we know that 101,000 were on the live register, a drop of 12,000 in the course of a year, so how many jobs were created?  If we take away 101,000 from 143,000 I hope we get 42,000 as the answer.  That 42,000 must have done one of three things.  They must have either got jobs so that would be job creation, they must have emigrated and that is where he had that number on the wrong side of the account, or the other possibility is, of course, that they may have retired from the labour force.  They may have withdrew from the labour force: older people retired and some people <Col N="1239" /> got married.  This would be true of girls that where they might have been looking for work at one stage, if they married they would be no longer searching for work and would, therefore, withdraw.  We have no information on the numbers who withdrew from the labour force, so I cannot answer that one.  It boils down to the numbers who either emigrated or who got jobs.</P>
    <P>What we said consistently in the course of last year was that the number of gross jobs created was in excess of 30,000 which left something like 10,000 plus to be accounted for either by emigration or people withdrawing from the labour force.  We went on to say that if you set that increase or that provision of new jobs in excess of 30,000 and subtracted from it the redundancies, the outflow from agriculture, we were estimating a net increase in employment of 17,000.  That still stands as about the best estimate I can give.</P>
    <P>If I wanted to play numbers games, which I do not, I could now even claim a more ambitious figure, because we were talking about these things a few months ago.  As Senator McDonald said earlier, seven months is a very long time when it comes to looking at these sort of things and lots of numbers have changed in the course of seven months including the latest information on migration.  At the beginning of the year based on the best information which we then had we said that emigration in the year from February 1977 to February 1978 had been of the order of 7,000 and we thought it was staying somewhat similar during 1978, that is, from February 1978 to February 1979.</P>
    <P>Some critics, not in this House I hasten to add, were trying to claim that emigration had more than doubled.  They were talking in terms of emigration of 14,000 and said that was the way in which we were apparently solving our unemployment problem.  The latest information on this score, which was given in a reply to a question in the Dáil last week, also based on the passenger movement for the 12 months up to February this year, suggests that far from there being <Col N="1240" /> any emigration last year, you would be led to believe that there was immigration of the order of 11,000 between February 1978 and February 1979.  If you took that, you would have a turnaround; instead of something between 7,000 or more people leaving the country, you are expected now to believe that on balance 11,000 entered.  That is a turnaround of 18,000 or more.  Have they all got extra jobs?  If I was in an extravagant mood I would say then we must have provided more than 50,000 jobs last year because none of them were on the live register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>How were the Minister's projections so very wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  There may have been this turnaround, but not all of them would have been people who would be entering the labour force.  They may have been children, they may have been old or retired people and so on.  That would be fair enough.  You could reduce the numbers relevant to your employment figures in that way.  Even still you would have to stretch your imagination pretty far to believe that all of them could have been people who are not of working age and that at least some of them would not be entering the labour force.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald asked how I got my projections so wrong.  The point was I never gave the projection on this figure. I consistently refused to do so.  The only thing I said was that I did not know, that the 7,000 was the estimate up to February or April 1978 and that we did not have the information.  I recall taking a fair bit of flak for refusing to give estimates for 1978 into early 1979 but I refused to do so on the grounds that the quality of the preliminary information was not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making this point to show that if one wants to indulge in numbers games one can but that has never been part of our approach.  It is not my concern and at the end of the day we are not going to resolve any of the problems of this country on the basis of whether or not we rely on some preliminary estimates, <Col N="1241" /> whether it is of emigration or anything else.  In so far as any data is available, it does show that there must have been a very substantial increase in employment last year.  Let me not be misquoted or misunderstood but I have always consistently refused to accept that the live register was an accurate measure of the number of people who were unemployed. I have always said that it was used as an indicator of the trend, whether the numbers unemployed were rising or falling, because it was available weekly but the only accurate counts we got were either at the point of census taken at intervals of five years or more, or now we get another estimate from time to time in the form of the EEC labour force surveys which are taken at two-yearly intervals.</P>
    <P>I am referring to the reduction in the live register which showed a drop over the relevant period of something in the order of 12,000.  Indeed, if you take the latest figures which I have up to the end of April and compare them with those for the same date of last year the drop is in excess of 13,000.  They appear to show that the numbers regarding themselves unemployed for the purposes of the live register are falling.  There was some work done in earlier years on relationship between the live register and the numbers obtaining employment to suggest that the increase in employment would be one-and-a-half times to twice the reduction in the live register.  I could use those figures to say that they are consistent with increased employment.  If I take the 12,000 reduction that Senator Harte mentioned, from January to January, a fall of 12,000 on the live register would be consistent with an increase of 18,000 to 24,000 in the numbers employed on the basis of the only independent academic research that has been done on this topic.  I am not claiming those more favourable numbers.  On the basis of such preliminary data as we have, we have been suggesting a figure of 17,000.  That disposes of Senator's Harte's point.</P>
    <P>I come to one of the few regrettably political points that I have to try to score in the course of my reply.  I do not like doing it but I feel it is right to set the <Col N="1242" /> record straight.  The first speaker in the debate after myself was Senator FitzGerald.  I would like to note that in general his remarks were very balanced, fair and unpartisan and I was quite happy to accept them.  However, there was one point where he accused me of lapsing into what he regarded as political statements.  He said the Government cannot get the support of the people for the White Paper when it contains statements such as, and he quotes &ldquo;the approach involved a temporary increase in Exchequer borrowing to help restore confidence&rdquo;.  It will be recalled that the basic argument we were using for the first phase of our strategy was that it was necessary to do something quickly and urgently when we came back into office.  First, we had to make an impact on the unemployment problem&mdash;we had a special programme for that&mdash;and I have been discussing some of the results and, secondly, we had to restore confidence.</P>
    <P>We were arguing that there had been a collapse of confidence, especially in investors, during the recession years and that there could be no sustained satisfactory expansion of the economy unless and until that confidence was restored. Senator FitzGerald claimed that this was a partisan statement.  He said it did not require anything of this kind to help restore confidence.  He said &ldquo;confidence was very buoyant in 1977 and I challenge that proposition&rdquo;.  He said confidence was magnificent, confidence was high and so on.  In the course of a paragraph or two he made the claim three or four times about the exceptionally high level of confidence that already prevailed before the change of Government in 1977.</P>
    <P>While I wish to avoid making partisan comments in so far as I can, I cannot let that one go because the only evidence that is available totally contradicts Senator FitzGerald's claim.  I was wondering how he could have claimed this and I waited carefully for him to bring forward any evidence to support the claim.  He never did.  Let me insert my evidence.  The only references I know of to the state of confidence which you can gauge were those that were taken <Col N="1243" /> from surveys of business opinion from time to time.  A statement on the state of business confidence was taken in a poll conducted at the end of 1976 and the beginning of 1977.  That showed that there was a disastrously low level of confidence, that businessmen were not thinking in terms of any investment plans on any scale for the future, that they did not regard the development prospects for the Irish economy as good and they were generally highly pessimistic. If anyone cares to dispute that, he has only to contrast the results shown by the same survey when it was repeated 12 months later, at the beginning of 1978.  You can see the remarkable turn around in every one of the indicators. There was a dramatic shift in the thinking of businessmen, their attitudes to tackling new investment projects and so forth and, of course, that sampling of opinion is reflected in the actual results for 1978.  If you look at what happened last year in terms of investment the volume of investment&mdash;let us forget about problems of inflation or anything else&mdash;appears to have increased by 15 per cent.  This is far and away the largest increase in the volume of investment for any year in this decade and well in excess of anything recorded in the previous year.  While I regret the necessity to score what might be described as a partisan point, I feel it necessary to do so in the interests of setting the record straight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment in some detail on the contribution of the next speaker in the debate, Senator Whitaker. One of the reasons I want to do this is because on the previous occasion when we had a debate of this nature on the Green Paper and when I did not respond <Col N="1244" /> to the Senator's comments, a number of people tried to read all sorts of mysterious rationalisations into that alleging that there was some difference of opinion or that Senator Whitaker had been critical and that I was trying to ignore or brush aside the criticism, and so forth.  In case anyone would think that I was in any sense trying to avoid or ignore any of the points which were made in the debate, I welcome the opportunity to speak on them now.  I hope also that the balance will be conveyed accurately. It is fair to say that both on that occasion and more recently there has been a tendency just to report selected bits of what people say and, therefore, to give a totally unbalanced picture of the sense of the remarks as a whole.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker said he was glad of an opportunity to discuss the paper and while acknowledging the Government's good intentions, he was apprehensive about the effect on confidence of our failing for any reason to attain the very ambitious targets which we set ourselves.  He actually quoted a biblical injunction which commends, somewhat paradoxically, &ldquo;prudence in planning and courage in taking risks&rdquo;.  The quotation is from column 330 of the Official Report of the Seanad debates of 1 March, 1979.</P>
    <P>The Senator would have liked us to be more prudent in planning and less courageous in taking risks.  That is fair enough.  Ultimately this is a balance of judgment.  While I can see many merits, obviously one would not be giving as many political hostages to fortune by settling for a more cautious and more long-term approach to employment and other needs, I have to say for the reasons which I gave earlier that there is an absolute imperative in tackling our unemployment problem for the sake of our country over the coming years.</P>
    <P>There is no way in which one can say in these matters whether anybody is right or wrong.  It is misleading even to attempt to discuss it in those terms.  All one can say is that people will look at a prospective future situation, assess the relative merits and demerits of a particular course of action and they will then make their own judgment as to how much effort they think should be made <Col N="1245" /> to tackle any particular problem. However, if I say then, having noted the Senator's view, we were justified in being more courageous and less prudent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the time period I was referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it was five years.  Perhaps the Senator thought we should take it over a longer period.  I would have to say in reply that if one says we should tackle the unemployment problem and spread it over a longer time period one is also saying to countless thousands of people that, whether they know it or not, they are going to remain unemployed for that extra length of time.  That may be a perfectly permissible and valid view but I happen to be of the school which says if it can be at all done we should make every human effort possible to cut down on the length of time for which young people find themselves deprived of employment opportunities. However, I recognise that there are greater risks and that greater efforts are needed if one sets an incredibly ambitious time-scale.</P>
      <P>I am in much more agreement with the Senator when he says that much more important than the targets of the White Paper are the conditions essential to their fulfilment.  The White Paper went on to talk about some of those conditions. The Senator also mentioned the lack of clarity in discussing the way in which some of these conditions might be met.  This was a point which cropped up in some other speakers' remarks as well. If I am not mistaken, Senator McCartin made a somewhat similar point later in the discussion, saying that it was all very well to set these ambitious targets but we wanted to see more clearly how we were going to achieve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with this important point.  The numbers in themselves are not important.  The numbers are attempts to illustrate, in a simple convenient term which everybody can understand, the scale of the effort required to be made.  It is easier to say to people that we need 25,000 more jobs a year and that compares with only achieving 7,000 or 8,000 a year in our previous best.  That conveys very quickly <Col N="1246" /> to people the order of magnitude in the turn around and transformation we are seeking.  The numbers themselves are not important.  What is much more important is how you are going to do it.  I am talking about the conditions essential to their fulfilment and the actual policies by which we are going to bring about the change.</P>
    <P>Of course, if the only things that were associated with these planning documents were to publish the papers and set out nice targets, tables and discussions about the pros and cons of different approaches, it would not be worth the paper they were printed on.  At the end of the day what is important is the action that is taken.  Of course, we want to know how we are going to achieve these ambitious results and what action the Government are going to seek to evoke from the people in order to achieve them.</P>
    <P>In some areas one can spell out the kind of action that is needed and where that is possible we have been seeking to do it.  We have indicated quite a number of changes for activities that lie more or less wholly within the sphere of government decision and responsibility.  For instance, if in order to sustain the kind of development that is needed for rapid increase in employment in a satisfactory way, one needs, for example, an improved road system or an expanded telecommunications network and so on, then these are areas of action which can be identified and the necessary decisions can be taken.  We can claim that in the few months which have elapsed since the White Paper was printed there has been further evidence of the speed and the direction in which the Government are moving in these areas.  So, if we are rewriting the numbers today, as Senator McDonald suggested, not all the rewriting is necessarily of an adverse kind. Some of it is very positive.  We now see much more clearly the speed and the content of programmes for say, modernising the telephone system in a five-year time span and a ten-year programme for modernising the road network which was published a few months ago.  Some of the action can be set out fairly clearly because on the whole it lies within the sphere of Government responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> The most important areas are the ones where the results depend on the behaviour and reactions of others and are not simply a matter for Government decision or resolution.  That is recognised not only in the White Paper but in any other statement of Government policy which one cares to name.  I am thinking here of the importance of getting the right kind of climate in industrial relations, the right kind of decisions with respect to income increases and so on. Some of those matters were touched on by Senator Whitaker and other speakers.</P>
    <P>At the time that our debate was taking place in March, I was not in a position to say a great deal because at that juncture we were in the middle of discussions with the trade unions and employers on these very matters.  In January of this year the Taoiseach had launched the notion that what was required was a comprehensive type of understanding, embracing the social partners, which would cover not simply the traditional matters of pay increases but also would extend to commitments and support for this programme for tackling unemployment as well as an understanding on the policies and actions which would then be needed in other areas such as taxation, developments in social welfare and so on.  Many weeks of discussion and work went into the production of just that very type of agreement.  As we know, the original proposals which emerged from that work have not yet been ratified. There was an initial rejection on the trade union side which, I am happy to say, appears to have been largely overcome by some revisions.  We should know, in a matter of a week or so, whether or not there will be the necessary support for the terms put forward in this draft national understanding.  I should make clear that those terms, while they cover a limited period of 15 months, are intended as phase 1 of a longer term, five year programme which would deal with all of the issues arising from a five year programme for achieving full employment.</P>
    <P>Let me point out to the House that the <Col N="1248" /> trade unions, in their first discussions on these matters in March of this year, when they were deciding on a mandate, so to speak, for their negotiators, expressed their commitment to and support of, the target of full employment which is planned.  They welcomed and recognised the efforts which had already been made by the Government to achieve that result and said that they would work to help to achieve it.  The terms of the proposed understanding which at present relates to the initial period of 15 months or so, give some indication of the approach which is being adopted in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that all the problems that will arise in that context of the national understanding have been solved.  No-one believes that they could be.  If phase 1 is adopted, there would be even more complex, perhaps even more difficult issues to be resolved in the second or later phases.  If you are in the business of changing things, you have to make a start somewhere in bringing about changes.  We are justified in maintaining a reasonable degree of optimism that the necessary type of change can be forthcoming in these areas.  I would like to emphasise that the approach to policy formulation is not simply the publication of nice targets and rosy promises.  It is the setting out of guidelines and the bench marks for action, action designed to bring about the necessary changes in behaviour.  Those changes in behaviour, however, require the understanding and support of groups outside the domain of Government itself.  This takes time and one must recognise that progress is not going to take the form of a simple smooth upward path.  Who, with any sense of history, would expect or believe that this is the way mankind progresses in any area?  Anyone with even a limited familiarity with history knows that the progress of mankind since he first came out of his cave can be more appropriately likened to the drunken man going up the flight of stairs.  Not only does he make his progress by occasional upward jerks, very often there is the temporary relapse or the slide back down one or two steps, before another upsurge occurs which takes him to a new height, or new plateau.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> If we are to be realistic in our approach to bringing about the action that will help us to achieve our targets and our goals, we must be prepared for the hard work, for the ups and downs, for overcoming the initial doubts, hesitations, difficulties, objections and so forth, and for building up the necessary degree of support and commitment which will eventually enable us to achieve our goals.</P>
    <P>I hope I have explained why, while it is possible, in some areas, to spell out, with a fair degree of clarity, the nature of the policy action to be taken in support of targets, one cannot do that in other instance and, indeed, why it would be foolish and even dangerous to attempt to do so.  The areas in which reticence or silence is noticed appear, on careful examination, to be areas in which it is prudent and wise to be silent.  If there is a case for prudence and planning &mdash; as, of course, there is&mdash;those are the areas in which prudence is appropriate.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other contributions on which I would like to comment and I shall try to be brief.  Senator Robinson emphasised that she was very disappointed with the lack of reference to the role, or possible role, of the National Development Corporation, and invited the Minister to elaborate on that when he came to reply.  This is a perfect example of my point about the timing of comment in some of these areas.  At that juncture, in March, one had embarked on discussions with trade unions and one of the issues on the agenda was the question of the development corporation and the possible role which such a body might fulfil.  It was not until the end of April that those discussions had reached a sufficient degree of progress where one could arrive at any clear decision.  As you know, the Government took the decision, which is incorporated as part of the proposed national understanding, to establish a new National Enterprise Agency.  This agency would undertake the task of harnessing new development opportunities as they arise, whether as joint ventures with other groups in the private or public sector, or acting on its own initiative.  That is a very convenient and adequate example of the need to balance openness and clarity with the <Col N="1250" /> need to take account of other views and other proposals which have not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>At this point, it is relevant to take some remarks which Senator Governey made, both last day and earlier this evening.  He listed some areas in which he was disappointed that there was no progress from the Government.  He was also disappointed with the lack of decision in the White Paper, and listed some areas.</P>
    <P>It is totally unrealistic to imagine that one can slice out one particular day of some particular week and say &ldquo;In the first weeks of 1979, the Government are going to take decisions on A to Z and are not going to take any other decisions,&rdquo; presumably, for the rest of the year.  With the best will in the world at any point in time one can only hope to assemble so many areas and take so many decisions.  If we wanted to play the numbers game, I could produce more than 20 specific decisions in the White Paper, which is not bad going for any one period of a couple of weeks.  In addition to those 20 or more specific decisions, one can list a number of areas where further decisions will be taken in the near future and, indeed, some of those subsequent decisions have already been announced.  It would be inappropriate and unrealistic to try to organise our planning on the basis that all decisions were to be incorporated into the &ldquo;White Paper of the Year.&rdquo;  I do not believe that would be helpful.  If we attempted to do that, it would act as a major obstacle to progress because, presumably, then one would have to wait for the rest of the year, to be hallowed or blessed with the dawning of a new year and another White Paper.  I trust I can be dispensed on that point.</P>
    <P>As to the Senator's other points, there were a number of areas where he made some interesting suggestions that we shall certainly follow up.</P>
    <P>On the general point, that not all the specific proposals put forward in our election manifesto two years ago have yet been implemented, the same marked infairness applies.  I could get him a list of, I think, more than 40 specific items which have been implemented, which, again, is not a bad record.  It should be <Col N="1251" /> clear that the manifesto was a programme for a whole term of Government; we have two to three years more in which to complete the task.  In particular, in the area of decisions which were identified as being urgent, requiring action within the first 12 months, every one of those has been implemented.  So, far from that being a criticism, I would regard it as evidence that we had indeed kept our promises to the electorate and that we were pursuing the programme for which we had received a mandate.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the concluding point, that there has been, undoubtedly, a change in the environment within which we have to operate since the White Paper was prepared, deterioration that was most pronounced in the international area because of the upheavals in oil supply and the consequential major increase in price.</P>
    <P>That deterioration in the international outlook was reinforced by the damage inflicted by our actions at home, especially in the field of industrial disputes. Some Senators suggested that this deterioration in the economic outlook means that we should, scrap our development plans.  It would be absolutely ridiculous to scrap them.  The fact that some external event has intruded; the fact that all of the initial conditions that one has set out as being necessary if any targets are to be met, have not been fulfilled; the fact that conditions have changed, is not any argument on the merits or demerits of the policies themselves.</P>
    <P>This worsening of the oil situation means that we shall have a slower rate of growth this year, that we shall have worse inflation, in common with the whole of the western world, or that we shall not get as big an increase in employment as we would originally have liked.  These are not arguments for scrapping plans or proposals.  On the contrary, surely these are arguments for saying what are now needed are even greater efforts in this direction.  We must now think in terms of new ways of searching out employment opportunities. We must now learn to cope with the consequences of a less prosperous outside <Col N="1252" /> world, therefore, a world which offers fewer opportunities for our exports. That means that there is an even greater need to put our own house in order and the field in which urgent improvement is essential is industrial relations, with the associated income increases.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government from the Taoiseach downwards, right through the Cabinet, have all consistently stressed the vital role of the efforts of our own people in achieving our ambitious development targets.  We consistently said that there can be no question of bringing about the necessary results if we have the damage and disruption of protracted industrial disputes, especially in any sort of key services, and the less visible, but just as damaging, longer term consequences of excessive pay increases. Unfortunately, in the months that have elapsed since we initiated this debate, there has not been the improvement that we would have wished.  For, that reason, our progress is not as rapid as would have been possible.  Progress not taking the form of a simple upward graph surely means that, far from losing heart and saying that we should slow down and become less ambitious, we have to make an even greater effort so that we can recover lost ground.</P>
    <P>In the immediate future, we must first see the outcome of the discussions on the proposed national understanding.  If that proposal is accepted by the trade unions, we must certainly look to them to honour fully, in the spirit as well as in the letter, commitments which it enshrines about, improving the climate of industrial peace and bringing about more orderly arrangements for resolving any disputes that may arise.  While we cannot expect to achieve perfection overnight, there is no reason why we cannot embark on the path of improvement at the earliest opportunity.  There is a whole generation of young people in Ireland who will never forgive us if we cannot share their impatience to win a place for themselves in their own country.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
