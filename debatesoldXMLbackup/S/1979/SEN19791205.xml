      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the County Borough of Waterford (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1979, which was made by the Minister on 8 November last. The order provides for the extension of the boundary of the city of Waterford to take in an area of County Waterford comprising some 7,544 acres approximately.</P>
      <P>The procedure for altering the boundary of Waterford city is governed by section 36 of the Waterford City Management Act, 1939. A petition by Waterford Corporation under this Act was made to the Minister on 22 May this year. A local inquiry was held on 4 September last. Waterford County Council and Corporation were both represented at the inquiry and all other interested parties were afforded an opportunity to express their views. There were no objections to the proposed extension at the public hearing. The proposed extension had already been agreed to by both the corporation and the county council. The inspector in his report on the inquiry recommended that the proposed extension should go ahead without modification. The Minister having considered this report and the inspector's recommendation and the agreement between the local authorities concerned has approved the extension as proposed without modification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped to have the present legislation enacted before the Christmas Recess so that the extension will come into force as from 1 January 1980; this, being the beginning of the financial year, is the date most suitable for both the <Col N="405" /> local authorities and the date which will cause least inconvenience for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The main case made by Waterford Corporation in support of their petition was that the existing area of the city&mdash;2,613 acres&mdash;was totally inadequate to meet development needs.  Of this area only 84 acres is capable of further development. In addition, the built-up area of the city has already spilled over its present boundary. A form of ribbon development has arisen on the arterial routes including not only residential development but also commercial and industrial development. At present, in the immediate environs of the city there are planning permissions for residential development in excess of 1,300 acres. Since 1973 the corporation have been obliged to purchase over 600 acres outside the city in order to satisfy their house building programme. In recent years the designation of Waterford as a regional growth centre and the realisation of this with expanding industrial development has also emphasised the need for the expansion of the city.</P>
    <P>The area to be added to the city under the provisional orders is contiguous to the existing city boundary and includes the electoral divisions of Ballynakill, Killoteran, Kilbarry and Waterford Rural. They all form a coherent unit and can be related to a convenient boundary. Apart from an extension in 1966 which added some 520 acres to the city and minor extensions in 1944 and 1955 the boundary of Waterford city has remained unchanged since 1896.</P>
    <P>As I already mentioned, Waterford County Council have accepted the need for the proposed extension and agreement has been reached between the city and county authorities on all aspects of the matter including a financial settlement.</P>
    <P>The order also contains a number of provisions which are consequential on the extension. These are along the usual lines and provide for the preparation of official maps of the extended city area, the continuation in effect of resolutions <Col N="406" /> and orders, as appropriate, arrangements in regard to the register of electors, employment and hours of trading orders and development plans. I understand that the corporation are busy preparing a new development plan for the added area which will be put on display as soon as the extension is effective.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I would like to ask for the co-operation of Senators in ensuring that it will have a speedy passage so that the boundary extension can become effective on 1 January next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that as far as this party are concerned the Bill will have a speedy passage. It is very hard to keep yourself out of anything. It would be impossible for me to keep myself out of the extension of Waterford County Borough having been born under the mental hospital clock in Waterford a considerable time ago, which may have accounted for a good deal. I had an uncle who used to say in a vague kind of way, looking at a ruin, &ldquo;a very historical kind of place&rdquo;, which meant he absolutely knew nothing about it except that he had been told various things by people which he had since forgotten. There is no doubt about the historical nature of that great city. I have a very great pride in having been born in a city that was given the motto of <i>urbs intacta.</i>  It was given that by Henry VII I believe.  I recollect it as an <i>urbs intacta</i> as I wandered through the streets which are in the present county borough and the territory which is now being taken into the county borough which I understand to be along the Cork, Tramore and Dunmore roads, which I know very well. I owe a great debt to that place in which I lived until the attainment of adulthood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is useful in regard to the information that the Minister has given the House to give some additional figures to inform the Senators broadly my understanding of the effect of enacting this Bill. The present acreage, the Minister has said, is 2,613 acres. The extension, which is in the Waterford area only at <Col N="407" /> this stage&mdash;there is a further development planned&mdash;is that to the figure of 2,613 acres are added 7,544 acres, giving a new figure of 10,157 acres. That is an extension which is almost a multiplier of four of the present boundaries. The population, however, increases quite modestly, according to the estimates that I have, from the existing population within that county borough of 32,600 by 4,650, which is just over 10 per cent, to 37,250.</P>
    <P>All this, as the Minister said, has been agreed with Waterford County Council. One of the reasons why we should all have some enthusiasm here is that there has been full agreement between the borough and the county council. That is very important. The valuation of the city properties is £177,418. It is to be increased by £23,640 to a new total of £201,058.  Perhaps an explanation for the ease with which agreement was reached is that they are doing the transition of business from the extension of the county borough into the county to spread it over a period of three years. It is only going to add 71p in the £ spread over three years to the rates bills of the new people who are being taken into the city.  This is a very moderate increase on what these people are paying to the council on their old rates. We all know that private residences are free from the burden of rates.</P>
    <P>This does not affect the position of dwellinghouses except, curiously, it will provide a relief to the citizens of Waterford, because at the moment they are paying £17 a year for water rates. That will disappear, as I understand the provisions of what is being enacted. It is interesting that this will take only three years, whereas the Drogheda extension is spread over a period of 15 years because of the considerable differential between what the people in the country areas around Drogheda were paying before the extension of Drogheda compared to what they would have to pay as ratepayers of Drogheda.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. I would love to give you the splendid account of the <Col N="408" /> various instructions I received in the city of Waterford and the various towns which I went to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill and take the opportunity to congratulate the people of Waterford for their good timing and good sense of planning which enabled them to have enough land available to be in a position to produce houses at the lowest cost in the country. Any further development along these lines with that kind of foresight I would be happy to support.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for Senator FitzGerald's good humoured intervention and his experience of the Minister for the Environment's proposals in relation to the Bill, and his references to my opening statement in particular. The Senator's figures are accurate in relation to the population. The estimated population of the added area from the 1979 census is 4,860, so the population of Waterford city before the extension was 32,617 and the addition of the 4,860 gives you a figure of 37,477.</P>
      <P>In relation to the acreage, the existing area of Waterford city is 2,613 acres which is made up as follows: developed land, 1,839 acres, undeveloped land, 84 acres, undevelopable land, 500 acres and river and mud, 190 acres. The area being added on to Waterford city is, as I stated in my opening remarks, 7,544 acres which is made up as follows: land, 6,994 acres, river and mud, 550 acres.</P>
      <P>The Senator gave the example of Drogheda and the fact that the difference between the rates paid by the city and the county in that instance will be made up over a 15-year period. His analysis of the reason for the 15-year period in the Drogheda example is correct. In the case of Waterford, the people will be asked to make up the difference between the city and the county over a three-year period. I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions to the Bill.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House what the intention is in regard to the Appropriation Bill?  The normal precedent in the Seanad was that the Bill was discussed, debated fully and passed in the period up to Christmas. Last year, whilst we technically passed the Bill before Christmas, the debate on it did not take place until January. I raise the issue particularly because it seems to me that the Appropriation Bill is the most important Bill which comes before Seanad Éireann as it gives the House scope to discuss a very broad range of matters that are of great concern to this <Col N="410" /> country at this time and is not as confining as are many of the motions which we are presently discussing.</P>

      <P>As far as No. 8 is concerned, it is ordered and subject to its being reached on the one hand and the Minister being finished with the other Bill in the Dáil, those are the only things that may hold it up.  As regards the Appropriation Bill I am not in a position to say at the moment when that will be taken.  We are making inquiries and we will let the Whips of all parties know as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to make part of the domestic law of Ireland, (1) the Treaty relating to the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community and (2) the decision of the Council relating to the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Coal and Steel Community.  The Bill, when enacted into law, will add the Treaty and the decision to the list of &ldquo;Treaties governing the European Communities&rdquo; which is set out in section 1 of the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware of the distinction between the procedures necessary for accession to the EEC and Euratom and those for accession to the European Coal and Steel Community.  In the latter case a decision by the Council only is required; but in the case of accession to the EEC and Euratom, the conditions of admission of a new member state and the adjustments to the Treaties necessitated thereby must be the subject of an agreement between the existing member states and the applicant state. The agreement must be ratified by all the contracting states in accordance with their constitutional requirements. The constitutional requirements in Ireland are that both the Treaty relating to the EEC and Euratom and the decision of the Council on accession to the European Coal and Steel Community must be made part of the domestic law of the State and this, as I have stated, is the purpose of the Bill before the House. In addition, I should note that since the Treaty is an international agreement, it was necessary to satisfy the requirements of Article 29 of the Constitution under which Dáil Éireann must approve the terms of such agreements. A motion to this effect was passed by Dáil Éireann on 27 November 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> As far back as 1959, a full 20 years ago, Greece decided that her future lay with the European Community. It was at this time that she applied for associate status. The Association Agreement was concluded in 1961 and came into operation in 1962. The primary aim of the agreement was to prepare the Greek economy for eventual full membership and the obligations which this would impose. Chiefly, this involved the establishment of a customs union, the harmonisation of policies in a number of fields&mdash;mainly agriculture&mdash;and the provision of financial resources to enable the Greek economy to develop at a higher rate.  Unfortunately, the process of harmonisation had to be suspended during the period of the rule of the Colonels but despite this, considerable economic and social progress was achieved by Greece since the coming into operation of the Athens Agreement in 1962. The decision to seek associate membership in 1959 was politically motivated.</P>
    <P>After the re-establishment of democracy in July 1974, the new Government were naturally anxious to reiterate the commitment of Greece to a future within the Community of European democratic States.  The Association Agreement was reactivated in December 1974 and in June 1975 Greece applied for full membership of the European Communities There can be no doubt but that in making this application, the Government of Prime Minister Karamanlis was seeking to consolidate the position of Greece as a democratic state.  The concern to support this position, as much as any other factor, motivated the Council in February 1976 to accept the application following the favourable opinion given by the Commission.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 19-20 July 1976 the Council agreed to open negotiations leading to accession and on 27 July 1976 a formal opening session of negotiations was held.  Meetings between the Greek delegation and the Community were held on a regular basis until the substance of the negotiations was declared concluded <Col N="413" /> early this year. On 24 May 1979 the decision of the Council of the European Communities on the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Coal and Steel Community was signed. The Council decision on the accession to the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community were also signed on 24 May. The Treaty between the existing member states and the Hellenic Republic concerning accession to the EEC and Euratom was signed on 28 May 1979 in Athens. The Instruments of Accession were ratified by the Greek Parliament on 28 June 1979 and following ratification by the existing member states, Greece will become the tenth member state of the Communities on 1 January 1981.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to the outcome of the negotiations in the various sectors. Copies of a volume entitled &ldquo;Documents concerning the Accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Communities&rdquo; have been circulated to Senators.  This volume sets out the arrangements, conditions and adjustments to the Treaties resulting from the negotiations.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to some of the more important aspects of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The negotiations were conducted on the basis that Greece would accept the <i>acquis communautaire</i> as it exists on the date of accession, subject to the agreed transitional arrangements.  Until 1 January 1981, when Greece will become a full member state of the European Communities, an information and consultation procedure is in operation whereby Greece is kept informed of developments within the Community and especially those of direct relevance to Greece. This procedure allows Greece to submit its views on developments and is similar to that which operated in the case of Ireland, Britain and Denmark in 1972.</P>
    <P>The transitional period which has been agreed is the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; five-year period with some minor exceptions which are not of direct relevance to Ireland. We were particularly concerned during the negotiations that the transitional <Col N="414" /> period be as short as possible and in this regard the result was satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector the Commission initially proposed that the transitional period should be seven years. As we believe that a lucrative market exists in Greece for agricultural produce and particularly for beef and dairy products, Ireland argued successfully for a five-year period. Problems for Ireland in the agricultural sector are not envisaged as Greek agriculture is mainly Mediterranean and will not be in direct competition with Irish agricultural produce in the markets of the Community. It has been said that the addition of a new member state might adversely affect Ireland's position under the common agricultural policy. We have insisted in all discussions on enlargement that the accession of new member states must not be detrimental to the common policies of the Community which must be maintained and must not curtail the development of new policies.</P>
    <P>As regards the customs union sector, under the Association Agreement all Greek industrial imports into the Community have been duty-free. Therefore, accession will pose no great problem for Irish industrial interests. During the negotiations Ireland consistently argued that on accession quotas should be few in number and should be liberalised rapidly. We have attained this aim and the accession of Greece should give further opportunities for industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Greece will participate in the social and regional funds as from the date of accession. The Treaty contains a protocol relating to the economic and industrial development of Greece, similar to that negotiated by Ireland at the time of its accession. Greece will take part in all institutions from the date of accession. For example she will have 24 representatives in the European Parliament. Initially, these representatives will be nominated by the Greek Parliament, but direct elections will be held during 1981. Greece will, of course, be represented in the Council of Ministers <Col N="415" /> in its various formations. She will also, in turn, hold the Presidency for a period of six months and be represented in the Commission, the Court of Justice and the various other institutions of the Community.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might now refer to the general question of enlargement and to the particular concerns which Ireland has expressed in this context. Senators will, of course, be familiar with the recent study of the problems of enlargement which was conducted by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, the results of which were published in their Fifty-First Report. Ireland has always believed, and we have stressed to our partners in the Community, that an enlarged Community should also be a stronger and better Community. We have laid emphasis on the need to examine and reappraise the role of the institutions, decision-making procedures and financing.</P>
    <P>Ireland has insisted that enlargement must not adversely affect the maintenance of present policies or future developments.  In this regard we proposed in July 1976, before the formal opening of negotiations with Greece, that the Council should make a statement to safeguard this position. This was accepted and the Council declared: (1) that the consequences&mdash;in particular the financial consequences of an enlargement must not be detrimental to the common projects and policies of the Community or to those which it intends to carry out in the future, (2) that enlargement must help strengthen a Community dynamic in its aspirations and not weaken or reduce in effectiveness its institutional structures and possibilities for action, and (3) that, with this in view, it was agreed that subject to usual budgetary procedures, on Greek accession appropriate provision would be made for the needs of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>This statement underlined the commitment by the Community to ensure that enlargement did not result in a weaker <Col N="416" /> and less cohesive Community. It was, however, made clear that Ireland had no wish to be an obstacle in the path towards enlargement. Rather, we fully supported the application for membership of the Hellenic Republic and the opportunities it gave for examining the operation of the existing Community and how best it could be adapted to give maximum benefit to all member states.</P>
    <P>During the internal Community discussion on enlargement we paid particular attention to the regional disparities which exist within the present Community and we have achieved a certain degree of success in this matter. We have received aid for drainage in the west of Ireland as a balance to aid to Mediterranean regions within the existing Community and there are Commission proposals for infrastructural aid for the west which have been submitted to the Council. This package of aid does underline the fact that there is an awareness within the Community that serious regional imbalances exist and must be eliminated if the Community is to prosper in its entirety and not just in certain areas. This is not to suggest that the aid we have received is fully adequate for our needs, but it does demonstrate a commitment by our partners in the Community to alleviating the problems of the existing Community as well as those of new member states. I have no hesitation in saying that in an enlarged Community of ten or more, there must be a determined effort to eradicate the disequilibria between the more fully developed parts of the Community and those still in the process of development.</P>
    <P>As regards institutional reform, Senators will be aware that the Report of the Committee of Three Wise Men was available in time for consideration during the European Council on 29-30 November last. The European Council asked the Foreign Ministers to examine the report with a view to preparing the discussion at the next meeting of the European Council. In the meantime, it was decided that the report should be published and as the Taoiseach indicated <Col N="417" /> yesterday in the Dáil copies have been laid before both Houses.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no need to remind Senators of the importance and significance, of Greek accession to the European Communities, both for the Communities and for Greece. Greece has played a predominant part in the history of thought and of political philosophy throughout the ages. Her role in the affairs of mankind has far surpassed her size and economic significance. We must look to Greece for the origins of the political process and, indeed, the seeds of democracy were first sown and later flourished there. It is fitting that the Greek people should now wish to join with this comparatively young community of nations and take her rightful place in shaping the course of European affairs. I have no doubt that the addition of Greece to the European Community will add a dynamic thrust to its development and that her influence and experience will be of assistance in coping with the problems which will no doubt arise in the coming decades.</P>
    <P>The Greek people have ever been strong in defence of their country and their traditions. We look forward to making common cause with the Hellenic Republic within the European Community not only because we have many common interests of an economic nature but also because we both believe firmly in freedom and in the democratic process on which it is based. Given that Ireland has consistently welcomed the application of Greece to accede to the European Communities, and having regard to the fact that the results of the accession negotiations do not adversely affect the interests of this country, I commend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Community's institutional document the preamble states that it is determined to lay the foundations for an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe. We simply must welcome Greece and, speaking for one party in one member state, I most sincerely do. One must resist temptations to talk in an expansive <Col N="418" /> way about the significance of Greece. I hope I shall resist these temptations, except to say that anyone who underrates the Greek contribution to the shaping of the modern world and to the modern intellectual position, does not understand what he is talking about.</P>
      <P>When we talk about our inheritance we think of the Roman-Judaic-Hellenic thing.  We are forgetting the extraordinary Hellenic influence on the pre-Christian Judaic position.  I am not sure that the Community does not need a great deal of clarification as to its objects. One has to resist the temptation of flying far away from what is pertinent to most of the discussions in the Seanad today. The very form, the very words used in the EEC themselves raise a question about the nature of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>Which community really has in it the elements of survival through long periods of time, of a useful way for its members, which places such an emphasis on &ldquo;economic&rdquo; that the very word appears in the title of the Community itself?  I would hope that Greek membership might even, if not through Greek voices, send Western thought back to examining what is the state all about&mdash;what are the essential elements of the predominant requisites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is usual now to say that the Christian churches are all wrong in their catechetical emphasis and in this whole business of learning things by rote. I am not so sure that I go along with all of that criticism. I know learning things by rote taught me an awful lot that did not particularly have to do with Christian revelation, such as the cardinal virtues, which perhaps in this day Irish people should be thinking about. I remember learning the cardinal virtues and if I understand &ldquo;cardinal&rdquo;, it comes from a Latin word, <i>cardo</i> for a hinge.  Therefore, the word means the healthy human being, the quality of whose life hinges around his practice, his capacity to be temperate, to be prudent, not to go beyond his intellectual, psychical, physiological, economic resources, whatever you may call them: to just dispose <Col N="419" /> prudently of what he has and what that community has, not to go ranging in a gambling fashion after something, but to be prudent, to be temperate with regard to it; to have a golden medium guiding the manner in which he lives; to be prudent and temperate and to carry on, despite difficulties and darkness, with fortitude.</P>
    <P>The most important element of them all which should animate this Community more than it does is justice. I would hope that instead of engaging in petty bargaining points or petty points of the kind that I hope I would be reasonably well instructed to make about the nature of Irish interest at this stage, we would begin to think&mdash;not merely people in Dublin or people in Athens but the governing people in all the member states&mdash;of this essential quality of justice throughout the Community in all our policies: not merely looking for regional and social policies because they happen to suit the particular gang who are around, but to be concerned for justice everywhere in the Community, in southern Italy as well as western Ireland. It is only if we can build up around some symbol the sense of the justice and purpose of this Community that it will endure. Large question marks arise, of course, with regard to its endurability.</P>
    <P>At any rate, Greece joins this Community more or less on the lowest rung of the material ladder. Not all things are by any means exhausted even if these material figures are correct. Sometimes figures are very misleading because of the nature of the calculations involved&mdash;the lowest rung of the material ladder just about like ourselves in terms of gross domestic product.</P>
    <P>At a time when there is a doubt about the Community's ability to maintain the existing policies with justice, or concerned to achieve justice for the existing members, and at a time when we have two members of the nine, one which is challenging the actual entitlement of the Community to its own resources, if I understand correctly the British position, <Col N="420" /> and the other which no doubt for real political reasons is placing an arbitrary sort of ceiling on the ability to maintain and increase these resources, the question arises of the structure of Greek agriculture, the percentage of people in Greece who are engaged in farming. Nowadays this sort of figure is produced as if it is evidence of a totally convincing kind that you have to stay quiet immediately you hear that because there are four times as many people engaged in agriculture in Greece as there are in the rest of the Community. That is the end of the story. There is nothing more to be said.</P>
    <P>The process of urbanisation is obviously to improve the image of any policy which increases what is regarded as something to be welcomed.  Questions should be asked about all these things in a way which they are not being asked, that I can see. They are certainly not being asked in a manner which is penetrating the consciousness of the people who are casting their votes or to those who present policies or to those who comment on policies.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, the addition of Greece will add to the strains on Community resources which are limited in the way which we know, which are stretched in the way we know, to cope with existing policies. I do not know what degree of validity there is to any of the percentage calculations, but Greece will obviously be an additional substantial claimant on these resources. I have seen a figure, I believe we in the Joint Committee were given a figure, about the additional percentage to the guarantee section, that there would be an increased expenditure of 5 per cent. Is this estimate of a 5 per cent increase based solely on existing provisions in current regulations? Does it take account of the fact, which we understand, that the Community proposes to provide a market system for cotton when Greece joins, Greece being the only significant producer of cotton?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to what extent he envisages the Greek accession will require the common agricultural <Col N="421" /> policy to be orientated towards Mediterranean-type products at the expense of other products?  In the Dáil on 15 February 1978, according to the Official Report, Volume 305, column 1315, the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that a commitment to enlarge the resources proportionately with extended membership had been extended by the Council and recorded in the Council's minutes. Could I ask is this commitment in any way affected by recent reported and published events?  Perhaps through the Chair I could ask the Minister another question which should be taken in the context of my party's and my own complete welcome for Greece's membership. The question arises from my noticing that Protocol No. 7, negotiated by Greece on economic and industrial development, is identical with our Protocol No. 30 on the subject.  Greece negotiated this and no doubt in doing so adopted the belief that the terms of that protocol have been of particular benefit to this member state since we joined the community.  To what extent is the apparent Greek belief in this shared by the Minister?  Has the Minister compared Greece and Ireland from the point of view of these two countries' relative attractiveness for foreign investment and in so far as in both countries there are state aids to attract industry flowing from that investment does the Minister believe that the relative positions are to be maintained after accession?  I understand that Greece has an elaborate system of regional aids as well as a scheme for aiding export industry.  If both of them involve tax concessions&mdash;my understanding of this may be incorrect, but that is my understanding&mdash;would the Minister comment as to whether these are to continue after accession?</P>
    <P>My final point I genuinely make in a constructive way and in a manner genuinely seeking information and is not of a debating character.  Figures of the broadest kind are available to me, but everyone knows that modern Greece is one of the major ship-owning countries in the world.  According to the magnitudes available to me, or impressed on me, the effect of Greece joining <Col N="422" /> the Community will be that the Community's overall percentage of the world fleet will be increased from 20 to 30.  A point of very great importance to me and of necessity to every concerned human being on this earth is that the IMCO Conventions, MARPOLS and SOLAS, are seen by the Community as having an important contribution to make in the area of combating marine pollution by tankers, if these conventions are brought into force.  Does the Community, with the strength of owning 30 per cent of the world's fleet, intend to use that strength to bring these conventions into force so as to muster force against marine pollution with its appalling ultimate human consequences?  If the Community feels that it will have the kind of elbow required to do this, is there any reason to wait until Greece becomes a member?  Can it not start using that force now?</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to express, I am sure in common with many other Members of the Oireachtas, a word of appreciation for the present Greek Ambassador, Constantine Zepos and his wife, Greta, for the contribution they have made to the social, cultural and intellectual life of this city and country.</P>

      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the coming accession, as a full member of our Community, of the Greek Republic.  There is no need to go too much into the history of Greece.  It has often been said in the Houses here, and in Europe over the years, that part of the reason for welcoming the Greek people is that Greece has been known as the cradle of democracy.  Indeed, that introduces a special sense of history in the light of our own very strong belief and that of the European Community and its foundation in the democratic way of life. The history of Greece since the last war is very interesting in that they were, for a short period, as the Minister said, deprived of democratic rights under the Colonels.  During my period in Europe as a member of the parliamentary committee of the Parliament I found myself meeting the Greek parliamentarians in different places, in Luxembourg, Greece and Paris, I found the same expression <Col N="423" /> given privately by numbers of them, as was the experience with the Spaniards, that one of the reasons why it was possible to effect, if I may so describe it, the peaceful change-over from the system of dictatorship to acceptance of the democratic system, was the will of the majority of the people in those countries, particularly Greece, to be involved in the Community of the European nations.</P>
      <P>It is important to keep in mind that one of the conditions of membership of the Community is that your political system must be democratic.  In an indirect way it is to the credit of the Community in its original foundations, in its continuity, that this was a factor which weighed with people in the countries in question&mdash;Great Britain, Spain and Portugal.</P>
      <P>I do not think any of us have any illusions about the problem that must be created by the enlargement of the Community. These are practical problems and will have to be faced up to over future years by the existing member states of the Community and their political leaderships.  It is perfectly obvious, for example, that once you grant full membership to any other country there must be an effect on the total financial budget of the Community in relation to both the social fund and the regional fund since any full member automatically qualifies in the ordinary way to benefit from these funds.  In that sense, we should be aware that in the interest of a better Europe, of the strengthening of the European Community and of the spirit of unity among European nations, that all the member states and the people of the existing European Community from time to time may have to make over the next ten to 15 years some adjustments and drastic sacrifices in order to continue the process of development of Europe, in order to entertain future enlargement.  I believe that in terms of the great advantage not alone in stability of the European Community itself, future enlargement will far outweigh any difficulties that we may have to impose on ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> It is obvious that there are and will be problems in this area, and indeed we know that we have problems at the present time.  One is the question of the degree of loyalty towards the ideals of the Community of at least one of our existing member states.  One is forced to question how much some of the people, particularly one member state, are thinking of themselves rather than of the concept of free nations working together. The recent summit is an example of what I can only describe as a more selfish approach, a more of the mé féin approach to something which in my view is greater than any of our existing countries or member states.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the last debate on this subject here, I said that one of the causes of concern is that so far there is no indication of any method in the Community resources, in the Community report, of budgeting for the prospective cost of membership even of the Greek Republic alone.  This is a matter, of course, for the member governments and so far there is no information on how the additional cost of Greek membership, which will be quite substantial, is to be met.  In the coming couple of years we will be moving towards economic problems which have been touched on already.  They will have to be dealt with. Nevertheless, in conclusion I welcome the accession of Greece.  It is a positively progressive step in the life of the European Community and I look forward to further developments in that area in relation to other European countries, notably Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House may know, I am not an enthusiast for what is inaccurately being called Europe and I am not going to pretend that I am overcome by emotion on this occasion.  Mind you, I have nothing against the Greeks, they are a fine body of men, I am sure, like the Dublin Metropolitan Police, but there are some remarks I want to make, since, of course, the enlargement affects the only country to which I profess allegiance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ministerial introduction strikes <Col N="425" /> me as more than usually bland in its rather optimistic prediction of the consequences of Greek accession.  Greece having the connotations it has, it is easy, I suppose, to be romantic and to think of the symbol of liberation, the symbol of nationalism as it was in the 19th century, and to invoke, of course, its classical greatness.  But this is only so much romantic credit, because quite seriously the achievements of Greece in the classical period, apart from the fact, by the way, that in large measure the Greeks rested on a servile infrastructure, are no more relevant to modern Greece than the Island of Saints and Scholars, if ever such existed, is relevant to the present condition in this country.</P>
    <P>The reason why the Community welcomes Greece is basically a political one: it wants Greece on that outflank, if you like, of south-eastern Europe, and I suppose the move is welcome to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation military brass as much as it is to the EEC leaders.  But let us not have any illusions. If Greece underwent a period of military dictatorship there is no guarantee that it will not do so again: there is no guarantee that the Colonels are gone forever.  I attended last year a small conference in Germany of a group of European liberals.  The only reason I was asked was because they were looking for a parliamentarian from each country who belonged to the Liberal Party and since there is no Liberal Party in Ireland&mdash;at least not avowedly so&mdash;they accepted my liberal credentials, for which I was very grateful.  It was a small and intimate seminar for the most part. Its purpose was to discuss the accession of Greece and the eventual accession of Spain and Portugal as well.  Therefore, the backbench parliamentarians from Spain, Portugal and Greece played a very prominent role in those discussions. I must say, as St. Paul said, speaking as one less wise, I kept my mouth shut for the most time and listened to what they had to say.  They were very realistic, all three.</P>
    <P>However, let us think for a moment of the Greeks and about the problems <Col N="426" /> raised by accession.  The representatives of the Nine present who were also, if you like, ordinary &ldquo;Joe Soaps&rdquo;, were equally realistic about the problems posed by the enlargement.  Grave doubt was expressed throughout the whole seminar as to the ability of the Community's machinery to bear the enlargement, putting it in the context of that problem alone; that the original Six had sufficient difficulty in shaping the whole machinery of the Community to suit their needs and that a further strain was put on it by the enlargement to the Nine and that a problem of crisis proportions is presented by the prospect of an enlargement to twelve.  That is one problem which is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I am coming back to my question about the real strength of democracy in modern day Greece.  My impression was&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the ordinary people of Greece had not expressed any great deal of interest in their country's accession to the EEC.  I should like to know whether there was, has been, or is going to be a referendum on entry.  At least, though I disagreed with the majority of my fellow countrymen in their decision to support overwhelmingly our membership, I am, as a democrat, extremely glad it was taken.  I wonder whether a similar popular endorsement is in question in Greece.  I find it difficult even as a layman to accept the Minister's assurance when he said in the course of his introductory speech:</P>
    <P>Problems for Ireland in the agricultural sector are not envisaged as Greek agriculture is mainly Mediterranean and will not be in direct competition with Irish agricultural produce in the markets of the Community.</P>
    <P>I wonder is that true.  I should like to hear the opinions of Members of the House who are more experienced in these matters than I am.  Then the Minister went on:</P>
    <P>It has been said that the addition of a new member state might adversely affect Ireland's position under the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> Instead of saying this is not so, the Minister went on:</P>
    <P>We have insisted in all discussions on enlargement that the accession of new member states must not be detrimental to the common policies of the Community....</P>
    <P>In fact there is no guarantee possible that the accession of Greece will not be detrimental to the common agricultural policy, will not further drive the CAP into crisis.  It seems to me that when Greece made its application to join, the prospects for the common agricultural policy were much brighter than they have become subsequently.  If Greece is to be a net beneficiary, if we are to be a net beneficiary of the common agricultural policy, it seems to me that someone has to give.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the regional and social funds and the increased pressures that could be put on them with the accession of Greece and, later on, Spain and Portugal.  There is one final problem posed by the accession of Greece, that is that with its accession the Community will inherit one of&mdash;shall we say&mdash;the running sores of Europe.  It will inherit the problem of Cyprus, because the Community will not only include Greece but will continue, presumably, to have friendly relations with Turkey.  Therefore, in a particular sense the Community will inherit a problem of racial and religious conflict: perhaps of all possible parallel problems in the world today, one that quite resembles the conflict in Northern Ireland and the relative parties involved.  My question is: does the Community propose to do anything about this problem?  Before we joined the Common Market we were assured in the preceding campaign that our membership would contribute to the solution of the problems in Northern Ireland.  We were told that the common membership of people North and South&mdash;we heard the same story again in the context of the direct elections&mdash;the common experience of Irish members, whether they were orange or green sitting together in Brussels and Strasbourg, would somehow&mdash;in a way <Col N="428" /> we were not told&mdash;contribute to the solution of the problems.  The rueful experience has been that that is not so.  My point is that I hope the Greeks will not believe that the EEC will solve their problems in that respect and that they will not be conned into thinking that that is one of the reasons they are joining the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome wholeheartedly this Bill and the prospect of membership of Greece in the EEC.  In spite of what Senator Murphy has just said, one can look back to Greek traditions, to what Greece has contributed&mdash;as the Minister said&mdash;to the political thought in Europe. The whole basis of the EEC is founded on a certain concept of Europe as an entity. Europe without Greece is that much less truly European.  One can, therefore, welcome the accession of Greece, particularly since Greece is a country which has only comparatively recently emerged from a period of dictatorship.  We need be in no doubt that for the Greek people membership of the EEC is looked upon as a safeguard, almost a bulwark, against the possibility of a return of dictatorship. The fact that we are today dealing with this question of Greek entry into the EEC and that the negotiations between the EEC and Greece have been successfully completed is an indication of the fact that the Treaty of Rome and the other Treaties connected with it are open to all European democracies.  I was going to say I am surprised but I have had enough experience of him not to be surprised, but one ought to be surprised, at Senator Murphy's hostile attitude to Greek entry.  I can just imagine, if Greece were not being admitted to the EEC, if the EEC had decided, as they would have decided had they been looking merely to self-interest, not to admit Greece because life is more comfortable without them, Senator Murphy coming in here and talking about the rich men's club, the selfishness of these Europeans who were sitting within their ivory towers looking after themselves and to hell with everybody else.  I can just imagine that would be the attitude he would have adopted.  But one cannot win with <Col N="429" /> Senator Murphy.  When we are admitting Greece&mdash;and as I will mention later one must concede at some expense to our own community&mdash;when we are daring to do this because we have a feeling for Europe as an entity, a feeling for a concept that all European democracies who can, economically speaking, withstand the pace of membership should be let in, people like Senator Murphy come along and tell us that really we should be taking a selfish attitude and just saying to these people: &ldquo;Go away, please, and leave us in peace&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We must not do that.  We must be realistic about this and we must not ignore the fact that clearly there are practical disadvantages in the way of having Greece as a member of the EEC, and still more later on, if the question arises, of having Spain and Portugal as members.</P>
      <P>When it comes to purely economic matters, the question of trade&mdash;as the Minister has pointed out&mdash;we in Ireland will not be really affected one way or the other.  I think that it was Senator Murphy who mentioned the question of Greek aids to industry and would they be continued.  It does not really matter from our point of view because the plain fact of the matter is that for some years past there has been free trade for industrial products between Greece and the EEC.  Therefore, entry into the EEC will not affect industrial exports from Greece one way or the other.  As the Minister has pointed out, it may somewhat increase the potential market for our exports.  But when it comes to financial matters, particularly those concerned with the budget, of course we can see potential disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that in regional policy, social policy and on the question of the CAP, Greece, like ourselves, will be a considerable net beneficiary.  We know that the Council has taken a formal position at, I think, the instigation of the Irish representatives, that the entry of Greece will not in fact be detrimental to these various funds.  We must have regard to several facts.  The introduction of a large net beneficiary, such as <Col N="430" /> Greece, will probably make it more difficult to bring about the sort of increases in regional and social policies in the future that we would hope for; they may well remain as they are, but money will be provided to make up for the difference. At the same time it will make it more difficult in future years to get an increase. Also, we need to be in no doubt that the fairly large net transfers that will have to go to Greece will speed the day when we simply run out of money.  It will bring that much earlier the day when the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; will expire, when we will have to have a larger amount from VAT or whatever form of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; is decided upon.</P>
    <P>We must also accept that there will be repercussions on the CAP.  There is already, particularly in southern France and in Italy, a feeling that the CAP is orientated too much to northern Europe, not sufficiently to the Mediterranean. Greek entry will obviously strengthen the Mediterranean lobby, as it were, and even more so in the future were Spain and Portugal to come in.  We can expect that along with the other disadvantages the other problems that will arise in the near future in regard to the CAP we will also have the attitude from the south that Mediterranean products are not sufficiently covered and that too much money goes to northern Europe.  Clearly also there will be a problem about decision-making.  We already have the situation that decision-making in the Community is extremely slow and hazardous.  It is very difficult to get decisions from the Council of Ministers.  At any one time there are about 300 different items lying around, in pigeonholes on which no decision has been taken and, in some cases, on which no decision will ever be taken.</P>
    <P>We have the problem also of the Commission itself.  One hopes that the recommendations of the Three Wise Men will be carried out as soon as possible with regard to such things as more majority voting in the Council and so on. One also hopes that the recommendations of the Spierenburg Report&mdash;a sort of five wise men from whom the Commission <Col N="431" /> got a report recently&mdash;will be implemented.  In particular there seems to be a good deal to be said for the proposal in both these reports that there should be one Commissioner only for each country irrespective of size.  As it stands we already have 13 Commissioners; with Greece it is going to be 14 and presumably another three later on from Spain and Portugal.  One can imagine the whole Commission procedures becoming bogged down with that kind of membership.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of languages.  As we know one of the great problems in the EEC is the fact that everything is done in six languages.  All speeches are simultaneously interpreted into six languages.  Every document &mdash;and there are thousands upon thousands of documents&mdash;has to be translated into six languages.  Already about 40 per cent of the entire Secretariat of the Commission in Brussels consists simply of people who are interpreting or translating.  The introduction of a seventh language&mdash;one that does not even use ordinary European letters but which will involve a whole new range of new typewriters, printing machines and so on, will make matters that much worse.  The mind boggles at the thought that, with Greece, Spain and Portugal, we could end up with nine languages.  Ultimately something will have to be done to try to cut down these problems.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, with all these disadvantages one must welcome the entry of Greece.  In spite of all the problems we have at present it is a sign of confidence in the future of the EEC.  It is also a demonstration that, in spite of what the cynics say, the EEC is not simply a rich man's club interested only in itself; that we can, with confidence, expect that the new Greek members&mdash;at whatever level, whether in the Commission, the Council of Ministers or in the European Parliament&mdash;will have strongly at heart the European ideal.  We may look forward to greeting them as men who will be interested in the future development <Col N="432" /> of Europe.  Two of the three countries who joined last, Denmark and the UK, clearly have not shown the interest in Europe as an entity or in the development of Europe one would have hoped for.  I think Greece will; everything goes to show that in Greece we will have a strong and active ally in the future of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill which is necessary to relate the entry of Greece to the domestic law of this land. It is in this very area of domestic matters that we run into problems with the Bill for obvious reasons.</P>
      <P>To start with, we have to say in this House and country that we welcome the accession of Greece to the European Community.  We welcome it for a great many reasons.  Our country has been a relatively poor one which has benefited very significantly economically, politically, psychologically and socially through membership of the European Community and through the association which we have developed with other countries in western Europe.  I do not think we can afford the luxury of looking only at the aspects of life that affect our own narrow interests and of judging these matters in that vein, but I shall have something to say about that later. In the broadest sense in regard to a country such as Greece, which, in this century has had a great many political difficulties, which has lived under a dictatorship, a country with a poor infrastructure, a good deal of poverty, with a lesser level of development even than our own relatively poor country, we have got to be broad in this issue and welcome them into the Community despite the obvious discomfort it will cause us.  We have much in common in both countries; we are relatively poor, have a love of life, an agricultural base to our economy along with a tourist base. We are both maritime countries, although they have developed their maritime aspect to an infinitely greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The admission of Greece is not simply a question of economics.  I would not go <Col N="433" /> away with the notion that the countries of Europe, France, Britain, Germany and others, are being altruistic in admitting Greece because obviously there are very strong political reasons, in the interests of western Europe&mdash;just as in the interests of Greece&mdash;that Greece should be admitted.  Looking to the future political welfare, to the security of western Europe in the future against the background of this century in which there were two world wars, in which there is dominant communism in eastern Europe, obviously with the fragile state of democracy in Greece, the admission of Greece into the European Economic Community, the helping of Greece economically by the Community and the strengthening of the democratic links, as Senator Murphy rightly said, strengthen the south-eastern flank of Europe in a very delicate part of the globe at present. It is a two-way bargain.  It is not just a question of Greece being the beggar. Greece has a great deal to offer to Europe not only in the strengthening of democracy in its own country but in the broader contribution, to the strengthening of the security of Europe.</P>
    <P>Apart from the objective reasons for which we sincerely welcome Greece&mdash;I am glad to note the presence in this House of the Ambassador of Greece to this country and to offer him sincere best wishes for his country's entry to Europe&mdash;there are reasons for great concern within this country.  These have obviously to do with the economics of the matter.  If I stress the economics, and if I speak in a somewhat narrow vein for the next few minutes, I am not in any sense suggesting that the answer is that Greece should not be admitted.  I do not even begin to suggest that the responsibility for our problems rests with Greece but rather with the Community itself.</P>
    <P>It seems to be naive to suggest, as we have tended to do despite the commitments of the Council, that the admittance of Greece and later of Spain and Portugal, three Mediterranean countries, will not affect the interests of this country. <Col N="434" /> The background against which we are living at present suggests that that will not be the situation.  In Spain they are having great difficulties in negotiating at present.  They are running into an extremely difficult attitude by the French Government which persuaded the Spanish Prime Minister to go to Paris last week to try to sort out his problems. We have seen the attitude of Britain at the recent Summit meeting in Dublin, and despite the fact that we have supposed guarantees in previous resolutions in Council that the admittance of Greece, Spain and Portugal will occur without the interests of this country being affected, I take that with a huge grain of salt.  The Government need to be extremely vigilant about the entry of Greece, Spain and Portugal to ensure that the interests which we have established, and which we have protected by resolution of the Council, are in fact protected and that there is this commitment by the Community at large to ensure that we do not suffer as a result of the entry of the Mediterranean countries.</P>
    <P>It is fortunate that in 1976 Deputy FitzGerald, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, was able to insert in the protocol the two pre-conditions, which were made pre-conditions and which were carried by the Council at that time, relative to the admittance of Greece.  The first was the pre-condition that the admittance of Greece would not result in financial consequences which would be detrimental to this country.  This was adopted as a policy document by the Council.  The second point was that the enlargement of the Community should strengthen rather than weaken the institutions of the EEC. The second point is very important.  At first glance, we had problems in extending the size of the Community from six countries to nine and where we had institutional problems in welding this mass together, at first sight the extension of the Community from an entity of six to one of nine countries must make this task much more difficult rather than easier.  If we are dealing against a philosophical background of commitment to the concept of Europe by France and Britain as it exists in this country <Col N="435" /> and in the other smaller countries in Europe, and in Germany to a considerable extent, one might have more hope for the future.</P>
    <P>But looking at the attitudes that have been expressed and the attitudes of extreme self-interest by France and Britain in this regard, I cannot be very optimistic about the institutional aspects of it.  It seems that the very fact that we are extending this Community to bring in the three Mediterranean nations without having due regard to the difficulties that will ensue when this happens is possibly an indication of the flippant attitude to the EEC by some of the larger countries in Europe at present.</P>
    <P>The specific area where we will be affected is of course the common agricultural policy.  We are already witnessing an assault on the CAP, because Greece's admittance is likely to result in great pressures on the agricultural sector. Again, this is against the background expressed by Senator Yeats that the admittance of the Mediterranean countries will alter significantly the entire character of the Community.  When we talk about aspects of the common agricultural policy and the different nature of agriculture in the Mediterranean countries in comparison with the more temperate climates to the north, the altering of this structure will have profound effects on us.  It is another reason for our interests to be protected.</P>
    <P>In regard to regional policy, a country in the southern Mediterranean with a poor infrastructure and the legitimate demands it will have, obviously will be in competition with the entry of this country. It brings us back to the fact that the commitment of the Council has to be followed through.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has to see that this party will be paid for, that funds will be strengthened, if necessary by raising this 1 per cent limit which is becoming ludicrous having regard to the extent of the financial commitment at present and the bankruptcy facing the Community next year unless something is done about this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> I have stressed the economic factors and the natural areas of self-interest in this country which it is our obligation to express in this House and our obligation to our electorate.  Having said that in the broadest sense possible, having regard to the extent to which we have done so well during our membership of the Community, the extent to which it has reduced the level of introspection in this country, the extent to which it has allowed us to be less dependent economically and politically on Britain, the extent to which it has brought us into the mass of Europe, looking at our experiences and seeing what these experiences can do for Greece, we wholeheartedly welcome their admittance to the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most Senators that the enlargement of the Community from nine to 12 states in the years ahead will create new problems and new opportunities and that we should not permit our over-zealous commitment to the European idea to obscure the difficulties it will bring.  Many of the problems, as we have heard today, are specific to Ireland.  Others concern the organisation of the EEC itself.  I am glad that the Minister has recalled that the initial thrust towards European unity was powered by a political rather than an economic motive.</P>
      <P>As Senator Staunton said, two wars tore the Continent apart in the space of 30 years and the threat of a further conflagration had to be averted, and it now goes unremarked that the formation of the EEC was the first serious anti-war movement.  This is a reason why we welcome Greece, now that it has won its freedom for democracy.  We hope its joining represents a further insurance in the development against radical attitudes in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties that will arise may seem trivial, but to a small peripheral country like Ireland they are anything but small.  In the first instance all three are intermediate economies with large agricultural sectors.  In EEC terms they are relatively poor and will be joining <Col N="437" /> Ireland at the bottom of the EEC living standard, as we have heard other Senators say.  Senator FitzGerald said that Ireland's <i>per capita</i> gross domestic product was just below Spain's and just above Greece's.  Greece and the other two candidate members will add significantly to the EEC's population. Together they have a combined population of more than 50 million people, or 20 per cent of the existing numbers. Further, the three potential new members will increase the agricultural land in the Community by more than 50 per cent.  But these regions and their relative poverty in EEC terms, and their fairly substantial agricultural sectors will all make significant demands on the EEC budget.  They will be looking for the crumbs from the EEC table.  Since 1973, Ireland has been able to argue for economic aid based on being the poorest member state and we have benefited greatly thereby.  We have been defined as an undeveloped country for purposes of regional aid.  With the accession of Greece, Ireland will no longer be able to plead the case of singular poverty. Following the transitional period, equal treatment will have to be accepted as a fact of life.  This point was expanded on by Senator Staunton.</P>
    <P>There is also a further difficulty. Ireland's small size is to our advantage. Special financial assistance to this country, with a population of just over 3 million, is a very different question from providing aid to a group of countries which will then have a population in the undeveloped sense of nearly 60 million. Budgetary transfers to the poorer member states will simply become more expensive for the donor countries.</P>
    <P>I am glad that reassurances have been given by the Minister.  I want to underline the fact that a vigilant attitude will be required if our national interests are to be adequately protected.  It is also important that the EEC does not fragment itself into first and second divisions for conflicts of interest will arise between the stronger and the weaker nations.  The Commission vice-president in charge of enlargement, Mr. Lorenzo Natali, has <Col N="438" /> already admitted that the imbalances existing within the Community will be amplified by the accession of these three countries.</P>
    <P>Crucial difficulties will probably arise over the budgetary transfers effected through the common agricultural policy. All three are substantial agricultural producers and what they produce to any appreciable extent may not mean direct competition with us but indirectly there will be competition for the available CAP supports.  At a time when CAP is hardening&mdash;many Senators have referred to this&mdash;the additional burden implicit in supporting prices for Greece is certain to impart added vigour to call for the abolition of CAP.  There is no doubt that Britain will use the enlargement of the Community to strengthen her case for reforming all the EEC institutions and policies.  Apart from the budget and the common agricultural policy, we must carefully watch for the proposed changes of Community competition, regional and industrial policies.</P>
    <P>The British public, and quite a few of her allies, are being conned by the tremendous media coverage which the Prime Minister is getting in her complaint about Britain's net contribution. What is not being highlighted is the amount of agricultural products which she imports from Commonwealth countries, for which Britain has to pay a contribution, whilst if she was taking flour from France, or more dairy produce from the other EEC countries, her contribution would be less.  The impending enlargement of the EEC makes early agreement on reducing the net contribution by Britain to the Community budget all the more imperative from her point of view.  This is something which I feel we must watch, particularly in view of last week's Summit.</P>
    <P>Our trade with Greece has grown substantially in the last five years with an interchange of both agricultural and industrial products.  Our main imports have been in dried fruits and products like those but unexpectedly there has been a sizeable quantity of industrial products, including textiles and yarns. <Col N="439" /> The cute Irish importer does not miss the opportunity to sell cheaper products. The Greeks through lower all-round costs can sell more cheaply.  I stress this factor to underline the major economic problem facing us, that is the necessity to moderate our income expectations all the more with another competitor coming on to the field.</P>
    <P>Even without taking enlargement into account, the Community's own resources will be insufficient to meet expenditure after 1981.  It is clear that the accession of Greece, which will be a net beneficiary, will greatly aggravate the budgetary difficulties of the Community and put even present policies in jeopardy unless new resources are made available. We all know that the EEC is seekng ways of getting further revenue to cope with the growing demands of more costly policy programmes in the years ahead.  Ireland's continued prosperity within the EEC lies in substantial growth in this kitty but we must not support the easy way out of thinking that the way of doing this is increasing member states' receipts from VAT without a great deal of consideration, particularly until the rates of VAT are harmonised.</P>
    <P>The welcome we extend to Greece on her entry into the EEC should be positive, but we must press very strongly for a real distribution of resources.  I am glad to hear the Minister's assurances that our interests will be safeguarded.  I, too, join other Senators in welcoming the Greek Ambassador here this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody realises that in contrast to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil the Labour Party opposed entry into the EEC.  However, as a democratic party we have our institutions.  They are being worked and we have our representatives at European level and we have our spokesmen both in the Seanad and Dáil who can actually make an input in matters dealing with the EEC.  Once the EEC is working and functioning it is only right and proper that we should not be selfish about other countries if in fact any benefits can flow to those countries. I say that as a socialist rather than someone who might use the ultra national sense and ask what is it going to mean to us?  Our endeavour is to bring as many people as we can into the most beneficial situation possible.  Even though we were opposed to entry into the EEC, it now exists and because it exists, and because of the way things are built into the system, it is only natural that if you want to survive in certain areas of Europe the best place for your country to be in the long term is in this Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I want to say now in view of the remarks from the Chair, and I take them to be quite correct, is that we are still very disturbed by the very features that made us oppose entry into the EEC. We did not believe all the promises that were made on the regional policy, on the social policy, the industrial policy, energy policy and so on and the noncompulsory expenditure area.  We did not think that those things could be delivered.  We now have the problem that the general budget for 1980 is liable to affect those things even more, particularly when we are low down in the table with regard to the standard of living. It means in effect that we are in a position now where it could well be that we could actually remain in that position and not move from it.  The Greeks believe they need EEC membership.  The people in Europe have agreed to it.  All we can say is, welcome to the Greek people and we hope they are doing the <Col N="441" /> right thing.  At the same time, I hope their entry will not in effect worsen our problems here.  We have got enough of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the welcome being given to the Bill and to the accession of Greece to the Community.  It is perhaps particularly welcome to me because, with my colleague, Senator Brennan, we put down a motion about 18 months ago welcoming the application of Greece to join the European Economic Community. However, although welcoming the accession of Greece I do not think it should be an uncritical or unqualified welcome either from our point of view or from the point of view of the Greeks and of course there was very considerable debate and divergence of opinion in Greece as to whether they should join the EEC, a debate which was very interesting and in some ways modelled on our own.  I was reminded of this by Senator Harte's contribution because it was a labour-socialist group in Greece which opposed entry to the EEC.  I will come back to that, if I may, in a few moments.</P>
      <P>First of all, I have made some general points.  Greece is a country not much larger than Ireland, with a population of somewhere about 8¾ million at the last census, and presumably now somewhere around nine million or so people, with an area of somewhere around 50,000 square miles.  So in size and population it is very similar to us, more so than any of the other members of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With certain obvious exceptions, many of the attitudes of the Community and of our own will be very similar. From this point of view we should welcome the Greek accession.  There may be one or two points on which they will differ very markedly from us.  It has been mentioned that Greece has had a very long and proud tradition of democracy.  Democracy began in Greece even though it was submerged so often both in classical times and throughout the middle ages and again more recently. It has nonetheless always managed to reemerge <Col N="442" /> and I have no doubt whatever, contrary to what certain other speakers said, that any threat to democracy in Greece will be well and truly met by the Greek people.  They have shown their love for democracy and their determination to reassert it.</P>
    <P>Turning to slightly more mundane matters, it is a practical fact at the moment that industrial imports in relation to Greece are already duty free.  I think some Irish exporters have been taking effective advantage of this although there are probably many opportunities still to come.  Perhaps agriculture is much more relevant and for Irish agriculture there should be very good opportunities from Greece.  Greece is very much an importer of meat and of dairy products generally, and this may well prove to be an important market for us, small though Greece is.</P>
    <P>Another aspect touched upon in a slightly different way by other speakers was the shipping element.  Greece has built up an enormous merchant marine which will now effectively be a part of the EEC merchant marine.  I would hope that in addition to the general accession of this merchant navy to the EEC it will perhaps also stimulate this small country to build up our merchant fleet much more than hitherto.</P>
    <P>In relation to regional development, I would hope that the accession of Greece will be a very definite spur to regional development rather than a hindrance. The Greeks will have a very natural correct interest in this matter.  This was one of the matters that caused concern to certain of the larger states during the course of the discussion of Greece's application. We have seen very dramatically recently the attitude taken by one of the major states in relation to the EEC and certainly there has been an unfortunate tendency over the last two or three years for certain of the major states in the EEC to hold their own private discussions and to some extent to suggest that the decisions which they take should be endorsed by the other members of the EEC.  This is something which our Government have rightly <Col N="443" /> resisted and which it is very important we should continue to resist as fully as we can.  And here Greece's interests will clearly march with our own and, I would hope, effectively.  During the course of the negotiations there have been certain pointers, such as possible reduction in the number of commissioners to one from each country which would be very suitable perhaps from our point of view and lessen this tendency towards domination by the big two or the big three of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I mention at the beginning that accession was by no means unanimous among the Greeks.  In fact there was a very definite upswing in the left wing or anti-EEC vote between the 1974 and 1977 elections.  I understand that the socialist party increased their seats from something like 60 to more than 90 seats. Admittedly some of this was at the expenses of the Communists but it was nonetheless quite a significant increase. Equally well Mr. Karamanlis' party dropped support quite substantially from 50 per cent of the vote to something like 40 per cent of the vote and their number of seats fell quite significantly and substantially. From this point of view I am rather glad that the negotiations and discussions have been pressed forward effectively and that we have played some small part in this.  If the matter had been allowed to drag out much longer there could quite possibly have been a change in attitude among the Greek people who have by no means unanimously agreed to accession.</P>
    <P>Agriculture in Greece has been mentioned on a number of occasions but perhaps what has not been emphasised is that it is perhaps much less significant in Greece than is commonly imagined. Probably only about 20 per cent of the people at this stage are engaged in agriculture&mdash;the last official figure was something around 20 per cent.  Further figures estimate it as around 21 per cent, but it is now probably under 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>There has been a very substantial decline in the numbers of people engaged in agriculture in Greece.  There are certain <Col N="444" /> aspects of this which are very unusual. Greece, for example, will account for something like 80 per cent of tobacco exports from the EEC, a thing virtually nominal at present.  Greece has a substantial cotton export trade and there is no cotton production anywhere else in the EEC.  There will be, undoubtedly, Greek competition as regards other Mediterranean products, with Italy and the South of France but none of their agricultural products competes significantly with ours.  Greece is a net importer of the sort of products we can export.  At present that country imports many of these products from outside the EEC and, therefore, there should be a very substantial opportunity for us.  That country's imports of meat are in the region of £100 million per year, a substantial amount.</P>
    <P>There will, presumably, be, just as we have got the mysterious green £, a green drachma initiated.  If I understand this correctly this may present certain problems for Greece, depending on the adjustments Greek agriculture has to make and adjustments in her balance of payments.  However that is primarily a problem for the Greeks rather than for us.</P>
    <P>Industry occupies a very large proportion of the Greek people but it is not industry as we understand it.  It is much more workshop and craft industry with the vast majority of the concerns employing small numbers of people, perhaps four or five people.  Much of it is in such areas as footwear, textiles and food manufacture.  In practice there should be a good opportunity for Irish exporters, with the very effective and modern exports we now can offer, to build up a considerable trade with Greece.  Greece also has certain minerals and a certain degree of oil.  They will be very welcome in an EEC context as well as being of benefit to the Greek economy.</P>
    <P>I gather that one of the main problems will be in relation to the balance of payments in Greece and that there may be difficulties as regards Greece's capital account.  Achilles Mitsos and Efstathios <Col N="445" /> Papageorgiou in the book, <i>Greece and the European Community</i>, edited by Loukas Tsoukalis, stated:</P>
    <P>Greece's external transactions are characterised by sizeable deficits in the current account but without overall balance of payments problems. This peculiar element of Greece's balance of payments is due to the fact that considerable funds are made available for financing the external deficits by Greeks who live and work abroad.  The important characteristic of these funds is that either servicing is done mostly in drachmas or they are for all practical purposes transfers. Moreover, on the basis of the importance of the total foreign exchange inflow that is generated by Greeks abroad, it may be argued that the current account deficit and in particular the trade deficit are in fact jointly determined with the service surplus, particularly when the previously mentioned funds are considered as part of the current account.</P>
    <P>This is a situation somewhat reminiscent of our own situation in the past.  One aspect that comes up which may not necessarily be to our interest is in relation to the contribution to the EEC budget about which there was such a furore at the Dublin Summit.  Curiously enough, Greece's position may well be rather similar to Britain's position because Greece is relatively a high net importer.  It is much higher than the EEC average which is somewhere around 10 or 11 per cent, whereas Greece is about 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Many of the arguments which have just been used, rightly or wrongly, by the United Kingdom Government may well be followed by the Greek Government. Although a very poor country in relation to other European countries, much poorer than Britain, Greece, nonetheless, under the present arrangements for the Community budget, will find itself a relatively high contributor to the EEC budget, strange though this may be.  I cannot help thinking that this is going to be a matter of some controversy in the <Col N="446" /> future, when the euphoria of joining the EEC has died down.</P>
    <P>An aspect which has not been greatly touched upon, but which is an enormously important aspect to Greece, is its relationship <i>vis-á-vis</i> Turkey.  I know the EEC does not have any foreign policy, but, nonetheless, I do not think one can entirely isolate the accession of Greece to the EEC from its situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> Turkey.  This is an extremely delicate situation, one in which we have already been involved and have played some part in Cyprus through our contribution to troops there.  I hope we will be able to play some further part in endeavouring to make sure that relations between Greece and Turkey improve and that we can play some slight part in helping to minimise or resolve the difficulties.  Nonetheless, Greece is in an extremely important strategic situation.  This was shown clearly after the Second World War.  I do not think we can entirely ignore these implications which may give rise to difficulties in the future.  It is a very different situation from that pertaining in relation to the other members of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach ruled out of order a discussion of Portugal and Spain and, I am sure, rightly so, but I am sure he will permit me to say that the applications of Portugal and Spain inevitably had some impact upon the application of Greece, an impact which the Greeks very rightly, and, indeed, bitterly resented. There are implications there and I am sure that the possible accession of those other two countries was taken into account during the negotiations.  Since there has been some mention of dictatorship it is interesting to comment that the end of the dictatorships in Greece, Spain and Portugal was signalled by application to join the EEC. I would like to think that this was a major aspect of the EEC, ensuring the stabilising of democracy.  Since Greece was the cradle of European civilisation I believe it is only right and proper that it should be rejoining Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that in considering the admission of any new <Col N="447" /> entrant to the European Economic Community there should be some examination of the suitability, or otherwise, of that applicant.  It is a pity that it should be like that because I can only imagine that examination that went on in other countries at the time of our application for entry into the European Community. I hope such examinations would not infer that Greece was not a suitable candidate for admission.  The examination must be carried out under certain economic criteria, and if Greece qualified under that well and good, but we must be realistic enough to know that in a wider context, namely the political context, had to be brought into consideration in this instance, particularly in view of Greece's geographic location, what it has gone through and what it could mean to the European Community from the political angle.  I should like to congratulate Greece on what it has survived and managed to pull itself through the past decade.  The fact that it is the father of all democracies is one thing but when democracy to any extent disappears from a country for a small number of years there is never a guarantee that democracy will return in the form in which it was before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democracy is a very brittle matter and the fact that Greece pulled itself back and is again on the democratic path is something on which I should like to congratulate it.  If we were not to extend an unequivocal welcome to Greece we would be acting in a rather selfish or arrogant manner.  How do we know that we were not subject to some scrutiny and examination as to our own suitability at the time of our application? There are advantages to the Community and Ireland by the admission of Greece. It is geographically situated at the periphery of the Community and can help us in our argument for greater assistance from the Regional Fund. However, there is no doubt that there will be some disadvantages.  The net benefit to countries like ours, and other small nations, may be a little less as a result of the admission of a further small nation, but that is the price that will have <Col N="448" /> to be paid.  The Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Government, have got some form of undertaking that the financial implications will not be disturbed as a result of the admission of Greece, but while undertakings are good enough in their own time one never knows what the situation will be in a couple of years' time.</P>
    <P>I, unequivocally, welcome Greece to the Community and I congratulate that country on pulling itself back out of a rather difficult situation in the past decade.  It is appropriate that we should extend Greece a céad míle fáilte.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I agree with many of the points made by Senators.  The only novel point I should like to add relates to the old story of a shop in a street being concerned because another shop is started nearby. Generally, the two shops find that they do better as a result of their nearness to each other.  The notion that the United Kingdom was a poor country was a little bit hard to take.  It may be that they are poor because they did not manage their reserves as they should.  However, the addition of Greece to the Community puts us in a better position to make our case.  We will have a real partner when we are making a case for regional development and a redistribution of funds.  I should like to add my voice to the Senators who mentioned the importance of Greece in the Mediterranean region of Europe.  In the north-western area we are inclined to forget that the problems of the Mediterranean in the future will be very much the problems of Europe.  Greece has a unique contribution to make in providing an understanding of what is going on internationally in that area down as far as the Middle East and the developing problems in the Arab countries.  I welcome the opportunity publicly to endorse Greece joining the Community.</P>

      <P>I welcome the constructive nature of this debate.  It has been most helpful in every regard, and the debate was conducted in <Col N="449" /> a spirit of welcome for a new member of the Common Market.  The criticism was of a constructive nature rather than a destructive nature and the debate has been all the better for that.  I will reply in a general way to the various observations made in the contributions of the Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald, like other Senators, welcomed the accession of Greece to the European Economic Community. He pointed out that the Community needs a great deal of clarification and in that context he felt Greece might help.  He also mentioned the important matter of the effect of Greek entry on agriculture and what will happen in the context of Irish agriculture generally.  He mentioned specifically the guarantee section of the common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>The Commission of the European Community estimated that if Greece was a full member of the Community in 1978, for example, the additional expenditure involved for the Community budget would have been approximately 400 billion European units of account, which would have represented 3.2 per cent of that budget.  The Treaty of Accession for Greece provides <i>inter alia</i> that the provision of the FEOGA guarantee section will generally be applied on a phased basis during the transitional period up to the end of 1985 and that Greece will be entitled to certain refunds on its payment of own resources to the Community during that period. Taking account of the traditional arrangements the Commission has estimated that the net increase in the Community budget arising from Greek membership will be 80 million European units of account in 1981 and 220 million European units of account in 1982. Those figures represent approximately 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively of the total budgets forecast by the Commission for 1981 and 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of Greek Protocol No. 7, the question of economic and industrial development, a suggestion was made by Senator FitzGerald that the Protocol was identical with Ireland's <Col N="450" /> protocol No. 30.  He is, of course, accurate, as usual, in relation to his analysis of the Greek and Irish protocols.  Protocol No. 7 relates to the economic and industrial development of Greece and provides that the Community will do all in its power to assist the efforts of the Greek Government in that regard.  It is similar to our Protocol No. 30 to the Treaty of Accession. Senator FitzGerald asked if the belief of the Greek Government in this protocol was shared by our Government and if their attitude in relation to their protocol was similar to the attitude of our Government to Protocol No. 30.  It is fair to say that the two protocols are not dissimilar and that the two Governments share a similar view in relation to them as they affect each other.</P>
    <P>On the question of the modern Greece being one of the biggest merchant shipping nations in the world, Senator FitzGerald stated that the European Community's merchant shipping fleet will be increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.  He referred to the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation and the two conventions under that organisation.  As the Senator rightly pointed out that organisation looks after maritime safety and sponsors national conventions.  The Senator specifically mentioned two conventions, MARPOLS, the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, which was set up in 1973.  The question of introducing legislation to implement MARPOLS was uppermost in the Senator's mind.  This is, of course, at present under consideration by us.  To date, for the Senator's information, no major maritime country has ratified the convention.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second arm mentioned by the Senator, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS, which was introduced in 1974, the council has recommended that member states ratify it and MARPOLS. However, as the Senator will appreciate, before Ireland ratifies either of the conventions a considerable body of legislation must be drafted.  Without putting a <Col N="451" /> particular date on it, this is being given careful consideration.  How careful the consideration it is being given I cannot be absolutely accurate in relation to that but I know it is under scrutiny at the moment. How active that consideration is, I am not competent at this point to inform the Senator.  If the Senator would like me to correspond with him on this question I can give him an up-to-date account of how far consideration has gone in relation to both conventions.  I will be glad to get that information for him.</P>
    <P>State aids are to be abolished over a three-year transitional period.  Maritime pollution must be of great concern, as the Senator said, not only to EEC countries, but to mankind on a global basis, particularly with the injection of a 20 to 30 per cent increase in the maritime merchant shipping fleet of the community with the accession of Greece. Ireland has taken account of this aspect mentioned by Senator FitzGerald. Ireland is satisfied that Greece shares the concern of all nations that the question of sea pollution should be dealt with satisfactorily.  We have recent evidence of this concern following the collision off the Wicklow coast which involved a Greek tanker.  Preliminary inquiries, as I understand it, were conducted by the Greek Embassy in Dublin on the day after the incident and that shows that the Greek Embassy and the Ambassador were very quick off the mark in relation to their concern for this country's protection of its coast line.  Formal investigations were initiated in Piraeus the week after the collision.  This is indicative of the bona fides of Greece's anxiety to ensure that its extensive maritime fleet does not do damage to a country that does not have a very significant maritime presence on the high seas.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald and a number of Senators also raised the question of Ireland standing by the Council's statement of July 1976.  The Council made that tripartite statement on the question of enlargement and Ireland has insisted that enlargement must not adversely affect the maintenance of the present policies or its future development.  In <Col N="452" /> 1976 before the formal opening of negotiations with Greece we proposed that the Council should make a statement to safeguard our position.  This was accepted by the Council and they declared:</P>
    <P>(1) that the consequences, in particular the financial consequences of an enlargement must not be detrimental to the common projects and policies of the Community or to those which it intends to carry out in the future,</P>
    <P>(2) that enlargement must help strengthen a Community dynamic in its aspirations and not weaken or reduce in effectiveness its institutional structures and possibilities for action, and</P>
    <P>(3) that, with this in view, it was agreed that subject to usual budgetary procedures, on Greek accession appropriate provision would be made for the needs of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>We have to take that statement at face value in the sense that the Council have given a commitment in relation to the enlargement of the Community, with Greek accession in particular&mdash;Spain and Portugal have been mentioned in the future.  We have insisted that note be taken of that Council declaration in 1976.  We are ensuring that the Council, Commission and all institutions in the European Community are constantly made aware of that undertaking.  It was a firm undertaking and we will ensure that it continues to be adhered to.</P>
    <P>The budgetary problems of the Community have undoubtedly emerged since 1976.  A number of solutions have been proposed in relation to these problems. With the accession of Greece and the undoubted accession in due time of Spain and Portugal these considerations will become a problem.  In fact, they will become greater than they are at present. The concern expressed by Britain at the recent Council meeting in Dublin is indicative of the type of problems we are facing at present in the EEC on the budgetary front.  One possibility is that the VAT ceiling of one per cent will be <Col N="453" /> reached next year.  The British demands with regard to her contribution is another serious consideration and there is the emergence of the economic monetary system.</P>
    <P>During our negotiations we received the three assurances I have outlined and we are sticking by them.  Senator FitzGerald in his generous concluding remarks paid tribute to the work of the Greek Ambassador, Mr. Constantine Zepos, and his wife, Greta.  I am sure the House will join with me in that generous and proper tribute to this excellent representative of his country.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha mentioned that Greece was the cradle of democracy.  He also raised problems in relation to the area of financing.  He said that one was forced to question the degree of loyalty to the ideal of the Common Market by Britain.  That is not an unreasonable proposition.  Since Britain's accession and, indeed, before it, General de Gaulle felt that if she did join she would do so for the purposes of wrecking the Common Market.  I do not suggest that that is necessarily our assessment but, nevertheless, she seems to be beating the big drum at the moment.  This was stridently expressed by the Prime Minister during her short stay in this city last week.  The smaller and medium-sized countries in the Common Market should be on their guard against the prospective attack, as I see it, on the European budget and the common agricultural policy in particular.  That one silk thread ran through the contributions of Senators.  It was a positive observation. With the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Common Market in 1981 we will have a definite ally in our efforts to ensure that the common agricultural policy remains as it is and to see that it will remain unassailable by our big brothers or sisters who have other reasons for reducing its effectiveness to small nations like Ireland.  We will have a substantial ally with the accession of Greece in protecting our common interests under the common agricultural policy.  We are determined, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated <Col N="454" /> in introducing this Bill in the Dáil, to ensure that the common agricultural policy is defended against all comers and that its effectiveness to the nations who benefit most under it is not reduced. Senator Murphy said he was not going to be overcome by the prospective accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us will be overcome by the entry of Greece to the EEC, but we might be generous, nevertheless, in our expression of hope for the government and the people of Greece in their desire to join this bastion of democracy. This Community will ensure, in a collective, organised way as best mankind can ensure, peace in Europe for generations to come and Greece has a very important role to play within that context.  We are not overcome by the accession of Greece but we certainly welcome its accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy pointed out that the ministerial speech was rather bland. That is a matter of prejudice and of interpretation. What do you say, when you are welcoming a friend into your house? Do you have a band outside and all the usual paraphernalia and trappings, or are you just courteous to him and go through the normal expressions of goodwill?  I assume that, if you do express yourself in normal language, it is bland but, nevertheless, sincere.  If that is what he means by bland I must reject his suggestion that it is intended as such.  My speech of welcome to the Greek Government and the concern expressed by this and other countries on their accession was a sincere expression of goodwill towards them.  That is as it should be, and that was the general trend of the contributions by the Senators, with the exception of Senator Murphy.  If we were not welcoming the Greek Government and their application was rejected, he would be the first here to ask why.  His contribution was based, not on the fact that they were refused entry, but that they were accepted.  So I am afraid you cannot win with people like Senator Murphy, with great respect to him.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked if the Greek <Col N="455" /> application was considered by the people of Greece by way of referendum, or if they had any direct say in their Government's intention to apply to the EEC. There was not a referendum by the ordinary people of Greece.  The Greek Parliament decided that and ratified their Treaty of Accession by way of their own legislation, as we are doing here.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of Greek agriculture, articulated by Senator Murphy, Senator Alexis FitzGerald and others, Ireland was particularly successful in having the transitional period for beef and dairy produce held to five years, with the elimination, over this period, of incompatible Greek aids to agriculture and the establishment of accession compensatory amounts, which will operate as efficiently for the community as for Greek exporters.  Our interest in the speedy elimination of barriers to the export of Irish agricultural produce to Greece was adequately accommodated.  To answer some of the queries in relation to the type of agriculture that exists in Greece and here, the reality of the situation, as I read it, is that there will be no real conflict between the Greek agricultural industry and ours.  Greek agriculture is mainly considered with Mediterranean type produce such as olive oil, tobacco, citrus fruits, figs, grapes and so on.  However, the accession of Greece may present a problem, in the area of future development of the common agricultural policy, since it is generally recognised that Mediterranean produce received less firm support from the CAP than do temperate products.  At the moment support measures for Mediterranean produce represents approximately 20 per cent of the total CAP guaranteed budget.  With the accession of Greece, and more especially the possible accession of Portugal and Spain, there is likely to be more pressure to increase this percentage. My reply to those Senators who have raised the question on the agricultural front and the similarity between Irish and Greek agricultural produce is that they are quite dissimilar and their problems are distinct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> Senator Yeats, with his own particular knowledge and his experience as a former and respected member of the European Parliament, replied to Senator Murphy.  He made a number of very excellent suggestions which certainly will be taken note of.  The question of the languages of the EEC was raised by him. He says that at the moment, and properly so, there are six simultaneous language translations in relation to any meeting of the Council of Ministers, Parliament, or committee meeting of the EEC.  He said that this is a considerable drain on the personnel of the EEC.  It is a tremendous strain on the personnel within the Community and something will have to be done about it.  He said that, with the accession of Greece in 1981 there will be an additional language.  He also mentioned the prospect of Spain's and Portugal's entry, which would compound the existing serious language problem.</P>
    <P>The problem of language in the Community has been examined by the Committee of Three Wise Men, whose report is now being made available and placed in the Library of the Oireachtas.  The report does not recommend a specific decision in regard to the use of language within the Community, but recognises the difficulties which will arise after enlargement and recommends a policy of, to use their own words, &ldquo;pragmatic flexibility&rdquo;.  With the greatest of respect, that is a piece of mumbo-jumbo and we shall have to get to the basic of the meaning of such a policy.  Senator Yeats is right in saying that there is a problem there.  It appears that the Three Wise Men have put this on the long finger and, on the basis of what the Three Wise Men have said, a solution to the problem may not be found in the very near future.  The European Council asked that the Foreign Ministers should examine the report with a view to preparing discussion at the next European Council on the language question, so it is being given priority.  Certainly if the recommendations of the Three Wise Men are to be taken into account we cannot expect much movement there in the near future.</P>
    <P>The European Regional Development <Col N="457" /> Fund was mentioned and the matter of the social fund was raised by Senator Harte.  The Senator vouchsafed that his party opposed Ireland's entry to the EEC but, the people of Ireland having adjudicated and given their support to our entry, he and his party accepted the inevitability of Ireland's entry.  He accepts the democratic process and his party now support but question the existence of Ireland within the EEC.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte and other Senators raised the question of the amounts received from the European Regional Fund and the European Social Fund. Since the foundation of the European Development Fund, in March 1975, Ireland's receipts have been: 1975, £1.8 million; 1976, £8.5 million; 1977 £8.5 million; 1978, £11.1 million; 1979, 18.1 million, that is to this date.  Receipts for the European Social Fund have been: 1974, £3.6 million; 1975, £4 million; 1976, £4.6 million; 1977, £8.1 million; 1978, £19.3 million; 1979, to this date £25.8 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte and others expressed their concern about the amount of money being received by this country from the European Regional Fund and from the European Social Fund, and I know the Government share the concern expressed by Senators in this regard.  We are not at all happy and we are going to pursue a policy which, because we have always been seen as a good nation in the Community sense, will not rock the Community boat.  It is about time we looked to ourselves in regard to the European Regional Fund and the Eruopean Social Fund.  This country will have to begin to make noises in regard to the relatively small amount we have been receiving from both funds since they were founded in March 1975.  In 1977 we received £8.1 million under the European Social Fund and this figure jumped quite considerably in 1979, to date £25.8 million, nevertheless we are still not happy.</P>
    <P>I am avoiding replying to some of the very good points made by Senator Staunton because I would only be repeating myself.  He said that there was <Col N="458" /> much in common between the Irish people and the people of the Greek Republic, the love of life, the agriculture based economy, a maritime nation.  They are all matters of fact and nobody can disagree with them, and if for no other reason we should be welcoming a nation that is not unlike ourselves in many regards.  For the economic reasons that Senator Staunton properly mentioned, the Government must ensure that this country does not suffer by enlargement. Again I can only refer to the resolution made by the Council in July 1976, and we must take that Council's resolution at its face value, and we must ensure that if there is any attack on Ireland's position we must raise it time after time.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must be vigilant for Ireland's interests, and it is fair to say that successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs have been most vigilant. They can continue to be vigilant in relation to the regional and social funds. These are two of the greatest priorities facing any Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Lambert mentioned, in a very positive contribution, that the EEC is being increased from nine to 12 members nations and said the enlargement would create new problems but also new opportunity. Vigilance, again, was a theme of his contribution.</P>
    <P>I have already adverted to Senator Harte's contribution and I do not think I need to allude to it any further.  He generously welcomed the accession of Greece to the EEC.  Senator Conroy in his usual positive contribution said we would have an added important market for our agricultural produce having regard to the dissimilarity between Irish and Greek agricultural products.  He also mentioned the theme articulated by Senator FitzGerald on the maritime nature of both countries and the addition of a huge merchant shipping fleet to the existing Common Market fleet by the accession of Greece.  As Senator Conroy said, it may encourage us to build up our own navy, which needs building up.  This in no way, of course, underrates the contribution <Col N="459" /> being made by the Irish Naval Service to the nation at present.  Senator Markey, whose contribution was effective by virtue of its brevity, congratulated Greece on entry, on its return to democracy from the rule of the colonels.  He said that Greece's entry to the Common Market would be good if it was to ensure the continuation of democracy in Greece.  I have no doubt that will be the case.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy made the point that competition is the life of trade and that entry of a new country will not adversely affect the position of existing countries in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered the ground as well as possible on all the points of view expressed during the debate.  I am grateful to Senators for the way in which they spoke.  On behalf of the Government I again express our pleasure at Greek entry and thank the Greek Ambassador in Ireland and our Ambassador in Athens for the work they have done on behalf of both countries to protect the interests of both countries, to ensure that the Common Market will be a better place because of the presence of a country like Greece.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney is absent due to the death this morning of his father-in-law.  I dealt with these matters two weeks ago and I am dealing with them now.  As I understand it, it is the intention of the Minister to offer some compromise in relation to Senator Cooney's amendment. <Col N="460" /> If she could enlighten us in that regard.  I should be glad to reply.  In the context of moving Senator Cooney's amendment, I understood that there was a counter-amendment by the Government, which I should like to hear in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no such counter-amendment.  I made a commitment to Senator Cooney last week&mdash;based on the fact that he mentioned the basis for his amendment here today&mdash;to go back to the parliamentary draftsman and to our legal advisers to ensure that Senator Cooney's point about the substitution of &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; for &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; justified him in making the case here last week.  The parliamentary draftsman advises me that the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; ensures greater protection for the trader than the words &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo;. The Minister must have consultations with his advisers to ensure that he is satisfied, whereas if the words &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; were used he need not necessarily be absolutely sure before he makes a decision&mdash;the burden of proof is less.  On that basis I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that Senator Cooney's amendment did not relate to whether or not the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; provided greater or lesser protection for the trader.  What he raised was a constitutional issue.  I shall quote very briefly from his remarks:</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo;, in a similar context in the 1939 Act were held to be unconstitutional in that the Minister in establishing satisfaction was, in effect, exercising a judicial function.  An amending Act was introduced in 1940 changing the words from &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; to &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to state that the Bill was inviting the Minister to be satisfied as to whether or not an offence is being committed. It is a constitutional issue, not an issue as to whether or not the wording <Col N="461" /> satisfies the details of the trading position, and it is in relation to a constitutional issue that the Minister should reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity of replying to the remarks which were made by Senator Cooney here last week. The parliamentary draftsman has advised me that the constitutionality of the 1940 Act did not turn on the substitution of &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; for &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;.  This matter of the constitutionality of the 1940 Act was not referred to in the Supreme Court decision and it did not give the Minister for Justice a judicial function. The parliamentary draftsman is quite happy that the Supreme Court would not have found that &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; is unconstitutional. The Minister could safely be of opinion where he is somewhat less sure of his grounds than being completely satisfied.  The taking of action by the Minister, where he is either satisfied or of opinion, does not entail the administration of justice; it is an administrative decision.  The draftsman explained that the 1939 Act came before the High Court by way of a <i>habeas corpus</i> case taken by an internee.  The court decided that the part of the Act under which the internee was arrested and taken into custody was unconstitutional and the internee was released.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who contravenes subsection <Col N="462" /> (1) or (2) of this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Contravention of subsection (3) is not stated to be an offence.  The Senator said he did not see the need for section 6 (3) as forgery is already a criminal offence under the Forgery Act.  Strictly speaking, Senator Cooney was quite right.  We could do without section 6 (3) but I am advised that it would be preferable to spell out, in the Occasional Trading Bill, that forgery of a permit is an offence. The mere act of forgery, irrespective of the outcome, would attract the penalty prescribed in section 9 (4) of the Occasional Trading Bill.  For a prosecution to be successful under the Forgery Act, it would be necessary to prove that the permit was forged with the intention of deceiving or defrauding and such proofs would seldom be easy.  It is better that we ensure that there is no confusion arising out of this subsection and that we make it an offence, in line with the other two subsections.</P>

      <P>On this amendment, I find myself in disagreement with the Minister, because the Minister has admitted that there is not a necessity for this subsection.

For a prosecution to be successful under the Forgeries Act, it would be necessary to prove that the permit was forged with the intention&mdash;and I am putting the accent on &ldquo;intention&rdquo;&mdash;of deceiving or defrauding.  I am told that it is often very difficult to prove that the intention of deceiving or defrauding is there, and to ensure that this difficulty of prosecution does not arise under this legislation, it is better to make this subsection an offence in its own right, under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Is é cuspóir an Bhille cead a thabhairt don Institiúid Taighde Tionscail agus Caighdeán airgead a fháil ar iasacht chun dhá chríoch ar leith; an chéad chríoch, chun caiteachas reatha a íoc agus, an dara chríoch, chun trealamh capitiúil a cheannach.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to borrow temporarily such sums as they may require for current expenditure and to borrow on the security of their own lands and premises without any guarantee by me, such sums as they may require for the purpose of purchasing capital equipment, where the institute can show that they can fully service the borrowing through the earnings effected with the equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put the Bill in context by saying something about the institute and their operations.  Senators, I am sure, are aware that the overall objective <Col N="464" /> of the institute is to promote the efficient operation of industry and to maintain and stimulate where possible, industrial growth.  Their activities are distinguished from those of other State bodies such as CTT and the IDA, in that they are centred on industrial technology.  The function of the IIRS is to ensure that industry has access to, and uses, the most up-to-date technology available for the creation of wealth, high quality employment and a higher standard of living for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The institute strive to achieve this objective in two ways.  First, the provision of a technical advisory service to ensure the efficient operation of industry.</P>
    <P>These services, for which fees are charged, are provided under the headings of specialist testing and analysis, problem solving for industry, and technical information and advice in general.  Simply solving industry's problems, however, is not enough.  The institute also engage in applied research and development which can lead to the development of new industrial units and the creation of new jobs by providing the necessary technological support for firms committed to grow and by providing viable investment opportunities for such firms.  This research and development service now represents about 20 per cent of the institute's activities and the institute are hopeful of increasing this figure.</P>
    <P>In addition the institute also act as technical adviser to the Government.  Indeed, as Senators know, only recently the institute were given the lead role in the Government's energy saving campaign.</P>
    <P>The institute receive the bulk of their funding from State sources.  The total Exchequer grant-in-aid in 1979 amounts to over £5.1 million of which £1.4 million is for building and construction at the institute's headquarters at Ballymun Road, Glasnevin.  On top of the £5.1 million, the institute expect to increase their earned income this year to over £2 million.  Indeed, over the past ten years the institute's income from clients <Col N="465" /> has increased dramatically from £83,000 in 1968 to its present level.  In 1968 income as a percentage of the current expenditure of the institute came to only 15 per cent.  It now represents over 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>This increase in earned income has brought its attendant problems.  Experience has shown that because of the delay in clients settling their accounts there is a substantial amount owing to the IIRS at the end of each accounting year, to be received in the early months of the following year.  The outstanding amount has had to be financed by bank overdrafts to meet the cash flow problem at the end of each accounting year.  The Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961 makes no specific provision for borrowing powers by the institute.  Section 2, subsection (1) of this Bill proposes to permit the institute, with my consent and the concurrence of the Minister for Finance to borrow temporarily by arrangements with bankers such sums as they may require for the purpose of providing for current expenditures.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice since 1975 that the overdrafts are cleared very quickly in the new accounting year.  This will continue to be the practice and Senators can be assured that these overdrafts will be purely year-end phenomena.  The Bill currently before the House also proposes to extend the borrowing powers of the institute in section 2, subsection (2) to cover the acquisition of capital equipment which can pay for itself on a self-financing basis from fee income earned by the institute. With the increasing technological content of our exports in recent years, and the demand for certification of exports as meeting certain standards, it is becoming increasingly more obvious that there are certain areas of product-testing where the income generated from these tests would be capable of paying for the investment necessary to meet the demand.  This Bill proposes, therefore, that in such cases the institute be allowed to borrow on the security of their own assets&mdash;their lands and buildings <Col N="466" /> without State guarantee for the repayment of the sums borrowed.  These borrowing powers will only be exercised with my consent and with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Senators that it is not the intent of this Bill to place the institute at any disadvantage in borrowing compared with other State bodies. Quite the opposite, the aim of the Bill is to give the institute a flexibility in borrowing which they have not got at present.  The reference in the Bill to &ldquo;without State guarantee for the repayment of sums borrowed&rdquo; is to make it clear that the institute's borrowings for capital equipment are to be on a self-financing basis and that the institute will have to satisfy themselves before considering such borrowing that they have the capacity to repay them from own resources and to ensure that the institute will be borrowing for clearly worthwhile capital investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support this Bill.  I do so first of all because the institute have done excellent work in this age of technology, the importance of industry to this country and because of the type of growth we have to have in that sector there must be adequate funding of the IIRS in the work they are doing in the technological section so vital to our economy.  Having said that, one could be a little bit critical.  I want to re-echo somewhat Deputy John Kelly's remarks in the Dáil when this issue was discussed there because, in a sense, this is penny-pinching. Normal funding would be a grant-in-aid to the institute from Government but, in this instance, instead of giving them the money which they effectively need to do their work, we are, if you like, giving them the authority to borrow, which is a somewhat different way of doing things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this borrowing there is one specific problem they may encounter as a semi-State institute in that they are dealing with private industry in the commercial market place when people are trading <Col N="467" /> and when people are buying or selling. Normally people pay reasonably promptly for goods or services supplied. It is possible that, in the case of the IIRS&mdash;because of the fact that they are a semi-State body with a supposedly bottomless pit of funds&mdash;some of their customers are not paying as promptly as they might do for their technology and advice.  This was referred to in the Dáil. Certainly it would be proper for the financial controllers in the institute to look into their accounting methods, to see whether or not they are being paid as quickly as they should be by their customers.  In this age of high interest rates&mdash;where the prevailing rate is anything between 15 and 22 per cent for different purposes&mdash;money is a very expensive commodity, but it is no more than a commodity.  They should look into the possibility of adopting some type of system in so far as customers are concerned whom they might not sue as easily as people in private enterprise for overdue accounts.  Something like additional invoices to charge up the prevailing rate of interest might help them in this regard.  In so far as the cost of the money which they are going to borrow as a result of this addition to the Bill is concerned, they might get recompense to an extent by doing it in this manner.</P>
    <P>Having paid compliments to the IIRS for the work they have been doing and for the services they have given to Irish industry, I should say that they have problems in the sense that such a huge proportion of industry here is of foreign origin, coming from America, Japan, West Germany, France and other countries which are technically more developed than ours.  To a large extent the multi-national industrial companies coming in here rely on their own technology, or the technology of their home countries rather than on liaison with the IIRS.  The IIRS have funding problems in this regard.  Possibly they are not getting the support proportionately of what industry exists here as they might, for example, in a country in which industry has been indigenous and <Col N="468" /> in which there is an industrial inheritance which we have not got.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid in 1979 is over £5.1 million and the earned income is estimated to be over £2 million.  There is a very healthy trend there for a semi-State body in the sense that they are earning an income for services provided.  Back in 1968 earned income amounted to only £83,000.  There is a parallel here with the extent of industrial development in this country since 1968, when they had then £83,000 in earned income.  It is not merely a matter of inflation catering for the difference because, at that stage, it amounted to 15 per cent of their income, whereas today it represents 33 per cent, which is very healthy and on which I would like to compliment them.  Independent of this House, in another capacity, I have had reason to be in touch with them and I have been very satisfied with the work they have been doing.  But, having said that, to be objective one would need to refer to a very disturbing report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today on the financial page under the headline &ldquo;US professor says the IIRS is not aiding Irish industry&rdquo;. I will briefly quote from this, to put it into perspective.  The Minister should be aware of the criticism, and if there are concrete reasons to rebut the criticism I think they should come in on the floor of this House.  I would not normally pay too much attention to what professors of any discipline outside this country might say about this country, but the professor in question has a fairly eminent background, in that he works in the Sloan school of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, otherwise known as MIT.  It is probably singly the most advanced institute of technology in the world.</P>
    <P>If you have somebody of that eminence, with that kind of background in that school of learning, expressing criticism, it is criticism which we have to take fairly seriously.  Very briefly, he states that the IIRS has largely failed in its function to transfer technology to Irish industry.  Indeed the IIRS appears in very poor light in his research, has failed in their role of transferring <Col N="469" /> technology to industry.  He states: &ldquo;We have been unable to find a single instance of technology transfer.&rdquo;  He makes the radical assertion that the IIRS strategy, which on the surface appears eminently reasonable, has not worked. He suggests the possibility, which was suggested to him by the general manager of a major Irish company, that IIRS have associated themselves too closely with British technology and that British technology is always either too backward or too sophisticated for Irish purposes.  He adds that an explanation may be that the IIRS staff associate too much with contacts in the UK.  All of their contacts are in Europe with little in the United States but that British technology is inappropriate to Irish needs.</P>
    <P>There is in this article a rebuttal of his remarks by a spokesman for the IIRS who refuted Professor Allen's work as &ldquo;biased, misinformed, disturbed, and unfinished&rdquo;, claiming that the work, which commenced in 1971, was to include 300 companies, but when it was finally updated in 1977 it included only 75.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I find myself a little on the professor's side.  If one is talking about detailed criticism from a source as prominent as I have quoted I do not know that it is altogether balanced or objective to dismiss it by the type of sweeping remarks which we read here: &ldquo;biased, misinformed, disturbed, and unfinished&rdquo;. Whilst the work was based not on 300 companies but on 75 companies, 75 out of 300 is a reasonable sample. There is disturbing news in this.  The Minister should be aware of it.  I should like him to comment at this stage or later.</P>
    <P>Having said that, my experience with the institute has been good.  They have been doing excellent work.  Today particularly they have singly an extremely important function in one specific area of industry.  This relates to energy where we have been less diligent as a country in taking steps to reduce our dependence on fuel oil.  We have been negligent.  I know the Government have been talking to people and trying to get people interested <Col N="470" /> in it.  The public and industry in this country are very much less than receptive and are not sufficiently conscious of the real crisis there is in energy matters.  Energy is the foundation of everything that industry stands for. There is an absolute crisis in energy at present.  It is undiminished and is rapidly growing faster with the antics of the Ayatollah and for other reasons in the Middle East.  We are not sufficiently conscious of it.  We are not doing enough.  In this regard the IIRS have been doing very good work in attempting to articulate our energy needs through public relations, in attempting to advise interests in this country, both public and private of what can be done.</P>
    <P>Going very far wide of the mark of this Bill I might point out that there is a vast acreage of bog in this country. There are anthracite and coal resources; there are areas in which we could undertake research and development which would be in the interests of the country.  I would like to compliment the IIRS on their work in that regard.  However, I should like to balance that by saying that I am very disturbed by the report which I have read today which I accept as being authentic and on which I would ask the Minister to comment whenever it is convenient for her to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two comments about this Bill.  We all welcome it.  It is good to see the IIRS being enabled to expand their work.  I wonder if the capacity is not there for the institute to pay for new equipment out of their own resources, what then happens? Have they any option other than increasing their fees, or can they go to the Minister seeking a grant-in-aid?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience in regard to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is that they encounter considerable delay in being able to deal with complaints, particularly complaints under the Planning Acts whether they be in regard to effluent, noise, vibration or whatever.  I have often wondered whether they have not alone adequate equipment but sufficient manpower with <Col N="471" /> which to carry out the necessary tests in those cases.  I had an experience once with them when they had to place in queue about a dozen applications for tests to be carried out under the Planning Act, 1963, when each complainant had to await his turn because there were available only two pieces of the type of equipment necessary to carry out the tests in the whole country.  Of course complaints under the Planning Acts are becoming more frequent.  Therefore, I can well see the need for the Institute to have more up-to-date equipment than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The institute may well have to spend too much of their time and resources checking and testing existing products, and may not have the resources with which to undertake real pioneering work&mdash;as Senator Staunton said&mdash;on the energy problem.  On television recently we saw that in Sweden a body equivalent to our Institute for Industrial Research and Standards had carried out tremendous research work into possible new energy resources, when it was thought that from their woodlands they could well have adequate energy resources within the next two decades.  A body such as the IIRS should be entrusted by the Government to carry out pioneering work and very intensive research into matters such as the energy problem.</P>
    <P>I believe there may be a problem on the administrative side of the IIRS in regard to collecting outstanding accounts. This is a problem all bodies have to face up to.  The institute might well investigate bringing about an improvement of their mechanism in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who spoke and to thank them for their complimentary remarks about the IIRS.  Each of us is aware in our own way of the tremendous response the IIRS have given to industry, the tremendous and valuable service they provide for industry, in particular&mdash;as <Col N="472" /> Senator Staunton pointed out&mdash;to all the industry that we are getting from highly technological advanced countries.  Of course, the IIRS are expected to be able to supply the type of service to which these people are accustomed.</P>
      <P>I might refer to the last point made by Senator Markey.  He talked about the institute perhaps not having the necessary manpower, about complaints that have been coming in about unnecessary delays that have occurred because of a rush on one service at a time.  We will always have that type of situation arising because we can never budget in advance to decide what type of use will be made of a particular service.  Then there are particular times of the year, particular times in the history of a country, or the history of a particular industry, when the services of the IIRS may be required at more frequent intervals.  However, there is a consultancy study to be done of the IIRS.  I should say immediately that that study would not be based on investigating what the IIRS are up to, in case they are up to any monkey business that we sort it out.  Of course, the consultancy study is to ensure that the IIRS are geared to their role as an adviser, in their role as the institute which renders this service to Irish industry, ensuring they are able to carry out that type of service, and that they give the best service possible.  The decision to have the consultancy study carried out was taken against the background of projections by the institute which gives this service to Irish industry to ensure that it is able to carry out that type of service and that it gives the best service that is possible.</P>
      <P>The decision to have this consultancy study carried out was taken against the background of projections by the institute of an increase in staff numbers within the next ten years and a proposed major building programme to accommodate this extended function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparations for the consultancy study are well under way.  Representations have been received from three international groups with wide experience in science and technology, and in particular <Col N="473" /> of the establishment operation and that type of research institute in developing countries.</P>
    <P>As a result of this study, when the results of it are made known and the report is made to the Minister, it will be easier to make a correct decision to enable the institute to operate more efficiently, if that is necessary, and to aid it financially or otherwise in fulfilling its functions.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton referred to criticism of certain aspects of the institute's work by various people.  Indeed, in the Dáil debate Deputies on the Opposition benches made certain comments.  It is only natural, and indeed right, that there should always be ideas as to what the institute should do, what role it should fulfil and how best it should activate itself to meet the scientific and technical needs of Irish manufacturing industry. To the extent that all such inquiry of mind and comment are constructive, progressive and always aimed at achieving better results, then it is good and is welcomed.</P>
    <P>I hold in high regard the motivation of the institute to serve Irish industry well.  I hold in very high regard its efficiency and the level of expertise of its highly qualified administrative and technical staffs.  It is evident that, as industrialisation progresses and changing needs emerge, new services will be demanded from the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards.  New emphasis will be called for on the direction of its activity, and even criticism that it does not do enough in one way or that it is not going into the right areas.  I reject this when it means that the institute is in any way unmindful of its obligations or lacks enterprise in pursuing them to the maximum degree that its resources allow it to go.  I am always on the other hand, prepared to search, as I know the institute itself is, for changes which will optimise for Irish industry the activities which the institute is designed to carry on.</P>
    <P>I feel that the consultancy study which I mentioned has that particular aim.  As a result of the report which will be made by that consultancy study to <Col N="474" /> the Minister, it will become obvious whether the institute could be helped in some way to give a better service to industry. This is on the basis that we are not being critical of the institute itself but that we are ensuring, as Senator Staunton pointed out, that the type of industry we are now attracting to the country is very highly sophisticated technological industry and we must ensure that the type of service this type of industry requires will be provided here in Ireland by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The result of that consultancy study will ensure that any criticisms which have been made of the institute and of all such bodies, will be cleared up and that any help the Government can give to ensure that the service the institute give is the best and the quickest possible, will be forthcoming.</P>

Na focail &ldquo;without State guarantees for the repayment of sums borrowed&rdquo;, sin rud a raibh roinnt mhaith díospóireachta faoi sa Dáil, agus níl aon rud ann i ndáiríre.  An fáth is mó a bhí leis an mBille seo ar dtús ná go dtabharfaí cead don IIRS airgead a fháil ar iasacht ó bhainc leis an treallamh atá ag teastáil uathu le deileáil go ginearálta i dtionsclaíocht a cheannach. Ní raibh ar a gcumas go dtí seo airgead a fháil ar iasacht.  Bhí an cumas sin ag CTT agus ag an IDA agus ag eagraíochtaí eile Stáit nach iad, agus le déanaí anuas bhí sé tagtha go dtí an pointe gur ghá don IIRS iasachtaí airgid nó overdrafts a bheith acu ag deireadh na bliana mar gheall ar nach raibh a gcuid custaiméirí ag íoc chomh luath agus ba cheart dóibh.  Shocraímar mar sin, i gcomhairle leis an IIRS, go gcaithfí an seans a thabhairt dóibh iasacht a fháil ó bhainc chun cuidiú leo treallamh den sórt seo a cheannach.  I gcás treallaimh go hiondúil, an saghas a bheadh i gceist acu á cheannach agus nach raibh ar a gcumas fhéin íoc as, seo an t-aon bhealach amháin a bhféadfaidís airgead a fháil ar iasacht ó bhainc, mar bheadh ar an treallamh fhéin ais-íoc a dhéanamh, más é sin an chaoi cheart chun é sin a rá.</P>
      <P>Nuair a deirimid &ldquo;without State guarantee&rdquo; níl sé i gceist go níodh an tAire ná an tAire Airgeadais nó an tAire Tionscail, Tráchtála agus Fuinnimh a gcuid lámh den airgead a d'fhéadfaidís a fháil ar iasacht.  Is féidir, ag aon am, leis an Aire Airgeadais nó an Aire Tionscail, Tráchtála agus Fuinnimh an guarantee sin a thabhairt, ach seans a thabhairt don Institute a bheith neamhspleách ar guarantee a fháil ón Aire.

      <P>All right.  Paragraph 8.5 of the Road Development Plan for the 1980s under the heading of &ldquo;tolls&rdquo; states:</P>
      <P>The accepted principle of toll roads and bridges is that the facility to be provided offers an alternative route to road users who may choose to pay for the convenience of using the toll facility.</P>
      <P>It also states that road users have, in parallel, a choice of alternative routes.  I do not believe this principle has been included in this Bill in any respect.  As the Bill stands it is open to the Department and a local authority to approve a toll on an existing road.  People may have no option but to pay the toll.  In accordance with the principles in the Road Development Plan for the eighties there will not be an alternative route for road users.  I ask the Minister to abide by the principle so positively laid down in the booklet, which was adopted by the Government but is not included in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment.  It is quite conceivable that a toll facility would incorporate some part of an existing road.  For example, in the case of a bridge it might be necessary to have the toll booths on the approach roads in order to ensure smooth traffic flow on the bridge itself. These approach roads could in some cases comprise part of the existing road network.  At present major road improvement scheme realinement works often incorporate sections of existing roads.  This principle could also apply in the case of a toll project.  The Bill as drafted caters for such a situation.  I have made it clear that I do not anticipate indiscriminate or widespread imposition of tolls on existing roads because of the rigorous process being laid down in the Bill for bringing toll schemes into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rigorous process to which I refer involves prior approval of the elected <Col N="478" /> members of road authorities and of the Minister after ventilation of the pros and cons of any particular scheme or schemes at public inquiries.  I am satisfied that there is already sufficient safeguard against any unacceptable or unwarranted imposition of tolls and projects which would propose to include sections of existing roadways.  One thing that should not be forgotten in relation to this Bill is that the final say rests with the elected representatives of local authorities and thereafter the approval of the Minister.  It is elected representatives who decide on the toll schemes.  I do not see why any local authority or members of local authorities should have anything to fear with regard to this section and indeed this Bill because the elected representatives are the people who decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that people who have already made their contribution in their taxes for roads and bridges will feel much aggrieved now when they have to pay when they are crossing them.  On top of that it is easy enough to say at this stage that it is left to the local authorities and to the local representatives.  These people are under terrible pressure for money at the moment.  I am sure the Minister realises that, without getting into the percentages given to them last year and the amount of money they require with the rates limit, they will also be under pressure from the people who are sponsoring the schemes for tolls.  Their main interest will be a return for their capital investment.  If the local authorities find themselves under pressure they will hit at somebody else.  I do not think that it is reasonable to expect the local authorities to accept it in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I read out what the Minister in his own booklet accepted as the general principle of toll roads and bridges, namely that there should be an alternative route, that there should be a choice to road users, that there should be an option to road users.  Is the Minister now saying that he is departing from <Col N="479" /> that acceptance principle which he enunciated only six months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not departing from it.  For example, in the case of a new toll bridge it is conceivable that some portion of an existing road would have to be utilised as an approach to a toll bridge. Take the example of the one that is under discussion with the road authority here in Dublin, across the Liffey.  As the Senator can understand some of the existing roads will lead on to any new toll bridge.  This does not mean, in effect, that road users, if they wish, are in any way prevented from using O'Connell Bridge or another or another adjacent bridge.  Existing roads and bridges are already there and can still be utilised.  There is no serious infringement of people's rights involved in this.  It is just conceivable that some portion of an existing road would have to be utilised as an approach to a new toll bridge.  It is not an infringement. There is already an existing route in all cases.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister clarify one aspect of this legislation for me?  It seems to me from what the Minister has just stated that the intention is that tolls may apply to a very limited portion of an existing road approaching a new toll bridge.  In reading the Bill I have the distinct impression that the legislation enables tolls to be applied, as necessary to all existing roads.  Even though the Minister says the intention is only to provide for tolls on short portions of existing roads approaching a new toll bridge, could that not have been provided without giving the sweeping powers that are in the legislation to apply tolls?  The authority and the power is there to apply tolls to all existing roads. Could the Minister tell me why that is necessary?</P>

      <P>It is necessary for the reasons I have already stated, such as, if there are toll routes at the approach to a bridge on part of an existing road.  There will have to be approaches whether we like it or not.  The power is there to have <Col N="480" /> them, but it is entirely up to the elected members of local authorities to decide in favour of a toll scheme, the type of toll scheme, whether they should be at X or Y, the approaches and so on.  It is entirely a matter for the elected representatives. Nothing could be more democratic or fairer than that.  The power is in the Act for them to act in whatever way they wish.</P>

      <P>If a toll bridge was erected beside the house of a person who was a resident of that house for many years and the particular road right beside the bridge became a toll road, what way would that person be affected?  Would that person be obliged to pay a toll every time he comes out on that road?  I do not like leaving the option to any section of the community, whether it is a local authority or the Minister, to decide, either with approval or without approval, to put a tax on that person going out on the road.

If the only reason they would build a toll road as an alternative to that is because of the volume of traffic, such a by-pass or a new bridge would have to be made attractive to the people who invest money in it also.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (3), page 3, lines 41 and 42, to delete &ldquo;give special consideration <Col N="484" /> to the question of exempting&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;exempt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple amendment.  It is a matter of changing a word from &ldquo;exempting&rdquo; to &ldquo;exempt&rdquo;.  There are a number of people who should be exempt from paying tolls&mdash;pedestrians, people on pedal cycles.  It is in everybody's interest to keep as many people as possible on pedal cycles if we listen to the Minister for Health and if we listen to other Departments about the use of petrol and the saving it would be on our energy.  As well as that we have invalid people who use carriages and some type of motor they have adapted.  Some disabled people have vehicles which are operated by hand.  All those people should be exempt from tolls.  We had the situation up to 1977 that they were exempt from paying motor tax.  They should have this advantage above other sections of the community.  I am sure the Minister will give me the same answer he gave on the first amendment, that it is a matter entirely for the local authorities and for the elected representatives.  We should put something in the Bill to prevent the local authorities or anybody else making a charge on this particular section of the community.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are under great pressure for money at the moment. Maybe every company and private individual is under pressure for money, but certainly local authorities are under much more pressure than many others.  I would ask the Minister, if at all possible, to provide for those people in this Bill.  In England, these unfortunate people have to pay £1 every time they cross a toll bridge.  There is a danger that this might happen here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to repeat that it is the elected members of local authorities who will have the say in this.  This particular subsection was inserted by me on Report Stage in the Dáil.  It specifically requires road authorities to give special consideration to the question of exempting from tolls pedestrians, pedal cycles, invalid carriages and vehicles specially adapted for use by physically <Col N="485" /> handicapped persons.  I am quite satisfied that any Member of this House who is familiar with the local authority system will also be quite satisfied that the members of these authorities will give special consideration to the granting of exemptions to these categories of road users.  I fail to see how necessary making it mandatory is.  After all we are leaving the power to the elected members of the local authorities.  I would remind the House that in the last 12 months, under the Rates Bill, I was continuously accused of taking powers away from local authorities and eroding their autonomy. This was inserted by me in order to give local authorities the power to make the exemptions that they thought should be made.  I have sufficient confidence in local authorities that they will do it properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that there are up to 40 local authorities, maybe 39 will exempt those people, but there may be one local authority that will not exempt them.  You then have a curious situation, where you have an exemption in one <Col N="486" /> part of the country and none in another. Therefore, it should be mandatory on all local authorities to exempt them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went a good part of the way in meeting it when he made the suggestion to the local authorities, but he should go the whole way now and accept the amendment.  If it should happen that in one local authority they are exempt and in another they are charged we would have a bad situation.  I feel the Minister should have another look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Senator says happened that 39 authorities did what we expect them to do and the other did not I would still have to approve this.  I could have it amended in order to include such exemptions as people feel strongly about.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), paragraph (d), page 3, line 55, after &ldquo;users&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall also include a projected profit and loss account anticipated for each year of the operation of the said scheme&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to have each toll road scheme accompanied by an estimate of the amount of money likely to be collected.  I have no doubt that a private individual will not build a toll road or bridge without making some calculation of income, and that calculation or estimate should be submitted to the local authority concerned.  It is also necessary for us to know the amount that is likely to be collected.  Will the same amount be demanded for a motor car using a toll road or bridge as for a lorry or tractor for agricultural purposes? Some type of estimate should be submitted to the local authority.  I do not think this will work otherwise.  It is essential also that a profit and loss account be produced.  That is a handy, fair and sensible approach.  Could those tolls be subsidised from the Central Fund or from any other source such as the EEC?  One never knows the switches that may come and that is why it is essential that an estimate is produced when the scheme is prepared.  It is vital information for local authorities.  What is the attitude of the Minister to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment but I appreciate the objective which the Senator has in mind in putting it down.  The provisions of section 3 have been drafted on the basis that the maximum information which a road authority could reasonably be expected to provide for the public will be made available through the explanatory statement which must accompany any toll scheme being put forward for consideration. The detail which must be included in the explanatory statement is set out in section 3 (6) and includes estimates of capital and operating costs of the volumes and types of traffic likely to use the facility, and of the likely levels of toll <Col N="488" /> charges.  The Senator, I feel, will accept that it would be unreasonable to require a projected profit and loss account on an annual basis of a scheme that would be of so many years' duration.  I have no doubt that the public will insist on getting the maximum possible information on operating costs of any proposed toll facility at the public inquiry.  In any event, the Minister will insist on getting similar information prior to approving such a scheme.  I am sure the Senator will appreciate that a profit and loss account of so many years' projections would be unreasonable.  All the necessary available information will be available at the inquiry and when the scheme is submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it would be unreasonable to insist on or seek a profit and loss account on a scheme of so many years' duration.  The &ldquo;so many years' duration&rdquo; aspect is something that concerns me.  I take the view that we may well see quite a section of the most important part of our communication, roads or bridges, coming under the control for their development, maintenance or improvement, of private enterprise, with a toll charge on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If private enterprise are to be enticed into doing this job they will become interested only if the margin is good enough and the return on the investment is good enough.  Let us assume that the construction of a bridge arouses the interest of private enterprise and a scheme, which includes a costing on the job, is agreed upon and a toll charge is set.  If the capital cost of providing that bridge, and the interest on it with a reasonable margin of profit is obtained from the toll charges of over a period of five or ten years, what provision is there in the legislation to say that at the end of that period a local authority has the power to say to private enterprise: &ldquo;It has been a profitable operation for you and now we feel the scheme should be discontinued&rdquo;? Are we going to have a situation that private enterprise, attracted by the margin that can be obtained from this development, will regard it as an asset or a facility to continue producing good <Col N="489" /> returns over an unlimited number of years?  Will the Minister comment on my fears on that likely development?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 3, between lines 55 and 56 to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) state the duration of the scheme,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In reply to amendment No. 4, the Minister clearly stated that at the inquiries the charges for the various types of vehicles using toll roads or bridges would be discussed to see what could be hammered out.  However, there is also the question of the period for the duration of the scheme.  Do I take it that that will also be discussed?  When a scheme is submitted to a local authority for a certain period it is necessary to state the duration of the scheme.  Will the Minister accept my amendment which seeks to have the duration of the scheme specified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  There is ample power under the Bill for any road authority to fix the duration of a toll scheme.  Subsection (4) (e) requires a road authority to specify such other information as the road authority may consider appropriate or the Minister may direct.  This will enable duration clauses to be adopted where either the road authority or the Minister consider such to be either necessary or desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (5) (b) enables a road authority to amend or revoke a toll scheme.  This could be used to insert duration clauses where none may be included in an original scheme but where the road authority subsequently consider a fixed duration to be either necessary or desirable.  Section 9 (2) (b) provides that an agreement between a road authority <Col N="490" /> and a private entrepreneur may provide for its duration and determination while it can be said that these provisions are not as rigid as the proposed amendment, I would argue for the greater flexibility which the Bill in its present form provides because of the many uncertainties which could affect projects, for example, fluctuation of interest rates, the energy situation, variations in the volume of traffic and so on.</P>
    <P>A rigid provision on the lines proposed could cause unnecessary problems.  As was stated by the Minister of State in the course of his reply to the Second Stage debate many of the provisions of the Bill have been framed on a flexible basis because the Bill is breaking new ground in this area.  I am satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that the interests of the general public are reasonably safeguarded. There is also the possibility that a rigid insistence on the duration of a toll scheme being specified in all cases could operate against the consideration of cross-subsidisation of toll schemes.  This is an aspect of the financing of such schemes which was put forward in the Dáil by the Opposition.  It could interfere with the successful utilising of that asset. I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What crosses my mind very forcibly about this is that the local authorities, with the demand on them for money at present&mdash;and they have no means of getting it&mdash;could overcharge for the use of the toll road or encourage the overcharging in order to get a higher income from the contractor.  I accept that schemes must be sanctioned by the Department of the Environment, and that is all right for us but we must think of the people who will follow us.  There must be some sort of protection built into this section.</P>

      <P>This is a simple amendment.  This section is rather vague and it is necessary to have specifications, construction methods and maintenance standards included. When a toll road is complete the contractor, naturally, will be out to get as much money as possible and for that reason it is essential that there be some set of standards.  The Department of the Environment and local authorities have all experienced inferior type of houses being built.  We are all aware of complaints about housing.  I want to ensure that a contractor does the job to specifications and gives some guarantee in the agreement with regard to maintenance.</P>

      <P>With regard to the initial approval of a toll scheme, the preliminary plans are all that are required because one could not expect the entrepreneur at that stage to have detailed plans.  They would be required later by the local authority, and subsection 6 (a) requires the giving of information in relation to the general arrangements for the construction, maintenance, improvement, management and operation of a project.  With regard to the matters of construction and maintenance, since every toll road or bridge will be a public road then, by definition, the relevant road authority will, ultimately, be legally responsible for its satisfactory construction and subsequent maintenance.</P>

      <P>Do I understand the Minister to say that it will be the responsibility of the local authority to see that this standard is sufficiently high with <Col N="492" /> regard to the construction?  Will the local authority also be responsible with regard to maintenance?  I can recall where local authorities have fallen down on the building of bridges, the reason for which I do not know.  There have been some damn bad jobs done in house building and the construction of bridges.  I do not want to see a recurrence of this on toll roads or toll bridges.</P>

      <P>This amendment is quite clear.  It is much easier, much quicker and much better to have land purchased by agreement, and certainly much faster.  I fully realise that it is hard to embody that in the Bill, but some encouragement should be given somewhere to get agreements, other than compulsory acquisition, or whatever the alternative will be.

      <P>Since a toll road will become a public road it will have to be subject to the same laws as any public road.  I agree with the Senator that negotiation is always a quicker way to get a road or a bridge built but there are people with whom one cannot negotiate so you must resort to the CPO.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the First Annual Report of the Employment Equality Agency and in view of the specific reference in the Report to the fact that &ldquo;the Agency felt constrained in its activities in the period under review by the limitations imposed upon it by the insufficient Exchequer Grant under which it operated&rdquo; calls upon the Government as a matter of urgency to provide adequate funding to enable the Employment Equality Agency to carry out its important functions which are essential to the achievement in practice of the principle of equality enshrined in the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to propose this motion, which concerns the first report of the Employment Equality Agency.  The span of the report is the first 15 months of the agency, from October 1977 to December 1978.  The motion refers to an extract <Col N="498" /> from that report and I should like to quote the full paragraph, because it refers to the fact that the agency feels that it has been inadequately funded to discharge its statutory responsibilities and its functions.  The full extract which is at page 7, paragraph 5, is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Agency felt constrained in its activities in the period under review by the limitations imposed upon it by the insufficient Exchequer Grant under which it operated.  The main effects of the budgetary constraints were that</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Agency was unable to acquire premises separate from the Department of Labour which might have helped to foster its independent identity</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Agency could not commission research, as envisaged under the Act, and which it felt was essential to the identification of patterns of discrimination in employment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;two of its staff posts were left unfilled in order to conserve resources.</P>
    <P>I begin by concentrating on this issue of funding; with the Minister present in the House and with the timing of the preparations for the February budget, this is where the primary emphasis must be.  I address myself to the Minister because he is kindly here, but we are referring to a collective responsibility.  The funding of the agency is the collective responsibility of the Government and it is in that sense, certainly, that I approach the question.  It is clear from the report of the agency that, in its first 15 months, it received a grant from the Department of Labour of £96,263 and for its second period, which is this year of 1979, it received a grant of £95,000.  It is also clear that a very substantial portion of that grant was taken up by fixed costs, by the cost of administration and the rent paid to the Department of Labour; in other words, by the fixed elements of its overall budget.  If that were true of its first 15 months, it must be even more true of the grant for 1979; in real terms, more of its budget must be used up by salaries and the amount in rent to the Department.</P>
    <P>In the first report, the amount which was left over for all the activities of the <Col N="499" /> EEA was less than £30,000 and probably a lesser percentage was left over for these activities during 1979.  I welcome any comment the Minister might make on that.  It is a fair judgment on the matter.  If that is the case, then what we need&mdash;and we need it at this point&mdash;is a new appraisal of the role of the Employment Equality Agency and a different order of funding which reflects this appraisal.  It is important that, in 1980, the approach to funding the agency is not one which barely keeps pace with inflation and with salary increases, but which marks a completely different assessment of the role and work of the agency.  I would submit to the Minister&mdash;and hope he will comment on this&mdash;that to treble the funding of the agency would not be over-generous.  To give them a basic budget for 1980 of the order of £285,000, which would be trebling the £95,000 for 1979 would not be out of line with the role and function which the Agency are required, under the legislation, to carry out but their first report says clearly that they are not in a position to do.  This has left them short of staff, not able to carry out research and not able to acquire the separate premises which would give them an independent identity.</P>
    <P>It is desirable, and would have an educational effect, if the agency were to be in separate premises.  Even if that had to await a certain amount of time, involving as it must capital expenditure, they must have adequate staff and research capacity; these things have a bearing on the budget for 1980.</P>
    <P>Despite the handicap of being underfinanced and understaffed, I pay tribute to the members and to the work carried out by the Employment Equality Agency.  I pay tribute to the chairman, Sylvia Meehan, the members of the agency and the staff.  It is customary, when dealing with a report of this sort, to pay tribute and to say a few polite words.  In this case, the tribute is very well warranted.  The report is evidence of very hard, thorough work being done and of a genuine concern by the agency to fulfil their function.  This is clear from <Col N="500" /> the introduction to the report, where it is well summarised.</P>
    <P>I might refer, first, to the nature of the problems which the agency face.  This is set out in very clear summary form at page 5 of the report, summarising the overall situation in relation to women workers in the State.  The agency point out that approximately 28 to 30 per cent of the labour force are women and that almost two-thirds of these women are under 30 years of age.  They then show the various kinds of discriminations, or limitations on their access to equal pay or to employment opportunities.  It points out that, whereas girls outnumber boys in academic successes at Leaving Certificate level, nevertheless just over one-third of those in third-level education are women.  This is something which requires explanation and research.  Less than 2 per cent of female university graduates take up employment in industry, compared with 11 per cent of male graduates.  What is the conditioning there?  What are the factors that influence their choices?  The agency points out that the recruitment of girls into designated trades apprenticeship was not introduced until 1975.  On 30 September 1978, there were 42 female apprentices registered with AnCO, as against 17,932 male apprentices.  Although there is the beginning of female apprenticeship and although AnCO is doing a considerable job in promoting opportunities for female apprentices, there is a very long way to go.  It is not something which will come naturally, through market forces. It is something that has to be very carefully planned for, promoted and encouraged.</P>
    <P>Again, the agency point out that in the civil service and local authorities, where there is a high concentration of women workers, only 7 per cent of senior positions are held by women.  The agency made a very valid statement about the approach that is needed and I strongly support the approach that they adopt.  I would like to quote from page 5 of the report because it summarises where the agency should be going from now on, with the full support of other bodies which are mentioned in this quotation:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> Changes in this picture will not come simply from claims made under legislation, even when the success rate is high.  In Ireland there is clearly defined and widespread job segregation; the agency has not yet become aware of efforts made by employers to take positive steps to end this segregation. Use must be made of the provisions of the Employment Equality Act which allow positive discrimination in providing special training schemes for members of one sex to obtain qualifications which have largely been the preserve of the other sex.  Few organisations appear to have reached even the elementary stage of producing a policy statement or a jointly agreed equal opportunity clause in industry or company collective agreements.</P>
    <P>Affirmative action in these areas requires co-operation between the Industrial Development Authority, the National Manpower Service, An Chomhairle Oiliúna (AnCO) and the Unions who organise workers in new enterprises and the employers.  The Agency hopes to have evidence of a co-operative approach,...</P>
    <P>That is the way in which we should be moving if we are genuinely to bring about, within any decent span of time, employment equality, a different attitude towards the opportunities for women workers and a better recognition of their overall needs.  I refer briefly, to the basic legislation, to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and to the Employment Equality Act, 1977, which established the Employment Equality Agency.  It is fair to say that, as legislation goes, it is good legislation.  It compares favourably with legislation in other jurisdictions.  Indeed, I understand we have been praised by the European Commission on the basis of our legislation, because of the definition of like work and because, in particular, of section 3 (c) of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong to bask in any warm glow at getting praise from the European Commission for the basic <Col N="502" /> legislation.  That would be the height of hyprocrisy when we know that beneath that legislative veneer the situation is one of job segregation, of discrimination and of lack of opportunity for women workers.  It is this reality which is going to be the next stage in the achievement of the objectives of the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>I turn to the capacity and the various important functions of the agency.  If one reads its responsibilities, its functions and its powers in the Employment Equality Act, the range compares very favourably with other statutory bodies which have far more manpower, capacity and resources at their disposal. I would divide the roles of the agency into, firstly a monitoring and enforcing role and, secondly, a persuading and educational role.  I submit that both of these roles are vital and are of equal importance to achieving the end result of a genuine movement to a mature equality between the sexes in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Taking firstly the monitoring and enforcing role, the agency have a responsibility to monitor the work situation of 30 per cent of the workforce, to monitor whether or not the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, is achieving the legislative objective of providing a basis for equal pay, an entitlement to equal pay and a machinery and process by which this can be obtained, to monitor equality in employment to ensure that there is no discrimination in advertising, discrimination in career structures, in employment and so on.  These are extremely important and far-reaching responsibilities and the agency has very far-reaching powers to go with those responsibilities.  The question will have to be asked whether it has the capacity to carry out these functions with its present level of support from the Government.</P>
    <P>The second role which the agency has is one of persuading and educating, and this obviously includes advertising and publicity in relation to both the existence of the agency itself and the legal entitlements, the right to equal pay, the right to equality of opportunity in jobs, training, educational possibilities and so on.  This includes research which should be and <Col N="503" /> can be carried out by the agency; it includes the holding of conferences to allow specialists from this country and other countries to give detailed information on the situation, with the object of ensuring the integration of women into the economy in a significant way and not in the present way, where the main impact is by the few individual claims that come before the machinery and which do not have a major impact on industrial life in this country.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I would like to make some comments on the adequacy of the machinery for processing equal pay claims under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.  I would like to refer to the work carried out by the equality officers and to their standing under that Act.  I understand that the two original equality officers are no longer with the Department.  There has been a lack of concern to ensure proper training facilities, adequate support, adequate manpower, or women power, in order to process equal pay claims.  The two original equality officers carried out a remarkable function considering that they were thrown in at the deep end without any training or preparation for the work that they were doing.  It is ironic that you then had an equal pay situation among the equality officers themselves, when a male equality officer came in at a different level although he was carrying on like work.  I would like to ask the Minister for some clarification about the present situation because it is not clear what the complement of the equality officers is now under the 1974 Act.</P>
    <P>There are delays in the procedure which must be apparent in some instances, which are certainly very frustrating and which are not either in the letter or spirit of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act.  From my personal experience I am aware of examples of delays, for example, in the claim put forward by the POWU on behalf of the female telephonists.  That claim had been a long time around before it went to the equality officer and it was several years before there was a result from the <Col N="504" /> Labour Court.  It took three years to pursue that equal pay claim.  For unions pursuing a claim on behalf of its members, and for the members of the union, this is extremely frustrating and disenchanting, in particular when you are talking about a Department of State. This was not a private capitalist employer refusing to accede to an equal pay claim: it was a Department reflecting, apparently, the lack of a real ideology of equality in that Department or perhaps within the State itself.</P>
    <P>There is a claim from the post office clerks which has been waiting for some two years for resolution.  That is far too long for something as important as establishing an entitlement for equal pay and having a decision on it.  If I can refer to my own pension claim where I argued that the pension scheme for Members of the Oireachtas contravened the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.  As I recall, that claim was lodged with the equality officer in the spring of 1978, I finally got a recommendation in December 1978, which was contrary to the submissions that I had made, and the Labour Court decided the matter in June 1979 in my favour.  It was a very net point.  Why did it have to take so long despite strenuous efforts on my part to speed the process up?</P>
    <P>All those three instances&mdash;the female telephonists, the post office clerks and the individual claim which I brought&mdash;were all against public bodies of this State, and the delays are completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I might refer briefly to the question of the adequacy of the Labour Court as the court which makes determinations in relation to equal pay claims.  I do not want to dwell on this at any length.  It is obviously very relevant to the monitoring of equal pay claims: it is necessary that we have this court reviewed, and it is the function of the Employment Equality Agency to review it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that there has been a considerable amount of discontent at a number of different levels about the capacity of the Labour Court <Col N="505" /> to be a genuine adjudicating body on equal pay claims.  The Labour Court was established as a conciliation body.  That is the main thrust of its work, that is where its main concentration must be.</P>
    <P>There is increasing frustration among women because there is not a single female member of the Labour Court, yet it is adjudicating on claims of potentially one-third of the labour force, trying to get equality in their pay and conditions. There is increasing support for the view that the Employment Appeal Tribunal or some similar body would be a more appropriate body for adjudicating on such claims.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the great potential of the agency which stems from its wide and specific powers, and the importance of the functions which it can have, for example, its power to serve notice that it is going to carry out a formal investigation. In its report, the agency refers to the fact that it had carried out its first formal investigation during the first 15 months.  This was the investigation of the situation in Aer Lingus.  In reality, as I understand it, once the fact of the formal investigation was known, Aer Lingus ceased the practice which might have given rise to the investigation and made it clear that it would not carry on any policy of employing only one sex in a particular thing.  Therefore, the fact of notice of the investigation achieved the objective.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I understand there is at the moment an investigation into CIE, and we see the effect of the female bus conductors and the very substantial impact which notice of a formal investigation can have.  It is desirable that the agency have full powers to institute formal investigations in other areas.  One does not have to look too far to see potential areas.  For example, the unequal retiring age of women is an obvious area that the agency perhaps might well be examining. One of the areas that would be very important in a broad range of employment would be the structure of career prospects for women in a number of these industries if there were the manpower <Col N="506" /> and resources in the agency that it clearly has the commitment and the interest to pursue these areas.</P>
    <P>I would also like to talk about the potential of the agency in its persuasive and educational roles.  It has a responsibility to carry out research, it has a responsibility for publicity and for information. It is amazing how effective quite a small publicity campaign can be.  It is fair to say that the very limited advertising campaign carried out by the agency last year had a very substantial impact. There are other bodies, for example, the Health Education Bureau, who seem to have unlimited budgets for advertising and who seem to be able to put together extremely glossy and long-term publicity or advertising campaigns on radio, television and newspapers.  I would like to see the Employment Equality Agency given more scope there because I believe it can make a very substantial impact. There is a need for that kind of publicity, that kind of education.  Also there should be an encouragement to the agency to fulfil roles in a more directly educational sense.  For example, one of the things that would have to happen if we are going to break the present job segregation pattern is to have career guidance in a much more structured and planned way opening up the possibilities for girls.</P>
    <P>That means we are going to have training and education of career guidance officers.  This should happen at every level and should be a role and function of the agency.  They should be greatly supported in doing this.  It can happen at conferences, meetings or seminars when these career guidance officers are brought together.  It can happen in supplying briefs to them which encourage them to get girls to think of broader opportunities.  If the agency is going to carry out its range of responsibilities and functions it requires legal expertise.  They ought to have either a full time legal staff&mdash;which is justified from the kind of role it has to play and the importance of what it is doing&mdash;or at least be able to avail of its powers under the Employment Equality Act to contract out legal work.  It would be <Col N="507" /> preferable if it could have its own legal staff.  It would be very desirable that that kind of expertise be built up.  The agency would be in a position to recruit very good young lawyers, or at least one lawyer working on the staff who would have the commitment and who would also be able to benefit from the experience of claims being pursued in other countries and of what has happened there.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the immense potential of the Employment Equality Agency, the striking work that has been done by a body which was new, which had to carve out its own territory, which I think has done it with remarkable skill and has maintained very good relations, for example, has maintained good relations with the trade unions, with employers, even with State agencies, trying to coax them into a more enlightened position in implementing equal pay claims.  This is important.  The Employment Equality Agency should not seek confrontation for the sake of it but should have the capacity and resources to achieve the objectives of the legislation. At present I believe it does not have that capacity.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to emphasise the point I made about the collective responsibility of the Government. There are two ways to ensure that something does not happen.  One is not to pass the legislation, or not to bring in the scheme.  For example, the long delay in bringing in a legal aid scheme.  The other way is to bring in legislation which looks good on the Statute Book and then make sure that you underfund the body concerned, that you do not allow enough people to be employed, that you do not give the capacity to carry out the functions. There is a real danger that this is going to happen in relation to the Employment Equality Agency.  It appears to me that the funding for the agency was less, in real terms, in 1979 than it was as evidenced in this first report for its first 15 months.  It would be no real improvement, no marking of the significance of the role of the agency, to merely keep pace with inflation.  What is needed is for <Col N="508" /> the Government to value the work of the agency, particularly value it because we have not had in Ireland a strong ideology of equality.  We probably would not have brought in that legislation in that time scale if we had not been under the thumb of big brother, the European Economic Community, which was saying: &ldquo;you cannot postpone equal pay; you cannot postpone equality of opportunity; you must implement these directives&rdquo;.  In particular in those circumstances we need an agency which has the encouragement, which is fully supported not only by a much greater grant out of Government resources but also supported in the way that the agency itself has called for, supported by the other bodies, such as the Industrial Development Authority, the National Manpower Service, AnCO and so on, to integrate women into the economy, ensuring that we genuinely have equal pay and equality of opportunity.</P>

      <P>I second the motion.  It must always be a matter of concern to everybody when a public body makes open confession of its failure to carry out its duties properly or fully.  That concern must be all the greater when the particular public body is an exceedingly important one charged with the responsibility of protecting the rights, the wages and the conditions of employment of almost one-third of the country's entire workforce.  As I see it, that is precisely the position of this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all be appalled were we told that the Garda Síochána or the courts of justice could not prosecute or punish law breakers because of lack of administrative funds.  We should be equally concerned about the non-implementation of any Bill for the same reason.  The areas in which the agency feel they are constrained in operation&mdash;because of the inadequacy of their grant-in-aid&mdash;are set out in section 5, Chapter 1 of the Report on page 7.  Broadly speaking they cover acquisition of adequate premises, research and unfilled staff <Col N="509" /> posts.  I shall not elaborate on these areas, or add to them, although I think I could.  It is not for me to suggest where the agency should extend their operations. That is for the members of the agency themselves.  Their people have tremendous experience, ability and knowledge in this field, but whatever could be delayed further&mdash;bearing in mind that we are getting very close to the next budget&mdash;in respect of the acquisition of adequate premises and research facilities, the very least we would expect would be that the agency be enabled to employ adequate staff immediately by way of the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as a trade union official I have fairly constant dealings with the Minister for Labour and his Department. I am conscious of the fact that the Minister is most hardworking and progressive, and is backed by staff second to none in this or any other country. I know he is extremely anxious to push on with progressive working-class legislation of every description.  But he, with his staff and his Department, are as much handicapped in this respect as are the agency.  I know that he would like to see his Department getting sufficient funds to enable him to implement his own aspirations and plans.  Therefore, my appeal really is to the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole to get their priorities right.</P>
    <P>By a unanimous decision of this House taken an hour or so ago we enabled the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to put their financial affairs in order.  We took steps to ensure that they will not find themselves in any financial difficulty in implementing their programme, or in carrying out their functions and duties.  During the course of a speech in this respect the Minister reminded us that the institute is in receipt this year of a grant of more than £5.1 million.  I do not begrudge the institute that sum of money.  They are doing very important work but so too is the agency.  We might well think that, in comparing a sum of £5.1 million for the institute with the <Col N="510" /> £96,000 in grant made to the agency for this year, we are dealing in chicken feed in so far as the agency is concerned, and, that is quite right.</P>
    <P>I could make many suggestions as to the manner in which the agency should operate, into what areas they should wander.  But&mdash;as I see it&mdash;that is not the purpose of this motion.  The purpose of the motion is to ensure that the agency is enabled, fully and properly, to implement their statutory functions and duties by way of making available to them the necessary grant, certainly in respect of next year, and as far as I am concerned a supplementary grant, to ensure they can recruit staff of the proper calibre immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this short contribution I propose to comment first on the link between equality in employment and job creation and secondly on the need for constant attention to the preparation of claims submitted to the Employment Equality Agency.  Thirdly, I contend that legislation on its own is inadequate to achieve equality in employment and lastly, I would support the case made by Senator Robinson that the functions of the Labour Court in respect of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 should be transferred to a larger Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The objective of the Employment Equality Agency is to encourage the elimination of discrimination and to promote equality between men and women in employment.  It has, therefore, an important role in monitoring existing practices and particularly in serving as an agent of change.  In its short life&mdash;and it is worth emphasising that it has not been long in existence&mdash;the agency has made considerable progress, due in large measure to a committed staff.  Here I join Senator Robinson in paying tribute to them.  In the historical context, there are many barriers to be overcome in advancing to a position where half the population, composed of women, can be employed first of all and then take up positions where their talents can be used to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> On the question of the link between equality in employment and job creation, clearly equality in employment is a very desirable objective and aim.  But jobs, however, have to be created irrespective of which sex secures them in the first instance, in order to reduce existing levels of unemployment and to provide new jobs for our young and constantly-growing population.  In this respect the main thrust of the Government's economic policy has been to create more jobs.  Very significant progress has been made in this regard.  It is only, therefore, in the context of full employment that full equal opportunities will become a reality.</P>
    <P>There is a need, as with any submission, be it the Labour Court or the Employment Equality Agency for constant attention to be paid to the preparation of claims.  In this respect the agency are to be commended for their efforts in appraising people of their rights under the two Acts already mentioned.  In addition, where disputes arise the agency staff assist people in preparing claims. This is time well spent and deserving of constant attention, as illustrated by the following quotation from the 1978 Annual Report of the Labour Court:</P>
    <P>The onus of proving entitlement to equal pay falls on the employee(s) concerned.  The parties might best serve their own interests if they were to take particular pains to present well documented cases to the Equality Officers. This would help to reduce the time taken to investigate the cases submitted.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases, too, the actual claims for equal pay are still being addressed to the Labour Court instead of the employers in the first instance.</P>
    <P>This legislation is concerned with rights and is important social legislation. But I contend that legislation alone is quite inadequate in achieving equality in employment.  Legislation and the claims made there under will not adequately <Col N="512" /> change the picture, as can be seen from employment practices today.  It will take time to change long-established practices and entrenched attitudes.  I submit that women employees themselves, supported by trade union efforts on their behalf, perhaps offer the most promising opportunities for advancement of women's rights.</P>
    <P>On the question of research&mdash;which Senator Robinson touched on&mdash;I welcome the idea put forward by the Department of Labour to the Employment Equality Agency that research should be undertaken on the extent to which curricular differences may be contributing to unequal opportunities for girls when they take up employment. This link between education and work is certainly deserving of investigation.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the role of the Labour Court in regard to this social legislation.  The operation of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 have added to the work of a very busy Labour Court.  Furthermore, this is a new dimension to the court's main role of mediation, in that under these two Acts the court has a monitoring role in regard to workers' rights and also has the responsibility for hearing appeals thus making determinations which have legally binding effects.  In addition to its main function under the Industrial Relations Acts of helping the parties to settle their disputes, the court is now virtually making determinations on points of law in accordance with what is stated in these two Acts rather than adopting the traditionally pragmatic approach of recommending settlement terms to the disputants.  This additional complex work has implications for the character of the court and for the principle of voluntarism which has been fundamental to the court's make-up since its establishment. This point is clearly underlined by the following extract from the 1978 Annual Report of the Labour Court:</P>
    <P>A feature of these appeals is the extent to which the Court finds itself involved with legal aspects of its actions <Col N="513" /> and its decisions, thus depriving it of the flexibility which it enjoys when dealing with cases referred to it under the Industrial Relations Acts.  It also means that the cases take up more time and that the decisions take longer to reach.</P>
    <P>I would support the view of Senator Robinson that the present role of the Labour Court in regard to social legislation should be transferred from the Labour Court, thus allowing the court to concentrate exclusively on its mediation role and to devote more time to that.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the proposer and the seconder for putting down the motion thus allowing an opportunity to have it discussed in the House.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with <Col N="514" /> this motion under two headings, grants in respect of farm buildings which are applicable to the whole country and drainage grants applicable to the 12 western counties.  Until Monday of this week, grants payable on farm buildings were based on a scale of costings that had been in operation on 1 June 1978, and in that 18 months there were very high increases in the cost of building materials and wages, and the costings that were made on a particular building job in 1978 became irrelevant by the time the job was completed and meant that the grant fell to about 25 per cent of the cost.  The grant is not giving the same assistance to people to erect farm buildings or to improve concrete farmyards as was originally intended.  In a case of which I know, £5,000 was the cost estimated for the erection of a silage pit, but with the increase in costs the 30 per cent grant represented only about 25 per cent of the cost incurred.  There had been a long period of 18 months without an adjustment in the costings, and during that time, with rapid inflation, a great increase in the cost of building materials and an increase in wages, an adjustment should have been much earlier.</P>
      <P>Senator McCartin, who would have been speaking on this motion but has a commitment in Europe, has figures to show that grant payments made amount to 23 or 24 per cent of the total cost of the work done, thus falling considerably short of the 30 per cent intended.</P>
      <P>The costing scheme for drainage work in operation was drawn up on 1 January of this year and because of an increase in the cost of diesel oil, an increase in the cost of plastic pipes and in wages, the amount allowed in grants is falling short of the 70 per cent which was the amount fixed to assist drainage in the 12 western counties.  Because of that, the grants are falling below 60 per cent of the total cost of the work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My principal objective in having this motion discussed is to emphasise the need for a more regular adjustment in the costings so that farmers will be enabled to keep pace with the increase in the cost of the job.  If it goes for a period of 18 months without review, as it did in <Col N="515" /> the case of costings on farm buildings, it becomes obvious that the grants are not giving the percentage assistance that they were intended to give at the outset. With regard to the drainage grants, I know of one farm of 22 acres where the grant fell short by about £80 an acre because of the increase in costs.  Another one in County Cavan, a farm of ten acres, was drained and the farmer concerned assures me that it fell about 78.5 per cent short.  Another point that is causing some annoyance amongst applicants for these grants is the delay in paying the grant.  This is a matter of great annoyance to the farming community at a time when credit, if it can be got at all, is very costly and very difficult to get. The contractors naturally are pressing for payment of the money as early as possible.  It does not do the scheme any good if there are unnecessary delays.</P>
    <P>With regard to the drainage scheme itself, in my own county of Cavan it was slow getting off the ground in the early stages but I am glad to say that there is an improvement in recent months. Figures that I have indicate that in County Cavan there are 799 applicants for grants under the drainage scheme, that will cover a total of 4,270 hectares and that up to date work on 768 hectares has been completed.  That is a reasonable rate of progress for a scheme that is not so long under way but that progress will have to be speeded up if the number of people who have already applied are to have any hope of having their work done inside the next five years.  We could not take that as a satisfactory rate of progress.  I understand, too, that applications from all of the 12 counties in the western area would cover 36,440 hectares and that about one eighth of that acreage is already covered.  It is said that the work is held up in some areas because of shortage of staff.  I have here a report in the <i>Leitrim Observer</i> which draws attention to the slow rate of progress in that county, as stated by an official of the IFA at a public meeting.  It is reported in the <i>Leitrim Observer</i> dated 1 December 1979.  The report says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> The operation of the scheme, which is a joint EEC/Irish Government venture, has been the subject of much criticism from various agricultural sources throughout the county.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Many farmers who made applications some six months ago had heard nothing since.  This is only one of the problems the applicants have run into.</P>
    <P>It says, too, in the report that:</P>
    <P>...up to 31 October, of the five year scheme there has only been 155 acres of land drained in Leitrim.</P>
    <P>That could not be considered satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Another point that causes a certain amount of annoyance amongst applicants for this scheme is that they are not told exactly what the agricultural officer bases his figures on.  This IFA spokesman, speaking in Leitrim, on this matter drew attention to this very point and said:</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Cloone last spring the Minister for State at the Department of Agriculture, Mr. Tom Hussey, stated that farmers could see the costings being used to price their work but the Department officials say their costings cannot be shown to the farmer, as they are private and confidential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That leaves very little time for me.  I give less than a guarded welcome to the increase in the estimated costs for farm buildings.  There was not any mention of land drainage at all in the recent announcements.  I have been told that this particular costing has been increased by about 12 per cent.  I ask the Minister to tell the House what exactly the percentage increase was. Does he realise the enormous increase in building costs since the 1 June 1978?</P>
      <P>Is it not true that a slatted house to house about 50 cattle could easily be built for about £150 per head or a total of £7,500 in June 1978, and now, eighteen months later, the same house for the same number of cattle would cost at least £225 per head or well over £11,000.  That is an increase of £3,500 or a whopping 46 per cent.  That particular increase would be insignificant with a figure of, say, 12 per cent or a figure near that that might attract the increase that has been granted.  I suggest to the Minister that if the EEC will not accept responsibility for those dramatic increases in building costs would he not get the Department of Finance to give an immediate subvention to keep grants in pace with inflation and rising costs in construction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A gesture of this type, I am certain, would partly promote confidence in agriculture.  We have falling cattle prices, soaring interest rates, a general gloom over agriculture particularly in the small farming areas and added to this the difference between the actual cost of doing a job for farm buildings and the grant one is entitled to get while that big gap begins to widen.  It will not do a lot for the confidence of Irish farmers.  We know that buildings by their very nature are very slow to pay their way, as any <Col N="518" /> fixed assets would be.  We only have to look at the price rises in ready-mix concrete, cement, sand, iron, work and wages.</P>
    <P>Who was responsible for accepting the latest estimate costs?  Was it accepted by the Minister and his Department? Was it imposed on us by Brussels?  Why are the grants not paid promptly?  I do not want to be given the answer that it was because of the postal strike.  They are still just as slow, as far as I am aware.  There is not a day of the week that we are not trying to get a grant for some of our constituents.  I see no reason once the area officer passes a particular job why the grant would not be in the farmer's hand inside a couple of weeks. That is certainly not the rule at the moment. Is there a bias against the grants for slatted houses?  I heard murmurings in the last couple of weeks from farmers that the estimated costs in relation to slatted houses have been pegged down and that the estimated costs for other building activities in fact have been allowed to come upwards with the present increase.  I want to know if this is true and, if so, why?</P>
    <P>I will address myself for the few moments at my disposal to the western drainage scheme.  As we all know this was heralded 12 months ago as the saviour of the west.  I still have my doubts as to who will be saved and who will not as far as that is concerned.  The estimated costs were published in January 1979 and there was no increase whatever since.  We get 70 per cent of the total cost, to a maximum of £220 an acre.  I have calculated from several farmers that that 70 per cent is, in fact, 50 per cent of the total cost.  Why was the ceiling on the £220 not increased?  Does the Minister not realise the problem of stubborn heavy land with scrub, rock and bushes?  It could not possibly be done for anything like a baseline of £220.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise the excessive rises in oil prices, wages, the cost of credit even if one could get it?  Why do the Department of Agriculture not grant aid to private contractors in the <Col N="519" /> purchase of new drainage machinery?  I feel this is a remarkable omission when we consider the vast amount of acres that have to be drained in the west of Ireland.  From the involvement of the co-ops at the moment there is no way I can see that they will be able to cover the ground.  I cannot understand why we did not put up a better fight and why the Brussels authorities will not grant aid to private contractors, who are the people who did all the drainage and have all the expertise down the years.</P>
    <P>It is one of the great tragedies of the western drainage scheme that that particular section have been left out.  With the cost of heavy drainage machinery at the moment much of it, in fact, is completely outside the scope of most contractors. If the co-ops were able to do it it would be all right.  The co-ops have the money but they have not got the expertise. The Minister must be aware of the fact that people are terribly slow getting involved in drainage schemes.  There is a lot of pious talk about it.  The man who owned a few JCBs, and had five or six men working for him was the sort of contractor who was handy.  He was a neighbour and everybody trusted him. One knew with whom one was working. I cannot understand why the Minister, the Department generally, and Brussels for that matter, had to impose this penal law on our contractors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Senators should find themselves impelled to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  During the course of their contributions they revealed an absolutely astonishing lack of knowledge of the realities in this situation, and possibly if for no other reason the short debate we have been listening to was of use from that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the Senators that the amount of actual expenditure on farm modernisation schemes between 1976 and 1979 has risen from £12 million to £44 million.  Nobody would seriously challenge the fact that costs are rising rapidly.  Most people are aware by <Col N="520" /> now that there has been an acute and continuing fuel crisis that must have a very big effect on the costs of the carrying out of drainage schemes and all other types of schemes.  Nevertheless, to hear Senator Connaughton speaking of the payment of a 70 per cent grant in the case of western drainage and describing it as a penal law is departing from anything that could reasonably be called good sense. The same Senator advocated the building throughout the small farm areas in the west of Ireland of the dearest possible form of cattle houses, slatted houses.  A far more appropriate type of cattle housing for the smaller farmers would be the kennel system.  I do not believe that there is an acute problem with the shooting up of costs in the area of slatted buildings for animals in the west of Ireland.  I do not think there can be many cases like that.  Even if there were, farmers in the west of Ireland might be well advised not to go into the business of investing in this very costly form of animal housing.</P>
    <P>Before January of this year the ordinary level of drainage grants was available in the west as well.  Because of representations I made in Brussels this is now 70 per cent.  I am currently conducting negotiations for the raising of grants further still and over a wider area in the structural field.  That covers a very large spectrum of development measures.  In that context it does not seem to add up to the fact that the two Senators should have felt it desirable to raise this small point and to read at great length, as Senator O'Brien did, from the observations of an unnamed IFA man, as reported in the <i>Leitrim Observer</i>, interesting though it was.  It has no bearing on the fact that the expenditure on farm development throughout the western counties has been dramatically changed for the better with the arrival of the special west of Ireland drainage scheme. I look forward to the early completion of the negotiations of the second structural package for the west of Ireland.  I am aware that there will always be a constant escalation of costs, and, because there is, there will be an attendant review of the costings situation from time to time.  That is the situation.</P>

      <Col N="521" /> Things have been difficult in farming in the past year.  One of the worst winters in memory has passed, and a very bad grass season.  This bears particularly heavily on the farmers whose main enterprise is cattle husbandry of one kind or another.  This is not to say that the new western development structural funds made available by the European Community as a result of the successful negotiations of the Government and myself is in any way answerable to the description that Senator Connaughton gave of a penal code as if there was something really stringent about it.  The payment of a good deal more than two-thirds of the cost of the drainage of particular land is in anybody's estimation a very enviable size of grant and makes the business of land drainage on a fairly extensive scale a truly economic proposition. <Col N="522" /> The difficulty in the budgetary situation within the European Community will be to maintain percentages, as it will be my endeavour to do.  To make charges of the kind that have been made by the two Senators is to depart from common sense.  I do not think the Seanad should indulge in a great deal of that; it is a very unrewarding practice.  I am satisfied that the level of grants is very good and that the incidence of the rise in costings will be subjected to constant review.  In general, the prospects are good and may be even better.  Therefore, I can see no reason for the despair that is evinced by the Senators in their contributions.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Thursday, 13 December 1979.</P>
