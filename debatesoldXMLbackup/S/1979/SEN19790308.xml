      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  the immediate and other causes of, and the circumstances of <Col N="514" /> and leading to, the explosions and fires on and in the vicinity of the ship <i>Betelgeuse</i> and the jetty of the terminal of Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Limited at Whiddy Island, Bantry, in the County of Cork on the 8 January 1979,</P>
    <P>(2)  the circumstances of and leading to the loss of life on and in the vicinity of the ship and jetty on the 8 January 1979,</P>
    <P>(3)  the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 8 January 1979, on, in the vicinity of and in relation to the ship and at, in the vicinity of and in relation to the terminal to prevent, and to minimise and otherwise to deal with&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  fires and explosions of the kinds aforesaid, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the occurrence of circumstances of the kinds that led to the loss of life aforesaid;</P>

    <P>2.  making such recommendations (if any) as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion sets out the terms of reference which the Government propose to give to the tribunal of inquiry which is being set up to inquire into the Bantry Bay disaster of 8 January last.  Fifty-one people lost their lives in the terrible events of that morning and I do not need to remind Senators of the appalling impact which that tragedy made on all of us and our deep dismay that such an event should occur.</P>
      <P>It was immediately clear that the most searching and exhaustive inquiry must be conducted into the disaster.  The Taoiseach announced on 8 January, the day of the disaster, that the fullest possible inquiry would be held and on the following day I announced that this would take the form of a public sworn inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two reasons in particular why the fullest possible inquiry must be held.  First, we have a duty to the victims of the disaster and to their bereaved relatives to make every possible effort to <Col N="515" /> establish the circumstances and causes of the disaster and to identify as precisely as possible the lessons which we can learn from it so that we may be in a position to take whatever measures are necessary to minimise the possibility of such terrible events occurring again; secondly, we have a wider obligation, which extends to all those who go to sea in ships, whether in tankers or otherwise, and those who continue to work at oil terminals.  We would hope that, from our experience of this appalling tragedy, there are lessons which can be learned which will contribute to making the seas and the ports of the world safer and we have, accordingly, a duty to isolate those lessons and benefit from them.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, compelling reasons for the widest possible investigation into the disaster.  Furthermore, such investigation must have the standing and powers commensurate with the important task which is being assigned to it by the Government.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Government decided that the body appointed to hold the inquiry should have the highest status in law.  Following an examination of existing legislative provisions which provide statutory authority for the holding of public inquiries into incidents of this kind, it became clear that a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 would best meet the requirements which the Government had in mind.  It became necessary, however, to draft and enact amending legislation in order to ensure the effectiveness of the inquiry.  It was in these circumstances that the Minister for Justice promoted the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 1979 which has since been enacted and which contains provisions which, <i>inter alia,</i> require the attendance of witnesses, the giving of evidence and the production of documents.</P>
    <P>An eminent judge of the High Court, Mr. Justice Declan Costello, has agreed to hold the inquiry.  He will be assisted by a number of assessors who will be chosen on the basis of high calibre, experience and expertise.  Senators have before them the comprehensive terms of <Col N="516" /> reference which the Government propose to give to the tribunal.  We propose to ask it to investigate the causes and circumstances of the disaster and the resultant loss of life as well as the adequacy of the measures taken to prevent and deal with accidents at, in the vicinity of and in relation to the terminal and the ship.  Furthermore, the tribunal may make such recommendations as, having regard to its findings, it may think proper.  The terms of reference have been deliberately drawn up after the most detailed consideration with the objective of providing the tribunal with full scope in its conduct of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>As Senators are, of course, aware, the effectiveness of the inquiry will be governed to a large extent by the evidence and expert opinion which is presented to it.  One of the tragic aspects of this disaster is the fact that there were no survivors among those aboard the vessel or present on the jetty at the time of the explosion and fire.  This obviously makes the task of the tribunal particularly difficult and makes it all the more essential that the most thorough and painstaking examination of the wreck and the jetty be carried out with a view to providing evidence for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I made arrangements in the immediate aftermath of the disaster to ensure the assembly and preservation of evidence necessary for the conduct of the inquiry.  My first action in this regard was the appointment, on the day following the disaster, of an officer of my Department to undertake a preliminary inquiry under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  When the bow section of the vessel had been rendered safe for examination after the completion of gas inerting, the work of investigation and assembly of evidence was carried out under the close supervision of my Department. In order to do this, I assembled a team of experts comprising maritime technical experts from my own Department assisted by experts from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and Irish Shipping Ltd. and augmented, as necessary, by technical experts from abroad.  My aim has been to ensure that nothing which would have contributed to the cause of the disaster is overlooked and that the tribunal will <Col N="517" /> have the assistance of the best available expertise.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the other parties with a direct interest in the hearings before the tribunal have also had access to the wreck and the jetty with my consent and under my supervision.  These facilities have been granted subject to appropriate safeguards and in an atmosphere of agreement and co-operation between all concerned. Everybody realises the vital importance of the work which is being done and the value of the contribution which they may be making to safer operations in the future.  I have no doubt that all concerned in the investigations share a real desire to establish, in so far as this is possible, the truth of what happened to cause the disaster of 8 January.</P>
    <P>The examination of the bow section of the vessel has been completed and that portion was towed to a selected sinking site about 100 miles west-south-west of Fastnet and scuttled on 23 February last.  Work on the salvage of the midsection and after section is proceeding and will take some time.  Similar work of examination by experts is being carried out on the remaining sections of the vessel and on the jetty to establish whether they can yield any possible evidence as to the cause of the disaster.</P>
    <P>We have not yet reached a stage where a date can be set for the commencement of the inquiry but I can say that it will be held at Bantry.</P>
    <P>It would clearly be inappropriate for me at this time to comment on any matter which will arise for consideration by the tribunal and I do not propose to do so.  I must not, however, let the opportunity pass without paying tribute to the very considerable work put in by many people, often in difficult and, indeed, dangerous conditions, in the aftermath of the disaster.</P>
    <P>The Garda, Army, Air Corps and Naval personnel did a tremendous job. The most immediate task after the explosion and fire was to remove the remaining oil from the bow section, to eliminate the risk of further pollution and to ensure against danger of further fire or explosion. In these areas, the shipowners, terminal operators, salvors and their employees worked in difficult and hazardous <Col N="518" /> conditions to make the wreck safe and to contain the risk of oil spillage. These tasks were undertaken with efficiency and expedition and have received international praise for the way in which they were carried out.  The anti-pollution operations in particular have been of considerable effectiveness, having regard to the potential pollution hazard of the severely damaged vessel. The damage caused by pollution and the use of dispersants has been kept to a minimum and the position remains under constant surveillance.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on record also my appreciation of the efficiency and dedication with which officials of the various Government Departments, including my own Departments of Tourism and Transport and Posts and Telegraphs, the Departments of Defence, Environment, Fisheries and Labour, the Attorney General's Office and local authorities tackled and dealt with the various problems which arose in the aftermath of the disaster.  I would also wish to record my appreciation of the facilities provided by the British and French authorities.</P>
    <P>Finally it is my fervent hope that, despite the very considerable difficulties which face them in their task, the tribunal will find it possible to establish the cause of the disaster.  The fact that there were, tragically, no survivors among those most intimately concerned in those fateful final moments leaves a large gap in the available evidence.</P>
    <P>The amending legislation already enacted and the resolution now before the House are designed to ensure that the tribunal will have all the powers necessary for its purposes and will suffer from no constraints which might hinder its work.  I have no doubt that the Seanad fully shares the Government's objectives in this matter and will lend its full support to the resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this motion to establish a tribunal, I would like to express from this side of the House the sympathy of Fine Gael to all those who suffered bereavement on this very sad and tragic occasion.  The disaster was of such dimensions that it was within minutes a news topic throughout <Col N="519" /> the world.  Certainly the focus centred on Ireland, particularly on what we would do in the immediate aftermath of this disaster.  Here I would like to pay tribute to everybody concerned who did what I felt was a very good job in carrying out whatever emergency operations could be carried out at that hour.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister himself.  I know he has had plenty of problems on his plate in the past few months, but he responded very quickly in the aftermath of this disaster, as did all the officials of his Department.  I would also pay tribute to Cork County Council, all the local organisations and local people in Bantry who responded as required.  I would also thank the rescue services from other nations. They came from Britain and France and perhaps from other countries in the EEC as well.</P>
      <P>In establishing this tribunal we must try to satisfy ourselves that the terms of reference will be adequate and sufficient to meet what we want done.  It is always desirable that the terms of reference should be as wide as possible to give the necessary powers to the tribunal itself so that its findings will be both positive and finite.  It is, of course, important that the tribunal should hold its hearings urgently. The word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; is used in the wording of the motion, but we should not have urgency at the expense of care in the hearings and the drafting of the findings.  The rest of the world will be paying attention to the findings of the tribunal and I am sure those findings will be the subject at a subsequent date of international measures.  Mr. Justice Declan Costello has a very serious and onerous task on his shoulders and I wish him the very best of good luck in his duties.</P>
      <P>It is good to see that the tribunal is being held in Bantry.  This will serve two purposes.  It will keep in the forefront of the public mind why the tribunal hearings are being held in Bantry.  It will refresh the public's memory with regard to this disaster.  It will also give the local people an opportunity to rid themselves somewhat of the traumatic feeling which they experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be noted that Gulf Oil, notwithstanding this tragedy, are still <Col N="520" /> very much welcomed by the local people. It is important that this should be, and certainly it shows that the people of Bantry and Cork are conscious of the benefit which Gulf Oil have brought to their community.  There may have been mistakes in the past with regard to not having proper safety measures and perhaps more adequate emergency measures, but there is no point in crying at this late stage, and if the report and the findings of the tribunal do result in responsibility having to lie on somebody's shoulders, then that will have to be faced up to when it does come.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that preliminary inquiries have already been held.  I wonder if there are any findings resulting from the preliminary inquiries and whether they can be implemented pending the final report of the tribunal itself.  We have other oil terminals in Ireland, in Dublin and in Whitegate, for instance, and if anything has come out of these preliminary findings perhaps safety measures should be implemented in both Dublin and Whitegate.  Even though a disaster of this dimension happened only a couple of months ago, there is no guarantee that it will not happen elsewhere on some future occasion.</P>
    <P>One of the tragic aspects in this whole business of oil spillages, oil explosions and disasters on the sea generally has been that notwithstanding the number of instances there have been throughout the world in the past few years, indeed over the past decade, we still seem to be unable to provide a proper safety measure system and proper and adequate emergency precautions when these disasters occur.  There were a number of instances such as those involving the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> and the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> and now this latest disaster and unfortunately it seems to lead to the conclusion that there is no guarantee that the experience of these disasters will be prevented in future.  Perhaps this is the price of our being part of the modern world, particularly in regard to having oil terminals in this country, and we have to pay that price, but it behoves us to make sure that we take every precaution possible.</P>
    <P>The tribunal being established must, of course, have at its disposal adequate <Col N="521" /> resources, in regard to proper staffing and proper financing.  Proper and adequate communications with the outside world throughout the hearings of the tribunal will be necessary.  I am sure the Minister in his function as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will try to make sure that the world is kept properly acquainted and informed of what the tribunal is discussing each day of the hearings.  The tribunal should look into the functioning of the Bantry Harbour Board over the past five or six years.  It appears that there has been certain laxity in regard to giving adequate power, or any power at all, to the Bantry Harbour Board.  Whether such powers being there would have done anything to prevent this disaster is another question.  If we are to have an oil terminal in Bantry it is necessary that the harbour board should be given some powers and not merely be a rubber stamp or merely seem to be a nominal authority with no functions or no real responsibilities.</P>
    <P>During the past couple of days I have heard fishermen from Bantry saying on radio that there is still pollution in that vicinity.  This is regrettable, notwithstanding the fact that dispersants were used.  The fishermen in any location where there has been an oil spillage are the people who suffer most of all, because their livelihood is at stake for the future, apart from any tourist benefits or anything of that kind.  I wonder if the dispersants which are used in such situations are the proper types? Perhaps we are tempted to use more dispersants than necessary, and we spoil a great deal of marine and fish life in the process.  This morning we received a report from the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation which deals with this question of marine pollution arising from the carriage of oil and there are a number of recommendations as to what the EEC would like to do.  The Joint Committee spell out that it is regrettable there is no world-wide convention for organising emergency facilities and they call on the EEC itself to take the initiative in this matter and try to draw together all the existing international conventions in an effort to have some uniform procedures adopted.</P>
    <P>If the report of the tribunal contains <Col N="522" /> recommendations in regard to safety and rescue services, it is important that they should be implemented at the earliest possible date, notwithstanding what the EEC might be considering on a broader front.  We must look to the safety and security of our own territory first of all, and I am confident that the Government will implement whatever recommendations come from this tribunal.</P>
    <P>I hope that the cause of the disaster can be discovered and, if there has been negligence somewhere, that the blame will be positively directed where it lies and the negligent parties dealt with.  The public are entitled to this, but more important still is that the findings of the tribunal's hearings will enable safety, emergency and rescue services in future to be implemented.  The real lesson of this horrible calamity is that we must do something and there is no point in having all the international bodies which exist talking about and discussing this matter; a proper procedure must be adopted and implemented.  Pollution itself knows no borders and with the great volume of oil now being carried on the sea there is no country safe from a disaster such as we experienced.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tribunal.  I hope it will come up with its findings at the earliest stage possible, but I do not want urgency at the expense of care and responsibility and positive findings.</P>

      <P>I am sure everybody here welcomes this motion. We all lament the terrible tragedy that took place at Whiddy Island in the recent past.  Not alone was our own nation shocked, but the whole world was shocked.  The loss of life was enormous and maybe for the first time in the history of the carriage of oil people realised the terrible dangers under present-day conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the inquiry will be held in Bantry.  It was felt by most of us that it would be held there, despite rather annoying and abrasive bouts of speculation from various people regarding the location of the inquiry.  Local people in Bantry wanted the inquiry to be held there, as all reasonable people would.  To my knowledge the only constraint was in <Col N="523" /> regard to facilities.  All that has been overcome.  At this juncture I would offer the highest commendation to the Minister for the speed with which he got things moving immediately the disaster happened.  Again there was much speculation which was very irritating, not alone to the local people but to the Government, Cork County Council and the various people who were interested in finding the truth and exactly what happened, how and why it happened. The responsible authorities, the Government, Cork County Council and the local people had as their objective coming at that truth and in the long term seeing that steps would be taken to prevent such disasters happening in the future.  I suppose disasters will happen no matter what precautions are taken, but we are new to all this and it is a lesson for us. We learn by lessons, and steps must be taken to see that every effort will be made, not alone on our own local seas but all over the world, to prevent the recurrence of such disasters.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey rightly referred to the report which we received this morning from the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Community action in regard to marine pollution arising from the carriage of oil.  I have not had time to go through it, but I noted the paragraph on combating pollution which states:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee agrees with the Commission that whereas the solution for the overall problem must be found on an international basis, the Community should not be inhibited from taking such action as it can on its own initiative.  Progress towards formulating appropriate internationally acceptable rules is necessarily a slow process and, as the Commission points out, a succession of tanker accidents and increasing marine pollution have highlighted the failure to effectively enforce the international conventions and agreements that do exist. In the Joint Committee's view it is particularly regrettable that there is no worldwide convention for organising emergency facilities to deal with major oil spills.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> Now we have a further dimension to our tribunal of inquiry and it places a very onerous job on the shoulders of Mr. Justice Declan Costello and his team of experts and advisers.  The findings of this inquiry will set a headline for future legislation, not only in our own State but all over the world.  Certainly there is a heavy burden on them.  Please God they will find out the truth in so far as it can be found out.</P>
    <P>The Minister laments the fact that we have no survivors.  We have to depend on evidence from onlookers and others. We hope that while this inquiry is being held and as news comes along there will be no exaggerated speculation or such activity by people who should be a little more sensitive to the grief that is still there and will be there for a long time among the people in the vicinity of the disaster and our friends in France.  We are sometimes inclined to think that ours is the only grief.  The French lost more in numbers than we did and we hope that everybody who has evidence to offer to this tribunal will come forward and give of whatever knowledge he has.  The truth is the important thing at this stage.  Let everybody who has evidence come along and offer it.  Great as the disaster was, the speed with which the Government and all concerned have acted will, we hope, be the cause of preventing future disasters of that nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to welcome this motion setting up the inquiry into the Whiddy Island disaster.  I should also like to be associated with the messages of sympathy to the families so tragically bereaved.  The magnitude of the tragedy awakened a tremendous concern not only within our own shores but throughout the world as to the problems that can and will arise in the transportation of huge quantities of oil.  While the major tragedy was the colossal loss of life, a frightening volume of pollution was caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All those involved, including the Minister, deserve the hightest commendation for the speed with which they demonstrated their human interest and concern.  The emergency services, at very considerable hardship, were assembled <Col N="525" /> at very short notice and did Trojan work despite frightening difficulties there.  This was in itself a tremendous demonstration of how readily and effectively these services could be organised in the middle of the night and at short notice.</P>
    <P>There is a frightening task of responsibility in front of this tribunal.  As the Minister has said, there are no survivors and the tribunal will rely mainly on the accounts of witnesses on the island and on the mainland.  I hope that the tribunal's functions are so important that neither time, money nor energy will be spared on their part in their endeavour to establish the real cause of this frightening disaster.  If the causes can be established it would be of great significance not only to this country but internationally.  Its functioning and findings will be watched with tremendous interest throughout the world.  Undoubtedly, if it can establish the cause, regardless of where negligence may or may not lie, it would have a tremendous impact on future marine safety regulations and would make a contribution towards avoiding such disasters.  I am delighted that the Minister has agreed to hold the inquiry in Bantry.  This will be more convenient for all those involved and will provide for the easier assessment of all the evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>When it was mooted that Gulf Oil might come to Bantry it was welcomed, first by the nation because it meant an extra reserve of oil and, secondly, by the people of Bantry because they saw in it the commencement of industrial development in the area.  At the time there was concern in case it would go to Scotland rather than to Bantry.  During the period Gulf Oil was being built, Bantry gained by the number employed and when the building was complete, they also gained by the employment and the trade coming into the area.  They succeeded in planning the operation so that the tourist industry was not affected and the oil company was able to operate in conjunction with it without spoiling the environment. When everything appeared to be happy, we suffered a series of oil spillages. <Col N="526" /> Those caused concern and claims were paid.  The company then brought in new procedures for dealing with oil spillages. These seemed to be effective and everything in the garden appeared to be rosy when, suddenly, out of the blue came this unanticipated disaster; the ultimate disaster resulting in loss of life. That disaster could have been far greater only for the fact that procedures had been developed, in some form, to deal with such disasters.  The services came into operation immediately.  We should congratulate those concerned and thank them for preventing the Bantry disaster being far greater than it actually was.  It was a traumatic experience for all those living in the area.</P>
      <P>Through the methods of dealing with pollution which went into action and through those who, in some cases, took their lives in their hands, pollution was minimised.  Despite this, there has been pollution and many fishermen in the area have not been able to carry on their ordinary operations since the disaster. Unfortunately, those men have received no income.  It may be that this situation could be assisted by the company or such other persons who, in the interim period, could, without prejudice, make some contribution or, possibly, it could be taken up temporarily with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This inquiry is important to Bantry and I would like to congratulate the Minister on the action he took immediately following the disaster. Everything was done that should have been done and we would like to thank him.  The people of Bantry are hopeful that this inquiry will be able to tell us what happened so that, in future, steps can be taken to prevent a recurrence or in fact, any disaster in that area and Gulf Oil can continue.  The people of Bantry look forward to an oil refinery and a spin-off industry.  This is their hope.  The result of the inquiry is important to them and to other people, as Senator Moynihan has mentioned.  The people in Whitegate are concerned, the people in Dublin are concerned, and no doubt, people throughout the world are concerned because this is an international affair.  We look forward to the inquiry and hope that everyone who can <Col N="527" /> assist it will do so, so that, not alone can the reasons come out into the open but it will be possible to take action, to enact legislation if necessary, to make the industry safe for the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for acceding to the request of the people of Bantry to hold the inquiry there.  I welcome this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my sentiments to those already expressed by the Minister and Senators.  As the Minister said, the intention of the inquiry might be summarised by saying that we owe it as a duty to the victims to inquire into what happened.  We must learn something from it.  That is what came home to me. We may have learned a few lessons already before the inquiry has actually been held.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, in the public meeting of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities a report was examined which covered the regulations and procedures to be followed in the control and manning of shipping with particular emphasis on the EEC role.  Like so many other reports that this Committee prepare, it will probably not get very much attention from the media.  We learned something from examining these proposed directives and regulations from the EEC.  One of the things that I learned while participating in the discussion on this report was that Ireland as a maritime nation, as an island, is wide open to problems that arise from badly managed processes involving shipping and storage on the coastline of oil, chemicals or any other potentially dangerous substances.  Some of the problems that are heralded in that report are, for instance, the extension of the territorial waters.  It is difficult to control waters nearby but it is going to be even more difficult as our jurisdiction extends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a non-technology-orientated society and this has come from our educational system.  What I am afraid of is that the technologists in our society do not have sufficient power in our administrative system and some of the procedures and systems of protection <Col N="528" /> may not get the full consideration they should get.  For instance, it came out in the report we examined yesterday that the technology for the protection of potentially explosive situations is not fully developed even internationally, not to mind in this country.  The lesson I would derive from that is that we should not wait until other countries develop these things.  We should put them in hands ourselves.  We should make sure that money is made available for the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and other such bodies to do the work that is required.  Prevention is better than cure.  It is very satisfying to be able to commend all those who took action following the disaster.  What I would like to make sure is that, in future, we would take action before the disaster.</P>
    <P>I would advocate a greater role for technologists in the administration of this State, as happens in other countries. I am not saying that lack of this contributed to what happened.  It struck me, looking through the EEC report, that the technology was deficient internationally. In a situation where we are so exposed, I hope that we will ensure that money spent on technology and on paying technologists would add to the probability that we have covered all the possible avenues of error.</P>

      <P>I join in expressing sympathy for the relatives of the people concerned in this dreadful disaster.  I want to congratulate the Minister for the very determined effort which has obviously been made to investigate this matter.</P>
      <P>There are two small points which I should like to mention in connection with the general principle of setting up tribunals of inquiry.  One is the very unusual international aspect of this inquiry. I am delighted to see that the Minister has very clearly taken this into account in the manner in which he has already started his investigations and in which he proposes to enable the tribunal to continue its investigations.  The circumstances surrounding this disaster may well have originated where it happened but they could also have originated far outside our jurisdiction.  It is essential that this possibility be thoroughly investigated and I am sure with the Minister's determination, it will be.  Part 2 of the motion states:</P>
      <P>making such recommendations (if any) as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper.</P>
      <P>There are, tragically, no survivors of the immediate disaster and it may well be, as the Minister suggested, that we will never know the full facts of what exactly happened.  This situation is analogous to aircraft disasters.  There is now an international regulation whereby aircraft must carry a recording device which is virtually impervious to impact and fire.  I cannot help thinking that a safety device which should be incorporated in such circumstances as these is the black box recording device which would monitor essential conversations and happenings in crucial safety areas.  I would recommend this.  I am sure the Minister probably already has it very much in mind.  I hope that it will be considered by the tribunal under part 2.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the very constructive manner in which they have dealt with this motion.  I have no <Col N="530" /> doubt that they are all very anxious that we should discover, in so far as it is possible to do so, the truth of what happened at Bantry.  I feel, from the various remarks made by Senators, they are satisfied that the tribunal of inquiry which we are now setting up has the necessary wide-ranging scope to enable it to make the best possible effort to discover the truth of what happened.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the opening remarks of Senator Markey and those of the other Senators.  They commended the work done by the various bodies who were involved in the arduous tasks both at the time of the explosion and subsequent to it.  The only word I can use to describe the co-operation which existed between all of the parties involved is &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo;.  Senator Markey referred to the preliminary inquiry.  I expect to have a report of the preliminary inquiry very soon.  Senators will appreciate that the main purpose of a preliminary inquiry into a shipping casualty in the normal case is to advise me, as the responsible Minister, on whether a public inquiry is necessary.  In this case, because of the nature of the disaster, I decided at a very early stage to have a public inquiry, so the report of the preliminary inquiry will have less significance than it might have in another case.  I assure the Senators that the statements and evidence collected by the officer holding the preliminary inquiry and his report will be made available to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>With regard to communications with Bantry, I would like to put on record that the communications system worked exceptionally well in the period immediately after the disaster.  The Seanad can be assured that all the facilities necessary to ensure the highest standards of communications will be provided at the inquiry, for those attending and interested in it.  We will make special facilities available to Bantry for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators referred to the anti-pollution operations.  These were carried out efficiently and thoroughly.  They were closely supervised by the Government Departments concerned and by Cork County Council through the control centre we had set up at Bantry.  The use of dispersants was strictly controlled <Col N="531" /> and I am advised that the threat to fisheries and wildlife was kept to a minimum.  I understand that the use of low-flying aircraft to spray the dispersant worked effectively.  This was a unique feature of the anti-pollution operations at Bantry and I am informed that it has considerable advantages over spraying from boats.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Senators for their approach to this.  In their approach to the inquiry the Government gave the most detailed consideration to matters relating to its scope and effectiveness. The legislation governing the holding of tribunals of inquiry has been amended to provide the tribunal with the necessary statutory powers to perform its functions. We are now arming it with terms of reference which are of sufficient scope and precision so as to leave no doubt in anybody's mind of the determination of the Government to seek the truth of this terrible disaster.  From the beginning, the Government have been acutely aware of their obligations in that regard to those who died, to those who were bereaved and to those who will continue to work on tankers and at oil terminals.</P>

    <Title>Health Contributions Bill, 1978: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is designed to give effect to the decision of the Government to replace the present scheme of flat-rate health contributions by an income-related scheme of contributions and, subject to certain specified exemptions, to extend the obligation to pay health contributions to all those who have an income and are over 16 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle underlying the new scheme is that the payments will be assessed on an income-related basis, where appropriate, and, in the case of farmers generally on a notional income basis using a multiplier related to land valuation. As compared with the flat-rate contribution system it will work out in a fairer <Col N="532" /> way for those on low incomes and, in the case of farmers, for those with farms which are in the lower valuation classification.</P>
    <P>A substantial group of the population will not be obliged to pay any health contributions, such as widows with social welfare pensions and others who are listed in section 11 (2) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Neither will persons with medical cards be obliged to pay health contributions but the existing liability of the employers of such persons to pay health contributions on their behalf will be continued. This employer's liability will also extend to persons with agricultural employees and to those who employ female domestics.</P>
    <P>The decision to extend liability for the payment of health contributions to all those who have an income and are over 16 years of age, with certain specific exemptions, follows logically from the decision of the Government to extend entitlement to further health services to the community generally.</P>
    <P>The most important of the new benefits is the right to free in-patient and out-patient services in public hospitals. This will include the services of consultants except where a person's income exceeds the ceiling, which for the year commencing next April will be £5,500. In addition, the benefits of the drug refund scheme will be extended to everybody.  Those who have medical cards will, of course, continue to have medicines and drugs provided free.  The regulations providing for the extended benefits will be made under the Health Act, 1970, and will be submitted to the House in the near future.</P>
    <P>The ceiling for health contributions specified in the Bill is £5,000.  That ceiling is identical with that fixed for social insurance contributions in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978, as both ceilings must be the same to meet the needs of the collection machinery. The ceiling was recommended by an inter-departmental working party which investigated very comprehensively the problems associated with the introduction of fully pay-related social insurance, health and redundancy contributions. The figure was calculated on the basis of the latest information then available on <Col N="533" /> the average earnings in the transportable goods industries, but using a multiplier of 1½ to arrive at an appropriate ceiling. The purpose of using the multiplier of 1½ was to ensure that the ceiling would encompass the earnings of the vast majority of workers.  Certain changes have taken place in the average earnings in the transportable goods industries since the working party reported and, as I have already announced, I intend to make regulations after the enactment of the Bill to fix the ceiling at £5,500.  The power to make regulations to vary the ceiling is contained in section 9 of the Bill.  The ceiling will not be static and will be reviewed from time to time taking into account the latest information available regarding the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries. I wish to stress, however, that the ceiling which will apply from April next for the purposes of determination of eligibility for consultant services will be the income accruing in the year ending on 5 April 1979, and not in the year commencing on 6 April 1979.</P>
    <P>The rate of contribution specified in the Bill is 1 per cent.  With a ceiling of £5,500 this would involve a maximum contribution of £55 per annum.  The present flat rate contribution is £24 a year. If no change was being made in the existing arrangements regarding eligibility for services and if there were no proposals for the extension of health benefits, the £24 rate would probably have had to be increased in any event to take account of the cost increases in the existing limited eligibility services. The new rate required would probably have been of the order of £32.  The decision to extend liability to the community as a whole to pay health contributions and to provide further health benefits has a further impact on the amount required to be raised in health contributions. There have been substantial cost increases in other sections of the health services apart from the hospital services and the new health benefits will cost a substantial amount in 1979.  The income related scheme will ensure, however, that where they have to pay, those on lower incomes will be paying less than they would have paid if the flat-rate contributions had been increased to take account <Col N="534" /> of all the factors to which I have referred. Again, as I mentioned earlier, substantial numbers of persons in the lower income brackets will not be paying at all.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that if the scheme of contributions provided for in the Bill had been in operation from 1 January 1979, the income that would have accrued over the whole of 1979 would be about £30 million.</P>
    <P>As the scheme is not scheduled to come into operation until next month the total estimated income from health contributions for 1979 is £26.6 million, including about £4.1 million which it is anticipated will be forthcoming from the existing scheme of flat-rate contributions in the period from January-March.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that further income totalling about £700,000 will be received as a result of raising the ceiling from £5,000 to £5,500.  This addition would raise the estimated yield from health contributions in 1979 to about £27.3 million.</P>
    <P>The additional revenue that will accrue in 1979 over 1978 as a result of the introduction of income related contributions will amount to about £10¾ million. While it is not possible to be completely precise as to the cost in 1979 of all the elements provided for in the range of extended benefits to be introduced from 6 April next, it is estimated that they will absorb practically all the additional resources which will become available.</P>
    <P>The increasing cost of health services is, of course, a matter for concern.  The problem is not peculiar to this country. All countries, whether developed or developing, face the same difficulty.  Efforts at cost containment have been and will continue to be made, but much more is required.  It is not only a matter of looking for solutions within the services as they are now organised with the main emphasis on curative aspects.  A more radical approach is necessary not only from the economic viewpoint but in the interests of producing a healthier nation. A major contribution to improving the overall situation can be made by devoting ever-increasing attention to health education and preventive measures.  We have made a significant start on these fronts but it is essential that the impetus of the campaigns <Col N="535" /> should be maintained.  There must be no let up in the efforts to persuade people that they can do quite a lot to improve their own health status.</P>
    <P>Our health education campaigns have so far been concentrating mainly on controlling the abuse of alcohol, pinpointing the dangers of cigarette smoking and improving the standards of hygiene.  We have also embarked on a major campaign to cut down on the use of drugs and medicines where they are not medically necessary.  Many of the modern most lethal diseases have their origins in factors related to life style. Prevention rather than belated attempts to cure should be the guiding rule.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that so many believe that drugs can cure almost every ailment. There is no denying that they have made highly significant contributions in support of the advance of medical science but resorting to them for even trivial ailments is both unnecessary, uneconomic and sometimes damaging.  The amount spent on drugs and the volume of consumption is increasing annually at a rate that must be regarded as alarming. As I mentioned at the recent international symposium on &ldquo;Alternatives to Drugs&rdquo; it is estimated that we will be spending about £35 million on drugs in the health services in 1979.  It has been shown that a very considerable amount of the drugs prescribed are not eventually used by patients.  The wasted moneys could be put to far better use in other branches of the health services.  I am arranging for a nationwide publicity drive in the media to focus attention on the situation and a commencement will be made in the near future.  The wholehearted support of the medical profession has been forthcoming and I am confident that a sustained effort will produce worth-while results.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of overall costs and the need for the making of increased direct contributions towards the cost of services, I would point out that the Exchequer contribution towards the cost of health services in 1979 is about £419 millions&mdash;£79 million more than was provided for in the Estimates for 1978.  The estimated total net cost of <Col N="536" /> health services in 1979 is about £453 million.  I have already mentioned that the estimated income from health contributions in 1979 is £27.3 millions.  That figure represents only about 6 per cent of the total estimated net cost of the services in 1979.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill indicates that for the purposes of collection the community will be divided into three groupings. In the case of employees the collection of health contributions will be integrated with the collection of social insurance contributions through the PAYE system.  It would be extremely wasteful to set up special machinery for the collection of health contributions separately from social insurance contributions. Employers will benefit from the system as administration will be simplified.  They will also benefit in that the dangers in the handling and custody of insurance stamps, which included provision for the health contributions of employees, will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will also look after the arrangements for the collection of health contributions from the self-employed, from persons with investment income and from a limited group of farmers who have other trades or professions and who are directly assessable for income tax.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners being so closely involved in the collection arrangements will have available to them considerable data regarding health contributions and the reckonable income, earnings or emoluments of individuals in respect of whom health contributions are payable.  It is necessary that this information should be made available to my Department and to health boards as far as this is found to be necessary for the purposes of the administration not only of the Health Contributions Bill but also of the Health Act, 1970.  Section 14 of the Bill makes provision accordingly.</P>
    <P>In the case of farmers generally the regulations to be made under the Bill will provide that the collection of health contributions will be a function of the health boards as it is at present.  The amount of health contributions payable will be determined on total income from all sources, including farm income assessed <Col N="537" /> on a notional basis using a multiplier related to valuations and the ceiling of £5,500.  The systems in operation for the collection of contributions from farmers are being redesigned and strengthened with a view to improving the collection rate.</P>
    <P>Senators will have seen the press notices, publicity and commentaries on the new schemes being offered by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I would like to draw special attention to the low-cost scheme for consultant cover which the board will be introducing as from next month to coincide with the introduction of the new health benefits scheme.  This special scheme will be of particular interest to those who wish to avail of free maintenance at public ward level in public hospitals and who will not be entitled to free services of consultants. The scheme will provide for cover against the cost of consultant services associated with treatment at hospital level, maternity benefits, a relaxation of the existing rules governing payments in respect of day surgery and where miscarriages are involved, provision for special nursing and for cases requiring convalescent care.</P>
    <P>The scheme will allow for a relaxation of existing entry restrictions regarding previous medical history.  There will be no entry age limit or no waiting period as regards elegibility for benefits.  The age loading for persons over 60 years of age will disappear.  Provision will be made for payments by instalments.</P>
    <P>The premiums payable will enable the biggest families to be covered for consultant services for somewhat less than £33 per annum which, for persons paying the standard rate of income tax, will mean a net payment of about £22.  The cost for a single person will be less than £11 per annum, before allowance is made for income tax concessions.  I should, perhaps, emphasise that this low-cost scheme for consultant cover will be available to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I commend the board for the very attractive scheme they have produced, and I would strongly recommend the scheme to all those who may need cover for consultant services.</P>
    <P>I might also point out should the circumstances in individual cases present <Col N="538" /> difficulties the existing hardship clause will continue to operate.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the main elements of the Bill and certain other relevant matters associated with the new health benefits scheme.  There may, however, be other matters which I have not dealt with on which Senators may desire to have information and which may not be covered in the explanatory memorandum. If so, I will give further explanations when replying.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the income ceiling in this Bill is similar to the ceiling in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act which we discussed here some time ago.  I remember saying on that occasion that the principal advantage of that Bill was that it streamlined the collection of social welfare contributions.  The same thing can be said in relation to the present Bill. It ensures the collection of more money from more people.  This money will come into the Exchequer on a regular basis throughout the year, which is an improvement on the old system in which stamps were usually paid at the end of each year.  The ideal would be to have a comprehensive national health cover for all our people.  This Bill is a step towards achieving that objective, and I welcome it.  It goes part of the way, but it does not go all the way.  In so far as it is an indication that the Minister is working towards that ideal, I commend the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reservations about the cover that is being provided for some people. Three categories of people will benefit when this Bill becomes law.  First, people with medical cards will qualify for free health services.  The second category are those whose incomes do not exceed £5,500 per year and farmers with a PLV of less than £60 per year.  Wage and salary earners will pay 1 per cent of their incomes to a maximum of £55 per year which compares with the existing flat rate contribution of £24.  The people in this category will receive free maintenance but they must pay medical costs, consultants' fees and maternity costs.  In relation to the first category, those who qualify for medical cards and <Col N="539" /> pensioners, who are the weakest and most deserving of all, they are a steadily diminishing group.  Is the Minister aware that several thousand people in the west have lost their medical cards in the past few months?  The loss of these medical cards has, in cases that I am aware of, resulted in hardship and unhappiness for the families concerned.  Is he aware that this campaign is continuing?  Is it taking place with his knowledge, and will he accept that it is causing hardship?</P>
    <P>If so, will he therefore assure the House that he will call a halt to this campaign for the removal of medical cards and ensure that borderline cases are treated with sympathy?</P>
    <P>With regard to the second category of people, those whose incomes are less than £5,500 per year, in the past they had a limit of about £3,000.  This limit existed for some time.  At face value, it would appear that the increase to £5,500 is pretty generous.  When account is taken of the effect of inflation on wage and salary increases and increased hospital costs, not many extra people will benefit as compared with the numbers that came into benefit when the £3,000 limit was originally introduced. Perhaps there are figures to show what the extra numbers will be in comparison with the numbers who benefited when the £3,000 limit was first introduced. For the majority of people within this income bracket the Bill represents an increase in the health contribution.  Insured people have been paying at the rate of 50p per week, or £26 per annum, and all now earning up to £55 per week will have their contributions increased from £24 per annum to £55, which is at the top of the scale, more than double the contribution.  Many of them will be paying an increased contribution and will not be receiving a corresponding increase in benefits.</P>
    <P>One of the reservations I have in regard to the third category, those who earn over £5,500 per annum and farmers with PLVs over £60, is that their entitlement is limited to free hospital beds and maintenance.  They must pay for all additional medical expenses, consultants' fees, maternity costs and so on. <Col N="540" /> The ceiling of £5,500 is too low.  When we see the 1979 wage settlements many manual and non-manual workers will find that they have passed that limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not be affected by this provision.  Income up to 6 April 1979 will govern eligibility for the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>When we come to the following year, is it the Minister's intention to adjust the limits?  The figure of £5,500 will represent quite a sudden cutoff for some people.  Could he not have considered a phasing or a grading at that point?  Let us consider the case of two neighbours, one with an income of £5,499 and the other an income of £5,501.  The man who has £1 over the limit and who is suddenly cut off is paying a severe penalty for a difference in income of £2.</P>
      <P>The reservations that I have expressed do not mean I am not prepared to admit that there are certain good points in the Bill.  I believe it represents a step on the road to the provision of a comprehensive health service for all our citizens.  It now includes the non-manual worker who earns between £3,000 and £5,500 and it streamlines the health services.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the enormous cost of our health services. I should like to conclude by again drawing attention to the fact that in 1979 something like £453 million will be spent in providing health services.  It is a vast sum to service a vast machine but, of course, we are dealing with the health, well-being and the lives of all our people. Because of that we all accept that it is vital that this machine operates smoothly and effectively.  It is vital that all involved in that service play a full and unstinted role.  In the final analysis, the buck stops on the Minister's desk.  The Bill represents a short step towards the provision of a comprehensive national health service.  I wish it well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on the changes he has made, which are a step in the right direction.  Firstly, we have the general change over several Bills in the pay-related payments which, in itself, should <Col N="541" /> rationalise administration, save administration costs and make things easier for those who have payments to make.  Secondly, I congratulate him on working out a system where there is more equalisation and fairer treatment. The pay-related system means that the burden of cost is spread more equitably in that it is partially taken off the lower paid and allows those more capable of paying to pay their share.  The scheme will probably be simpler for hospitals because they will know that all patients are covered to general ward standard.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister in his approach to preventive medicine, especially in relation to the use of drugs.  I hope he is successful in pointing out that drugs merely treat the symptoms not the disease.</P>
      <P>We already know that the VHI will cover consultants' charges for those who are not already covered and will allow those who wish to have semi-private and private accommodation to pay for the reasonable cost through the VHI.  I have always accepted that the VHI is an excellent service.  I have no doubt that it will continue to be so.  I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on his approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister adhered to a ceiling in the development of a national health service. The aspiration of the trade union movement and of the Labour Party is for a free national health service for every citizen.  In the absence of such a service the two queues will continue&mdash;one for the national health service and one for the private service.  This creates many problems of which, I am sure, the Minister is aware.  Nevertheless, the raising of the limit from £3,000 to £5,500 is inadequate.  The ICTU have been looking for a ceiling of £8,000 to £9,000.  This figure creates problems for a substantial number of workers.  During the existence of this State the insured manual worker and his dependants never had a ceiling in relation to free health services.  For the first time this legislation is putting a curb on such people and will expose them and their dependants to consultancy fees when they exceed £5,500.  This is a retrograde step in that their existing rights which <Col N="542" /> they have carried will be terminated.</P>
      <P>In regard to non-manual workers, public service workers and so on, there was the system of voluntary social welfare contributions.  I should like to know whether this legislation proposes to discontinue the services to which these people had an entitlement from the contributions they were making.  I am sure some unions have been in contact with the Minister in relation to this matter. This is of major concern to many trade unions, especially the unions that cater for non-manual and public service employees who had exceeded the ceiling of £3,000 and opted for voluntary contributions.</P>
      <P>In regard to the figure of £5,500, there is no flexibility for the single person or the family with 10 children.  All have the same level of dependency.  Therefore, if the person with the higher number of dependants exceeds the ceiling he is exposed to consultancy and other fees.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the responsibility of the family doctor.  I am sure the Minister has, as has every public representative, received representations in regard to substantial bills from private hospitals for patients who were entitled to health authority hospitalisation. We should feel proud of the standard of service of our health boards. They are capable of dealing with every situation that arises in our health services. Family doctors still think that better treatment can be obtained in voluntary and private institutions that do not accept patients as health authority patients.  While this option must remain the right of every citizen, family doctors should advise patients of the financial impact should they choose to enter a private hospital for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About two weeks ago an unfortunate medical card holder was presented with a bill in excess of £500 for a period in hospital.  I asked him to get an explanation from his doctor for the charge.  He said the doctor was unable to get him a bed in a cardiac intensive-care unit in one of the health board hospitals.  On a subsequent checking with the hospital in the area I found that this was not right. At the time of illness patients or their relatives should be advised of the impact of such charges.  It is wrong that people <Col N="543" /> are exposed to these costs.  They seek help from their public representatives and the health boards who cannot do anything to reduce or even eliminate the cost.</P>
    <P>There is ignorance of the rights of the community to the free health services.  In hospital waiting rooms, public libraries and all public institutions, either by leaflet or poster, full publicity should be given to entitlements, and the consequences of choosing private hospitals. The family doctor should be responsible for advising patients in regard to hospitalisation.  Much emphasis has been put by the Minister and others on the contribution of voluntary health in the advancement of the health services.  One problem with the VHI is that they refused admission to people with medical and psychiatric problems.  This is a very serious omission on their part. A medical or psychiatric history can have a tremendous impact on a person's income.  I am sure he will continue to review the situation in regard to the lifting of these ceilings and have a further look at the position of the insured worker to date and what his position will be after 1 April.  I should also like the Minister to have a look at the position of the people who have opted for the voluntary social welfare contributions, which was a tremendous way of continuing the social insurance factor in our health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on doing his very best to ensure that people will look after themselves.  That is the essence of all health preventive measures: it is much better to prevent it than to cure it in a more costly exercise afterwards.</P>
      <P>This scheme is like all other schemes, it is good and bad, but in my opinion it is more good than bad.  A bigger number of people will be much happier once 1 April comes.  It brings us nearer to the situation where there will be more people eligible for free hospitalisation, which is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise a number of <Col N="544" /> points which the Minister might clarify. First is the application of liability to persons from 16 years upwards.  Obviously, a lot of young people at that age would not be earning very much money and one would have hoped that the system we now have under which persons who are not employed between the ages of 16 years and 18 years automatically get medical cards would apply to lower paid juvenile workers. There would be a fair amount of hardship on a large family with persons in that category.  Admittedly, in any family you would probably have only one or two in that category, but where you have a big family, the cost will be more than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning is that all income earners, irrespective of whom they are, will have to contribute. That is fair in so far as the free hospitalisation scheme is being spread to that category, but manual and clerical workers earning more than £5,500 will not receive a return for their contributions other than the free hospitalisation and drugs refund and so on.  This brings us to the point that has been mentioned here before, that they may have fairly considerable consultants' fees.  Anybody in that category will not like that angle of the scheme.  Given the restraints on the budget, we cannot legislate for everybody, but at the same time I am happy to see that the drug refund scheme is an important factor in this area.</P>
    <P>Another very important factor is the whole position of medical card holders.  I represent a western area where there is a higher number of medical cards per thousand of the population than anywhere else.  I understand from a Dáil question that 24,000 medical cards were withdrawn in the period from July to September 1978.  That is a remarkable number by any standards.  A very hard look must be taken by the Minister and the health board at the eligibility pattern for medical cards, taking into account inflation and the cost of living.  There is a big difference for a small landholder with a £10 or £12 valuation and a county council worker or a forestry worker earning £47 or £50 with a young family. A very hard look must be taken at this in <Col N="545" /> the light of 1979 family costs.  There is severe hardship in some cases and this is something I spend a lot of my time with. If you take a farmer with £12 or £13 valuation with five or six young children, with the standards as they now are, it is quite possible that he will not be entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <P>While I am on this subject, I should like to ask the Minister what health contribution would a farmer on £12 valuation have to pay?  How is it assessed?  It is a very important point.  When you consider that a recent farm management survey by the Agricultural Institute found that 25 per cent of farmers had an income averaging £1,500 a year or £30 per week, one can see immediately that it is vitally important the medical card scheme would be extended in line with inflation costs and so on.  There is a certain period in the life of any family when they want the greatest help and that is when the children are small, whether in town or country.  The family doctor could cost £2, £3, £4 or £5 per visit. Prescriptions to the chemist, even for a child, might be anything from £4 to £6 or £7.  There is no way that people on that type of income can put up with that. I ask the Minister, through the Department and the health boards, to take a long look at the eligibility threshold for medical cards.</P>
    <P>In all matters dealing with health concerning the low income groups, it is vitally important that at the stage when the family budget is most expensive every possible help in medical terms should be given to them.</P>
    <P>I notice that the ceiling of £5,500 has been calculated at one-and-a-half times the average industrial earnings at a certain date.  I assume that that is a fair and reasonable way to do it.  I also notice that the Minister is putting a fair amount of emphasis on the fact that this ceiling will be reviewed as the years go by.  That is very important because, if the wage demands being looked for are to be met in the next few months, that figure will be much higher this time next year.</P>
    <P>The position of fee paying patients getting priority over non-paying patients is something which we come across as public representatives quite often.  There are a great number of people who believe <Col N="546" /> that to be true.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on this, because if any educational exercise is to be undertaken there would be a major plank on this: that if you are entitled to a certain thing, you will get it and it does not make any difference who is paying for what.</P>
    <P>Another important point I would bring to the Minister's attention is the collection of the contribution from farmers. This will be a very difficult thing to do, but I must say that since the £7 health contribution scheme was introduced in 1972 many people did not know whether they had a statutory obligation to pay it. It turned out that a lot of people paid it the first and second year, but for some unknown reason they did not pay it thereafter.</P>
    <P>I would make a suggestion to the Minister that just might work.  We have rate collectors in every county and by virtue of the decision of this Government to abolish rates they have not an awful lot to do.  From the introduction of the new health scheme on 1 April it should become clear through the media by the health boards and the other bodies concerned, that a certain section of farmers are included, people who are ineligible for medical cards and so on.  I find a fair amount of ignorance among the farming population as to what they are supposed to get or to what they are supposed to contribute.  It is something like what Senator Moynihan was speaking about a few minutes ago.</P>
    <P>At this stage an unusual problem has cropped up now for the health boards, particularly the Western Health Board with which I am most acquainted.  It is that many farmers have &ldquo;copped on&rdquo; to the idea, and &ldquo;copped on&rdquo; the hard way when somebody belonging to them was hospitalised and they were billed for it but they had not medical cards.  A number of those people incurred arrears over the years.  The Minister has mentioned the figure of 70 per cent intake.  I would not have thought it was that high. I would have thought that it would have been far less than 70 per cent.  If it is possible within the law, a deal should be made, as is their right, that they pay their contribution through the rate collectors as from 1 April and that all the <Col N="547" /> arrears that might have been there before will be scrapped.  It should be a statutory obligation if a person fails to pay he would be in serious trouble.  A few thousand pounds might not be collected, but most people would pay and they would be much happier to know that they are actually covered for their hospital bills.  It is something the Minister might look at.  The arrears, though not high, represent a stumbling block and the health boards are inclined to say: We will admit you to the scheme but you must pay for the years you did not pay for before now.  Maybe with a new sheet and ensuring that everybody pays would be better for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Can anything be done from a price control point of view about drugs?  As an ordinary paying citizen I am amazed at the difference in prices of drugs between one place and another and indeed the price of drugs in one place at different times.  I often wonder why in a consumer age, when so many people are so price conscious, it is not possible that the Prices Commission or an allied body of some type to inquire into this whole area and perhaps control prices.  I do not believe for a moment that drugs should be as costly as they appear to be.  Maybe it has something to do with wholesale and retail trades.  The Minister would be doing the people, and indeed his Department, a great benefit if he could stop profiteering in the drugs business, that is, if there is as much profiteering as I think there is.  I must compliment the Minister on his fitness-for-all programmes.  That is a very good development.  As he has been quoted as saying, people are unaware of the aids that can be used without drugs to make them feel better, to work better and feel happier.  It is important that health programmes be launched on television and radio.  It is important that a greater emphasis be placed on the things we have for free in this country, such as our clear air and our methods of leisure and so on, so that we can become a healthier race.  I congratulate the Minister on the line that he has taken on this, and hope that in the future people will be able to look after themselves better and not have the State <Col N="548" /> doing it for them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, and it is a good Bill.  There are things in it I should like to see changed.  I ask the Minister again to take note of the medical card situation and particularly the farmers' contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the general welcome which this Bill seems to be so rightly getting.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and on his general approach to the problems of health.</P>
      <P>The principle of the Bill is a worthwhile one.  It proposes to change the whole system of flat rate contributions to an income related scheme of contributions, and accompanying them with some important and necessary safeguards.  This should make the scheme a great deal fairer in its impact generally on people, allowing for the fact that you have these very proper exemptions for some people, such as widows and social welfare pensioners and so on.</P>
      <P>The ceiling which has been set is in present circumstances a reasonable one. I am sure we should all like to see it a good deal higher but one has to decide on some figure; and this, using the one-and-a-half multiplier, seems to be a reasonable one.  Perhaps even more important is the fact that the Minister is taking the power in section 9 to make regulations to vary the ceiling.  This means that one has very effective control and will be able to increase it when necessary, if and when it is possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yield from this Bill however, is not likely, despite all this, greatly to contribute to the costs of health services. We talk a lot about the large figures involved and yet I do not think we fully appreciate just how enormous they have become.  It is, perhaps, the enormity of the figures which begins to leave us totally uncomprehending: demands for another £400 million or £500 million almost seems to be incomprehensible.  In simple terms, the figure which we have here of £459 million is four and a half times what the entire budget for the country was a short number of years ago.  It represents an enormous percentage of total Government expenditure in <Col N="549" /> the current budget.  If you run through the various items of account which we looked at earlier, there are two figures which by their enormity dwarf all the other figures in the budget.  One of these is social welfare and the other the health budget.  Unfortunately there is no way in which the amounts required for health can be effectively reduced, nor would we wish to do so, because if there are methods of treatment, personnel and so on available which would increase the health of our citizens, we would wish to avail of these to the maximum extent.  As the Minister has suggested, the escalation of health costs is a problem which not only poor countries find difficult in coping with, but for which even the wealthiest countries have not found an effective answer.  Nor is there likely to be a full answer in the immediate future, because the scope for increase is openended whereas the revenues and the means to pay those increases are strictly limited.</P>
    <P>So it is a question of getting the best possible value we can out of our health services.  Unfortunately, for many years this has been not just a problem for this country but a global one, and by and large the attitude of Governments has been to try to limit expenditure and to cut down expenditure in various ways, as Senator Moynihan implied, often in ways which bear very hard on particular sections of the community.  In effect, people are rationed, and inevitably such systems can cut very unfairly on individuals involved.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome this, in effect, new approach of the Minister, a greatly neglected approach until now, of trying to emphasise health education and preventive medicine.  It is not the whole answer, but it goes a long way towards providing part of the answer.  Many of our ills are self-inflicted, and a relatively tiny amount of money can do much good in preventing illness, by keeping people healthy instead of trying to lock the stable door afterwards.  This is an enormous advance, and one which I welcome and which is very important.</P>
    <P>The second aspect is to try and get the best value we possibly can when we are spending money.  Here again the Minister has brought in a new and much <Col N="550" /> needed approach, looking at these things on a sensible financial basis and seeing where the maximum benefit can be got for the expenditures which, vast though they are, nevertheless are limited.  We cannot spend money on everything.  We have to select and try to get the best value possible.</P>
    <P>One of the lines which the Minister is using is in relation to drugs.  One welcomes his campaign but in some ways one would be inclined to wonder if it could not go a little further.  As the Minister rightly stated, many drugs are not used, many are used for trivial purposes. I wonder should the health services, the State, be providing free drugs such as tranquillisers&mdash;a very large proportion of the health budget goes to these types of drugs.  It seems to be a pity that we provide free drugs of that nature, on which very considerable sums of money are spent and yet we are finding ourselves limited in regard to much more vital and beneficial aspects of the health services.  One would like to see this at least considered, even if there are difficulties about this.</P>
    <P>Senator Moynihan referred to a particular case.  I hope he would agree that by and large, doctors, and in particular family practitioners, most of my colleagues who are in family practice, give a great deal of care and attention to their patients.  In many cases they go perhaps beyond the call of duty in consideration of what the financial impact will be of the advice they are giving.  Many of my colleagues take a great deal of trouble to see that the financial impact of illness on their patients is limited in so far as they can advise or help.  I would like to pay a tribute to our family practitioner services. We get very good value for money there.  We have very good and devoted doctors, nurses, medical laboratory workers.  Generally it is one of the things we are very lucky to have.  I am sure it makes the Minister's difficult task a lot easier that he has such good backup by the people involved in delivering the medical services.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are bringing in this new low cost treatment benefit scheme.  I welcome it very much.  I am glad to see VHI has taken a very <Col N="551" /> enlightened attitude and I hope that anything that can be done by the VHI will be supported by the Minister so that it be done on a cost-conscious basis with the object of getting the maximum benefit to the patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction&mdash;that of providing fuller health servies.  Access to the health services at present is that 40 per cent of the population are covered by medical cards.  About 85 per cent are covered by limited eligibility for hospital services.  That situation has given rise to a lot of anomalies and inconsistencies in the area of manual and non-manual workers.  In effect, we had a barrier raised against a very large number of the population who were not in a position to pay privately, and this possibly resulted in a lot of people not having sought public medical treatment because they could not afford to do so.  We talk a lot about education and prevention, but this situation has to be guarded against: we must take the steps quickly to avoid a development of that situation.  This Bill will help to prevent further such anomalies developing.</P>
      <P>On the question of eligibility limits the Irish Congress of Trade Unions felt that £9,000 would be a much more realistic figure.  They probably based that on their assessment of the total situation.  It looks as if they are arguing that the amount be almost doubled.  I know the problems that lie in that direction, but overall I am wondering if the suggested increase in the limit would affect any more than 35,000 more people.  What would the cost factor be in that situation?  I do not think if the eligibility limit could be raised it would have any effect on the VHI new low cost scheme. There would still be a substantial number of people who would have to take advantage of that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is the type of person who would like to see a strategy in the development of free health services.  I know this is not possible at present and a lot of people would rather see a situation of contributions to these services.  In the long term it could mean the beginning of <Col N="552" /> a strategy towards the implementation of a free health service, a free drug service and a free GP service.  At this particular time I do not think that this is a realistic proposition, but in the long term it could well be, if other factors were taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the Labour Party did an estimate and they reckoned that a phasingin of a free national health service would cost about £75 million at 1977 prices.  I do not know how accurate these figures are.  This would mean spending about £12,500 million each year, in the phasing-in period.  It does not seem all that improbable in the very long term.  I think this is the desire of most people; it is not an idealogical matter.</P>
    <P>The fundamental objective should be the establishment of a free comprehensive system for all citizens, free of discrimination, and we have discrimination at the moment.  Health care is a fundamental human right and there should not be any situation where cost prevents people from availing of health care.  The development of the medical card scheme alleviates things a great deal, but I still think that health problems can cause financial stress for a lot of people, having regard to the ceiling of the income relating to medical cards.  As a test whether or not people are being discriminated against and whether people can avail of the health services, it might be a good idea to see if the health standards of our society are equal.  An exercise was done in England and it was found that health standards were savagely unequal.  It is likely that we could have a similar situation here, which I do not think the Minister would want.</P>
    <P>Over the next 30 years the health services should continue with the collection of compulsory contributions through the employer, but with an overall working towards the objective to narrow substantially, or eliminate, the gap in health standards between both parts of Ireland and between the social classes.  In present circumstances I am not quibbling, and neither is anyone else, about payment. At the moment the quibble seems to be that there are not enough people brought into the hospital services.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the point about <Col N="553" /> whether there is discrimination, the mortality rate is usually a good indicator with regard to health standards.  In the area of infant mortality, we might find that discrimination manifests itself in the sense that the infant mortality rate is much higher in the lower paid income groups than in the other social classes. There is not sufficient information available on mortality statistics generally, and there should be.  What is the distinction between the mortality rates of the various social classes?  Probably the only way this exercise could be done would be to work right through all the age groups up to 65 years and see what the position is.</P>
    <P>In Britain, where most of the people are working class, government is by a system rather similar to our own.  A survey in Scotland over a 50-year period showed that there was a big distinction between the medical and health care services given to the different social classes and that there was no narrowing of the gap over that 50-year period.  When we consider that this survey was done at a time when the national health service and the welfare state were in existence, it is something worth thinking about.  I wonder if a similar survey would not reveal defects in our system.</P>
    <P>In my view educational programmes cannot, of themselves, prevent self-inflicted ill health.  In this area, I must compliment the Minister on his initiative in making people more health conscious. I agree with Senator Conroy that there is a lot more to be done, but there has been a beginning, and that is a good thing.  I hope the legislation meets with the success it deserves.  We need more information. There may be intolerable differences, but if they lie deep in the fabric of the society in which we live, then we must not accept this situation and must come up with remedies.  If we find, for example, that problems are caused by poverty or by environment, we must look at the whole question of how we can provide the service, what the necessary contribution must be and what action may be needed to eliminate some of the existing problems.  A lot of research has been done on the medical side but we do not seem to get benefit from it: what problems cause health difficulties <Col N="554" /> and so on and what kind of service can be provided to overcome that?</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister.  The idea of health education and prevention of ill health has been developed by him.  He should get the reward he deserves for taking this initiative, it is not an easy job. Do health and occupations come into it? What are the factors?  The initiative taken by the Minister must be supplemented by other research, particularly in the area of the patients' needs and away from the doctor's needs.  Research at present is directed more towards hospitals, but there is no effective research that I know of on the cause and effect of occupational diseases, for instance. However, I am open to correction on that.  I do not mind being corrected if in fact some research has been done.</P>
    <P>We are still dealing with the area of prevention, education and so on.  If the GP's area is too remote, how does his service connect up with the hospital services? Is the kind of work the GPs do too narrow?  Are their surgeries adequately equipped?  When we are talking about prevention, we must look at these things.  What type of consultations are given?  Are they too short?  Are the GPs not good contributors towards the health services?  After all, we are talking about contributors in more than one way.  We are talking about people who contribute to a good service by actual deed and by their reaction to the realities of the situation. It is not just about people who pay for the service.  On that side of it, can we get any information from the GPs' records that would help on the question of prevention and health education?  This is relevant, because we are talking about a free hospital service, about prevention and about the whole question of good health habits and making people less dependent on the health services.</P>
    <P>Very substantial revenue accrues from compulsory contributions through employers.  I have, however, one question on the income limits and it is this. When contributions are subject to an income limit does this make the financing of the system less equitable than taxation? If it is not equitable with the taxation system, how can you avoid the unequal distribution of resources and establish <Col N="555" /> priorities?  I welcome the initiatives the Minister has taken and hope the specific steps taken in the Health Contributions Bill will be developed and that supplementary research will take place.</P>
    <P>Finally, my reading of the Bill may not be correct, but I see a problem where people are on early retirement and do not receive any unemployment benefit, where they sign for credits but are in receipt of a pension from their company, I assume that, since they were contributors under the old system, they will come under the new system.  Will they have to pay contributions out of their pension from the company in order to pay for the improved health standards? It is important to have this information because these people might have to join the VHI scheme for further services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make some comparisons between the health services at present and how they will operate when this Bill becomes law.  As we know, medical card holders make no contribution to the health services at present but are entitled to all health services free of charge.  At present, under the Health Contributions Act, 1970, the middle income group make a contribution, the self-employed pay £24 per year and an insured person pays 50p per week.  Under the new Bill, medical card holders will make no contribution as heretofore, but people whose incomes do not exceed £5,000 a year will contribute on the basis of 1 per cent of their earnings. They will be entitled to free hospital services, hospital beds, hospital maintenance and medical, surgical and consultants' fees.  Taking into account inflation and the fact that the cost of hospital services and maintenance has increased tremendously over the past few years, the increase here from £3,000 to £5,000 is small and it will not bring many extra people into this scheme.  In the case of people whose earnings are more than £5,000 and of farmers who are over the £50 valuation, these farmers will not have to pay any more than those on £5,000 income.</P>

      <P>They will qualify for hospital beds and maintenance, but will now have to pay their own consultant.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his reply, might be able to set my mind at rest on one point. During the term of office of the Minister's predecessor, the then Minister for Health tried to introduce a scheme of a free-for-all health service, but was told by the consultants, at that time, that it could not be operated.  The major reason given on that occasion was that there would not be enough hospital beds available.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that there are now enough hospital beds available to operate this new scheme, or has the position changed dramatically over the last 18 or 20 months?  I think people earning £2,500 at present are being asked to pay a little too much.  By today's standards, with the present cost of living, £2,500 is not a very considerable amount of money.  I do not know if anything can be done about it but the contribution for that income seems to be a bit out of line.</P>
      <P>I now refer to something which has been spoken of in both Houses, which is the question of medical card holders.  We all know the health boards review income limits each January, but those in operation, even since last January, are far too low.  A married couple earning £40.50 per week are entitled to a medical card, but a married couple earning £41 per week are not so entitled.  The Minister, who takes such an interest in his Department and who is so concerned with the health of our people, would agree with me that a married couple earning £41 a week who suffer illness during the year and need the attention of a doctor cannot afford to pay for this service, pay their rent and get the bare necessities of life.  I know the income limits are decided by the CEOs of the health boards, but I would strongly urge the Minister to give a directive to those CEOs to have another look at this limit and to increase it to a more realistic figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the case of a married couple, but I am just as concerned about the single person living alone.  All the income limits are far too low.  At a meeting, about a month ago, of the Southern Board, of which I am a member, we sent <Col N="557" /> a resolution along those lines to the Minister for Health.  I would ask him to consider it very sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  I thought it was relevant to this Bill.  Up to now, a manual worker earning more than £3,000 was not covered but one earning less than £3,000 was covered.  Now, people earning more than £5,000 are not covered for consultancy fees, but those earning less are eligible.  In the case of a husband and wife who are slightly under the £5,000 limit, they will be covered for consultancy fees, for maternity, for everything under this Bill.  But in the case of a husband and wife with a family who are earning more than £5,000, they will not be covered for consultants' fees and, if I am correct, they will not be covered for maternity fees.  That is something which the Minister might reconsider.</P>
      <P>Finally, I refer to what was said in the Minister's speech about the low-cost treatment benefit scheme being offered by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  This is an excellent scheme and I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for the courtesy and help one always receives when dealing with any section of this board.  The Minister might clarify the following point for me. Previously, if people suffered from recurring illness before they entered the voluntary health scheme, they were not covered by the scheme for that illness. Do I take it that, regardless of past medical history, people will be accepted under this new low-cost scheme?</P>

The health service has changed tremendously in the 20 years during which I have been associated with the provision of health services to the public.  With the change from the local authorities to the health boards, the whole structure of health administration has changed, and this is probably the biggest leap forward that we have taken so far.</P>
      <P>The public will realise that this Bill is necessary because we are reaching the stage where a vast amount of money is being spent on health, and all of us realise that the money must come from somewhere.  Somebody must pay for it at the end of the day.  The Bill goes a good part of the way towards regularising the health service.  It clears up the position where some sections of the public were entitled to free medical service while certain income brackets had a grievance and sometimes had to pay large amounts for medical service.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision whereby we will have specialist services available free.  That is really a tremendous step forward.  Any family who have incurred medical expenses realise that this can be the biggest financial burden on a family. Almost all citizens are now absolutely assured that financial difficulties will not prevent them from getting the best treatment.</P>
      <P>I would say to the Minister that when the provisions of this Bill are being implemented all the machinery of the State and of his Department should be organised to eliminate waste at every level, whether it is excessive charges by specialists, waste of drugs, or involved with the storage or administration of drugs.  All of us realise that only by so doing will further advances be made in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated <Col N="559" /> and commended by all the people.  Those who may not support him politically have applauded him for his great crusade in the interest of the health of the country as shown by the nonsmoking campaign.  I would like to see the Minister start another crusade against the over-use of drugs and the use of drugs where it is unnecessary.  We as a nation must not copy other nations who have almost destroyed themselves by the use of drugs.  The public should be advised to guard against the over-use of drugs.  Secondly, there will be a saving that will help to extend the benefit of the health service to those most in need.</P>
    <P>If our forefathers could see the advances contained in this Bill they would find it hard to believe that the country has come so far in such a short time.  We are offering a very elaborate medical service to nearly all our people.  I am delighted that the public are made aware that there has to be a contribution.  I was very interested in the medical services introduced in the past in Britain and in Northern Ireland.  Those medical services did not call for a contribution.  The prescription cost at that time was one shilling.  However, those who introduced that type of medical service quickly realised that they made a serious mistake, because the amount of money wasted through abuse could not be calculated.  This is a totally different approach. It is a planned approach because we realise that we have to plan our budget and our expenditure to get the best results.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very commendable and a great step forward.  There are just a few areas I hope the Minister would consider. At the conclusion of his speech he said that there are areas that he will look at further.  Where people are hospitalised for a long time consideration should be given to their relatives.  Facilities should be improved for relatives where there is a problem of transport.  If somebody from my county is in a Dublin hospital, transport to and from the hospital and accommodation are a major problem. That is one aspect of the health services where I should like to see an advance.</P>
    <P>I join other Senators in complimenting <Col N="560" /> the Minister and I wish him success.  It is evident that he is one of the most successful Ministers for Health this country has had, but the onus on him is great because the public have come to expect, perhaps, a bit too much.  The Minister has the backing of the vast majority of the people in his present campaign and we accept his balanced and reasonable approach to health services.  I would encourage him to keep up the good work.</P>
    <P>I would like to see him start another campaign or crusade to prevent the over-use of drugs and to prevent doctors from over administering drugs.  The price of drugs is now enormous.  All too often there is lack of control.  GPs do not need to keep a strict record of how they prescribe drugs.  I do not know how best to approach this, but the Minister would be well advised to keep a very strict check on the use of drugs, even through some of our best GPs.  That would be a major contribution to the health of the nation.  I think that is the Minister's intention. I see this as a good Bill and a step forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the tribute to the Minister in so far as the Bill sets out to provide more medical care for a greater section of the people.  That is desirable and everybody is in favour of it.  Whatever limitations there may be are necessary because we are controlled to some degree by our wealth-earning capacity as a nation.  If we develop production and make more money for ourselves as a people, it is to be presumed that the limits with regard to health cards and so on will be raised.</P>
      <P>Without going into the maximum figure under which health cards are allowable, I would make a special plea to the Minister to ensure that there is a liberal interpretation of limited eligibility clauses.  We all know of people who are just beyond poor law valuation or just beyond the upper income limit and when they are confronted with a long period of illness it is more than they are able to bear.  Every effort should be made to be as considerate as possible in extending their eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to what the <Col N="561" /> Minister has done in launching what I might term a crusade to get people interested in their own fitness.  As the Minister said, prevention rather than belated attempts to cure should be the guiding line.  But there are many fields in which the Minister for Health will want co-operation from other Ministers if he is to get his message across.</P>
    <P>There is widespread recognition of the fact that there is an over-consumption of alcohol.  That is made easy by the ease with which people can get bar extensions in hotels.  Extensions are given for the most flimsy reasons.  A high percentage of our young people go to these functions, to which the admission charge is about £1.50.  They often indicate that they do not want to take a meal and they are then admitted to these bars on payment of £1.  That simply means that they have two or three extra hours for consuming alcohol.</P>
    <P>Recently a very prominent medical practitioner in this country drew attention to the fact that it is the concentrated drinking over the weekends from Friday to Sunday that has resulted in an enormous increase in the number of people being admitted to psychiatric hospitals for treatment of illnesses brought on by over-consumption of alcohol.  The regulation as it stood with regard to the meal provided at these functions was that a substantial meal costing not less than 50p should be served.  We all know how substantial a meal at the present time costing 50p would be.  My opinion is that the regulation should demand that a meal costing in the region of £2 should be served during these extensions.  This is a matter that has been referred to by health boards all over the country and medical people and parents are very concerned at the ease with which these bar extensions can be obtained.  That has resulted in a great growth in the number of people being admitted for treatment in the psychiatric hospitals.  It has resulted in absenteeism from work on Mondays.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently the manager of a factory told me that there <Col N="562" /> were more rejects from the work done on Mondays than on the other four days of the week.  Therefore, every effort the Minister can make to control that situation will be very welcome and will contribute substantially to an improvement in the quality of our life.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that he has embarked on a major campaign to cut down the use of drugs and medicines when they are not medically necessary. Quite recently at a budget day meeting of the North Eastern Health Board attention was drawn to the fact that the cost of drugs was escalating rapidly year after year, and the Minister also draws attention to that.  I believe that there is an over prescription of drugs and that people have come to think that a drug of some kind is a necessity.  At one end of the scale they want pep tablets; at the other end it is tranquilisers.</P>
      <P>Quite recently I heard of a case where in the senior final of a primary schools' competition a boy playing at centre half back, who had been a commanding figure in all the games up to the final, was suddenly found to be off form.  He was running all over the field.  He did not advert to the fact that he should keep his position.  He was making an attempt to feel the ball when it was still some feet away from him.  When the trainer of the team had a talk with him at half time as to the sudden cause of the deterioration in his form he was told by the lad that he had taken four pep tablets so that he could put on a class performance.  It had the opposite effect.  The point I want to make is that even at 13 years of age youngsters think that pep tablets will have a good effect.  At the other end of the scale there is the fact that after any exertion whatever a tranquiliser is thought to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being conditioned into the frame of mind where we believe tablets of some kind are necessary for everything we undertake.  In the old days there was a belief that sometimes a general practitioner who knew people well gave them a bottle of coloured water and the psychological effect of taking that home and drinking it, thinking it was medicine of some kind, worked wonders.  Nowadays it must be a <Col N="563" /> tablet or drug of some kind.  Whatever can be done by the Minister to educate the people to get them to rethink on this situation will be very useful and valuable.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Minister's crusade to win people away from excessive drinking, excessive smoking and excessive eating, we should have a greater drive for savings, though I know this does not come under the Minister's Department.  One of the bad side-effects of inflation was that people felt that putting money aside was no good, that in three to four years' time the devaluation of the £ would mean that the savings would not be worthwhile.  Concurrently with the Minister's drive to cut out these abuses, we should have an intensification of the savings campaign.</P>

      <P>With due deference, it is interrelated with everything that the Minister has said with regard to the over-consumption of drugs, alcohol and so on.  The attractive alternative would be to get people conditioned into thinking that some of the money should be left aside rather than spent every weekend.  That would help to achieve the Minister's goal.</P>
      <P>We have reached the stage where we have a shorter working week, but we are not trained how to use our leisure time beneficially.  The result is that we crowd into public houses with all the consequent evils to society.  That is aggravated by the fact that we have the &ldquo;hire purchase&rdquo; mentality.  Young people now, instead of saving for the future as the older generation did, believe that when they embark on marriage everything will be made easy through hire purchase.</P>

    <P>I should like to join in the tributes <Col N="564" /> paid earlier to the VHI for the great improvements recently introduced.  This organisation have done tremendous work.  I hope that the operation of this Bill, together with the operations of the VHI, will result in better treatment for a wider section of our population.  I fervently hope that efforts being made at health board level and by the Minister to cut down on the use and prescription of drugs will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very sincerely to express my appreciation to Senators for the welcome which they have afforded this legislation and for the constructive comments which have been made on all sides.  I am very interested in the points made by Senators arising out of the legislation and in regard to the health services generally.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as a number of Senators have pointed out, can be regarded as a step forward.  It is a major improvement in our approach to health and to the administration of the health services.  It will go a long way towards providing in our community a reasonable satisfactory and comprehensive health service.  I would hope that by the time the Bill is fully in operation, allied to the attractive package which the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are putting forward, there will not be anybody in our community who will hesitate to seek any medical attention they may require because of their inability to pay for it.  The provisions which we will have made when this Bill is implemented will be comprehensive and will cover all sections of the community to the extent that is necessary to ensure that ideal.  As a number of Senators have mentioned, nobody will be compelled to forego necessary health treatment or medical treatment because of financial and economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with some of the points raised by Senators and with the queries which have been put to me.  I will deal with them more or less in the order in which they were made during the course of the debate rather than attach particular importance to one point over another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> The question of the information of hospital patients is a very important one. It is something to which I have been giving attention over the past 12 months or so.  Most Senators agree that for many people to be admitted to hospital is an intimidating experience, particularly for old people.  For most ordinary citizens to be removed from their home environment and taken into hospital&mdash;an institutional setting&mdash;can be intimidating. It is very important that every effort be made to ensure that patients being admitted to hospital are reassured to the greatest extent possible and treated with kindness and understanding.</P>
    <P>A more important aspect than any of these is that they be fully informed of exactly what their condition is.  We all know the trying experience it is to be left in hospital without any information as to what is going to happen or what treatment is to be received or what the programme is for the individual.  There is a small working group looking into this matter and they have now submitted a report to me.  As a result of that report we are now preparing in the Department of Health a booklet which we will be issuing in a matter of months to all health institutions and hospitals on the subject of providing the maximum amount of information and reassurance for patients admitted to hospitals.</P>
    <P>Some of the debate has centred on the question of the ceiling and there are a few points which I would like to make about that.  First of all, it is a movable ceiling.  When the Bill was prepared the figure of £5,000 was mentioned, but I indicated that before 6 April a final decision would be taken and the ultimate ceiling would be fixed by regulation. That is still the position.  Since the Bill was published we now have access to the figure for the average industrial earnings which was published in March 1978 and on the basis of that, using the same one and a half calculation, it is clear that the figure should now be somewhere around £5,200.  The ceiling for both the social welfare and the health sides should be somewhere in that region.  There have been very strong representations from the trade union movement and from <Col N="566" /> others that we should put the ceiling up as far as we can.  In response to that and in an endeavour to go some way towards meeting those representations, it is proposed to fix the ceiling at £5,500. That is more than would be indicated by the calculator of one and a half times the average industrial earnings.  It will take in the vast majority of wage and income earners.</P>
    <P>One of the limiting factors is that we have to have the same upper limit, same ceiling, for the new social welfare payrelated contribution system as we have for the health contribution.  Otherwise, there would be an enormously difficult collection system.  One of the big advantages of the changeover we are making is simplicity.  We are introducing on the social welfare and health sides a major degree of simplification.  In future, both these systems should be able to be implemented and operated with the minimum of difficulty, complication and bureaucratic and official problems.  That is the limiting factor.  But, weighing up all the factors, I think that £5,500 is a reasonable ceiling.</P>
    <P>I mentioned by way of interjection to the Senator that, in considering the level of the ceiling we should bear in mind that it will always be operating retrospectively.  In other words, it is a person's income in the year ended April 1979 that will be the basis of eligibility for 1979-1980 the following year.  There is that further element of extension in the upper limit of the ceiling.  The ceiling will move up in accordance with the movement in wages and incomes.  Fixing the new ceiling will be an annual exercise.  It will have to be the same ceiling for social welfare and for health, because that is one of the great advantages of the whole process.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to commend the new Voluntary Health Insurance package to Senators and, through the Seanad to the general public.  I am very pleased that so many warm tributes have been paid to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board during the course of the discussion.  They are very well merited because the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are one of the great national successes of our <Col N="567" /> health service.  They have established an excellent reputation for efficiency in their approach to the whole matter of health insurance.  They have, at my request, adapted themselves and their schemes very quickly to the new proposals.  The package they are offering to the general public fits in exactly with what we are proposing on the official health administration side.  I want to urge all who are likely to be affected, particularly higher paid workers, to really find out for themselves what the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are now offering to them and to favourably consider becoming insured under VHI.  The package is a very attractive one.  Any worker who is moving up towards the limit of £5,000 or beyond would be doing himself and his family a very great service if he got in touch with the VHI and investigated how the schemes would suit his family.</P>
    <P>The VHI are introducing a number of improvements.  Some Senators asked about the modifications in the new schemes.  There were some questions asked about this in the Dáil, and I would like to avail of this opportunity to reiterate what the exact position is.  The main thing, of course, is that the new schemes will be available to the public as a whole.  They will be of particular interest and benefit to higher paid workers, particularly higher paid manual workers. The schemes will be of general application to the whole community.  The important changes are that provision for maternity, for instance, is being brought in.  The previous illness conditions which have existed up to now are being done away with.  In most cases the age limits are being done away with.  Provision is now being made to pay one's voluntary health insurance premium by instalments if one so wishes.  A number of the restrictions that have existed up to now have been abolished.</P>
    <P>I ask the full co-operation of Senators in drawing attention, particularly of the vocational organisations with which they are associated, to these new provisions, and preaching the gospel and getting across the message that family men and women should find out for <Col N="568" /> themselves what it would cost them to join VHI, what benefits they would derive and how it would affect them.</P>
    <P>Some Senators spoke about medical cards.  While medical cards are not affected by this legislation, except in so far as the provision whereby a medical card holder does not pay a health contribution is being continued, nevertheless it is an important matter because medical cards and their availability affect in a real and vital way many of the lower paid families.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the situation in regard to medical cards.  It is wrong to be too disconcerted by reading or learning that so many thousands of medical cards have been withdrawn in a particular period because that is not the figure that counts.  The figure that counts is the balance between the medical cards withdrawn and the number of new ones issued.  There will always be movement in the numbers and the important thing to ensure is that, as far as possible, everybody who is entitled to a medical card gets one.  There should be a minimum of delay and bureaucratic frustration in this situation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies and Senators are concerned that in some of the health board areas, medical cards seem to be withdrawn to a greater extent than previously.  I assure the Seanad that there is no policy directive of any sort involved in this situation.  As far as I am concerned, I am anxious that all members of the community and families entitled to medical cards get them with the minimum of interference and delay. If there is a problem the benefit of the doubt should be given to the particular families.  The guidelines were revised on 1 January by the chief executive officers of the health boards and the income limits were increased.  They are not by any means generous limits, but they have been revised in line with increases in the cost of living.  I recently had a meeting with the chief executive officers on different matters and I availed of the opportunity to discuss with them the question of the issue of medical cards.  We understand each other's position.  The chief executive officers are fully aware of what I am anxious to achieve in this <Col N="569" /> situation&mdash;that the guidelines be fairly, impartially and flexibly enforced.</P>
    <P>As regards the hardship provisions in the Health Acts, a chief executive officer always has the reserve power to provide assistance in any case where an individual or family would be involved in hardship in the provision of medical attention. Senators should not hesitate to drawn the attention of the officials, or ultimately the chief executive officer, to this provision and seek to have it invoked in any case where it appears desirable that it should be invoked.  We will keep the situation in regard to medical cards under review but, in so far as the population as a whole is concerned, the percentage of the population covered by medical cards remains relatively stable.  I imagine that in some cases the withdrawal of a number of medical cards might be due to the fact that people during 1978 secured employment. There was a fall in the numbers on the live register.  Apart from that, there was a considerable increase in the numbers employed.  That would be reflected in the medical card statistics.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that there is no question of the Department of Health, the Minister or anybody at any level, giving instructions or directives that medical cards are to be restricted or that there is to be any tightening up or anything done that was not part of the Minister's machinery before.  I will continue to keep an eye on the situation and will keep in touch with the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte raised a number of interesting points.  He was inquiring about the amount of research being done into mortality rates.  I am speaking from recollection at this point, but there is no great valuable breakdown of mortality rates as far as social classes are concerned. The Medico-Social Research Board are at present engaged in a hospital in-patient survey.  We will get a fair amount of information from that. The information we have is on the basis of age groups and not social classes.  The Senator raised the question of whether or not morbidity and mortality figures can be related to social classes.  We might get some surprising results if we <Col N="570" /> had such a survey.  I imagine that, in so far as a lot of modern diseases are concerned, the statistics might show that they are more closely related to affluence in society rather than to deprivation. But, unfortunately, as of now, there is no valuable or important research information available to us.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke about the importance of preventive medicine and health education.  At the risk of being a bore on this aspect, I reiterate the fundamental basic importance of preventive medicine and health education. The most precious asset an individual has is his or her health.  It means more to the individual than it does to anybody else.  An enormous amount can be done by the individual to maintain and preserve this vital, valuable asset which he or she has.  As Senators know, we are trying to do a great deal in the field of health education and are trying to get across a number of important messages.  We have had a number of successful campaigns and will be continuing with them.  Senators mentioned most of the important points; cigarette smoking, alcohol&mdash;and not just alcoholism&mdash;but the abuse of alcohol&mdash;the over-use and misuse of drugs and the importance of diet and physical exercise.  We need constant educative programmes on these so that they will have an impact on the general public.</P>
    <P>Every time I go to a meeting of Ministers of Health in Europe the debate is always the same: what can we do to control the escalating cost of the health service?  The wealthier the countries are, the more they are concerned with escalating costs.  The cost of the health services is one of the most vital factors in health.  Any sensible person looking at the situation will see clearly that the ultimate way of keeping the health services within our capacity to pay for them is by a positive approach to preventive medicine and health education.  If we can prevent people from becoming ill, we can use the money we have available to provide far better services for those who are ill.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>One Senator mentioned the question of the co-operation and assistance from <Col N="571" /> the radio and television authority.  I must confess that I have mixed feelings on this score.  One would think there could not be a more desirable function for a national radio and television service than to be fully committed to promoting positive health and preventive medicine. I have been making determined efforts to seek the co-operation of the RTE Authority in this area and I have met with some success, but I have also been meeting with quite a deal of disappointment. As Senators know, we launched a national no-smoking day on Ash Wednesday.  The general public were interested in that and I know from my own contacts that there has been quite a good response to that campaign.  I went to a great deal of trouble to facilitate the radio and television authority by doing a programme, which was to be transmitted on the evening before Ash Wednesday, to try and focus public attention and get the maximum public involvement in and support for the national no-smoking campaign.  Despite that I, to my dismay, found that, even though we have made the programme, RTE for some reason of their own decided not to use it.  I still do not know to this day why they did not use it.  In so far as they discussed the no-smoking campaign at all, their attitude towards it was negative and unhelpful.  I am sorry I have to say that but it seems to me quite incredible that programmes of a health education nature would not be enthusiastically accepted by the national television and radio authority. We have been meeting, at certain levels, with a great deal of co-operation from the Authority in certain areas.  However, there is a great deal of room for more comprehensive and enthusiastic co-operation by the national radio and television authority in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> A Senator mentioned the price of drugs.  That is something which needs constant attention.  By and large, we are fairly happy in the Department with the situation regarding the price we are charged for drugs in the health services. We keep an eye on the situation and monitor price movements in other countries.  We have constant dialogue with the industry about the prices that were charged.  We are having discussions with individual companies in relation to particular preparations where prices seem to be out of line.  That process will continue.  The big improvement must come about not merely in the price of drugs but in the use of them.</P>
    <P>There must be a sensible, moderate approach to the use of drugs.  We are in very close co-operation with the medical organisation about this matter.  If one looks casually at the figures in the general medical service one will see that the amount of drugs dispensed is out of all proportion to what should be dispensed. It is a complex and difficult situation and one should not come to any facile solutions and opinions.  Both the Department of Health and the medical organisations are concerned to constantly try to improve the whole system of prescribing drugs.  We have now brought out a formulary which lists the basic ingredients and which should be of enormous help to the medical profession to prescribe economically. We will continue our efforts to try and ensure that valuable and beneficial drugs are only used to the extent and in the manner that they should be.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to that section of the Bill which is not covered by the general medical service.  One Senator mentioned that there seems to a fairly general opinion among the public that if one goes to a doctor one must come away with a prescription for a drug. That is totally wrong.  More and more doctors are preaching the message that they can be of far greater service to their patients in many cases if they do not prescribe anything at all.  It is an area in which an enormous amount of effort and education is required and, ultimately must be governed by what the patient regards as necessary and desirable and <Col N="573" /> the clinical judgement of the doctor.  We on the administrative side can only go so far.  We cannot interfere with the liberty of the doctor to prescribe for his patient as he sees fit nor can we intervene in the clinical relationship between doctor and patient.  Doctors are just as concerned about over-prescribing and about the use and abuse of drugs as we are in the Department and afford us full cooperation in our efforts to bring about an improvement.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised during the course of the discussion. The debate, as usual, has been informed and constructive.  Very good points have been made by different Senators, perhaps not with great relevance to the legislation, but nevertheless important so far as general administration of the health services is concerned.  It has been a valuable discussion so far as I am concerned.  I was glad to get the views of the Senators on these various matters.  I greatly appreciate the constructive welcome which Senators afforded the legislation.</P>

      <P>Ag leanúint ar an méid a bhí á rá agam an tseachtain seo caite, bhí mé ag teacht go dtí an pointe an uair sin go raibh mé chun cur síos ar an <Col N="574" /> chaoi an-mhaith ina raibh an córas sin, Radio na Gaeltachta, ag obair ó thaobh chumarsáid níos sásúla a dhéanamh idir ceantair éagsúla na Gaeltachta, agus cheap mé féin le fada an lá, thar na blianta sar ar chuireadh Radio na Gaeltachta ar bun, go mba cheart go mbeadh sé ann.  Tugann sé saghas aontais don Ghaeltacht iomlán in ionad go mbeadh siad scartha óna chéile ina reigiúin bheaga.  Idir an dá linn bhí deacrachtaí ann an chómhairle sín a chur ag obair i gceart, taobh istigh de Údarás RTE, mar, mar dúirt mé cheana anseo, bhí sé i bhfad níos fearr go mbeadh na heagrais lógánta seo neamhspleách ó RTE.  Beidh siad in ann a gcuid fhéin a dhéanamh gan bheith ag féacaint thar a nguaillí ar an fear mór thuas i Montrose.  Ach ag argóint sin caithfidh mé admháil anois go bhféachann sé go bhfuil rudaí ag obair go maith leis na socruithe nua atá ann. Ach tagann sé chugam ag caint ar seo&mdash;agus níl mé cinnte ach ceapaim gur luaigh mé seo cheana ag cur síos ar Bhillí a bhí ceangailte leis an Aire&mdash;go m'bfhéidir go mba ceart bheith ag smaoineamh anois ar chóras ceart telefíse a chur ar fáil, i dtreo is go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta, ní amháin in ann iad féin a chloisint agus labhairt le chéile, ach go mbeadh siad in ann iad féin a fheiceáil trí dhíospóireacht, cur síos, agus mar sin de.  B'fhéidir go gceapfadh daoine go mbeadh an saghas ruda sin anchostasúil le smaoineamh ar chóras telefíse i gcomhar na Gaeltachta. Ceapaim féin go bhfuil an córas ann cheana féin mar tá an chuid den chóras atá ag obair ó na tiomnóirí ar Maghera, Mullaghanish agus Truskmore agus áiteacha eile, díomhaoin i gcomhair chuid mhaith den lá agus abraimís ba cheart go bhféadfaí uair a chloig sa tseachtain, uair a chloig maidin Dé Sathairn, uair a chloig maidin Dé Domhnaigh, a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaelatachta i dtreo is go mbeadh siad in ann cur leis na seirbhísí cumarsáide atá acu anois.  Ba cheart go mbeadh na seirbhísí sin acu leis na blianta anuas.  Ba mhaith liom é sin a chur os comhair an Aire agus b'fhéidir go bhféadfadh sé dul ag caint leis an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa agus é sin a chur abhaile ar RTE.</P>

      <Col N="575" /> Is é mo phointe deireannach ná go mbíonn an-chuid cainte sna Gaeltachtaí, idir muintir na Gaeltachta agus na buíona éagsúla a oibríonn san nGaeltacht ar cé comh héifeachtach is atá Gaeltarra Éireann.  Dúirt mé san chéad chuid de mo óráid gur cheap mé go raibh togha job déanta acu agus do leag mé amach na figiúirí chun an taobh sin a theaspáint, go rabhadar tar éis fostaíocht a chur ar fáil, idir '67 agus '78 i gcomhair nach mór 4,000 daoine, go ndeachaigh na figiúirí ó 700 go dtí timpeall 4,700.  Dúirt mé san chéad chuid de mo óráid go raibh an figiúr sin ar 5,000.  Bhí mé beagáinín as slí ansin, ach is dóigh liom go bhfuil an figiúr sin, 4,700 ceart.</P>
    <P>Ag féachaint ar na figiúirí a tháinig amach ar an bpáipéir ar maidin ar chostas fhostaíochta ó thaobh IDA de, d'fhéach mé suas na figiúirí i gcomhair Ghaeltarra agus feicim go bhfuil timpeall £46 milliún infheistithe i monarchana, scaireanna, i dtrealamh agus mar sin de, chun cabhair a chur ar fáil chun an tionsclaíocht a mhéadú san Ghaeltacht. Cuir an dá fhigiúr sin le chéile agus táimíd ag caint, mar sin, mar gheall ar £10,000 an job.  Ag féachaint ar sin, b'fhéidir go bhféachann sé mór go leor, ach níl sé mór i gcomparáid leis na figiúirí a bhí poiblithe inniu ag teacht ón tuarascáil a chuir <i>Business and Finance</i> ar fáil.  Bhí siad ag caint ar £20,000 an job, ach cloisim ón nuacht inniu go bhfuil IDA tar éis é sin a bhréigniú agus go bhfuil an figiúr i bhfad níos lú ná sin, nach raibh ach cuid den airgead a cuireadh isteach caite.  Níl a fhios agam anois cad é an figiúr ceart i gcóir an IDA&mdash;b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé timpeall £5,000 nó mar sin.  Braitheann sé ar an bhfuil traenáil curtha san áireamh, an bhfuil na réamh fhóirgintí thionsclaíochta curtha san áireamh?  Níl fhios agam ach ar aon chuma ceapaim go bhfuil 10,000 postanna i gcóir Ghaeltarra maith go leor mar bheart agus ba mhaith liom é sin a chur ós bhur gcomhair.</P>
    <P>Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta tagtha anois nach mór agus tá súil agam go nglacfar leis an Bhille.  Guim rath Dé ar obair na ndaoine go léir go mbeidh baint acu leis an Údarás.  Ní amháin gur <Col N="576" /> údarás é i gcóir cúrsaí agus eacnamaíochta san Ghaeltacht ach is beart nua é ó thaobh coincheap daonlathais, agus san tseachtain atá caite bhí seans agam bheith ag díospóireacht le daoine a bhí ag cur síos ar chóras ceart Rialtais láithrigh i gcomparáid le Rialtas lógánta agus ceapaim nach bhfeiceann daoine fós&mdash;agus dúirt mé é seo cheana agus ba mhaith liom críochnú leis&mdash;go bhfuil san bheart nua seo, san choincheap nua seo Údarás na Gaeltachta b'fhéidir ubh nua a bhféadfadh fás chun a thaispeáint go bhféadfaí córas nua forbartha réigiúnach a chur ar fáil sa tír seo.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfeiceann daoine é sin ach ceapaim féin go bhfuil céim nua tógtha ag an Aire anseo agus go mbeimid ag caint mar gheall air san todhchaí.</P>

      <P>Níor labhair mé ach uair amháin riamh as Gaeilge sa Seanad.  Bhí sé cuíosach deacair dom an uair sin, agus caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfuil sé rófhurasta anois.  Mar sin, caithfidh mé tar éis tamaill labhairt as Béarla.  I dtosach ba mhaith liom go mór labhairt ar an mBille seo mar ceapaim go bhfuil polasaí an-tábhachtach ann; tá aidhm an-tábhachtach ann agus is soiléir dom go bhfuil smaointe nua ciallmhara ag an Aire a d'fhéadfadh bheith anéifeachtach. Do rinne Gaeltarra Éireann obair an-mhaith i rith na bliana ach tá plean nua againn anois, plean a thugann tacaíocht don Ghaeltacht i slí nua, slí nach raibh cumhacht ag Gaeltarra Éireann a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá dearcadh nua san Bhille, dearcadh a thugann daonlathas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i slí nár samhlaíodh cheana, fiú amháin san Ghaeltacht ach in aon áit sa tír.  Mar sin, tá áthas orm fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille agus mo thacaíocht féin a thabhairt dó.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is wide-ranging in its importance not only for the Gaeltacht areas but for the rest of the country.  It adds a new dimension to our concept of democracy.  We have discussed many times our concern to advance the concept of democracy and industrial democracy in the various ways in which it can express itself.  The Minister proposes to advance the frontiers with great imagination and courage in a way <Col N="577" /> which will be wholly successful.  The basic concept of involving muintir na Gaeltachta in the selection of the majority of the údarás is a most important decision which will have wide-ranging consequences for the good of the Gaeltacht areas, the people in them and, in time for the whole country.  I think it will set a headline.  It involves the individual in the decision-making process in a fundamental and wide-ranging way.</P>
    <P>Section 9 augments what I said in an important and far-reaching way because the section provides ways in which the údarás can acquire more powers.  The areas set out in section 9 are particularly revealing because they refer to the promotion of the linguistic, cultural, social, physical and economic development of the Gaeltacht.  That takes in the whole canvas.  It provides ample opportunity for the people of the Gaeltacht, through their representatives on the údarás not only to respond to new features or new requirements but, more important, to take the initiative and to suggest new powers in dealing with new situations or to initiate new programmes or new concepts.  The areas in which these powers may be sought are very wide and provide a great area for the members of the údarás to use their imagination and feelings for the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The basic concept of the advancement of democracy in this way for the benefit of the people, advanced further by section 9, is definitely exciting in the whole concept of economic, cultural and community development.  The headline which has been set here may help to accelerate other community and democratic changes to our society on the economic and other fronts.</P>
    <P>A practical power is contained in section 10, that is, the power to guarantee loans sought by organisations to which the údarás would have given financial support.  That could be very important in practice.  It should be mentioned specifically in that manner because there will be situations where an institution may feel that an investment should be made if it is well within the area of risk which they think should be taken.  I use &ldquo;risk&rdquo; in the particular sense of the term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> For reasons of financial planning or liquidity they may not be in a position to provide the finance themselves.  This power can make it possible for the údarás to allay their strength and financial judgement with money which is otherwise available.  I believe it is a wise power and one which will help lubricate developments and investments which otherwise may not get off the ground.</P>
    <P>As a Dubliner I wish to indicate my support for the Bill and the new concept which it indicates.  I am glad to welcome it in the centenary year of the birth of Patrick Pearse.  The progressive way in which the Bill provides for the people of the Gaeltacht to help themselves is a timely and worthwhile way in which to commemorate this centenary.  As a Dubliner, and bearing in mind the unfortunate and unrepresentative remarks which the Lord Mayor of my city made in relation to the Pearse centenary, the general impression he gave that those who wish to support the language and culture should be identified in some way with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not wish to make a personal reference to the Lord Mayor. The mentality which, through some form of neo-MacCarthyism, tries to identify people who use the language and culture with political delinquency is best answered by directing attention to this type of Bill which is progressive, constructive and for the benefit of the people. Above all, it is democratic and advances the frontiers of democracy beyond what is generally taken to be the meaning of democracy, bringing it to life for the people of the Gaeltacht.  It is important for the Gaeltacht.  In time it will influence our attitudes to other ideas for other parts of the country.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis bhróin agus náire dom nach bhfuil mé in ann díospóireacht a dhéanamh ar an mBille seo in ár dteanga dhúchais mar go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beagnach caillte <Col N="579" /> agam mar go bhfuil mé as cleachtadh. So I must beg the indulgence of the Minister and the Members of the House to continue through the medium of the second official language.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is set out in section 8 which reads:</P>
      <P>(1) An tÚdarás shall encourage the preservation and extension of the use of the Irish language as the principal medium of communication in the Gaeltacht....  (2) An tÚdarás shall carry on, control and manage the industries and productive schemes of employment carried on,...</P>
      <P>I welcome this approach.  Some people still think that the only job the Minister for the Gaeltacht does is hand out fáinnes and encourage people to speak Irish when he has the grave responsibility of looking after the welfare of the people of the Gaeltacht.  If we can provide the people of the Gaeltacht with a living in their own place, speaking their own language, we shall have done more to restore the Irish language in this country than we have so far achieved in our half century of independence.  What is the use of having a Gaeltacht?  What is the use of having and taking pride in our native speakers if they are obliged to earn their living in places like Liverpool and London?</P>
      <P>When we talk of providing industries for the Gaeltacht areas we must remember that we are talking about one of the most disadvantaged areas in Europe.  We are talking about an area that has been decimated by famine and emigration.  It is sad that the greatest attraction the Gaeltacht areas have, apart from scenic beauty, is that there are so few people there today.  One goes there to get away from the strains and stresses of life, to travel traffic-free roads and through areas without seeing houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years 1770 to 1840 the population rose by an unprecedented 172 per cent.  One of our remotest and poorest counties, Mayo, had the highest population in rural Ireland.  That population fell so quickly, by over 26 per cent, that it is now almost an unpopulated area.  We are talking about providing this very disadvantaged <Col N="580" /> area with the infrastructure of roads, water, sewerage and telephones in order to encourage industrialists to invest money.  We should be under no illusions as to the magnitude of the Minister's task.  I should like to emphasise a point made in the Dáil Debate on this Bill by Deputy Woods.  He said that An tÚdarás should be encouraged to promote their own training programme in order to get the maximum benefits from the EEC social fund.</P>
    <P>One of the fringe areas of tourism in the Gaeltacht areas which could be developed is to encourage parents to share a holiday in the Gaeltacht with their children.  Parents who are concerned about the low standard of Irish being taught in our schools and who send their children to the Gaeltacht areas in order to improve their Irish would surely be interested in sharing a holiday with them.  The first time my family went to a remote part of the Gaeltacht to improve their Irish, I felt obliged to travel to the West to speak to the family and thank them for the hospitality they had shown to my children.  After speaking to bean an tí, the impression I got was that, after she had recovered from the initial shock of the very poor Irish of the children sent from Dublin and from the eastern seaboard, she felt the only thing she could do was, to try and instill into them an awareness of the language.</P>
    <P>I feel that a great deal could be done in this area.  Our well-intentioned efforts to restore the Irish language have resulted in our having a bowdlerized version of an ancient and honourable tongue.  I feel that the bureaucratic approach to the restoration of the language has resulted in the speaking of Irish being regarded as a cultural status symbol. The sort of mad bureaucracy that consigns the transport system of this capital city to the fastness of An Lár, wherever that may be, is to be deplored.  To those bureaucrats I would say &ldquo;Hands off the Irish language.  Leave it to the people who really care about it, who really understand it and who speak it daily.&rdquo;  I assure the Minister that many of us from whatever traditions we belong to, be it the Gaelic-speaking tradition or the <Col N="581" /> English-speaking tradition, are aware of the peculiar responsibility we have as a people towards the preservation of the Irish language as part of our Celtic heritage.  We are the only remaining independent Celtic nation and we have an obligation to restore and keep alive the language which was first brought to this country many thousands of years ago by the last wave of Celtic invaders, a language that has developed through Old Irish and Middle Irish into the language that is still spoken, though sadly in diminishing numbers, by the people of the Gaeltacht areas today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, is maith liom an fháilte a chuir an Seanadóir O'Brien roimh an Bhille.  Ina óráid thug sé figiúirí a bhí suimiúil dom féin, fiú amháin nuair a luaigh sé an méid daoine a d'fhág na Gaeltachtaí sna blianta atá caite.  Sílim gur fiú rud amháin a lua faoi sin: ní hé amháin gur imigh daoine, fir agus mná, ach gurb iad scoth na bhfear agus na mban a d'fhág na Gaeltachtaí, rud a d'fhág an scéal níos measa fós, mar gurb iad na daoine ba laige a fágadh agus rud é sin nár chuidigh leis an nGaeltacht féin nó le spiorad na Gaeltachta, ná leis an ngríosadh a bhí ag teastáil leis na Gaeltachtaí a spreagadh chun rud éigin a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leo féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is fíor a rá chomh maith go raibh meon faoi leith ag na daoine maidir leis an teanga féin de bharr na himirce.  Má thógaimid mo Ghaeltacht féin, cuirimid i gcás, Gáeltacht Mhaigh Eo, is dócha gur mó an mheath a tháinig ar an teanga ansin ná in aon Ghaeltacht eile de bharr na himirce, agus is de bharr an mheoin a bhí ag daoine i leith na Gaeilge a tharla an mheath sin.  Is é an rud a bhí le cloisteáil ó dhaoine a bhí ag tógáil clainne, &ldquo;Cén mhaith dúinn an Ghaeilge nuair a chaithfeas muid dul go Sasana nó go hAlbain lenár mbeatha a shaothrú&rdquo;? Sílim go bhfuil an meon sin caite anois. Ó bunaíodh Gaeltarra i 1965 agus an fhostaíocht atá curtha ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí de bharr na cabhrach atá tugtha ag gach Rialtas chun na cuspóirí sin a bhaint amach&mdash;is é sin lánfhostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta&mdash;tháinig athrú ar an <Col N="582" /> meon sin agus tá misneach níos fearr acu de bharr rudaí atá ag tarlú i láthair na huaire sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Níl dabht ar bith ná gurb é an rud is tábhachtaí, mar adúirt an Seanadóir O'Brien, na daoine a spreagadh le gníomh a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leo féin, agus sílim go dtig liom a rá gurb é sin go díreach an rud atá i gceist sa Bhille seo: údarás a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin leis na cuspóirí sin a bhaint amach.  Beidh an tromlach acu ar an údarás.  Beidh siad in ann mórsheisear a thoghadh agus beidh an tAire ag ainmniú seisir don údarás, agus de bharr go mbeidh an tromlach acu ar an údarás ní raibh rud níos fearr ag muintir na Gaeltachta go dtí seo le rud éigin dearfa a dhéanamh ar a son féin.</P>
    <P>Do luaigh an Seanadóir Brugha dhá phointe thábhachtacha maidir leis an mBille agus maidir leis an nGaeltacht, agus arís tá sé ag teacht le cuid den rud adúirt an Seanadóir O'Brien, is é sin, nach hé amháin cothú na teangan ach cothú mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin atá i gceist.  Maidir leis an bhfostaíocht, luaigh sé rud a chuireann isteach orm féin; nuair atá fostaíocht á cur ar fáil agus nuair atá monarchana againn, is minic a tharlaíonn sé de bharr bainistíochta nó cúrsaí mar sin, nach í an Ghaeilge a bhíonn á labhairt ag muintir na Gaeltachta ag obair ins na monarchana sin.  Táimid ag iarraidh an scéal sin a leigheas; táimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh an Ghaeilge le cloisteáil ins na monarchana.  Tá cúrsaí traenála á gcur ar bun anois le cleachtadh a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta iad féin a bheith i mbun cúrsaí mar sin, agus fiú amháin an tráthnóna seo, tá Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta ag bualadh le cuid de phríomh-fheidhmeannaigh Ghaeltarra Eireann ag plé na ceiste seo agus ag iarraidh fáil amach céard é an bealach is fearr le béim a chur ar labhairt na Gaeilge ins na monarchana sin i gcaoi nach mbeidh an fhostaíocht féin ag cur meatha ar Ghaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tuigimid an tábhacht atá leis agus, tá mé cinnte, de bharr an fhiosrúcháin seo agus de bharr an scrúdaithe atá á dhéanamh ar na cúrsaí seo, go mbeidh feabhas ar an scéal agus nach gcluinfidh muid go bhfuil Béarla á labhairt sna monarchana feasta.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> Rinne an Seanadóir Brugha tagairt chomh maith do Bhord na Gaeilge.  Tá cúram orthu san ar chúrsaí taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, níos mó b'fhéidir ná cúrsaí sa nGaeltacht féin, ach tá rud amháin a luaigh sé maidir leis na Gaeltachtaí agus sin go bhfuil deacracht ann maidir le Gaeltachtaí a chaill an Ghaeilge agus atá ar imeall na Gaeltachta&mdash;cén chaoi is fearr cuidiú leo sin?  Tá sé sin á scrúdú i láthair na huaire chomh maith.  Tuigimid go bhfuil sé níos fusa an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais in áiteanna mar sin, áiteanna a bhfuil eolas ar an nGaeilge féin ach nach bhfuil sí á labhairt ró-fhairsing nó ró-mhaith nó ró-láidir ag muintir na gceantar sin.</P>
    <P>Bíonn daoine ag rá amanna gur cheart limistéir na Gaeltachta a athrú nó teorainneacha na Gaeltachtaí a athrú agus iad a chúngú, ach níl a fhios agam an bhfuil an moladh sin ró-mhaith nó ar cheart glacadh leis.  Tá daoine ar imeall na Gaeltachta a dteastaíonn cuidiú uathu agus b'fhéidir nuair a bhéas Udarás na Gaeltachta curtha i bhfeidhm go mbeidh siad in ann aghaidh a thabhairt ar na ceantair sin agus níos mó misnigh a thabhairt dóibh tuilleadh úsáid a bhaint as an nGaeilge agus í a neartú sna ceantair sin.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh mórán le rá ag an Seanadóir Whitaker, ach glacadh leis an mBille agus é a mholadh.  Tuigim an fáth nár dhúirt sé ach an méid sin&mdash;mar go raibh, cosúil le Seanadóirí eile, páirt mhór aige sna himeachtaí a bhí ar siúl maidir le ceist na Gaeltachta agus staid na Gaeilge leis na blianta anuas.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir de Brún cúrsaí pleanála, agus an cáineadh a bhí á dhéanamh ag daoine maidir leis an mBille mar atá sé dréachtaithe i láthair na huaire.  Is maith liom gur thagair sé do na pointí sin mar tá sé soiléir sa Bhille féin, agus luaigh an Seanadóir Donnelly an rud céanna, in ált 9 den Bhille, go mbeidh deis ag an údarás nuair a bhéas sé curtha ar bun cumhachtaí breise a iarraidh ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas.  Níl constaic ar bith á cur ar an údarás maidir leis na cúrsaí sin.  Mar adúirt mé sa Dáil, i mBille den chineál seo ní féidir chuile shórt a scríobh isteach ann, agus dá mbeimis ag iarraidh gach rud mar sin <Col N="584" /> a chur sa Bhille ní bheimis réidh go ceann a trí nó a ceathair de bhlianta. Thug sinne geallúint go dtabharfaí an Bille isteach taobh istigh de bhliain agus cé nár éirigh linn coinneáil leis an ngeallúint sin, níl muid ró-fhada chun deiridh, agus is maith liom go bhfuil an dul ar aghaidh atá annseo déanta againn agus go mbeidh an t-údarás ann sar i bhfad.</P>
    <P>Arís, is ceart go dtuigfeadh daoine, agus muintir na Gaeltachta go mórmhór, mar adúirt an Seanadóir de Brún, go mbeidh na cumhachtaí agus cibé cumhacht a shílfeas an tÚdarás é féin a theastós uaidh san am atá le teacht, go mbeidh cead acu na cumhachtaí sin a iarraidh.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé an míshástacht a bhí air maidir leis an gcaoi a bhfuil an deontas £10 á íoc sna Gaeltachtaí agus gurb aisteach an rud é gur féidir le duine amháin as muirín an £10 a thuilleamh agus go bhfágtar amach an chuid eile den chlann.  Le bheith fírinneach faoi, deirim gurb aisteach é sin.  Ní rud é a tharlaíonn de ghnáth.  Má tá an mhuirín uilig i dteideal an deontas a fháil fáigheann siad é agus is fíor-annamh a tharlaíonn sé go bhfaigheann duine amháin an deontas agus go bhfágtar amach an chuid eile den mhuirín.  Déarfainn, corr-uair, go mb'fhéidir go dtarlaíonn sé leis an mhuintir eile a spreagadh i gcaoi go mbeadh iarracht níos fearr á dhéanamh acu leis an nGaeilge a thabhairt chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé an gá atá le teicneoirí a oiliúint le freastal ar chúrsaí sna Gaeltachtaí.  Sílim go bhfuil an-dul chun cinn á dhéanamh sna cúrsaí sin, go mór mhór ó bunaíodh cúrsaí AnCO i nGaeltacht Ghaoith Dóbhair.  Táimid in ann anois freastal níos fearr a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta leanúint le cúrsaí Ghaeltachta, cúrsaí a chuideochas leo nuair a rachaidh siad i mbun oibre ina gceantair fhéin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh cuid mhaith Seanadóirí Radio na Gaeltachta.  Ar ndóigh, caithfimid a bheith fírinneach agus a rá go bhfuil an-obair ar fad déanta ag Radio na Gaeltachta ó cuireadh ar bun é.  Ní amháin gur thug sé muintir na Gaeltachta agus na nGaeltachtaí ar fad le chéile, ach thug sé léargas níos fearr don phobal uilig, agus don saol mór ar <Col N="585" /> an traidisiún atá againn i gceol, amhránaíocht, scéalaíocht agus seanchas na hÉireann, rud nach raibh deis ag muintir na hÉireann a chloisteáil ar an Radio nó ar Theilifís Éireann.  Fuair siad an deis sin ó Radio na Gaeltachta.  Ní amháin go bhfuair muintir na Gaeltachta an deis éisteacht le Radio na Gaeltachta ach fuair muintir na hÉireann an deis sin. Caithfimid tréaslú le chuile dhuine a raibh páirt acu i mbunú Radio na Gaeltachta agus do na daoine atá ina bhun i láthair na huaire as ucht na hoibre atá ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí cuid de na Seanadóirí eile ag caint ar Radio na Gaeltachta, luaigh siad gur cheart go leathnóidh sé amach agus go mbeadh níos mó ama tugtha do chláracha i lár an lae.  Luaigh an Seanadóir Cranitch é sin, agus aontaím leis.  Bíonn gach tosú lag, mar a deir sé, agus cé nach ceart é sin, b'fhéidir, a rá i dtaobh Radio na Gaeltachta, mar sin féin tá tús curtha le huair a chloig no uair go leith, a chur ar fáil i lár an lae, agus beimid ag súil go leanfaidh sé sin agus go mbeidh deis ag chuile dhuine níos mó ama a chaitheamh ag éisteacht le Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Cranitch gurb í an Ghaeilge an tseoid is luachmhaire dár n-oidhreacht.  Ní fhéadfainn é a chur i mbealach chomh deas sin, ach caithfimid uile teacht leis an méid sin.  Cé gur labhair an Seanadóir MacGabhann den chuid is mó i mBéarla, bhí rudaí anshuimiúil le rá aige.  Níl mé ag cáineadh juine ar bith a labhair as Béarla&mdash;tá mé buíoch do chuile dhuine a labhair, is cuma i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge, agus ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an mbeirt Sheanadóir a labhair inniu, an Seanadóir Donnelly agus an Seanadóir Cassidy. Dúirt siad nach raibh Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu, ach ón méid a chuala mise uathu bhí Gaeilge bhínn bhlasta acu.  Is é an t-aiféala is mó atá orainn ná nach bhfuil daoine sásta an méid Gaeilge atá acu a úsáid.  Dá bhrí sin níl a gcuid Ghaeilge le chloisteáil.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Seanadóir MacGabhann ag caint ar an toghchán, agus ní raibh sé sásta nach mbeidh muintir Thír Chonaill in ann ach beirt ionadaí a thoghadh. Caithfimid cothrom na féinne a thabhairt do chuile Ghaeltacht, agus <Col N="586" /> sílim go mbeidh muintir Thír Chonaill níos fearr as le beirt ná mar a bhéas muintir na Gaillimhe, muintir Mhaigh Eo agus muintir na Mí le triúr.  Chuir muid chuile rud san áireamh agus caithfidh daoine glacadh leis go ndearna&mdash;mar ár ndícheall na Gaeltachtaí ar fad a shásamh.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Seanadóir Mulcahy tagairt do chuid mhaith rudaí.  Bhí sé ag caint ar na heagrais a tháinig le chéile maidir le cúrsaí na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. Rinne na daoine sin an-obair&mdash;thug siad tuiscint agus léargas níos fearr dúinn ar céard ba chóir a dhéanamh agus cé hiad na scéimeanna a mba cheart tabhairt futhu maidir le ceist na Gaeilge agus ceist na Gaeltachta ar fad.  Dúirt sé gur ceart seiminéar ar leith a chur ar fáil ag na daoine a bhí i mbun &ldquo;Gníomh don Ghaeltacht&rdquo;, agus a leithéid a chur ar fáil don aos óg leis an scéal a mhíniú ina iomlán.  Da mba rud é go bhféadfaí a leithéid a dhéanamh, bhéadh sé inmholta, ach sílim nach mbeadh sé ró fhurasta rud mar sin a reachtáil. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an Seanadóir agus mé féin in ann labhairt le chéile faoi, am éigin, chun an rud a phlé go mion, le fáil amach go díreach céard iad na tuairimí atá ag an Seanadóir ina thaobh sin.</P>
    <P>Thug an Seanadóir céanna moladh mór do Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Tuigimid uilig na deacrachtaí atá ag Gaeltarra Éireann.  Mar a luaigh an Seanadóir Cassidy, tá siad ag iarraigh tionscail a chur ar bun in áiteanna atá iargcúlta, áiteanna a bhfuil a lán deacrachtaí ag baint leo, mar chúrsaí bóthar, teileafón agus eile.  Tá siad seo tábhachtach do thionsclaí ar bith a bhéas ag bunú sna Gaeltachtaí.  Glacaim go bhfuil obair an-mhaith déanta ag Gaeltarra, ach tá an deacracht ann, agus tá mise ag éisteacht leis i ngach Gaeltacht atá á siúil agam, nach bhfuil muinín ag muintir na Gaeltachta as Gaeltarra féin.  Níl a fhios agam cén chaoi a tharlaíonn sé sin, cén fáth go bhfuil an scéal mar sin.  Cuirimid i gcás na monarcana i nGaoth Dóbhair, nó ar fud Chonamara, go mór mhór sna Gaeltachtaí móra: tá drochmheas ar Ghaeltarra.  Mar adeirim níl a fhios agam cén bunús atá leis.  Tá sé ag cur as dom.  B'fhéidir go ndéanfaidh an tÚdarás athrú ar an scéal, go gcuirfidh sé ar ais <Col N="587" /> an mhuinín agus an misneach ceart i muintir na Gaeltachta agus go gcuirfidh sé spreagadh níos fearr iontu le tabhairt faoí chúrsaí ar mhaithe leo féin.  B'fhéidir gurb é an meon atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil siad ag súil le hiomarca ó Ghaeltarra, agus gur cheart dóibh níos mó a dhéanamh.  Ba mhaith leo a fháil amach go cruinn céard tá ar siúl ag Gaeltarra.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Mulcahy chomh maith gur ceart cláracha ar theilifís a leagadh amach agus iad a bheith ar fáil anois do mhuintir na Gaeltachta mar atá Radio na Gaeltachta i láthair na huaire. Níl mé ro-chinnte an féidir cúrsaí mar sin a chur ar aghaidh.  B'fhéidir os rud é go bhfuil an dara stáisiún anois againn, RTE 2, go mbeimíd in ann cúrsaí mar sin a chur ar fáil.  Cuirfidh mé os comhair Údarás Theilifíse RTE é go bhfeicfimíd céard is féidir linn a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Cassidy faoi na muiríneacha a bhíonn ag dul chun na Gaeltachta agus go mba mhaith an rud dhá bhféadfaí na tuismitheoirí a ghríosadh le cuairt a thabhairt ar an Ghaeltacht chomh maith.  Déarfainn go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta iad féin an-sásta leis sin, ach is é an deacracht atá ann i láthair na huaire go mbíonn, cuirimíd i gcás mar a tharla an bhliain seo caite, 19,000 páisti ag freastal ar na cúrsaí agus bíonn na daoine atá i mbun na gcúrsaí ag iarraidh bheith cinnte go mbeidh caighdeán ceart maireachtála ag na páistí nuair atá siad ar saoire, go mbeidh na seomraí leagtha amach i gceart, go mbeidh na leapacha agus gach rud mar sin ceart, agus cé go bhfuil deontais fhiala ó Roinn na Gaeltachta le cuidiú leis na daoine na cúrsaí sin a chur chun cinn, níl a fhios agam an mbeadh na Gaeltachtaí in ann glacadh leis an smaoineamh sin ar fad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter in the Seanad and am glad that the Minister is able to be present to reply.  I do not approach this in any contentious way and am not going to raise the temperature, but I want the House to be aware that this section&mdash;section 17 of the 1975 Act &mdash;appears to be a dead letter and yet it is a section which was inserted into that Act to fulfil a very important purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to begin by reading the relevant part of section 17.  It refers to the <Col N="589" /> possibility of the health boards recovering supplementary welfare allowances from the person who is in a position to provide maintenance.  In the normal case, this would be that, where a deserted wife was getting a supplementary welfare allowance, the health board could bring proceedings in the District Court against the husband, if he was in a position to maintain the wife and children.  Section 17 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Where a health board grants supplementary welfare allowance to any person (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the beneficiary&rdquo;), every person who is liable to maintain the beneficiary shall be liable to contribute to the health board according to his ability to any allowance so granted.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>Whenever a person who is liable to contribute to supplementary welfare allowance granted to the beneficiary fails or neglects to make such contribution, the health board concerned may apply to the District Court for an order directing the person liable to contribute to make such contribution to the allowance so granted.</P>
    <P>Then there are further subsections dealing with the procedure before the District Court and providing that the person liable for maintenance would not have to pay more than the amount of the supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>So far as I have been able to ascertain, from my own personal experience of deserted wives with particular problems&mdash;and I will identify these problems&mdash;and in conversation with social workers and from inquiries that I have made to Women's Aid, who process more than 20 applications for supplementary welfare allowance every week, there has not been evidence of any attempt or willingness by the health boards to invoke section 17 of the 1975 Act.  The information appears to be that this section is somehow under consideration, or it may even be that the health boards are not themselves sure of the jurisdiction.  It is extremely important that we clarify precisely what is meant in section 17 and that it be given a very positive and meaningful interpretation <Col N="590" /> by the health boards; it is a very vital extra hand, or additional support, to deserted wives in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would preface what I am going to say by referring to the problem of deserted wives generally.  It is too broad a subject for the adjournment but it is clear that a deserted wife, left with children, has very difficult choices to make.  Indeed, a report brought out by the Coolock Law Centre on deserted/separated wives' maintenance and social welfare, which was released on 14 November last, identified five basic choices for a deserted wife and six combination choices, making 11 choices in all, as to what she would do in seeking support.</P>
    <P>We must realise that the deserted wife is, initially, in a very difficult position. She must choose whether to apply for maintenance from her husband; whether to apply if eligible, for the deserted wives benefit; whether she can apply for the deserted wives allowance with all the attending conditions; whether to opt for split payments; or whether to fall back on supplementary welfare allowance. Depending on her difficult choice in this very harrowing time for her, she will get differing amounts of money and even differing conditions relating to relief on rent and other assistance.  She is in a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>I turn to a particular problem where section 17 would be a necessary help and support, in certain circumstances.  I refer to the situation where a woman has taken out a maintenance order and her husband defaults in paying&mdash;either he goes on sick pay, or as very often happens in these circumstances, he becomes unemployed, perhaps for a short time, perhaps for a longer time.  The net result to the unfortunate deserted wife with the children is that she gets half the amount of the maintenance order, or perhaps nothing at all or occasional payments. We all know cases of that.  Everybody doing advisory work in a clinic in a constituency&mdash;in Dublin particularly and around the country&mdash;knows of defaults in payments and of the evasion of responsibility in these matters.</P>
    <P>I would mention a recent typical case <Col N="591" /> which I encountered in the Rathmines area.  It is a case of a deserted wife who has three young children under the age of ten.  She has three other children but those three are being maintained by her as young, dependent children.  She took out a maintenance order against her husband and the District Court awarded her £30 maintenance.  Her husband was not paying, so she got an attachment order; in other words she has tried through the courts under the Family Law legislation to go as far as she can.  The husband has now gone on sick pay for an indefinite time.  So, instead of getting £30 a week&mdash;which is not a great deal of money to try to feed and clothe and house three young children and herself&mdash;she gets £12.25p.  She gets that £12.25p by taking a bus from the heart of Crumlin down to the family law office in Ormond House where she collects her £12.25.  She then has to take another bus to her employers' place and get a letter from them saying that £12.25p is all she gets under the attachment of earnings. She then takes another bus right back to the heart of Crumlin again, to the community welfare officer on the Old County Road, produces this letter and gets, not usually cash&mdash;by then it is late on Friday afternoon and the community welfare officer has no money left, as happens so often on Friday in these offices&mdash;but a food voucher.  That unfortunate woman traipses around the city every week and seems to have no way of improving her situation.</P>
    <P>If section 17 were given meaning, how would it help that particular woman and any other woman with a maintenance order, where there is default by the husband?  If the default continues over a number of weeks and places a woman in this kind of hardship and difficulty&mdash;a difficulty that can be totally compounded if there was something like a bus strike&mdash;what does a woman like that do?  She has to get somebody to look after her children while she traipses around the city from office to office.  If section 17 was being used and had the meaning that it is clearly intended to have in the wording of the Act, then, after the establishment of a default of <Col N="592" /> this sort, in getting maintenance a deserted wife in those circumstances should be able to waive any maintenance, if she is getting partial maintenance, or show that she is getting no maintenance at all, or that it is so irregular that it is not a genuine maintenance but only an occasional payment which is something placing her in total financial insecurity.  If she establishes that, then, from that moment, the health board should pay her the full supplementary welfare allowance&mdash;the minimum that the State believes that somebody can live on.  It is the absolute rockbottom minimum.  She would get her £22 odd a week to look after herself and her three children.  She would get the security of a cash sum every week and no pressure.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of pressure exercised by the community welfare officers on women trying to receive the supplementary welfare allowance, week by week.  They are asked why do they not go after the husband; why do they not take out another court order; why do they not look for an attachment of earnings. It is totally unfair and cruel to require the deserted wife, in those instances, to try to get further legal redress against the husband.  She has exhausted her remedies and should be able to rely on the security of supply of the supplementary welfare allowance.  The health board should go against the husband; they should proceed in the District Court to get the balance or the equivalent of the amount in supplementary allowance on the grounds that the husband has a duty to maintain, should have been maintaining and is in a position to maintain his wife and children.  If the health board ascertains that the husband is not in a position, has no means, is genuinely unemployed and cannot afford maintenance, then after a period of a secure flow of money at the minimum level of the supplementary welfare allowance, a woman, in those circumstances, should be allowed to transfer over to the deserted wives' allowance or, if she qualifies, to the deserted wives' benefit.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will accept that this is one of the major problems in this <Col N="593" /> whole area, the lack of any possibility of transferring, the lack of any link between what happens under the supplementary welfare allowance and the other allowances, such as the deserted wives' allowance. That is going a little bit outside the terms of this matter on the adjournment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other examples, apart from the example I gave, of cases where section 17 could be an invaluable extra support to a deserted wife who encounters obstacles in trying to get maintenance.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the particular problem is the lack of definition of what is meant by a deserted wife under the Social Welfare Act 1970; under section 22 of that Act, there is no definition of a deserted wife.  There is a provision that a woman cannot qualify for the allowance unless she has been deserted by her husband. The criterion appears to be not desertion but disappearance; it does not include constructive desertion or does not include desertion where the woman knows the whereabouts of her husband but cannot, for very understandable reasons, proceed against him.</P>
    <P>A woman may very well know where her husband is but be advised, or know herself, that she should not make any approach to her husband because of a history of violence to her or to the children.  There you have a woman whose husband may, in fact, be in a position to maintain her but who is not in a position to take out any maintenance against him because of the physical risk to her health and that of her children, and who should not have further contact with him.  That is an example where the health board should move in and should, first of all, give her the supplementary allowance; pursue the husband for his contribution and, if he is not in a position to maintain her, transfer her quickly and directly to the deserted wives' allowance.  Another example would be a woman who is too ill, suffering from a nervous or physical illness, and who cannot bring an action for maintenance in the courts but can ascertain her husband's whereabouts. She comes up against this terrible problem that she must take out <Col N="594" /> proceedings against her husband or she will not qualify for the deserted wives' allowance. She then goes along to seek the supplementary welfare allowance but there is always the implication that she should be doing more to chase up her husband, that she cannot be coming back every week to obtain supplementary welfare allowance.  That is, undoubtedly, the attitude in a number of the offices.  If a woman is coming back, week by week, to the community welfare office, she does not get a welcome.  She is told she should be trying to take out a maintenance order against her husband, or applying for the deserted wives' allowance. She applies for the deserted wives' allowance, knows the whereabouts of her husband and has not taken out maintenance against him, so her chances of getting the deserted wives' allowance may be very slim.  It is a catch 22 position.</P>
    <P>A terrible problem which Women's Aid may encounter again and again is of a woman who may have taken out a maintenance order but has to leave her area and come to Dublin because of the violence encountered in her home.  These are the really sad cases.  Again and again, it is the unfortunate, deserted wife with young children who has to cope with the inadequacy of the system.  In these circumstances, section 17 has particular importance and is, in a sense, an innovation; this does not apply in the Social Welfare Act 1970 and, unfortunately, it does not apply right across the board in relation to deserted wives' allowances and deserted wives' benefit.</P>
    <P>The section is of importance here because, in all these cases, the woman needs the security of a supply of money; security of supply is very often more important than the exact amount.  Regular receipt of even the minimum amount of the £22-odd is better than the occasional £30 and nothing the following week. Nobody can try to feed, clothe and bring up children on that basis of harrowing uncertainty.  Any woman in those circumstances should be able immediately to invoke the assistance of the health board, who should pay her the supplementary allowance and tell her that she can come back each week and get the full allowance in cash and that they <Col N="595" /> will proceed in the District Court against the husband to enforce a maintenance order, or to get as much in maintenance as possible, or take out maintenance in the first place against him, whatever the case may be.  If the health board has the view that the husband is genuinely unable to maintain the woman, she should be transferred to the deserted wives' allowance and continue to have, at a slightly higher level, her security of flow of money.</P>
    <P>If this section were to be given active implementation by the health board, if they understood what I believe is a legislative intent, then it would be the first step in the right direction towards the kind of approach we should have to deserted wives or, indeed, to deserted spouses; sometimes it is the husband who is deserted and left with the children.</P>
    <P>What we need is a guaranteed income to the deserted wife and children stright away; no three months' waiting period. If there is to be a follow-up in looking for maintenance from the husband who is in a position to maintain, and legally obliged to maintain, that should be done by the welfare authority.  That is the procedure in other jurisdictions, and is the only procedure which will remove from the deserted wife the burden, the often unacceptable position, of trying to sue her husband through the courts.  The constant racket that goes on when a deserted wife gets a maintenance order is that the husband goes unemployed, or goes sick, or disappears for a while, and terrible hardship is caused by this.  It is a major area of real hardship.  It would be a major improvement to a number of deserted wives just to have the security of a cash flow of about £22 a week.  We should all think deeply about that, about how one can try to manage, in this day and age, on that kind of income.  Yet, this is by no means an unusual position of a deserted wife in these circumstances. Very often, she will not get much more than that, anyway, in a maintenance order against her husband in the District Court and will have no secure guarantee that he will pay it. Even if she takes out an attachment <Col N="596" /> order, he can avoid it by going unemployed, or on sick pay, or simply disappearing.</P>
    <P>The problem is a very real and a very acute one.  The way to resolve it is to give section 17 full and meaningful implementation and to continue this approach by amending the Social Welfare Act 1970.</P>

      <P>I was a little confused and puzzled when I came across the notice of intention by Senator Robinson to raise this particular matter on the adjournment, as I could not visualise what exactly Senator Robinson might have in mind.  I regret to say that, having listened to the Senator, I am still not clear precisely which benefits she hopes to achieve by this.  Indeed, I cannot follow her line of reasoning.</P>
      <P>First of all, Senator Robinson is totally wrong in saying that the provision, section 17, was inserted into the supplementary welfare allowance legislation for a specific purpose.  It was not; it is an old, Victorian hangover.  It is carried forward from the Public Assistance Act 1939 and repeated, but the public Assistance Act 1939 made wider provisions for recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They were never implemented because they should not be.  I did not interrupt the Senator.  Senator Robinson maintained that this was inserted for a specific purpose into the supplementary welfare allowance legislation. I am making the point that it was not.  When the legislation was going through there was no advertence of any significance made to it.  In fact, as I say, it is an old, Victorian concept, carried forward from the public assistance system.  The theory behind it, apparently, was that, if the benevolent State or local authority or public assistance authority, out of the goodness of their heart gave out money as maintenance to some citizens, the citizen who had a legal responsibility for maintaining that person should repay that money to the Exchequer.  It was really intended in ease <Col N="597" /> of the taxpayer, or the ratepayer, as he probably was in those days.  It had nothing to do with the merits of the maintenance or benefit payable to the needy individual.  It was simply acting on the principle that a husband, father or mother had the responsibility for maintaining a necessitous person and that, while the public assistance authority would give some maintenance, the necessitous person should as quickly as possible go after somebody and get it back so that the rate payers would not be at any expense.  That is all it is.</P>

      <P>It would be of no benefit to the deserted wife.  Senator Robinson is completely confusing the issue. The Department of Social Welfare or the health board, or whichever body is concerned, should pay the appropriate amount to a deserted wife or to any other beneficiary, without any reference to whether or not they ever get it back. To accept Senator Robinson's line of thinking on this would be a disastrous principle: that health boards should be directed to go after people to recoup benefits paid to necessitous people.</P>

      <P>It would be a disastrous principle.  Senator Robinson is totally confused and wrong about this.  If she argues with me that we should facilitate and expedite the payment of supplementary welfare allowances to deserted wives and others, I would certainly agree with that, and would regard it as my duty and responsibility to see that a supplementary welfare allowance scheme works as perfectly and as easily as possible, in all cases.  That is a completely separate issue altogether from the matter of whether or not the appropriate public authority gets that money back from somebody.  In fact, it might inhibit <Col N="598" /> a local authority or a health board in paying out some suitable allowance if they had a mandatory directive principle that they must recoup it from somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Senator is saying.  She wants a clear indication given in section 17 to be implemented. It is permissive at the moment. I understood the Senator to say that we should make it explicit that the health boards should go after people. Any Senator who thinks about it for a moment will understand that that would be a restricting and inhibiting influence on the public authority, who would be less inclined to pay out supplementary welfare allowances if there was an obligation on them in all cases to go after somebody and to recover that money.</P>
      <P>I think the Senator is confused about this.  I sympathise with what she is thinking about here, the situation of the deserted wife.  I cannot agree with her that it would be desirable to adopt as an operative principle that we should put maintenance aside and go for the supplementary welfare allowance in these cases.  I was a member of one of the committees that brought in that Family Law Bill, and we were at the time all delighted with it.  We thought it was going to be the answer to all our worries in this area.  It provided its own machinery, simplified procedures for deserted wives to get maintenance.  I think that the Senator would be going in altogether the wrong direction, and it was implicit in what she was saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about when there is an obstacle in maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What she is saying is that maintenance is an unreliable, casual matter, that it is not a very satisfactory medium and that, therefore, we should really not be very concerned with maintenance, that we should go for supplementary welfare allowances; in fact, that it would be better if the health boards ignored maintenance altogether <Col N="599" /> and did not encourage deserted wives to go for it, but instead gave them supplementary welfare allowances.  I think that would be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not as well versed in this area as others are, but I do think that the right approach here is, first of all, to try to perfect family law.  If it is not functioning, let us try to improve it and make it function.  This is not my responsibility; it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  But I do think the principle of maintenance is a very desirable one, and that there should be an easy procedure&mdash;and we all thought when passing this legislation, that we were laying down simplified procedures&mdash;whereby a deserted wife could get maintenance.  Furthermore, we imported into that legislation&mdash;and I pay full tribute to Senator Cooney, who was the author of that legislation&mdash;very draconian provisions for the enforcement of maintenance.  As I say, we thought that was going to be the answer to our problems as far as the deserted wife was concerned.  If it is not working satisfactorily&mdash;and there is some evidence that it is not&mdash;do not let us get away from <Col N="600" /> the principle of maintenance.  That is the fair principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the fair principle, but who is going to collect the maintenance?  It is the welfare authorities that should collect the maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was laid down in the legislation.  If Senator Robinson now wants to abandon that family law legislation, that is one case.</P>
