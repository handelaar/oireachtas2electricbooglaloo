      <P>I have notice from Senator Connaughton that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The extension of the 30-day test period.</P>
      <P>This matter has important implications for the cattle trade and disease eradication policy and I consider it too wide to be dealt with under the half-hour Adjournment procedure.  In the circumstances I must rule that the matter of which Senator Connaughton has given notice is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>The Senator's motion was ruled out of order because its scope is so wide and because this is a very important motion.  Therefore, I would respectfully suggest to the Senator that he put it down as a motion for discussion in the House rather than have it limited to the very small period of a half an hour in which he could not do justice to it nor could other Senators join in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the original intention to introduce a single Bill to regulate both occasional and roadside trading but it has been found necessary to proceed on the basis of two Bills.  Legislation in this general area impinges upon the rights of individuals and great care has had to be taken to ensure that the constitutional rights of persons are not infringed.  Very complex problems which could not be solved quickly were encountered when the question of regulating roadside trading was examined.  In particular, in the case of outdoor trading which is carried on at public markets and fairs by virtue of royal charters and letters patent granted in previous centuries it was felt that it would take a considerable time, in view of constitutional difficulties, to arrive at an acceptable method of modifying, or perhaps even extinguishing, these rights and making suitable alternative provision for such <Col N="198" /> classes of street trading as are deemed not to be contrary to the public interest. For instance trading in livestock is one class of roadside trading for which adequate provision must be maintained.  It was in these circumstances that it was decided to proceed with two Bills rather than one.  However, a draft of a Bill to regulate roadside trading is being examined in consultation with other interested Departments and I hope to have it ready for circulation at an early date. It is my intention to avoid unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>For some years past representations have been made by and on behalf of established traders, their staffs and their customers about the activities of traders who hire hotels, dance-halls, vacant shop premises or other places for a short time&mdash;sometimes a day or two, sometimes several weeks&mdash;for the purpose of retail selling.  These traders frequently advertise their activities as monster sales or auctions.  Provided these traders take out hawkers' licences and provided their use of premises' as shops is not in contravention of the Planning Acts, they are not committing any offence.  A hawker's licence costs only £20 and, therefore, this requirement is not a significant burden on occasional traders and could not be regarded as an adequate control of them.</P>
    <P>As regards the Planning Acts, it will often happen that premises are occupied and vacated by an occasional trader before anyone has a chance of challenging the statutory right to use the premises as a shop.  Quite often it will be obvious from previous use of the premises as a shop that no contravention of the Planning Acts arises and, at times, the position of premises under the Planning Acts can be quite obscure.  The overall situation is that if a person takes out a hawker's licence he or she has little if anything to fear from the law.  It will be apparent, therefore, that virtually no controls on this form of trading exist at present.</P>
    <P>A study of occasional trading was carried out by the Restrictive Practices Commission at the request of the <Col N="199" /> Minister in 1976 and their report was published.  All of the submissions made to the commission and all the representations made to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy have been critical of occasional traders.  None has made a submission supporting them. Those who made submissions to the commission and to the Department included trade unions, trade associations, individual traders, chambers of commerce, local development associations and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Occasional trading was described by the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks as a form of piracy which took a considerable amount of trade out of a town, affected sales in particular goods for a considerable time ahead and threatened employment in the distributive sector.  All bodies who made submissions to the Restrictive Practices Commission agreed in saying that occasional trading was unfair because the organisers of such trading were in a privileged position since they did not incur the expenses of overheads, taxes and other commitments which local traders have to meet.  Selling at dumped prices was also alleged.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the Minister for Finance included a provision in this year's Finance Act for the collection of VAT at the point of importation from traders who have no permanent place of business in the State.  Furthermore, I am assured that the Revenue Commissioners have taken steps to collect the appropriate taxes from occasional traders.  However, it is clear that, even if these traders pay their full taxes, they do enjoy a competitive advantage over established traders and, on account of their mobility, it is frequently difficult for consumers to get any sort of after-sales services from them.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission were urged by the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks and other bodies to recommend prohibition of occasional trading.  I think it is a fair summation of the Restrictive Practices Commission report to say that, in several <Col N="200" /> respects, the complaint about occasional traders was found to be over-stated. Nevertheless, the commission accepted that there were particular risks to the consumers in occasional sales and that such sales can have a severe if temporary effect on local traders in the goods concerned.  The commission did not consider the total prohibition of occasional trading to be feasible.  They pointed out that manufacturers and wholesalers regularly rent rooms in hotels for the display of their goods and their sale to traders.  But the commission recommended that where a person engages in retail trading for a brief period in a place where he does not usually reside or carry on business he should require a permit from the local authority in respect of each day's trading.</P>
    <P>This recommendation has, basically, been accepted but it has been decided that the permits to engage in occasional trading should be granted by the Minister rather than by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Occasional Trading Bill proposes in section 2 to define occasional trading as retailing at a premises or place&mdash;other than a public road or other place to which the public have access as of right&mdash;of which the person so selling has been in continuous occupation for less than three months.  A very limited range of selling activities which are deemed not to be contrary to the public interest are excluded from the definition.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 provide that persons proposing to engage in trading to which the Bill applies will be required to apply in writing to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy for a permit which will cost £50 plus £25 for every day or part of a day on which he proposes to trade at the one place.  This application for a permit will have to be made 30 days before trading commences. The Minister may attach conditions to the permit.  A person who proposes to trade at the one place for longer than three months&mdash;that is to say a person who proposes to be a permanent or established trader at the one <Col N="201" /> place&mdash;need not take out a permit if he makes a statutory declaration of his intention and gives the statement to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a person engaging in occasional trading will be required to display his occasional trading permit at or near the place where the trading takes place.  Section 7 requires an advertisement relating to occasional trading to contain the number of the trading permit and the name and address of the person to whom it was issued.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the proposed legislation.  A person intending to engage in occasional trading will have to give reasonable notice of his intentions; he will have to make a reasonable contribution to the Exchequer which, while it may seem large to some people, is unlikely to go further than meeting the cost of administering the Act; and an occasional trader will have to let his customers and other interested parties verify that he has paid for a permit and they can make a note of his name and permanent address in case they have any reason for wanting to get in touch with him at a later date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking to this Occasional Trading Bill, 1979.  In the first instance I want to re-echo some of the <Col N="202" /> remarks made in Dáil Éireann when this subject was debated.  We are talking about occasional trading, which is in itself important, but it is of very much lesser significance than the main road area which is causing public disquiet, namely the roadside trading aspect of this issue.  The Minister states that there were difficulties in bringing in the two matters in the same Bill and that for this reason we are dealing with occasional trading first.  I emphasise, however, that roadside trading is by far the more important issue and numerically would probably account for about 97 per cent of the type of trading in general which we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that we have not had legislation in regard to roadside trading so far.  The background to it is that the Restrictive Practices Commission issued a report in July 1976, about three and a half years ago, and various promises of legislation emanated from that study which have yet to be fulfilled.  The promises were made in November-December, 1978.  A year later this legislation has not emerged and that is a much more serious issue than the relatively slender matter which we are discussing here today.  One has to have reservations about the slowness of pace in public life in this country.  Of course, I am not attacking the Minister personally in this regard, but complex problems that cannot be solved quickly and issues regarding royal charters and letters patent are not sufficient excuse for such terribly long delays in introducing legislation.  Is there to be any dynamism in Irish public life?  When people outside the public arena can motivate themselves and get their affairs moving in so much more quickly a fashion than we do, Parliament is going to be held in contempt if we continue these delays.  I have in front of me the Official Report of the Dáil for 17 October when the Minister stated that the two issues could not be brought in together and also that the other matter was being looked at and would be introduced as quickly as possible. It is now 21 November which is about five weeks subsequent to that, and if we are serious about this other matter, <Col N="203" /> then some reference should have been made to it in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>What we have is a stereotyped reiteration of what the Minister said in the Dáil on 17 October.  There has been no reference in this House to what happened in that five weeks and what the updating of the position is on roadside trading which is the most significant part of this entire issue.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill for many reasons.  It attempts to regularise a position which was very unsatisfactory from many points of view.  If we take this matter of people moving into dance-halls or town halls to sell goods, coming in off a wagon and moving off the next day, as a broader issue of roadside trading, established traders in this country have had very genuine grievances.  I am glad that the Bill is not going to abolish street trading, or occasional trading.  That would not be its purpose and such action would not be democratic, but control is necessary.  The established traders make regular returns of their accounts and pay value-added tax and social insurance regularly.  They are working under a trade union structure where they are paying decent wages.  They are in the business of paying rates and rents and all that goes with being part of the establishment of a town.  What was not referred to in the Dáil speeches was the fact that the existing traders in a town are part of the social fabric of that town, and if they are making profits, these profits are being spent in their own community, and are contributions to the social organisations and Churches of which they are members.  They have had to face a type of trading which has been unfair, where some traders in the occasional category have been abusing their democratic right in areas of tax, social insurance and wages and in some instances in the selling of shabby goods without the consumers having any guarantee of compensation or any ability to fight back if they got a raw deal.  This still is very necessary, and on this side of the House we welcome it and have very little quibble with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> It is better, as contained in the Bill, that permits are issued by the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy rather than by the local authorities as the Restrictive Practices Commission have recommended.  If the local authorities were in the business of issuing these licences one might not get an even-handedness in the sense that there would not be uniformity in the Twenty-six counties which contain the Republic of Ireland.  One would get uniformity and more objectivity if this was administered from the Department, and this is the sensible approach.</P>
    <P>The level of fees which the traders are asked to pay for their licences is reasonable&mdash;a permit for £50 and £25 per day.  If the occasional traders want to continue this type of trading, they have to pay into the kitty a sum of money which puts them into much the same ball park as the established traders on the streets of the town.</P>
    <P>I have not read the Committee detail of this Bill, but I gather from the speeches in the Dáil that traditional areas such as fish and fruit are exempt from this.  Fish has traditionally been sold in this manner rather than in shops, particularly in country districts where there are not specific fish shops, so there is good reason for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the Dáil the intention of exempting showroom exhibits of manufacturers and genuine wholesalers from the provisions of this Bill.  An established practice has been to have such exhibits in town halls and hotels here.  This is not in a sense selling, it is trading in the sense of showing goods and is an area which should be exempt.  I will not say much more on this, as we will be taking Committee Stage next week, or when the Minister chooses to do so.  Representations have been made to us on a number of issues a very short time ago and we have not had much time to study the Committee details as much as we would like to.</P>
    <P>It is not altogether valid to say that this legislation must be concluded in this House today, because Christmas is coming and we must implement this for <Col N="205" /> Christmas.  We have had about 51 Christmases since we established this State and we are talking about the background of the Restrictive Practices Report in July 1976 which left about three years to do something about getting legislation through the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is not desirable that we should be stampeded today for the very reason of having it done for this Christmas.  Let us treat this legislation with the same respect as we would give to other legislation.  In the most general terms I welcome this Bill on behalf of my party and myself.  It is long overdue, and I hope that it will be followed very soon by the more substantial Bill relating to roadside trading.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag cur fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Tá géarghá leis, ach ar ndóigh tá níos mó géarghá ag baint le Bille srian a chur ar thrádáil ar thaobh an bhóthair.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is part of a step to bring under control certain types of activities which are undesirable, particularly in relation to their effect on employment. The contribution by the Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks highlights this.  The two aspects of trading, roadside and the occasional shop as one might call it, are a fairly recent development, and they come under the heading of unfair trading in the sense that ordinary commercial people who run shops and have to pay full-time staffs, rates, rent and so on, are all making a contribution to society and providing steady employment.  Those who are hopping in and out of vacant premises, taking advantage of a temporary demand for some particular article or some series of articles, are simply engaging in a form of what one could call méféinism and are not really making any very useful contribution.  This applies particularly to the development of roadside trading which had led to a very undesirable situation, and I urge the Minister to process that Bill into legislation as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a couple of questions to put to the Minister.  I take it that the Minister will not be in a position to refuse a <Col N="206" /> licence.  If the Minister has the right to refuse a licence will there be gounds for it?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the fact that there is a change from seeking permission from a local authority to seeking permission from the Minister. Had the thinking behind the original idea of seeking it from a local authority anything to do with the possibility of a local authority being able to make some sort of special rate demand in the case of a vacant premises that may be in use perhaps for only a week and where possibly the local authority would not be in a position even to find out quickly enough who was doing the trading?  The comparison between both the roadside trader and the occasional trader of this kind and the ordinary business establishments who throughout the State are paying hundreds of thousands of pounds in rate contributions highlights the need for this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister have the right, for example, to refuse a licence to people who hold these sorts of public auctions in vacant premises?  I have noticed this taking place quite recently in O'Connell Street in Dublin.  Will there be any control over that kind of activity? Presumably persons engaging in that should have auctioneers' licences if they are engaging in auctioneering.  Will that aspect of it, the taking over of a vacant premises for a few days or a week or two or three weeks and engaging in what appears to be a public auction, come under control from the Minister?</P>
    <P>Apart from those questions I welcome this Bill and urge the House to pass it as quickly as is reasonably possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to hold up this Bill.  I have a certain interest in it because it was in my time in office that the matter was referred to the Restrictive Practices Commission. whose report strikes a correct balance. Legislation of this kind is always a matter of balance.  This is a good Bill because, on the one hand, we are all aware of, and as public representatives of one kind or another we all have had representations about, the sort of abuses <Col N="207" /> that gave rise to the necessity for this Bill.  Going beyond those abuses we know that the traders who have premises, who are long established companies, who have to meet all their overheads, have a continuing objection to more casual forms of trading, even when those more casual forms of trading are legitimate.  The IUDWC took a very strong line against occasional trading.  I understand that, but I do not agree with it and I think the balance that this Bill has struck is the correct one.  How poor life would be, particularly the life of towns and villages and the countryside, if a whole series of activities were to be prohibited.  They are activities that are commercially valuable but they are also enjoyable and colourful.  Whether it be a fair, whether it be the sort of selling that goes on at a race meeting, whether it be the sale of handicrafts along the side of a road where somebody says, &ldquo;I will stop my car and I will go in and get a thing like that&rdquo;, whether it be the activities of people with barrows, whether it be to get an ice-cream on a hot day when you feel like one, these are all both pleasurable and useful and they provide services that can be provided from the more permanent sort of premises.  Therefore the balance is right, and I welcome the Bill. The Minister will find that the attitude from the whole of the Seanad when it comes to Committee Stage is that we want to see the Bill enacted.  Even if there have been half a century of Christmases, it is still desirable that we do something in relation to this one, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make this single wider observation. This Bill is one half of the necessary legislation in regard to trading. That is acknowledged by the Minister. We are promised the other half.  I know from my own recollections of discussions that that other half is not easy to do because, as the Minister points out in her speech, one is into the area of the Constitution.  I do not propose a lengthy digression on that.  From my own experience, I can think of a number of times when constitutional issues were a <Col N="208" /> major inhibition to necessary and pressing legislation.  I offer the frightful and heartbreaking example of mining legislation as perhaps the more economically important one.  I therefore draw the conclusion that our Constitution is a barrier to doing things that we ought to be doing and that seems to me yet another reason why we ought to change it.  I completely accept the Minister's explanation of delay.  It is not in her Department.</P>
    <P>The delays happen when it goes off to the Attorney General; the Attorney General and then the drafting people have a go at it; then it goes back to the Attorney General; then it goes out for some legal advice and then constitutional lawyers work on it.  At that stage it is entirely outside the grip of Ministers or their servants; at that stage impermissible delays occur.</P>
    <P>I am not going to labour this point because we will have plenty of opportunities to discuss it under other legislation in other debates.  This whole constitutional issue will be coming up for a long time.  It is going to become quite an important issue in public life.  From personal experience I can corroborate the existence of the sort of delays the Minister indicates in preparing the other half of the necessary legislation to regulate trading.</P>
    <P>Having said that I welcome the Bill. The report of the commission struck a proper balance between the rights of the employers and trade unions on the one side and the rights of bona fide occasional traders and the public in general on the other side.  It seems to have got it about right.  I am glad about the exemptions set out in section 2.  When we come to the later stages we will certainly try to facilitate its enactment.</P>

      <P>I extend a hearty welcome to this Bill. I understand the Minister's difficulties in relation to occasional trading and roadside trading.  They are two different disciplines. Please God the other Bill will come through later on and we will then have a look at it.</P>
      <P>Many of these gentlemen indulging in occasional trading come from places other than Ireland.  Years ago I remember seeing the first of those gentlemen in operation in Oxford Street in London.  I notice in the Minister's statement today what the distributive workers' union said about their activities.  They described them as piracy.  I could not help thinking that they might have described it as piracy on the high streets because that is actually what is happening.  Whatever kind of gift they have, as the seanfhocal says, &ldquo;d'fhéadfaidis muc d'áiteamh ar shagart&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a godsend that this Bill has come because there is a human tendency to be attracted to these people.  I often go into town just to hear their patter, their style and their technique.  It is absolutely fascinating; it is splendid entertainment provided one is not led into buying something that one does not want.  Hundreds of people go to these places every <Col N="210" /> day and buy things they do not want at all and had no intention of buying.  I have seen this technique being displayed to such effect that people are actually prepared to offer money to buy a closed packet; they do not even know what is in it.  These people can do all these things and make a great profit and I am sure they do not return all their accounts to the Revenue Commissioners.  They have no overheads to pay and they can make a quick buck and get away very fast.</P>
    <P>The nicest thing in that Bill is section 7 which says:</P>
    <P>An advertisement relating to occasional trading to which section 3 of this Act applies shall not be published unless there is in force an occasional trading permit authorising the trading and the advertisement contains the number of the permit and the name and address of the person to whom it was granted.</P>
    <P>It is very important for a purchaser to know the name and address of the person who sold him an article because if there is one thing more important than another about articles bought it is the after sales service.  I am sure the gentlemen engaging in this trade have little or no intention of providing any after sales service for anybody.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I hope it will be law before the Christmas season gets really under way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak briefly in welcoming this legislation.  I regret, as the Minister has regretted, the limitations placed on it by constitutional difficulties. In all consumer protection legislation we have to keep in mind that, as in other areas of human activity, we really cannot legislate human stupidity out of existence. Neither can we legislate for human cupidity which works on both sides of occasional trading.  The main point I am making on this Bill is that the fact that we are discussing it here and that it has relatively quickly come to us and will be getting a speedy passage through the House is in no small way due to some very responsible investigative <Col N="211" /> journalism which was done on this subject over the last year.  This is how the abuses of public trust that were being carried out by various fly-by-night operators first came to my notice.</P>
      <P>I am referring particularly to the journal that we all like to hate sometimes, <i>Hibernia.</i>  It ran a very good series of articles between November 1978 and May 1979 on various sales which were run under headlines such as &ldquo;£2,000,000 smash sale.  There's never been anything like this.&rdquo; and investigated what they called &ldquo;The Dutch Connection.&rdquo;  It certainly struck me as being very worthwhile reporting and very worthwhile social and responsible journalism. Perhaps we are not always very enamoured of journals which investigate things too deeply but in this instance they and the other immediate people who pointed out this abuse which has resulted in this admirable legislation should be congratulated.</P>
      <P>Another reason why I am very interested in this&mdash;and in any consumer legislation&mdash;is that the Minister, I am sure, is very well aware that out of every £100 spent on consumer goods, women spend £80.  That is a very significant figure particularly as we come up to Christmas.  It has been mentioned that there have been lots of previous Christmases but it is particularly apt that we should be protecting the people who go out to spend money at Christmas; they do so usually with the best intentions and usually for other people.  For that reason it is excellent that we should be passing this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would emphasise the after-sales area of protection for the consumer. It is vitally important because, as anybody who buys fairly complicated modern equipment for the house or any other area knows, one is completely at the mercy of the sellers of these articles if one cannot get them serviced after the sale.  In the recent big panic that there has been for buying stoves and back boiler arrangements because of the energy crisis many people have said to me that there has been a great deal of <Col N="212" /> trouble with after-sales service.  This is an area in any consumer legislation that must be very carefully handled.  I do not wish to say any more about this Bill but I welcome it and I am very glad to help to pass it quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate that the House should regard this Bill as a measure designed to protect the consumer because the consumer in this type of operation is concerned only with buying something far cheaper than he would get it from an established trader.  He is looking for a bargain. Therefore he is quite prepared to forego after-sales service, guarantees and such matters.  He is prepared, in fact, to buy a pig in a poke.  Therefore it would be neither possible nor reasonable to expect the Legislature to protect him in such an operation.</P>
      <P>But in so far as the Bill is designed to regulate the operation of this type of trader whose activities have been for a long time a legitimate cause for concern to established traders, to trade unions and to members of trade unions, and in so far as it will help the authorities to ensure that occasional traders pay their fair share of taxes, this is a necessary and a welcome Bill and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, will probably add something to the balance of the arguments in favour of this Bill.  Senator Keating mentioned the whole question of balance and it was appropriate that he should.  It is significant that the Minister, when she introduced the Bill, referred to the fact that opinions had been received from so many organisations on the subject. Down through the years, as every public representative knows, opinions have always been available on this subject purely from one side of the area involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back over quite a number of the Bills that have been introduced here, looking at the trend in our society generally where legislation is very often the result of pressure by one group or another we see legislation which is indirectly, <Col N="213" /> legislation by the pressure group.</P>
    <P>While I accept it and agree with Senator Keating that the Minister has achieved the right balance and has not been diverted from doing what is best, I cannot pretend that I do not see in this legislation the unfavourable balance of opinion which has been going around on the whole subject.  The people engaged in this sort of trading are, more or less, on the periphery of society.  They are people we do not know.  We do not know whether they vote or how they vote and we do not know what their political views are.  As a result we might tend to forget about them as a section of our community which need our protection and our assistance and all the consideration that this House is obliged to give any section of people, however small and weak, who have not got a voice of their own.</P>
    <P>It seems we are affecting here, by this legislation, a group of people who have not got a voice of their own.  I could make the case for the other side but my colleague, Senator Staunton, has done that in an admirable way and I agree with everything he has said.  Nevertheless nobody has quantified the hardship or the suffering that will be imposed as a result of this legislation, and every legislation imposes hardship on somebody by way of restrictions or restraints which create problems.  I certainly hope that the Minister, in her own way when considering it, has quantified the disadvantages.  I hope she has considered the number of jobs involved, if we may call them jobs and there probably are jobs involved, and the disruption to a way of life of a section of our community however small they may be; nevertheless they require to be thought about just like any other section when we make legislation affecting their future.</P>
    <P>That is the principal point I wanted to make.  We have heard all the good arguments being put forward by every group, one after another, when promoting their own vested interests, their concern for the well-being of society, their concern lest illegalities take place, their concern <Col N="214" /> for the consumer and the right to after-sales service and so on.  Quite honestly I do not accept all that.  I do not accept that this is the reason behind all the agitation to get legislation on the Statute Book and therefore I would treat this as the represenations of a group of people concerned to protect their own interests. I agree that there is a lot of substance in what they say.  Nevertheless in bringing forward legislation, now and in the future, we must consider that people with money at their disposal and the ability to write reports and make submissions can sometimes have an undue concern for their own problems when legislation is being prepared.  We must remember that there are still many practices throughout industry where legislation, in the long run, may cause greater problems than the one we are legislating for here today.  Do we understand the whole grain trade of this country?  In the hands of how many people is the power to affect prices and influence the whole business?  Do we know what has happened in the energy market as a result of oil price increases?  How many people make the decisions on the prices that are being charged for coal and turf and other things at this moment and who has got the fantastic rake-off in profits that there must have been in those areas?</P>
    <P>This is an area which has been much talked about and the people who are being legislated for have not had an articulate defender at any stage.  It worries me slightly.  Let us leave aside the fact that some of those people would indeed exchange their positions for a well placed shop on a busy corner and the security and everything that goes with it.  Some of them have developed towards that through the years and if too severe restrictions were placed in their paths at the start perhaps they would never have graduated to their present position.  I have watched one street trader improve his stall through the years and make it bigger eventually; I have seen a site being bought and a big business go up. Perhaps it is not necessary for me to say this but because the other arguments have been so well put I would like to add that side to the balance.  I believe the <Col N="215" /> Minister is seeking in a responsible way to regulate this business and to ensure that those who operate business within our society with the assistance of the law and of our structures and so on pay their fair share of the contribution to the public effort.  I felt that the other side of the argument needed to be put because of the abuses that have come to my notice in this whole area have not been from the group of people legislated for here but from the wider and more important area of the street and roadside traders.</P>
    <P>It is true that we cannot legislate for the people who will insist on buying things that they do not need or on buying goods of an inferior nature.  We certainly will never solve these problems by legislating.  We will not stop the weak-minded mother from buying toys every time she goes to a shop for her groceries; we will not convince some people that the cheapest article is not always best. But very often it is important that they have the choice because I know people who have got good bargains from street traders and casual traders and there is a place for them.  I agree with the legislation as a move towards introducing order into an area where order did not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  I do not want to go over again what has been said about the various reasons. Senator Staunton made most of the points in his speech.  It is sufficient to say that this legislation will protect those with roots in the community against those who will not have roots.  At the same time it will not cut out occasional traders who are a benefit to the community and to whom the Minister will still have the right to grant licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also believe that in the short-term it may seem that the consumer is not to benefit but in the long-term he must benefit because in the retail trade, if a retailer is servicing the community, then that retailer has to carry very many lines to give a proper service.  Some of those lines are profitable and some are not so profitable but the retailer has to average. <Col N="216" /> The occasional trader can come in and make a sale on a single profitable line, thereby affecting the sale of that line with the retailer who is giving a proper service.  If that is likely to affect the retailer who is giving a proper service then the consumer must lose out if that service is discontinued because of such competition.  So, in my opinion this is also, in the long-term, protecting the consumer.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister some questions about some parts of the Bill. Section 2 (2) (b) of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>selling at a trade, commercial, agricultural or industrial fair or show that is held wholly or mainly for a purpose other than the selling of goods,</P>
    <P>Certain shows could be maintained to be completely interested in the selling of goods.  An example is the summer show of the Munster Agricultural Society in Cork.  It could be said that that is mainly for the purpose of selling both industrially and in the field of agricultural implements and so on.  But the Munster Agricultural Society, being in occupation for three months is clear; the traders who are selling there are in occasional occupation of their stalls.  Is it possible, because they are selling from a stall, rented for a short period of under three months, that they could come under this Bill?</P>
    <P>The next question is on the same section or paragraph (f) which includes the phrase:</P>
    <P>(other than those cooked at the place of sale),</P>
    <P>Could this affect catering for certain occasions? For example, recently at the opening of Nítrigin Éireann caterers brought down one of the big Papal tents; they gave lunch to 600 people and that lunch was cooked in the tent.  Could it be said that because that meal was sold to Nítrigin Éireann and cooked on the premises, that it was a sale and therefore they would have to have a licence?</P>
    <P>The next section is based on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the necessity for the legislation proposed in this Bill to control occasional sales.  I regret that the Minister has not found it possible to incorporate roadside trading as well because there is no doubt that, of the two types of trading, roadside trading is the more objectionable.  I would hope that her promise to bring in a Bill fairly shortly to deal with this serious problem will be realised.  The obstruction that arises from roadside trading even on primary roads, the mess left behind and the annoyance caused to local people, require to be dealt with urgently.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself controls but does not entirely prohibit occasional trading.  It is important to emphasise the point that there is no total prohibition.  In the same breath I would like to say that certain sections of the general public believe in the myth that they can always obtain value at these occasional sales.  This myth should be exposed for what it is.  I certainly have met with more complaints than compliments from people who have purchased articles of substandard quality at these sales.  Many people have purchased appliances or machines that have failed to work, or have broken down; there is a total absence of after-sales service and this is the order of the day so far as many of these sales are concerned, leaving disappointed and disgruntled customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> In so far as the Bill introduces a measure of control here, I welcome and support it.  Not alone are we in the situation where some of the articles offered for sale at these occasional sales are of doubtful quality but there are people who feel, and with good reason, that the origin of some of these articles is in doubt.  The purpose of the Bill is, I am sure, to provide safeguards but whether these are adequate or not, time will tell.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the effect of the other aspect of occasional trading on the established trader in the unfair competition it creates for him.  The occasional trader who comes into a town or village and rents a dancehall, warehouse, or similar premises for a day or two, perhaps a weekend, and disposes of goods there at cut-down prices is not rendering a good service to the general public.  In addition to this he is rendering a disservice to the established traders in that locality who pay their rent and rates, their VAT, social insurance and wages.  They can, in fact, on occasions put the livelihood of employees of local traders at risk.  We have a duty to do everything possible to extend what protection we can to the established traders in our community.  I am conscious that all reasonable bodies&mdash;trade unions, trade associations, chambers of commerce, local authorities and various others&mdash;are at one in their criticism of the activities of the traders to whom I refer.  These sales can have an upsetting influence on local business without rendering a valuable service or a service of any great value to the community.</P>
    <P>It is also desirable that the general public should be aware of certain sales that are exempted from the terms of this Bill.  There may be a misunderstanding if this point is not clarified effectively.  In so far as the Bill extends a measure of protection to the general public and consumers and to the local traders, I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill, which is very timely. The Minister of State and the Department are to be congratulated on bringing in this Bill which deals with a matter of <Col N="219" /> considerable practical importance and which I should imagine required a lot of drafting and consideration in regard to dealing with many matters going back through the centuries, such as legal rights on trading and original charters.  It seems appropriate that the legislation should be divided into two separate Bills.</P>
      <P>Occasional trading has a very long and in many ways an honourable, history and, certainly, a very traditional history, particularly in this country.  One would not like to see the traditional and worthwhile aspects of occasional trading interfered with.  As one Senator mentioned there have been instances of persons who have started off as occasional traders and later built up quite substantial trading premises and businesses and others who have a family tradition in this particular occupation.  Nonetheless there has been a considerable degree of abuse of the situation over the last few years, something that has been gradually arising over the last 20 or 30 years but which has become much more noticeable in the last five to ten years.  This occasional trading by traditional families and such like persons from this country has been increasingly accompanied by occasional trading by people who are certainly not traditional in the business and whose methods and habits are not set in any sense to the benefit of the consumer. In that respect I would, with great deference to my good colleague, Senator Cassidy, slightly disagree with her.  There is a considerable measure of consumer protection embodied in this Bill and it is very necessary, right and proper that there should be.  The small retailer has a very legitimate and genuine case to put forward.  Perhaps in recent years we have tended to criticise or ignore the small retailers who has played such a valuable and necessary role in our retail business and in our society generally.  It would be a sad day if such people were squeezed out either by anonymous corporations or alternatively by fly-by-night persons&mdash;a bad day not only for the people themselves but for the consumers and for the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> This Bill has a very fair balance of protection for established, legitimate traders and a fair balance for the occasional trader.  I am a little concerned about one aspect of it which brings me back to these cross-channel people, or people from outside the jurisdiction, who may come over here and sell goods which may or may not be of a certain quality, or may have come to them in a questionable manner, as one Senator suggested.  Is it at all possible for the Minister to consider, in relation to the legislation, that under section 4 (7) when a person is applying to the Minister, a photograph of the applicant be included with that application and, if possible, a photograph also be a part of the permit issued to an occasional trader?  A legitimate trader travelling around the country will, I am sure, have no objection to that.  The legitimate trader, or the person taking out a permit in one name, with perhaps someone else from across the channel coming over here and selling round the country, might well be, at least to some degree, hindered, or brought under some degree of control, by the use of photographs.  Perhaps it is not feasible, or practical, but would the Minister consider this is a possibility?  I think it would help considerably in adding to the value of what seems to be a very good, well thought out and very worth-while Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few observations to make on the Bill.  Perhaps there is no harm in having a few devil's advocates in a matter such as this.  The more I look at the Bill the more I am concerned about broader issues.  We have one law after another doing something which a previous law has failed to do or is not doing adequately. For instance, if some of these people that we are correctly trying to control in this Bill are selling defective goods, surely the sale of such defective goods is already covered by the Sale of Goods Act, by identification of the description of the goods?  Surely the sale of goods on the roadside, if they are ill-gotten goods, is covered by our existing law in regard to the powers the Garda have?  The particular interests in our society seem to be <Col N="221" /> cocooning us by further pieces of legislation. A devil's advocate could say &ldquo;You, Minister, are responsible by this Bill for an attack on what is nothing other than private enterprise&rdquo;.  If this Bill had been in existence at the time when the man built up his fortune on the penny product and insisted that he would sell nothing which cost him more than a penny he would never have got off his feet and would never have gone into business.  We seem to be arriving at the situation where we are continuously passing laws to protect ourselves and to prevent and prohibit other people.  That may be necessary.  If it is the message of our times that we must take some action against occasional traders, as they are nicely identified in this Bill, the Minister could have been a little more forthcoming in her argument as to why total prohibition should not be envisaged in that case.  I think representations were made that there should be total prohibition.  It has been indicated that it might bring a certain confusion into the matter in respect of manufacturers and wholesalers with their shows particularly of Christmas goods.  A simple exemption clause entirely prohibiting retailing direct to the consumer would do away with that confusion. That is the only argument the Minister seems to give in her speech as to why total prohibition is not envisaged. What effect will a statutory declaration of intention by a person who proposes to trade over three months have if he gives that statutory declaration of intention, starts trading, and one month later disappears over the horizon.  Where is the statutory declaration then and what is to stop somebody else coming in the following month with another statutory declaration?  The market place has its own laws built into its own system and people who sell shabby goods are looked after by the market place in time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am acting as a devil's advocate because there is always need for that in legislation like this.  I am not saying that I am against this Bill.  If there are shady characters operating it is only right and proper that we should try to hammer such shady characters, but we have already, on the Statute Book, legislation <Col N="222" /> which can be directed immediately and very positively against such people.  We just seem to be cocooning ourselves by successive pieces of legislation, which succeed each other in doing nothing in the long run.</P>
    <P>If I were confident for a moment that this legislation is going to do away with occasional trading under another heading which I am sure will surface for a time, I would say more power to the Minister for bringing it in.  I have my doubts that it will succeed in doing that because we have always had people who are on the look-out for a loophole somewhere along the line, perhaps a legitimate loophole.  The trader may only be anxious to look for a legitimate trading angle to make money and there is nothing wrong with making money. There is, also, the consumer who will continue to look for this type of occasional trading transaction, perhaps to save a few pounds&mdash;and there is nothing wrong with trying to save a few pounds&mdash;and some consumers may get a kick out of going to a place where this practice is carried on.  As long as both sides continue to have a hankering for occasional trading and all that it involves, we shall always have problems associated with that business.</P>
    <P>In the legislation licensing control could well have been left with the local authorities.  You say you do not want to prohibit entirely this occasional trading, but you should not present certain obstacles.</P>

      <P>My apologies.  If the Minister wished to introduce certain controls in regard to the future licensing of such practices, I think it should not have been made that bit more difficult for genuine people to obtain licences.  It is far more convenient for them to obtain a licence from a local authority.  Local authorities look after very many aspects, such as planning, hygiene, fire control. That is one form of control which could <Col N="223" /> well have been left with local authorities. I have no doubt that the enforcement officers will, initially, make some impact on this matter.  I hope that that will continue until whatever defects in the system, as the Minister sees, are ironed out.  There is a part to be played by genuine traders and that part lies with their offering at all times adequate after sales service, unlike the occasional traders.  Unfortunately, there are many traders in established businesses who also fall down completely in this respect. I hope that the established marketplace will look into the defects which exist within its own jurisdiction.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a very brief intervention on this Bill.  When I read the Bill originally, never having been the recipient of complaints from traders about occasional trading, and it not being a practice that took place in my area to any extent, my knowledge of the subject was very limited.  Having read the Bill, I reasoned that this was an abuse which required correction and that the Bill seemed to be a reasonable move in that direction.  In reading the Bill, with no great knowledge of the subject, I was, in effect, only reading one side of the picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago, I read an article in a daily newspaper by a former officer of the Minister's Department, the former Examiner of Restrictive Practices, and was very impressed by his analysis of this Bill.  It struck me as being an extremely cogent analysis and put forward a contrary point of view to that represented by the Bill.  I have read the Minister's speech and she may, in one or two instances, have dealt obliquely with the arguments raised by Mr. Kennan in that article.  I consider those arguments present a proper balance to this problem, and to be so important, cogent and relevant to this whole matter, that I invite the Minister, when she is replying to this debate, to take up specifically the points which Mr. Kennan made in that article and deal with them here.  Only if the <Col N="224" /> Minister does that will this subject have been debated fully.  I intervened in this debate to ask the Minister to be good enough to do that.  Having said that, I apologise that I will not be present for her reply as I am involved with the Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies and must leave, but look forward to reading, in the record of the House, the Minister's comments and, indeed, I would hope, refutation of Mr. Kennan's arguments. Unless they are refuted there is a serious question mark concerning the justice, equity and feasibility of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill particularly as I come from an area which has been bedevilled by this trade for a number of years now.  It has caused a lot of hardship to traders within the area and not alone has it caused hardship to traders within the area but it has also caused a lot of unnecessary problems to consumers who have bought from this type of trade, goods which turned out to be very shoddy; when they sought recompense the owner of the stall or the trader himself, could not be found.  On each occasion when these traders came to my area they had different personnel; there were no names and no licence plates issued for these stallholders and it was virtually impossible to find out whether you had brought from a particular person or from somebody else. The degree of shoddiness of the goods generally sold by these occasional traders is enormous.  Regarding electrical goods, there is no way that 90 per cent of the objects sold as electrical goods would pass any standard specification for safety.  These items are being brought into homes and used by housewives and they are extremely deadly and dangerous because they are not subject to standard specification marks.  This is something which will have to be looked into, not alone as regard occasional trading, but also, eventually, as regards roadside trading.  A person may look for something cheap, and gets good value because it is cheap.  Too often people buy something which is cheap and expect it to be good value, but when they get it home they find that it either does not <Col N="225" /> work, or else wears out within a very short time.  I have seen children buying, from these stallholders, toys which do not even make the journey home.  They are bad value, though cheap in money terms.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House on any other aspect of this Bill, except to ask what is the situation, for example, if there is a supermarket which has availed of occasional trading and it might not be evident in the supermarket&mdash;on occasion, a trader might take over half at that store for a particular sales item.  In the bigger stores in Dublin at present certain areas are leased or let to traders for a particular part of the year.  They lease ten or 20 square feet and are there for only a very short time.  Are these people to be considered occasional traders? Whatever control the store-owner has over these people, nobody else seems to have any.</P>
      <P>I now come to these shows which are called ideal homes exhibitions, Spring Shows and so on.  People go to these ideal homes exhibitions and buy household gimmicks presented by English traders who may come from Carnaby Street or some market in England and do a fantastic presentation of a household item which seems to work but I have never yet seen one of these things work in the home.  Will these people be covered by the Bill?</P>
      <P>I hope that when a licence is issued by the Department, a certificate will be issued for public display at the trading area.  These people have no names and are very hard to trace afterwards, but with a licence number they could be traced.  The street markets in England are licensed by the local authorities and there is a licence number on each stall. Anybody with a complaint can give the licence number and get some recompense. I welcome this Bill which needs to be put into operation before Christmas because it is at this time of the year that most of this type of trading is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blennerhassett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not welcome this Bill.  It is giving a licence to occasional <Col N="226" /> traders to go out and sell their goods.  At the moment, anyone can get a hawker's licence for £20; now we are giving a licence to hawk goods for £50, plus £25 a day.  We are dealing here today with the Occasional Trading Bill, not the Street Trading Bill, or the Roadside Trading Bill which will come up for discussion at a later stage.  In my county in the last few years people have come to a town, hired a hall, put a notice in the local paper and given a name which is very hard to trace&mdash;the name may not be in the telephone book.  After that small expenditure on advertising, they are allowed to trade.  To give them a permit costing only £50 is giving them a licence to continue this kind of trading.</P>
      <P>The Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks, of which I am a member, strongly protests at such licences being granted because they have approximately 21,000 people employed in the distributing trade, whose families will be affected if this type of trading is allowed.  Many employers who pay good wages to their staff, who pay taxes and high rates, will be hard hit.  A few years ago, a hawker was a man going in a car or van from house to house selling his goods&mdash;or before that, on a bicycle.  An occasional trader intending to use a hotel or a dancehall to sell his goods should apply to the local authority for planning permission to have that premises altered for that purpose.  Is that property covered by insurance?  In this Bill we are giving those people a licence to continue their trading.  I have seen, in Tralee, people selling furniture brought in from England at half the local price; those people must not be paying any taxes.  Is there import duty on those goods.  How do they come into this country?  Are they smuggled in?</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider very seriously the objections of the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks to this type of trading.  We are not objecting to the time-honoured selling of secondhand clothes at the fairs.  A licence should not be given to occasional traders, where the livelihood of workers and employers is affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators from both sides of the House who have taken part in this debate and most of them for their welcome for the Bill and, in particular, for their desire, which is also mine, to have the Bill passed as soon as possible.  My main reason for ensuring that the Bill becomes law as quickly as possible was the fact that it was represented to me and indeed to the officials of my Department, by chambers of commerce and by legitimate traders in various parts of the country, that the period up to Christmas is the period in which most of these monster sales and auctions take place. Those of us who go shopping at the weekend will discover very often when you park your car in a public car park or on the side of the street, when you come back that the sales techniques of these traders are so good that they have placed an advertisement on the windscreen of your car, or very often have put an advertisement, leaflet or brochure about the sale through your letter-box while you have been away.</P>
      <P>We must agree that their sales techniques are of very high quality.  They have a tremendous influence on consumers when consumers go to buy at these types of monster sales and auctions. Therefore, it is highly desirable that for all sorts of reasons, in particular for the protection of the established trader and of the consumer, this legislation become law as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that most of the Senators are as frustrated as I am myself that the two Bills could not have been produced together.  Senator Keating, who was a former Minister in my Department, certainly realises the difficulties that I and the Minister have faced in trying to bring the Occasional Trading Bill to fruition.  I expressed the hope in the Dáil that I would have the Bill made law in the next session of the Dáil&mdash;that it would be debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas and would become law before the Easter Recess.  I express that <Col N="228" /> hope now.  Any delays which have occurred in the past have certainly not occurred in my Department, and any delays which are occurring at the moment are not the responsibility of my Department.  I assure Deputies that I am certainly pressing forward and insisting that the problems, constitutional and other ones, which existed have to be ironed out immediately and that it is of great necessity to have this second Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton wanted to know if showroom sales where manufacturers take a room in a hotel or a ballroom for the purpose of showing their goods to retailers throughout the country are exempt. They are, of course, exempt because it would be very unfair if we penalised manufacturers to this extent. This would be their main way of showing the goods that they have on offer at particular times of the year to their retailers throughout various regions or counties.</P>
    <P>Various other points were made by various Senators, and I will try to cover most of them.  As the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach pointed out, some of these points would be more relevant to a Committee Stage debate, and as we are going to have the Committee Stage debate next week perhaps we could discuss them in greater detail at that stage.  However, the question was asked by Senator Ruairí Brugha whether the Minister had the right to refuse to grant a permit.  The Minister does not have that right.  He must grant a permit but he can attach various conditions to that permit, and in the event of abuse of that permit the Minister refuses to grant a permit to the same person again.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Senator Conroy that the permit should contain a photograph of the person or trader to whom the permit is granted.  This was one of the points which we discussed at length during the preparation of the Bill and it was decided that this would not become one of the subsections within the permit section of the Bill in that it would be difficult in the case of a corporate body or of even one trader to put his <Col N="229" /> photograph on a permit.  The photograph may be displayed within the permit itself at the place of sale, but very often there are so many servants or agents acting on the trader's part that it would be difficult to identify the person who had been given the permit, whereas if we leave it as it is with the option of the Minister himself insisting, at a later stage when the Bill is passed, that a photograph must be attached it would probably leave greater leeway.  I do not know if that would be acceptable to the Senator.</P>
    <P>The point was also made by various Senators that the giving of permits should be a matter for the Minister. More people felt that perhaps it should have been left to the local authorities. The main case that I would make for it being left in the Minister's hands is that, as Senator Staunton said, if we leave it to the local authorities there could be a great unevenness in the distribution of permits and in the conditions.  We could have a local authority, say in the west of Ireland, who would be very lenient in the conditions that they would attach while a similar local authority in another part of the country could be very severe.  We get a tremendous uniformity if we leave it to the discretion of the Minister to decide what should be in a permit and on what grounds the permit should be granted. That is the main argument against the leaving of the issuing of permits to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We had probably two devil's advocates here this evening&mdash;Senator McCartin and Senator Markey.  That is very healthy.  It is very good because the point could be made that I did not take all aspects into account and that I looked at it from only the consumer's and the established trader's point of view and did not look at it from the occasional trader's point of view.  However, the Bill that we came up with is essentially a balance.  As Senator Blennerhassett suggested, it would not be right to extinguish totally the rights of these occasional traders.  They are a tradition.  Maybe the ones that we have become aware of in recent times are not as traditional as, say, the ones who have operated in fairs and markets throughout <Col N="230" /> the country, but it would be wrong if we were to deprive the consumer of the type of colour that this kind of trader can add to a locality.  On the other hand, it is important to ensure that they do not get away with anything&mdash;that the shady characters who have been involved in a lot of this occasional trading in recent times should not be allowed to go scot free.  It is important that the traders should have to make some contribution to society.  I take the point that Senator Blennerhassett made that genuine traders have to pay rates, rent, overheads, ESB bills, various insurance and fire policies and all these types of things, and that the occasional traders did not have those types of overheads. We have reached a balance with the fee of £50 and the £25 for every day or even trading for only an hour in the day. However, as I said in my opening remarks, if the Minister decides that the fee of £50 and the £25 per day is not high enough, then, of course, the option is there for him in the Bill to raise the limit.  It was in the hope of keeping a balance between these occasional traders and the genuine traders that we agreed that the rights of the occasional traders should not be extinguished totally.  They should be allowed to trade but they would have to do it under certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Senator Lanigan and others that very often the goods which are sold are of doubtful origin and do not conform to the proper trading practices or standards that have been in operation with genuine traders.  I think it was Senator Markey who said that genuine traders throughout our country in the past have not been as good about their after-sales service as all of us in these Houses would like them to be.  It is important to remember that this Bill deals with the traders as such.  The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, which is at Report Stage in the Dáil at the moment, will deal with sale of goods and after-sales service, and both Bills can go hand in hand.  We are protecting the consumer in the sale of goods and we are protecting as well the genuine traders by ensuring that they <Col N="231" /> have to conform to after-sales service of a high standard.  Also in this legislation we are ensuring that, when the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill becomes operative, the traders engaged in occasional trading will have to live up to the standards of that Bill as well.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin and Senator Hussey made the point that we cannot legislate for people's stupidity.  My term for it might not be so strong, but certainly we cannot legislate for people&mdash;they make up their own minds.  People decide whether they are going to buy shoddy goods, or whether they are going to buy at one of these auctions or sales.  No legislation that I or anyone else could bring before any House of the Oireachtas would legislate against that type of thing.  People should always be free to make up their own minds.  I remind Senator McCartin that it is not only mothers who are weak-minded in buying toys for their sons and daughters. We have very often experienced weak-minded fathers as well.  I hope he takes the point in the spirit in which I made it.</P>
    <P>Senator Jago made three very valid points, all of which I will have to take into account between now and Committee Stage.  Senator Lanigan talked about the leasing which goes on in the larger towns in the larger shops and stores where certain floor space is leased by various traders.  If the lease is for a specific period of less than three months, then the trader would be covered in the Bill.  However, if the lease were to be for longer than a three-month period, the trader would not be covered by the Bill. In the case of a statutory declaration being made, as is demanded by the Bill, where a trader intends to move into a premises and stay there for longer than a three-month period, if, he makes the statutory declaration to the Minister that he intends to stay in business for longer than three months and does not comply with it, then he is in breach of the Act and will be penalised accordingly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point which was made by our two devil's advocates, it is <Col N="232" /> important to remember that there was a high degree of unfair competition and that occasional traders did not have to meet the expenses or the overheads that the genuine traders throughout the country have.  I am very much in favour of competition.  It lowers prices, it ensures a wide choice for consumers to avail of, it ensures that there are after-sales and other services available to consumers. Fair competition must be encouraged at all levels.  There was a very high degree of unfair competition as regards these traders and I felt that the time had come when the Government had to do something by way of legislation to ensure that that did not continue.</P>
    <P>I thank each of the Senators who took part in the debate, and I am glad they appreciate the urgency of it.  I look forward to Committee Stage to be taken next week.</P>

      <P>I admire the Minister's urgency in attempting to have this legislation going through so that it will be operative for this Christmas.  I am slightly confused by section 3 (2) in the Bill which states that the question of a trader needing a permit &ldquo;does not apply to occasional trading engaged in by a person within three months after the commencement of the Act at a premises or place of which the person has been in continuous occupation for a period less than three months ending at the time of such trading&rdquo;.  I presume it means that for three months after the Act has been passed permits are not required for a certain category.  If you are talking about three months from mid-November, you are going into December, January and February.  Could the Minister of State clarify the part of the subsection which says &ldquo;in continuous occupation of a period of less than three months ending at the time of such trading&rdquo;?  That is a bit of a gobbledygook.  I do not understand what those words mean.</P>

      <P>It is essentially a point to be raised on Committee Stage.  However, I will try to deal with it. If a person is in occupation in a premises at the moment and is not covered by the Bill, after the Bill comes into operation the Minister will have to make an order and then it will be up to anyone who wishes to engage in occasional trading to apply to the Minister for a permit.  The Bill does not become operative until the Minister makes an order after it is passed and signed by the President.  I am not sure of the point that Senator Staunton is trying to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">

      <P>It is a transitional provision mainly.  It is designed to exempt from the provisions of the Act the people who have been trading at the same premises or place for a period of less than three months on the date that the Act comes into force.  It will exempt both persons who intend to become established traders at that place and persons who are occasional traders, that is, persons who intend to occupy the premises for less than three months after the commencement of the Act.  The reason for the urgency is, as I pointed out, that the chambers of commerce and others who made representations to me, and I am sure to the Senator's party as well, were of the opinion that the main time for operation for these traders was Christmas, Easter and so on.  Therefore, as there would be a 30-day gap after the Bill becomes operative, until the first permit is issued, I felt that it would be desirable to catch as many as possible under this.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Seanad of 14th February, 1979, takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Resources for Financing the Community Budget, which was laid before the Seanad on 8th November, 1979 and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case it were possible as, alas, it sometimes proves to be, that I should sit down without having said something that is important for me to say, I would like to say that if the Taoiseach as President of the Council of Ministers should seek a commitment to increase resources for the Community, he would receive the full support certainly of the party of which I am a member, and I believe of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the language which has been used in public by a number of responsible people in relation to the European institutions we are in or approaching a budgetary crisis.  In broad terms I understand the bases structuring the receipt of money by the Community institutions, but suffice it to say what has been expressed by responsible people, that as expenditure is now incurred by virtue of various decisions already made, the budget itself&mdash;not including <Col N="235" /> everything, there being additional costs&mdash;is so structured that the EEC will run out of cash and will reach its ceiling in the spring of 1980, or certainly in 1981, even on what may be optimistic projections of one kind or another.  It is my very firm conviction, which I believe is shared with others, that this budget has got to be balanced.  We cannot have deficit financing in the centre of this great Community, nor can we have either of the other alternatives, these being that it is left to the member states, by the adoption of a variety of individual fiscal measures, themselves to make up the contributions to cover the deficit.  It is not acceptable to the people of Ireland, nor is it in the true interests of the Community generally, that the second alternative of cutting back should be adopted.</P>
    <P>The cutting back they talk of in particular which is of concern to this part of the Community is the cutting back in terms of the receipts by the agricultural community of the amounts which they receive through the application of the institutions of the Community.  The Common Agricultural Policy is the chosen means.  Its precise form is not sacrosanct for me personally, but its general terms more certainly are, because this is the means by which one of the important objectives of the Treaty is realised.  People have gone so far as to say that if the CAP goes, with it goes the general Community unity which is integrated politically at this level in terms of human living so experienced.</P>
    <P>I am not going to exhaust either such attention as I may be scratching from the House at the moment or as may be collectable from any record of what I may say.  I am not going to give a long account of the objectives of the Treaty. One of the objectives of the Treaty is to increase agricultural productivity in the Community.  Another objective is to achieve for the farming community a fair standard of living, and the general understanding of what that means has been indicated in one of its forms in a formal communication, a formal piece of law which is operative in this Community.  It <Col N="236" /> is that this fair standard of living has been equated as being equivalent to giving to those engaged in agriculture a remuneration of unit labour costs equivalent to the remuneration of those engaged in industry in the same area.  We are the Irish member of this nine-member Community.  This Irish member has very considerable resources in its land, the productivity of which it is one of the objectives of the Treaty to achieve.  No means can be tolerated by way of a solution to the budgetary problem which would prevent the increased productivity of this land.  There are problems.  Our passing a resolution to the effect that the earth is flat, will not make it flat.  There are hills, mountains and valleys.  There are political realities and economic situations.  One of the political and economic realities is that part of the cost of the CAP is caused by rewarding production which is based on imported feedstock.  That is a great cost to the Community in general which is being remunerated from the precise form of the mechanism that we have there at the moment.  But in no way can we, as representatives of a people who voted 83 per cent for joining this Community, agree to a solution of the problems of a member with whom we would have considerable sympathy, or any other problems arising from breaching the ceiling, which would have the effect of preventing the growth of productivity of good Irish land which ought to be in the hands of an increasingly youthful population with enterprise available to develop that particular resource.  That is enough said about that.  There are obviously other cutbacks which would be even more intolerable where we should not merely not be contemplating a cutback but where we should be contemplating substantial increases.</P>
    <P>When you consider that the total revenue which goes into the European institutions is only 1 per cent of the gross domestic product the ceiling is not approprite in its present form.  It is not our business to do any more than to indicate, as I have done, a general support for the Taoiseach as President of the Council in <Col N="237" /> making such a commitment.  It remains of course, for this House and the other House to consider in due course the appropriate legislation which might follow the form of commitment which might result from the Commission's recommendation to the Council.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to say a word by way of general counsel to the people; I suppose one has a certain duty to engage in that kind of pompous exercise. The community here and the members of this State, the people who lie behind us here in one form or another by way of mandating us, should be reminded of the economic benefits which are being derived from membership of the Community. I have reservations about this matter of economic growth, that is for a separate debate.  While I cannot accept it as a worthy national object to go out and properly die to increase economic growth I am prepared to adopt for the purposes of rational living, economic growth as something which, if properly used, can be of human value.</P>
    <P>On the basis of treating economic growth as a desirable need and assuming proper use and assuming that we are not calling income what is the utilisation of capital, according to paragraph 9 of this present Joint Committee's Forty-Seventh Report, referring to the Cambridge Economic Policy Review of April, 1979, the nett annual receipt from that budget by the people in this State is estimated&mdash;and I take the estimate to relate to last year because it cannot be this year&mdash;at £250 million.  According to my calculations that represents about 3½ per cent of our national growth as distinct from our fiscal receipt&mdash;3½ per cent of the total productivity of this community is given to us out of this budget. So let us not be unconcerned or devalue the receipt we get in that form.  Of course that is only one of the two benefits we get from the decision that the people made when they voted on this issue. That particular receipt is reflected in multiplier fashion throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>There is the other receipt, quite independent of the budget; that is the <Col N="238" /> receipt we get in terms of the 20 per cent investment rate increase per annum. Where does a lot of that investment come from?  It comes because of the accessibility of the markets that are the Common Market, because of membership of this Community.</P>
    <P>I do not want to subtract one iota from what I said in regard to the matter of the solution of the fiscal problem but it in no way lies in cutbacks or in borrowing but must lie in a commitment to an increase in own resources.  I do not advocate the taking off of all limits.  I simply say that it is a curious irony that we are moving into a period when we start using our own resources in the very year in which we are not going to have enough of our own resources.  We must face forward into another decade on the basis of making a proper provision for that period.  While we must face this as being an economic, political, social and proper reality having regard to the whole human position, nonetheless we must not fail to note that apart from the receipt from that budget there is the extraordinary receipt that we get through the opportunity to export, through the general membership and the encouragement there is to invest, through the employment that is generated and the response that it makes possible for those who have responsiblility here, in so far as they have, for reacting to the change in our population growth and so on.  We must recognise that that is very important to us.  I repeat that, as far as I am concerned and as far as this party is concerned the Taoiseach and Minister of State and anyone concerned have our full support.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be in a position to second this motion so ably moved by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth drawing the attention of the House to the fact that we are really noting the contents of two reports of the Joint Committee in this motion because last May the Joint Committee reported on the financing of the Community budget reported in the Forty-Seventh Report.  In that report we referred to the <Col N="239" /> urgency of the situation.  In paragraph 16 of that report it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Committee considers that this question of the future financing of the Community should now be pursued with a degree of urgency.</P>
    <P>It goes on then to state what the position before the Council is.  It is indicative of just how that urgency has become far more extreme and far more imminent that the Joint Committee took the unusual step of reporting a second time on the future financing of the Community budget for the purpose of ensuring that there would be a debate both in this House and in the Dáil on the contents of the report and on the subject matter of the urgent problem of the future financing of the Community.</P>
    <P>It would be worth looking at the position as it was summarised in that First Report because it helps to bring the subject itself into context.  Talking about the financing of the Community budget in the report last May the Joint Committee noted the source of the Community budget, this question of the decision on 21 April, 1977 providing for the own resources of the Community and, effectively, that these resources come from four sources, the common customs tariff, the agricultural levies on trade with nonmember states, sugar production and storage levies and the yield from a rate of VAT.  The report goes on then to reflect on the nature of these resources of the Community.  At an important paragraph, paragraph 7, it notes the Commission's own observation.  I quote here what the report says:</P>
    <P>Neither custom duties nor agricultural levies are levied specifically for financing the Community budget.  Customs duties have economic and political rather than financial objectives and in any event receipts from this source are declining in real terms.  Agricultural levies are primarily for the purpose of implementing the common agricultural policy and their yield being dependent on trade, prices and monetary fluctuations <Col N="240" /> is inconstant and uncertain. VAT is therefore the primary source to which the Community must look to meet expanding expenditure. However, the Community VAT rate is already approaching the 1 per cent ceiling stipulated in the Council Decision of 21st April, 1970.  For those Member States implementing VAT own resources in 1979 the rate is 0.72 per cent and, according to the Commission's latest estimates, the 1 per cent ceiling will be reached in 1981. The Commission's forecast is that when the 1 per cent ceiling is reached, the projected yearly increase in existing own resources on account of buoyancy will not be sufficient to keep pace with projected expenditure. Moreover the Commission's forward estimates of expenditure for 1980 and 1981 do not include any provisions for additional expenditure arising out of enlargement of the Community and the renewal of the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>The problem and its gravity are stated in the first sentence of paragraph 8 of the report:</P>
    <P>Unless revenue from existing own resources is to be regarded as setting an arbitrary limit to Community expenditure it is clear that additional revenue will be required after 1981.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald, in opening this debate, has emphasised the broader aspects of that problem.  I would like to focus for a moment on the question of time scale.  If it is accepted that the present method of financing the Community will reach its ceiling by 1981 at the latest&mdash;the situation seems to be even graver perhaps than was indicated in that report compiled last May&mdash;the present method of financing will not be adequate; there will have to be either new financing or arbitrary limits to the Community resources, which means cutting down on the regional fund, cutting down or eliminating the social fund and other dire consequences for the Community.</P>
    <P>What then is the time scale that we are talking about?  Because of the complex nature of Community decision-making, <Col N="241" /> if there is going to be an effective decision for further financing, new sorts of financing of the Community by 1981, it is my understanding&mdash;and I would welcome the Minister's comment on this&mdash;that initial decisions in relation to the future financing of the Community would have to begin to be processed at the latest by spring 1980 so that they can be ratified at Community level and then go through the national parliaments for national ratification.  One thing is clear about any decision regarding future financing; it will require, under the Treaty, to pass through the normal constitutional ratification procedure in each of the member states and, we are talking about nine, and perhaps ten, parliaments which would have to ratify the system in order to bring it into effect.  So we have a time scale which would require the commencement of effective decision-making by spring 1980.</P>
    <P>We have a political climate which is by no means favourable to the idea of increasing the size of the Community budget.  Again I would welcome the Minister's comments on this point but, as I understand it, the indications are that the German Government are not enthusiastic about increasing or providing new sources of financing for the Community; the French Government are not greatly enthusiastic about it; in particular the British Government are so anxious to get out of the Community an amount equivalent to what they claim to pay in on a strict quota basis that, until their domestic problem in this regard is met or until some concessions are made, the British Government will oppose any consideration of enlarging the Community budget. Therefore, like Senator FitzGerald, I think this is a very grave moment indeed for the European Community and for this country.  I believe that, as far as the European Community is concerned, all the political energy and skill of every politician, both in Government and in Opposition, should be concentrated on this single item, on the necessity to increase the resources of the Community and to ensure that effective decisions are taken by next spring to ensure that this <Col N="242" /> new financial allocation comes in time for the 1981 budget so that the Community can continue to expand in the areas in which it is operating.  It has to be spelled out very clearly.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that certain countries take some satisfaction in the fact that the agricultural spending is, as they would term it, hitting the ceiling and that is going to force a radical overhaul of the common agricultural policy.  There is a very real attempt to play brinkmanship with this, to let the situation get so bad that there will have to be some kind of radical change in the financing of the common agricultural policy. This, for several reasons, is a very grave problem for Ireland.  Ireland, as an agricultural country has the greatest need for stable prices and for that kind of financing of the common agricultural policy.  There are criticisms that can be made of the approach of the common agricultural policy.  There is room for improvement of that system of support for agriculture.  But, far more important, Ireland needs to participate in a community where there is a genuine commitment to a balanced regional revelopment, and that has to mean that the richer sections of the Community are prepared to provide for a balanced regional development which means that they make concessions, that they take less out of the overall cake of the Community, that they make a larger contribution. I believe that this kind of balanced regional development, this kind of closing-the-gap between the poorer regions and the richer regions of the Community can only come from an enlargement of the Community budget.</P>
    <P>If one moves away from the area of agriculture, the Community is totally failing to meet the other important social and political problems within its boundaries; it is totally failing as a Community to begin to cope with the enormous problem of youth unemployment and of general unemployment in the European Community.  The funding from the Regional Development Fund and the Social Fund is miniscule in comparison to the gross national product of <Col N="243" /> each of the member states and the overall GDP of the Community itself.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this crisis in the financing of the Community should be seen in a political context as raising the very important question of how and in which way the Community develops in the future. That is why I believe the total concentration of Irish Government Ministers and Irish politicians should be on this question of the budget.  It makes no sense for Irish politicians now to call for a larger Regional Fund or to say that there should be more emphasis on the Social Fund, because this is not facing the stark reality that these funds will not expand and indeed will have to contract rapidly if there is not a commitment to enlarging the budget of the Community.  I believe that in any committee or forum in which we participate, this is the message which we should get home directly and unequivocally, and we should work towards the kind of political commitment which will ensure the increase in resources.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee in its report last May noted the various methods by which the Commission would propose increasing the financing of the Community. It refers, at paragraph 11, to the fact that the Commission was considering possible sources of additional revenue, indirect taxes such as VAT or special taxes on cigarette duties or alcohol duties and, as direct taxes, additions to Corporation Tax, Income Tax or Energy Tax.  The Joint Committee expressed at least a tentative support for the idea of an increase in the Community VAT bringing it up from the 1 per cent ceiling.  The Commission are to put porward concrete proposals in the very near future.  When we visited Brussels and talked to the Commissioner for the Budget, Mr. Tugendhat, we formed the impression from him that proposals would be coming from the Commission before Christmas.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some indication of when the Commission will be making proposals and when the matter will be coming up for decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> In the meantime, in the view of the Joint Committee, it is vital that this matter be debated in both Houses so that during the November Summit to take place in Dublin a very clear message could go from the Government, supported by both Houses of Parliament of this country, that Ireland sees one crucial, urgent need at the moment, and that is the need for the political will and decision to increase the Community budget in order to allow the European Community to meet its economic and social commitments to the citizens of the European Community and in order to narrow the gap between the richer and poorer sections.</P>

      <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee have been very timely in bringing before us for debate a most useful report which signals certain difficulties which are ahead in the financing of Community expenditure. I should like, therefore, to welcome this report both on its own merits and on the way in which the House is now afforded an opportunity to debate the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The own resources system of financing the EEC budget, which was inherited by us on entering the Community in 1973, has made a significant contribution towards ensuring stability in the Community expenditure policy.  As the name implies, the system was designed to give the Community a source of income of its own as of right.  This arrangement confers a considerable measure of financial autonomy on the Community, having replaced a system of national contributions which were settled from year to year.  As indicated in the Joint Committee's report, under the Community's own resources system, revenues under certain revenue heads, namely customs duties, agricultural levies and the yield from a rate of VAT, not exceeding 1 per cent accrue automatically each month to the Commission. The system was introduced by a Council decision in April 1970 and implemented by various regulations made <Col N="245" /> subsequently: the decision is referred to specifically in the Treaty of Accession; to amend it would require both a unanimous decision of the EEC Council of Ministers and in some cases the agreement of national parliaments.</P>
    <P>The problem referred to in the Joint Committee's report, namely the question of finding new own resources for the Community budget, arises because in the future the revenue from customs duties and agricultural levies is likely to decline in real terms.  As regards the customs duty element, this is collected on trade with countries outside the EEC whereas trade between member states is not subject to such tariffs.  Thus, as EEC states can be expected to trade more and more with each other in the future, growth in receipts from the Community's common customs tariff will be affected.</P>
    <P>They will also be affected because concessions under GATT and the new Lomé Convention will tend to reduce the levels of these duties and levies.  In consequence the VAT element will provide the major part of the own resources in future years.  According to the Commission's estimates the rate of increase in expenditure on the Community budget is likely to be such that the 1 per cent ceiling on VAT own resources will be reached in 1981.  As a consequence in that year and thereafter, if there are no additional own resources, the size of the community budget will be limited not by the stage of development of Community policies but by the revenues available.</P>
    <P>In the case of additional own resources the Treaty provisions are that the Commission shall submit proposals to the Council and that the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, may lay down the appropriate provisions which it shall recommend to the member states for adoption in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. The Irish Presidency has encouraged the Commission to bring forward its proposals on additional own resources as soon as possible.  So far, however, the Commission has not submitted a formal proposal to the Council. The Commission discussion document <Col N="246" /> referred to in the Joint Oireachtas Committee's report of May last is the only indication of what the Commission's thinking on this subject might be.  In that regard I was pleased to note that the Commission rejected the option that the existing own resources should represent an arbitrary ceiling on Community expenditure. This would be undesirable from this country's viewpoint.  Among other things it could limit the opportunity to obtain additional funds from the Community to assist in our efforts to achieve high economic growth rates.  The Commission document also ruled out the possibility of borrowing for current budgetary expenditure.  The Commission came down, therefore, to the view that additional own resources would be necessary.  I accept fully that in order to allow the Community budget to grow as an instrument of policy it will be necessary to find additional resources either by increasing the VAT limit or otherwise to amend accordingly the Council decision of 1970 relating to own resources.  Otherwise the Community's ability to implement its policies will be frustrated.  I am pleased to note that this view is also accepted by the Joint Committee in their report.</P>
    <P>The Commission discussion paper was considered briefly by the Joint Council of Foreign Affairs and Finance Ministers last April.  It is an open secret that at that meeting and at subsequent discussions certain member states have let it be known that they would not agree to an increase in own resources in the near future.  Their attitude appears to be motivated, at least in large part, by a desire that the current rate of growth of Community expenditure, on agriculture in particular, should be arrested. Ireland's position is, of course, to support fully the principles and mechanisms of the common agricultural policy and the fact that there is a legal obligation to meet FEOGA guarantee expenditure is, of course, relevant in this matter.</P>
    <P>As President-in-office of the (Budget) Council, I have stressed in the European Parliament that guarantee section expenditure is not governed by the budgetary <Col N="247" /> authorisation, but rather by the basic regulations and the market situation. Any changes in the basic regulations can only by made in accordance with the procedure in the Treaties, that is, by the Council following an opinion from Parliament.</P>
    <P>The argument in favour of additional own resources centres on the need for the Community budget to expand at a faster rate than the growth in existing own resources would allow.  In my view, the Community budget should be given a greater capacity to contribute towards economic convergence in the Community through the development of structural policy instruments.  The inadequacy of existing funds for these instruments, in total about 3,000 million EUA or 0.15 per cent of Community GDP in the preliminary draft budget for 1980, and the fact that disparities between the richer and the poorer member states have not been narrowed since 1973 should in my view highlight the need to increase the budgetary funds especially in the light of enlargement of the Community.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument that the FEOGA guarantee section takes up too much of the budget.  The FEOGA guarantee expenditure should be seen in its proper perspective.  It represents no more than about 0.5 per cent of Community GDP and less than 3 per cent of total Community expenditure on food. This is hardly a significant level of expenditure and certainly it could not be taken that Community financing on this modest scale is a serious barrier to the proper development of other Community policies.</P>
    <P>There is strong pressure in the Community to reduce surpluses of certain products covered by the common agricultural policy and to ensure that in general Community expenditure on agriculture is cost effective.  The imposition of a ceiling on guarantee payments in particular as a result of a shortfall in own resources would, however, be a serious bodyblow to the whole idea of the CAP.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> Enlargement of the Community to include Greece, and later Spain and Portugal, will clearly increase the demands on the Community's own resources.  The acceding states, during their accession periods at least, are likely to be net beneficiaries from the budget.  They will presumably be granted a reasonable share of the structural funds such as the regional and social funds in view of their structural weaknesses.  Their accession will also give rise to increased expenditure under the FEOGA guarantee section on market support for their agricultural products.</P>
    <P>In their report of May last the Joint Committee make reference to the Council's &ldquo;agreement in principle on the need for the provision of additional own resources to meet the requirements of enlargement&rdquo;.  While the Council has agreed that, subject to the usual budgetary procedures, appropriate provision would be made for the needs of enlarged Community, I am not aware of any commitment by the Council, even in principle, to providing additional own resources in the context of enlargement.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee favour an increase in the Community VAT rate subject to some sort of a corrective mechanism to take account of member states' taxable capacity or ability to pay. A basic principle underlying national tax systems is that full regard should be had to the ability to pay of a taxpayer.  While there is, I think, a strong case for implementing this principle at Community level I fear that it would not be accepted by all member states.  An advantage of attempting to secure an element of redistribution through adjustments on the own resources side would be that a given redistribution effect could be secured more readily than by acting only on the expenditure side of the budget.</P>
    <P>To the extent that the Community VAT base is already harmonised, an increase in the 1 per cent VAT ceiling would be the easiest solution to the own resources problem from an administrative point of view.  The lead-in time necessary for its implementation would be relatively short.  If on the other hand the additional revenue were to <Col N="249" /> come from any of the other sources mentioned by the Commission in its discussion document and with which the Joint Committee deal in their report there could be a long delay in the implementation process because of technical and other difficulties involved in harmonising the base.  I would, therefore, see considerable merit in accepting as a new resource a further tranche of VAT.</P>
    <P>The reluctance already shown by some member states towards making additional own resources available is a cause of concern.  Nevertheless, I would not like it to go from here that we are facing a very immediate and intractable problem.  There is still some time to go before the existing own resources system imposes an arbitrary limit on the scope for growth in Community expenditure. In the past the member states have shown the ability and determination to overcome difficulties.  While this has frequently happened at a late hour the fact that it has happened is a sign of encouragement for the future.  The closer integration of Europe seems to demand that over the coming period a solution, acceptable to all member states, will have to be found to the own resources problem.  We will play our full part in striving to secure such a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>The Joint Committee in their May report have done us a service in making clear the outlines of what is a very complex problem, showing that it is a grave one from the point of view of Ireland and the Community and advancing some suggestions which I would like to endorse as being sound.  The Minister, in his statement now, has made it clear that the Government are fully aware of the dangers for Ireland and for the Community of any undue postponement of the solution of this problem and, indeed, of arriving at a wrong decision.  Clearly, the right solution is one that guarantees the Community, as of right, a new, or additional, resource of revenue from 1981 onwards.  Clearly, the wrong solution is to revert to individual contributions at the discretion of member states, which, as we can clearly see, would <Col N="250" /> merely strengthen the disruptive political leverage already evident in the Community. The Joint Committee endorsed the EEC Commission's view that there should be no deficit financing of current expenditure.  I would have wished they had gone a little further and asked that this rule be applied to all the individual member countries, in the interest of harmonisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisional preference expressed by the Joint Committee and, indeed, the preference indicated this evening by the Minister because of its quick availability and its general efficiency, is to raise the present limit of 1 per cent on VAT.  I looked at the reasons given for not having recourse to other forms of taxation and am satisfied that they are valid.  The Commission did suggest that, perhaps, petrol might be an appropriate object of taxation, particularly as the whole Community wants to save more energy.  This would run up against difficulties because of the different degrees of dependencies of individual member countries on petrol as a fuel and the different impacts increases in prices might therefore have on the individual country's economic development.  The Joint Committee also recommended that the new tax, the increased VAT, should be so levied as to help reduce the economic disparities between the member countries.  One could add that the proceeds should be so distributed, but the Minister has just made the point, which was well worth making, that if one can build into the taxation system some of the elements of removal of disparities this may operate in a more automatic way and arouse less contention than does the fight for increased distribution of resources on the expenditure side in favour of the less developed members of the community.  The two must go hand in hand.  This makes me support, entirely, what Senators FitzGerald and Robinson and, indeed, the Minister, have said about the primacy of securing this increase in their own revenue for the Community in order that we may have greater assurance, that not only will the common agricultural policy be preserved more or less intact, but also that the resources that we hope to secure in increasing <Col N="251" /> measure&mdash;a hope never realised so far&mdash;through the regional fund, social fund and so on may be available.</P>
    <P>This brings me to say how absurd it is that any major member country should be arguing for a balance between receipts and contributions.  This idea of a balance is totally foreign to the whole principle of the Community and, indeed, it is quite contrary to the obligations accepted freely by all members, in consideration of the benefits of membership. These benefits for industrial countries&mdash;major industrial countries like Germany, France and Britain&mdash;include free access to wider markets, including the markets of the less developed member countries.  No account seems to be taken of this benefit in arithmetic.  This principle of resource transfer lies at the heart of membership of the Community, one of whose basic principles and objectives is removal of the disparity in development which exists at present between member countries.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make in that context is that, if one of the less developed countries has, as we did, joined the European Monetary System, and accepted in the interests of the Community the disciplines involved&mdash;and they are very severe disciplines, particularly when, as yet, there is no parity of trend in prices in the member countries of the Community and when inflation differentials all the time threaten either the maintenance of the original exchange rate or the maintenance of growth and employment and industrial activity in the smaller developing countries&mdash;it is very hard to take, from a country which is much more industrialised and has not accepted them, an argument of parity between receipts and contributions, because an industrial country that has not accepted the disciplines of the EMS has, in effect, reserved to itself the power and possibility of so altering its rate of exchange that it can nullify the benefits afforded to others by the abolition of tariffs and quotas in the community.  With that point I will leave it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate and the report issued by the committee. It is a truism to say that there is a great need for a much broader approach to the whole problem of Community finances, and I agree with the view expressed by a number of speakers that it would be wrong for the Community to allow itself to get into a borrowing situation.  It is enough that the States do this.  It would be most undesirable if we should let time pass and allow a borrowing situation to develop.  The European Community has a very long way to go before one can say that Europe could be seen to be in any way complete.  There is a lot of unfinished business in the social, political and economic areas before one can feel assured that this is something that will continue indefinitely.  I do not wish to repeat a number of points that have been touched on, but the major area in which the Community has been successful is in agriculture.  As Senator Whitaker has just said, the contribution to the other world through the use of trade concessions is, in itself, indirectly a major contribution which is not recognised.  In addition, we here get a considerable contribution to the social fund, to the retraining of workers and employment generally.  I feel that in large metropolitan areas such as Dublin the contribution being made by the community directly to us in this area is not sufficiently recognised.  I agree with the general idea that the best way to proceed, the easiest, and probably the most efficent, way to set about correcting the financial situation is through an increase in tax on own resources.  Apart from the fact that there is, unfortunately, a continuing prospect of increase here through inflation, it is a very efficient way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress from my own experience in committees in Europe, that it was last year and earlier this year a matter of very serious concern.  It has been repeated, I think, by the Minister this afternoon that there has, so far, been no identifiable means set out for making up the annual net cost of even Greek membership alone, as it will develop.  The possibility of eventual Spanish and Portuguese membership is a good way off, <Col N="253" /> but a mechanism needs to be found to deal with this.  I would not like to give an estimate of the net cost, according to the Commission, of the Greek membership, but it will be considerable.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, looking back over recent years, that the real weakness of the Community lies in the fact that it can only develop and move along with the support of all members of the Council of Ministers, of the member states and, perhaps, one should particularise by saying the heads of states.  It is in that area that one finds decisions being taken and having been taken in the past.  This means, as other Senators have said, that in each member state a very strong public opinion support of the community and its aims and ideals and a stronger sense of the need for the Community is becoming necessary.  It will be necessary for all of us, in our various capacities in each of the member states, to try to arouse public feeling, so that the Heads of States themselves will realise that this is far more important than their own day-to-day political fortunes.  The continued development of the Community in social, economic and political terms is, and will continue to be, a major contribution to peace and stability in the world.</P>
    <P>I would like to end by congratulating the Minister and his colleagues for their performance to date during the presidency and also those on the civil service side who are supporting them, very often for very long hours.  I was glad to hear the Minister, at the conclusion of his speech, recognising the seriousness of the financial contribution aspect and letting us know that we, as a member of the Community, will play our full part in trying to secure an early solution to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst I agree with the principles and urgency expressed by the Senators, I must point out once again that although the Value Added Tax Amendment Bill harmonised the laws regarding the member states it still has not harmonised the rates applied to the various countries and, therefore, quite a few anomalies arise with different <Col N="254" /> products, and hardship with competitors vis-á-vis different countries, because some products are zero rated in a country and yet they are paying the .72 VAT on those products.  In other countries, like ours, there are certain products that are subjected to that which pay for their proportion of own resources.  I am anxious to point out that, although it sounds an easy way to increase the own resources through the increase in VAT, we should press ahead for the harmonisation of the rates of VAT.</P>
      <P>I was at a Joint Arts Council meeting in Belfast where they were discussing the movement of works of art across the Border, which is completely hampered and slowed down by different rates of VAT.  Also, when one looks at television, one can see that in Ulster certain foods are cheaper because there is no VAT.  I am anxious to see that in any pressure to move ahead with the provision of greater own resources we also press for the harmonisation of the rates of VAT, so that there is parity of opportunity and competitive availability under the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words.  This is, obviously, a very serious problem.  It is a problem, indeed, which confronts us with the possibility that the whole future of the Community, as we have known it, may be in danger.  A short time ago, Senator Robinson suggested that we ought to have a decision on this by next spring&mdash;that this is necessary if the problem of our own resources is to be fixed up by the time the Community runs out of money, which will, presumably, be the 1982 budget.  I wish I could be more optimistic, but my personal view is that there is not the remotest chance of this problem being settled by next spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there will be very, very serious problems, which are, perhaps, twofold. First of all, you have the immediate short-term, limited question of the capital at present being made by the British Government of the British contribution to the EEC.  It seems, at the moment, very likely that there is no <Col N="255" /> possibility of the British Government or, indeed, the British House of Commons agreeing to an increase in own resources until such time as a settlement has been reached which is satisfactory from their point of view.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the wider aspect, which several speakers have mentioned, of the common agricultural policy.  I am afraid that we, in this country, face a future where the whole common agricultural policy on which so much of our economic development, not merely of our farmers but of the country as a whole depend, is now being increasingly threatened.  I greatly fear that in countries such as Britain, Germany and, indeed, even perhaps Italy, there would simply not be agreement to an increase in own resources, so long as the situation continues where 70 per cent of the budget goes for agricultural matters. People will say: &ldquo;All right, there is plenty of scope there for an increase in regional policy, social policy, energy policy, and so on, provided one cuts down on the agricultural policy&mdash;cuts down on the 70 per cent to 60, 50 or 40 per cent.&rdquo;  I greatly fear that this will be the attitude taken in certain countries, and, in particular, in the parliaments of these countries. If this were a matter which could be settled by the council, one could imagine that, after the usual horse-trading, long all-night meetings in back-rooms and so on, it could be possible to come to some sort of a last minute agreement. Unfortunately, the question of own resources has to be settled, ultimately, by the national parliaments, and so much political capital has been made&mdash;in Britain about the question of its contribution, but also in Germany and elsewhere&mdash;with regard to the allegedly excessive amount being spent on agriculture with regard to the so-called surpluses of dairy produce and other matters, that it would be very difficult, from a political point of view, in those countries, to get a majority in favour of increasing own resources, until and unless a very radical change has been brought about in the entire financial scope of the common agricultural policy. <Col N="256" /> I feel more than gloomy with regard to the future, because of these matters.</P>
    <P>The problem with the EEC budget is, of course, that it has consistently been too small.  The council has consistently tended to treat the Community budget as if it were a sort of national budget.  They have tended to say, when times of depression come, that just as one has to batten down the hatches and try to cut down on expenditure on a national level, so also one should do this at the Community level.  This comparison is a totally fallacious one.  The Community budget is not like a national budget.  It is a reflection of the entire existence and development of the Community.  It is only by a very much larger Community budget, much greater expenditure in many directions, that the Community can really flourish and develop as we would all wish.</P>
    <P>To say, in times of depression such as are now affecting most of Europe, that it is necessary to cut down on the Community budget is to say simply that, at a time when social regional expenditure is more important than ever, these must be cut down.  The fact that these views are held is a fact of political life and one which will have its effect in all discussions for the future of the budget. We must welcome the undertaking given by the Minister that the Irish Government will press, so far as they possibly can, for an early and satisfactory decision with regard to the future of the budget, but I greatly fear that we will have a serious task on our hands.  It is a problem which I suspect will go on through next year and through 1981. One hopes that when the decision does come, it will not be too damaging to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak at the end of this debate.  As Chairman of the subcommittee that prepared the 47th report which has been mentioned already, I would naturally have to say here that I agree with everything that is in it, but I thought that it might be useful to add a few comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> It is a serious situation.  As the Minister said, we do have a little time, in that we are running at about .7 or .8 per cent at the moment, but must look ahead to the point where the 1 per cent ceiling agreed in 1970 is reached.  We have given our recommendation in the report and feel that it should be the VAT way.  The seriousness of the problem comes out when you think that, when this was discussed before the Minister in the European Parliament, the draft figures mentioned showed serious cutbacks in payments in the social fund.  For instance, in the council's draft for 1980, where the commitment was £547 million for the social fund, the payment to go out that year was £243 million.  You have heard me before, in this House, mention that we were waiting for payments under the social fund in various bodies and institutions in this country, and large interest costs were incurred while people waited for their payments.  I would hope that this will not occur in the future.  It is rather interesting that it is in the social fund that this big differential between payments and commitments exists.  I mentioned this as one indication of what might be happening.</P>
    <P>In this budget, we are talking of about £10,000 million, which is somewhat over the Irish GNP.  In terms of the total budgets of the member states, it is very small.  I sympathise with the Minister in his position because, obviously, he is trying to get a consensus amongst a lot of difficult people.  It is unfair to ask the Irish, when in the president's seat, to do this and that; they are in the difficult position of chairman, trying to get a consensus. For instance, the UK are enjoying the position they, themselves, are in. If I have any point to make in this windup, I would say that the UK are using this budget debate about their contribution as a red herring to confuse the situation and to distract attention from the fact that, as Senator Whitaker said, they are not playing the European game.  If the convergence of the economy is to take place, which we all accept is what it is all about, then they should have fully joined the EMS.  They have not done <Col N="258" /> that and I would like to hear Mrs. Thatcher giving a little bit more attention to that aspect and a little less attention to the UK contribution to the budget.  I am trying to be fair here.  For instance before we discussed this in the Joint EEC Committee and before we adopted the report which is before the House, that well-known economic guru Samuel Britten gave an analysis under the heading &ldquo;Lifting the Fog around EEC Finances&rdquo; in the <i>Financial Times</i> of Thursday, 12 April 1979.  What the UK are doing, if anything, is trying not merely to fog EEC finances but to solidify them.  All I could do is to recommend to the Minister in the difficult situation he is in that he find a solution to this and not to give in to them too easily.  In fairness, that paper gives a table which shows the <i>per capita</i> net receipts in the various countries in terms of the receipts and costs involved to the EEC.  For the UK at the bottom of that table £20 per annum per head is what it is costing the UK to be a member of the EEC.  We are at the top of the table and what we are getting out of it is £158.  It is costing them £20 per head and £158 to us.  I mention this to be fair to the UK.</P>
    <P>But as Senator Whitaker has said, the benefits that the UK get from membership are not taken into account in that equation.  It is significant also that it is only now that the UK are beginning to howl, because they accepted a formula in the Treaty of Accession for what their contribution would be and it is only now that their contributions are coming up to the level where they are beginning to notice it.  The level that they are at now is one-seventieth of their GNP.  They kept quiet in the lead-up stage but now that they have got their full commitments it is typical that they start to scream and they want to change the rules of the game.  That has to be resisted.</P>
    <P>The figure given in the <i>Cambridge Economic Policy Review</i> for net budget receipts for the UK is an estimated minus £806 million, but as a result of the MCA aspect of the agricultural area under net trade receipts they have to pay another £317 million.  What is not <Col N="259" /> brought out, of course, is that countries like Germany, who also would have a complaint about the level of their contribution to the budget, are happy enough to benefit from those MCAs in relation to their agricultural sector, so we are talking about a fairly complex subject. It is not easy to lift the fog, but it suits the UK to use the complexity of the understanding of the figures to make this point and they should not be let get away with it.</P>
    <P>For instance, in estimating what it is costing them in net trade receipts which estimate is £317 million, they are taking into account some notional world price for agricultural goods and they are saying that they have got to pay more because there is &ldquo;an artificially higher price for food in the EEC&rdquo;.  As Senator FitzGerald pointed out, our resources are our land; the French have their resources and have land and they benefit out of it; the UK have their resources and they cannot set up the cheap food type of policy which will not allow us to get the full productivity of our natural resources.  I see what is going on there as a red herring, an attempt to confuse the situation.  They have benefited since coming into the European Community. How they benefited can be illustrated by the fact that their exports as a percentage of total trade have gone from 18 to 25 per cent since they have gone in and their export to import ratio has risen from 85 per cent to 95 per cent.  One could ask what might have happened to them if they had not gone in.</P>
    <P>As well as that, they are using the fact that other countries have taken some of the uncertainty out of the monetary and exchange movements in the EEC and they keep to themselves the right to move any way that suits them. Therefore, the policy for the EEC budget must be, as everybody agrees, to get more funds, to make the EEC work.  It is not a matter of using the EEC budgetary policy as an instrument of fiscal measure to moderate economic development to the country.  It is an enabling funding of the measures that have to be taken to <Col N="260" /> meet the fundamental policies of the Community.  Obviously they must grow. The report says that a slight increase in VAT should be the means, and I am glad that this House seems to support that view.</P>
    <P>Before I wind up I would like to pay tribute in public again to the help that the Joint EEC Committee of the Oireachtas received from the staff of the Department of Finance and also, of course, from the staff of the committee. It is another example of what a joint committee of all parties of the Oireachtas can do when they set about it, and I was glad to note that the Minister recognised that the report was timely.</P>

    <Title>Adult Education: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to formulate a policy on adult education, provide a comprehensive adult education service with adequate funding and resources, and identify priorities in the development of adult education within the Government's development plan.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister is present to listen to this debate.  Senator Hussey will not only formally second the motion but will make her contribution after I have concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the motion is to ask the House to think and deliberate about the topic of adult education and, having done so, to join with me to press the Government to take the subject seriously, to put it on the agenda, so to speak.  My own interest stems from a number of experiences, not least an unforgettable and harrowing experience as a young Higher Diploma student-teacher in an institution in Cork called the &ldquo;one day week&rdquo;.  The intention, laudable enough I suppose at the time, was that people who left school to become messenger boys should be brought back to learn civics, basic English, basic numeracy and so on for one day each week.  It reminded me of the inequities <Col N="261" /> not only in our society but in our educational system.  Later on in happier days, I was glad to play some small part in a very interesting experiment undertaken by the trade unions in Cork called Scéim na gCeardchumainn, which sponsored an attempt at a daon-scoil or folk school.  It was entirely a voluntary effort and it was very enthusiastic in the nature of things.  The experiment did not last long.  Finally, since I became a member of the staff of University College, Cork, I have been too glad to make what contribution I could to the adult education programme of UCC which is a pioneer in this field.  One's interest in adult education goes deeper than that, because it is part and parcel of one's concern for educational opportunity and for social justice.</P>
    <P>To be honest, before I did my homework on this motion I had only the vaguest idea of what adult education was about, although I had some dealings with it.  In my experience adult education was the services benevolently, and perhaps condescendently, provided by universities primarily to rural areas giving courses in social science, rural science and, for women only, domestic science, to people who had their education terminated prematurely at primary level.  The kind of courses provided tended to be, in the past, watered-down versions of sociology, Catholic social teaching and so on.  It is important to realise that the concept of adult education has moved a long way beyond that crude and superficial level.  In the thinking of educationalists and sociologists today adult education has the connotations of something much more total than that.  It still stands for second-chance education because the community still have their basic obligations to those who, although financing by taxes the many-tiered edifice of learning themselves, have no opportunity to benefit from the process.  Therefore, the community must continue to provide a kind of conventional service in the form of extra-mural courses.  Society must retrospectively still pay its debt, so to speak.  This is the <i>rationale</i> behind, for <Col N="262" /> example, evening degree courses which are carried on by our universities, sometimes at considerable inconvenience. As society changes and as the pace of change quickens in the economy, more and more there is the need for the continuation of these conventional courses.</P>
    <P>In the present day and age, demand and need go much further than that.  Perhaps the reason why Governments&mdash;not only the present one but all Governments&mdash;have been largely inactive in this field was the failure to grasp how all-embracing the sweep of adult education has become, if not in Ireland at least in other countries.  The Murphy Report is a report of a committee appointed by the Minister for Education and is entitled <i>Adult Education in Ireland.</i>  In that report is an attempt at a definition of adult education which I find stimulating, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The provision and utilisation of facilities whereby those who are no longer participants in the full-time school system may learn whatever they need to learn at any period of their lives.</P>
    <P>Adult education is now put by educationalists and by sociologists in the context of permanent education, a never-ending process in which all of us are involved at once as learners and as teachers.  More particularly, it finds its expression in the idea of recurrent education, an idea which is being repeatedly endorsed at recent international gatherings. Through the far-reaching dynamic idea of recurrent education, society would do its utmost to compensate those of its members who have been deprived of educational fulfilment because of basic injustice in the whole system.  The Stockholm Resolution of 1975, to which our own Minister, as far as I know, was a signatory, spelt out lines of development which the various Ministers undertook to encourage actively in their own country.  These principles included, and I quote from <i>Aontas, A Review of Adult Education,</i> Volume 1, No. 1 1979, page 4:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" />&mdash;the recasting of the rules of admission to higher education so that work experience is more widely taken into account as a basis of qualification for entry.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the redesigning on a modular basis of extended programmes of post-compulsory education and training, so that qualifications can be obtained in different ways and at different times through recurrent periods of study.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the further development of measures which give the individual the right to take paid educational leave.</P>
    <P>All in all, that is a far-reaching, not to say a revolutionary, concept.  It is significant that the idea received this detailed elaboration in Stockholm since the Swedes are already implementing the policy of open access to higher education, a radical example of the recurrent education idea.  In Sweden 25-year-olds, with at least four years work experience, are free to enter institutions of higher learning.  More than half the students in Swedish universities and colleges of higher learning, are 25 years old or over. This policy is running into various difficulties but still one must hail a great social and educational experiment from a great and progressive country.</P>
    <P>At a less adventurous level the need for and the uses of adult education are many and varied and bound up with all aspects of everyday living.  In this country there is no shortage of individuals and institutions who recognise the need for adult education and who are actively involved as adult educators.  Admirable work is being carried out by such agencies as the Churches&mdash;and perhaps it is rarely that I find myself paying a tribute to the Churches&mdash;the universities, the trade unions, voluntary institutes and vocational education committees who alone are the bodies charged under the Act of 1930 with statutory responsibility for adult education.  One hopes the contribution will be increasingly substantial from community schools.  The notion of community schools is inspired partly, at any rate, by the contribution they could make to adult education.  There is ever-increasing <Col N="264" /> awareness among all these people of the vast vineyard to be tilled.</P>
    <P>There is no end to the scope of adult education.  Functional illiteracy is alarmingly widespread and cries out for remedial treatment.  One can only mention some of the other areas which are encompassed within the scope of adult education.  Preparation for retirement, the education of itinerants, education for leisure which is going to be increasingly with us, the education of drop-outs in rural Ireland, that is those who are involved in our vital industry of agriculture who leave school at a very early age, are some examples.  The list of the work to be done which to a large extent is being done is endless.</P>
    <P>I am concerned here with the role of Government, and there are all kinds of reasons why governments should be committed enthusiastically to the development of education.  Some of them are brought to our notice by Paul Bertelsen, the Chief of the Adult Education Section of UNESCO, and his address to the annual conference of Aontas in 1978 is given in the review <i>Aontas</i> I have already quoted, which I recommend to Members.  Bertelsen is a Dane and, therefore, has a special insight, perhaps, into the topic because we are all aware of the vast importance of the folk school movement in Danish cultural, political and economic history.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the prosperity of Denmark is linked in no small measure with the folk school movement, which is essentially an adult education movement.</P>
    <P>Bertelsen in his address to Aontas gives various reasons why governments should commit themselves to adult education.  In doing so he rather embarrasses us&mdash;I hope that he embarrasses governments at any rate by reminding them that they are, if not legally, certainly morally obliged when they return home from international conferences to implement as far as possible what has been decided at these conferences.</P>
    <P>At the 19th General Conference of UNESCO in 1976 an international <Col N="265" /> recommendation on adult education was adopted which committed the signatories to promote the cause in their respective countries.  Our Government put their hand to this commitment, but one wonders what became of it subsequently.  For example, why was the text of that recommendation not widely circulated to the public at large or to the bodies most concerned with the matter?  Our Ministers have attended, together with their European colleagues, various conferences, at Brussels in 1971, Berne in 1973 and Stockholm in 1975, where they signed resolutions which endorsed the principle of recurrence in post-secondary studies and recognised the need for redistributing educational opportunities throughout life in accordance with the concept of permanent education.  Despite this articulation of this dynamic idea, there has been no general follow-up to this in Ireland, in the sense that there is no co-ordinated policy on the matter. We have had reports of the NCEA working party and the question of facilitating the return of workers to formal education.  We have had the national committee of the Minister for Labour to advise on the introduction of paid education leave.  Both of these actions, which I shall mention again in a moment, were not, however, responses to international resolutions but to specific stimuli.  The NCEA action was a response to the Murphy report.  The committee of the Minister for Labour was a response to the 1974 International Labour Organisation convention on paid educational leave.  These two items of progress do not represent any coherent policy or any declared status on recurrent education.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the general question arises, is our endorsement at ministerial level of laudatory principles at international conferences a piece of hypocrisy or at best a pious aspiration?  It would seem so from subsequent lack of action.</P>
    <P>Apart from this obligation of implementing the decisions of international conferences, there are other compelling arguments why governments should take adult education very seriously indeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> There is the argument of justice for the older generation which I mentioned already.  After all, it is the sacrifices of the over-twenty-fives and more particularly the sacrifices of the over-forties, as taxpayers and as parents that have made educational progress and educational opportunities possible which, however limited, exist today.  Surely the over-twenty-fives and the over-forties are entitled to some of the fruits of that development, in all justice.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested with considerable force that adult education is the test of a government's commitment to social equality.  The government who are serious about promoting social equality must make access to education as wide as possible for all their people.</P>
    <P>We must accustom ourselves to making another demand in addition to the one we make for educational opportunity irrespective of class.  We must think also of educational opportunity irrespective of age.  At the more pragmatic level governments, if they are to be serious about improving the efficiency of the economy, should, for that reason alone at the level of economic self-interest, promote adult education.  In these days initial education, formal education obtained under a certain age, is no longer enough in an age of rapid, bewildering change.  Unlearning and relearning are essential nowadays if we are not to lose out in industry and trade. I suggest to the Minister that money spent on adult education is money well spent and the whole purpose of the motion really presupposes the outlay of considerable financial provision.</P>
    <P>We should put all this in the context of Thomas Davis's splendid slogan &ldquo;Educate that you may be free&rdquo;.  He may have had a particular narrow political purpose in mind when he penned that phrase, but it has, I suggest, much wider and deeper meanings.  At the most fundamental level of interpretation of that phrase &ldquo;Educate that you may be free&rdquo; is the notion that it is through education largely that a man is freed from <Col N="267" /> ignorance, from personal insecurity, from the bewilderment which so many people face in front of this complex world.</P>
    <P>In other words, the kind of blight there is on so many human beings that leads in many cases to depression, to alcoholism and crime could be largely prevented, I suggest without being too starry-eyed, by the Government and the State taking adult education seriously.  There is an analogy here with the health education programme the essence of which is how much less expensive it is to prevent ill-health than to try to cure it.  It is not too far-fetched to apply the same principle to the extension of adult education.  In other words, it is far more expensive to cure the social diseases that stem from ignorance than it is to make prudent provision for the prevention of these diseases in the first place.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect, too.  Irish society, as we can gather from our own recent observations, will no longer be satisfied with a bread and circuses policy.  Bread and circuses, even if they could be constantly supplied, will no longer do as is evident from recent electoral developments in the southern regions of the country.  Bread and circuses make a restless and ruthless society rather than a contented one.</P>
    <P>Finally in this general connection, let me make the point that a more educated public means a more educated electorate and therefore, one hopes, a better political system.  It is to be hoped that our politicians regard this as a consummation devoutly to be wished.</P>
    <P>What has been the level of Government commitment to date?  Ministers frequently go to adult education conferences and say what splendid chaps all those involved in the movement are.  But unfortunately, again, there is no follow-up. I suggest that our European partners take the notion of adult education much more seriously.  It has a much more central place in their educational thinking. In France, just to quote one example, all firms of a certain size pay 1 per cent of their wage bill to the Government for educational purposes or else they have to <Col N="268" /> spend it on education for their own personnel. In May 1969 the then Government showed an initial concern for adult education when Mr. Brian Lenihan, then Minister, commissioned the Murphy report which had the most wide-ranging terms of reference to report on the needs of the community in the matter of adult education and to indicate the type of permanent organisation to be set up in order to serve those needs.  The final report, which was produced in November 1973, is an extremely comprehensive one but it must be regretted that neither the National Coalition Government, which had then something like three-and-a-half years to run, nor the present Fianna Fáil Government took this report at all seriously.  For the most part the Murphy Report has been ignored.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that our governments regard adult education as any more than a peripheral area in what is up to now a ramshackle system.  It is the Cinderella of the educational services. The concept of paid education leave has been accepted and the NCEA idea of open access or enlarged access to recurrent education, now that the Act has become law, will hopefully soon be dealt with in legislation.  But again as I have said before, there is no connection between these two separate pieces of progress and, as Professor Rex Cathcart observes&mdash;again I quote from <i>Aontas Review</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>Thus we may deduce from European experience that if in Ireland disparate policies are promoted as at present which on the one hand offer easier access to higher education and on the other unrelated paid educational leave, there is a danger that the promise of recurrent education will be frustrated.</P>
    <P>All this argues for the overriding necessity of a planned system, a policy as is argued in the Murphy Report.</P>
    <P>One welcomes the recently declared, and indeed already implemented, decision to create 50 adult education organisers throughout the country.  But again since this has happened in isolation <Col N="269" /> one must be forgiven&mdash;and I think the suspicion is widely current among those involved in adult education&mdash;if one suspects the decision to create 50 adult education organisers was more of a sop to the job creation idea than any really important contribution towards a policy on adult education.</P>
    <P>Their position is unsatisfactory to a certain extent because they are apparently to be responsible within their particular areas to the CEOs who are not themselves adult educators.  In parentheses, I may observe here that the chief agricultural officers throughout the country have deputies or assistants who themselves are directly involved in the adult education system.  The whole agricultural advisory service in fact is relatively well organised in this respect. But these new organisers, it is to be feared, may have their hands tied by being responsible to the CEOs at local level, though the Minister himself has expressed the strong wish that these officers be supported in the total development of adult education in the areas to which they are assigned.  Their appointment also begs the question, to what extent is a training programme and administrative support envisaged as a back-up to these new officers?  What advice are they to be given in matters like counselling, information and so on?</P>
    <P>The Murphy Report made a very important recommendation which has unanimous agreement among all those working in the field, namely, that in pursuit of a policy and a plan, it is essential that there be a separate section&mdash;perhaps division is a better concept&mdash;in the Department of Education which will have exclusive and sole responsibility for the promotion of adult education.  To date no such division exists. Some people I have discussed this with say that if there is a separate section, is that not just another bureaucratic dead hand on the system; that is not so because it should be set up and set up as a developmental division, as a division which would be not so must an administrative or bureaucratic one as one which would be developmental and innovative <Col N="270" /> and would, moreover, perhaps fulfil the function of informing us about developments in adult education in the international sphere generally.</P>

      <P>Again I want to pay tribute to the voluntary bodies and particularly to Aontas, which is the national association for adult education. It is the advisory body, the consultative body in this country and it is grossly underfunded. It is dependent on a miserable Government grant and up to now it has been dependent on commercial sponsorship which is nothing short of a scandal. Let me point out that Aontas, like so many other bodies in this field recognises no border.  One of the great reasons for having the Government seriously promote the whole idea of adult education is that already this is a field which is non-controversial, which involves the cooperation of institutions and bodies North and South.  So let me say in conclusion that there is no shortage of enthusiasm, no shortage of voluntary workers.  But what we need is Government direction and Government resources to make adult education a dynamic concept, to make it an agent of change in society rather than something which reflects society.  The cause of adult education is the cause of community development; it is the cause of democracy and it is the cause of social justice.  I recommend this motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I am very glad indeed to second this motion which I consider a very important one.  I am happy to see that the Minister has indicated his own view of its importance by attending today as he did last week.  Senator Murphy has covered most of the areas in this important subject so I will not go over what he said.  It might be useful if we looked briefly at some figures to put the need in proportion for us.  The 1971 census showed that 60 per cent of the population finished full-time schooling at <Col N="271" /> primary level; 28 per cent finished full-time schooling at secondary level and 6 per cent at university level.  I should like to quote Seán O'Connor who was Secretary of the Department of Education and Chairman of the Higher Education Authority.  Referring to those figures he said:</P>
      <P>The educational profile which the 1971 Census draws for us screams out for second chance education.</P>
      <P>Those figures require that sort of dramatic language.</P>
      <P>It seems that adult education is very much a discovery of the seventies.  It is an extremely important discovery for this country and it could be a gold mine if it was properly approached by governments and by people working in the field. It has obviously been considered internationally in the seventies as an extremely important area judging by the number of documents to hand from international conferences on the subject. We had documents from Tokyo in 1972 and from UNESCO in 1976.  We also had the Murphy Report here in 1973, the foundation of Aontas in 1969, which was timely, slightly ahead of the posse, and the important NCEA document in 1978.  That is some of the enormous documentation which is available on this subject and which by its very diversity shows the necessity to draw together the strands of thinking in this area and form it into one definite policy, one definite path to be pursued by governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points mentioned by Senator Murphy as justifying a call for realistic Government involvement was that a generation which by its labours has provided the present educational opportunities for young people deserves to benefit.  Parents of children who are coming up to teens and late teens, who themselves may be what they would consider quite well educated, find that their children are approaching subjects in quite a different manner and, in many cases, a manner which they cannot <Col N="272" /> follow themselves.  It is amusing from the point of view that perhaps mothers and fathers are not able to help their children with the new mathematics but it is not so amusing when many people feel themselves to be rejects or outdated, that their own knowledge is obsolete at the age of 45 or 50.  It is important for the country that all of us unlearn and re-learn all the time.  To stand still educationally now in the acquisition of knowledge is to go backwards and individuals in a country who go backwards too much will draw their country down with them; internationally it is important to have a lively, well-educated population.</P>
    <P>There is one area which Senator Murphy had time to cover which is that it is extremely important to identify target groups.  People will not flock into the institutions of education in their area avid for knowledge.  We have discovered that.  The excitement of sitting down and watching television or going to the pool hall is very great.  People need to be approached in a gentle way, in a very scientific way in order to draw them into the adult education scene, in order to allow them benefit and to allow the country to benefit from having them drawn into that scene.  We could use the services of such professions as nurses, social workers, priests and doctors.  People who work among the community and who very often work among underprivileged communities can identify and be used to help in the development of adult education.  It is also important that the physical facilities are there.  I think particularly, for example, of the young women in housing estates.</P>
    <P>In planning large housing estates nowadays it is essential that a real community centre be established with the housing estate.  If necessary five fewer houses could be built and three classrooms and a day care centre for children put up to enable people who are in these housing estates to go out and benefit from any kind of adult education that they want, at the time that they can do it and not in the evening time when it would be quite impossible for them to get out and when their domestic duties require <Col N="273" /> their presence in the home.  That sort of target needs to be carefully identified. I suggest that that target can only be established by the full involvement of the Department of Education in it.</P>
    <P>There is another area which was not touched upon but which must be mentioned in any extension of adult education. That is the broadcasting of parliamentary debates as part of the adult education broadcasting area or open university which is at a stage of infancy here.  An educated electorate should be the goal of politicians.  It should not be left to a handful of politicians or civil servants to understand the issues of the day.  We should be concentrating very much on bringing that sort of real democracy into being throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the points that Aontas make in their public submissions to the Government.  They ask for&mdash;and I would join with their call&mdash;a comprehensive statement of Government policy on adult education, a broad-reaching comprehensive statement so that we could see where we are going for the next ten years in adult education. This would obviously require a separate section.  The Murphy Report, or Aontas&mdash;I am not quite sure which&mdash;regretted that the group of people who had assisted the Murphy Commission in drawing up that report were not immediately made into a specific section in the Department of Education to form the nucleus of a separate group working on adult education.  There is a need for an adequately supported training scheme for adult tutors, for organisers, for directors. This is a crying need if one is to bring adult education to the vast number of people who want to have it, who should have it.</P>
    <P>A final point which has also been mentioned and which I would like to reiterate is the recommendation of the ILO Convention in 1974 for the implementation of paid educational leave, to which the Government has agreed to in principle as part of adult education.  I would wholeheartedly support this motion <Col N="274" /> which has been supported, as evidenced by his presence, by the Minister.  I believe it is extremely important. I would not like to give any impression by any wording of the report or by any words of Senator Murphy that this is a motion to attack the Government.  It is put forward, and certainly I put it forward, in a very constructive manner hoping that we may see some real departures in this very vital field which should be given full status as part of our educational system.</P>

      <P>This motion can be divided into three sections.  It calls on the Government to (a) formulate a policy on adult education, (b) provide a comprehensive service with adequate funding and resources, and (c) identify priorities in the development of adult education within the Government's development plan.  The basis of the whole idea is that it is up to the Government to get all these things done.</P>
      <P>First of all what is adult education? As good a definition as one can find is to be found in the first Murphy report in which it is stated that the advisory committee adopted as their definition of adult education that it is all the educational activity engaged in by some people who have broken with full-time continuous education.  That is a fair definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let it be said quite clearly that from time immemorial we have had adult education here.  We always had a special grá for education in all its forms. We can never emphasise enough the fact <Col N="275" /> that education is one thing and instruction could be another.  I, as a youngster growing up, went to school to a dilapidated national school where I got a wonderful education because we had dedicated teachers but it was nothing to the amount of knowledge I picked up through listening to adults, whether it was a priest giving a sermon on Sunday or the people assembled after Mass; we were all the time learning.  I have no doubt but that when all is said and done if there ever is a full report written on the education processes down through the years in this country cognisance will be taken of what I might call the parish university which came together every Sunday after Mass.  People stood around; they talked; the women went into the local shop; they came out and they talked and they learned.  Now there we had adult education.  The latest news was swapped and exchanged; the latest ways of doing this, that and the other thing were exchanged.  There was adult education at every threshing when we had threshings.  We had adult education when men sat down together.  It is going on all the time.</P>
    <P>Adult education is nothing new but nowadays we are inclined to say we must formalise this.  There is a point made by Con Murphy in his first report which I have here with me.  He says that 10 per cent of the total population engages in formal education annually&mdash;that is where people come together for a specific purpose in a class, be it a woodwork class, a language class, a crochet class, a knitting class or any sort of a craft class.  What about the other 90 per cent?  The other 90 per cent were not idle either.  They all read the newspapers and at that time newspapers were newspapers&mdash;one got the news in full and made one's own assessment afterwards. They read books from the library when they could get them; so did we all.  For better or for worse, a lot of my youth was taken up with reading &ldquo;Buffalo Bills&rdquo; and I do not think I lost anything by reading those books.  But we read everything we could lay our hands on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> I referred already to the sermon by the priests on Sunday and in the local Church of Ireland church where our Protestant friends went to service they listened to the rector there and that was education.  It was adult education, education for adults.  Now along with that, this 90 per cent had and are having social contacts through various jobs, societies in the parish, hurling and football clubs and if I may add with respect, the local Fianna Fáil cumann and the Fine Gael branch and the Labour Party branch.  I suppose we have positive and negative. We may differ as to which is which. However, all that is education, adult education.  Of late years now we have had Macra na Feirme and Macra na Tuaithe.  We have the great advent of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  These things actually go back.  When I think of these things I think of the <i>scoileanna filíochta</i> in the 18th century.  If one wants to know the extent to which adult education was fostered and enjoyed during the terrible times our ancestors went through in the 17th and 18th centuries all one need do is take up Corkery's <i>Hidden Ireland</i> and one will see for oneself. Maybe people were a little better educated then because they had to live a tough life.  They had to put up with hardships and it was not the type of food they had, remembering the little verse&mdash;</P>
    <P>Prátaí ist oíche,</P>
    <P>Prátaí um ló,</P>
    <P>Agus dá n-éireoinn i meánoíche,</P>
    <P>Prátaí gheoinn.</P>
    <P>These were the facts.  Maybe we had a little more appreciation of what real education was then than we have now.</P>
    <P>Formulating policy is the first point there.  &ldquo;Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to formulate a policy on adult education...&rdquo;  But if we get down to the formalities of it we could find that too much formulism is hardly education at all.  Our society is advancing so fast, especially in the technological area, that what would be pertinent to education at present might, in ten years, become obsolete. Our society is changing very rapidly.  As I said, technology is advancing <Col N="277" /> at an ever-increasing rate.  We have higher living standards, increased incomes, more leisure and greater security and these bring a lot of further complex problems with them.  If we lay out policies today they could become out of date in a very short time.  The validity of the knowledge we acquire or have acquired up to now becomes questionable; at best the knowledge proves inadequate. We must consistently try to look ahead, to see what the position will be in the very near future.  I put it to you that possibly the best people to do that are the people themselves.  A wonderful job is being, and has been done&mdash;please God more will be done&mdash;to support those agencies throughout the country that are providing adult education perhaps in its best and most natural form.  We certainly could do more.</P>
    <P>We could all identify the activities we would like to commend; I could personally commend the encouragement of a study of our own country in all its aspects&mdash;and by the whole country, I mean the whole 32 counties&mdash;study the various peoples there.  That could be done by lectures, distribution of literature, by the local library having all sorts of documents and reports, from the various Departments here and in the Six Counties, available for people to study. They can then, in a discerning way, find out the truth about themselves and their country, above all, its language and culture.  We are a very small country, and unless we have an inherent sense of patriotism our country is bound to collapse sooner or later.  We have not vast resources.  We speak about the big states in Europe, the United States, Russia and their vast resources in material and in tradition.  We have not got those things.  We must make up for it by our enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>On that aspect, my mind always goes back to that extraordinary group of men, the first of whom went into action about the last year or two of the last century, about 1898, Tomás Bán Ó Conceannain. I am referring to the Muinteórí Taisteal, who went around on their bicycles, <Col N="278" /> preaching about the Irish language, what it meant, its culture, its music, its songs, its dances.  These men went through untold hardship, and it is worth reading this little verse from a beautiful poem by Alice Milligan, regarding the work of those men who were responsible for that scheme of adult education which was from the people, for the people, by the people.  This man came along on his bicycle late one night; they thought he could not come on account of the bad weather.  He arrived in, drenched to the skin, and she says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And the fire he has brought to-night through the winter rain and storm</P>
    <P>Is the rallying hope that our race shall live and shall yet prevail;</P>
    <P>See the eyes of the young men glisten, and the aged lean to listen</P>
    <P>To the glorious glowing speech of the yet unconquered Gael.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the spirit we want in our activity as far as adult education is concerned. We are living in extraordinary times, and unless we arrest this decay of selfishness and covetousness then we cannot survive as a nation.  That spirit would fit in nicely in regard to a possible solution to any problems we have to deal with.  The solution could be found if one reads the Report of the Broadcasting Review Committee of 1974, which has quite a number of paragraphs dealing with radio and television.  One of the difficulties at that time was that we did not have a second radio or television channel.  Now that we have, could we not use that to a better purpose than the purpose it is being used for at the moment?  If we use that to give out courses in adult education, in language, culture, instruction, and so on, we would be doing a great day's work for our country.  My final word is this: somebody referred to Thomas Davis.  He said &ldquo;Educate, that you may be free&rdquo;.  I say, educate, that you may appreciate and enjoy your freedom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be given this opportunity of saying a few words on adult education generally. Firstly, it is only fair to say that great <Col N="279" /> strides have been made by various organisations over the years as far as adult education is concerned&mdash;by the vocational education committees, the universities and a host of voluntary organisations that I could not possibly mention individually.  I remember, back over the years, that my esteemed colleague, Senator Keating's Telefís Feirme, for me, and for thousands of people who were beginning in rural Ireland some years ago, in organisations like Macra na Feirme, was a remarkable achievement.  I have often wondered, even with the changing times, why Irish radio and television could not, possibly, have done something like that.  That, to my mind, was adult education at its very best.</P>
      <P>There was always a tag about education and, particularly, adult education, up to, perhaps, ten years ago.  The problem always was that the people who were then reasonably well-educated had an appetite for more education.  It always appeared, with respect, that it was the local schoolteacher, or the local clergyman who went on further.  They were the people that had the appreciation and the appetite for further learning. I am thinking about the 60 or 70 per cent of people, the housewives who never get a chance of adult education.  The fact that it is so called immediately puts them off.  I find myself in agreement with one thing that Senator Cranitch said, which was that some people were taking part in adult education without actually knowing it.  However, the Senator's remarks were over-simplistic.  In my opinion, they do not take into consideration the great achievements, the technological era, and so on.  I had to smile when he spoke about people having a chat outside Mass; there are parts of this country where some of them might not go to Mass at all.  If you were depending on that to put word around, you would be in serious trouble.  Nevertheless, I appreciate that a lot of good work is done that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, when you talk about adult education, most people's minds swing over to the universities. <Col N="280" /> There was a time when the universities of Ireland usually had a big wall surrounding them, ten or 12 feet high.  Certainly, that was an area not to be entered by people other than of a certain stratum of society.  A tremendous amount of good has come from the universities deciding to put on a certain type of course in rural areas and small towns.  In the case of University College, Galway, however, it is not very feasible or possible to do this, because of the limited staff.  They cannot use that limited staff over a wide area&mdash;perhaps as far as Donegal.  The budget given from the Department to this university, while it does not preclude adult education, has nothing specific about it.  If the financial situation became critical, obviously the normal institution of the university would have to be affected.  Our problem, in the Galway area, was that nothing was earmarked for adult education; the adult education committee within the university was always fighting with the authorities to get more money for this, because they believed in adult education but not everybody in the universities agreed with them.</P>
    <P>The question of voluntary involvement is vitally important.  If I have any misgivings about the motion, I would be the last one in the world to approve of the Department of Education, or the Minister, having full control of our entire adult education business.  That is not to say that the Department are not playing their part.  I want to place on record my thanks to the Minister for the appointment of 50 adult education officers, which I believe to be a good thing.  It is not as comprehensive as we would like&mdash;what is, for that matter. Nevertheless, I see a great role for these people and hope that the established organisations and committees will not get a chance to muzzle them.  While an officer of that type might be in danger of standing on a lot of corns&mdash;I will not mention the corns he might possibly stand on&mdash;I hope he will be given the necessary responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will do that and I personally thank the Minister and his Department for these appointments. I worked for a number of years in that area with Macra na Feirme and I believe that the involvement of a paid officer of this type, and the obvious enthusiasm and goodwill that exists for the type of business he is doing, will marry very well.  At the same time if anybody in any part of Ireland believes that he or she has something to contribute, or a talent which can be shared with the community, I trust that it will not be seen that people have to be paid to do that kind of thing.  Those adult education people will be motivaters in their own field and I hope that they will be accepted as such.  The great progress to date concerning extra-mural study courses from the universities has been very impressive; one has only to look at what happened in University College, Cork, with their extra-mural programme in dairy science over the years.  There is no doubt in the world that that course meant that there are literally thousands of farmers today who are able to stand with the best of Europe and all because they got the necessary type of education at the right time.</P>
      <P>I believe in the concept of community development, sociology, the emphasis on leadership as something we badly need. Incidentally, leadership is there in reasonable quantities but we are not able to identify it.  So many people are running around talking about leaders and leadership and all that is involved is that little bit of self-confidence and knowledge, and doing what you believe is right.  I believe that universities have a big part to play in that, but it is not confined to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people now have a great hunger for knowledge because of television, papers and so on.  It is only right that we have a corresponding upsurge in the methods by which they can get that knowledge.  Some speakers said that because of television and the singing lounge mentality, you will not get people to attend this type of course, but I believe that when people have a group <Col N="282" /> interest, they will certainly cling to that, in so far as they believe that they are getting something out of it.  The problem was that most of the courses held by certain organisations were too broadly based, with not enough interest for the participants; however, once people begin to attend courses dealing specifically with their particular interest, they will automatically show enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a project we carried out in the Tuam area, concerning adult education as far as family life was concerned&mdash;this is also an important aspect of adult education.  There were certain topics and local speakers, and the project was sold on a door-to-door basis, on the grounds that it was important for both parents to appear at these discussions. In fact, in some small rural parishes, there were between 150 and 200 participants each night for five weeks.  That has now been running for four or five years, which leads me to believe that there is a tremendous reservoir of goodwill and of a need for adult education.  I would be the very first to accept that the co-ordinating body, Aontas, are certainly not sufficiently financed and have not enough staff to do all they would like to do.  I would particularly plead with the Minister to ensure that the Government's subvention to Aontas will meet the requirements of the eighties.  It is very important, because an organisation like Aontas have a lot to offer; you must have a co-ordinating group.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to say that, if we are to tap the 60 per cent of the population with nothing more than primary school education, the effort in adult education will have to be doubled or trebled in the next four or five years.  It is vitally important that the image of adult education be changed.  For too long, adult education has been regarded as the poor relation, something that you bother about when you have nothing else to do.  It is also vitally important that the method of choosing the actual participants be tightened up, to ensure that the people who get the chance, perhaps of a fine two- or three-year course, will be of <Col N="283" /> some use to the community, for which the whole thing was intended in the first place.</P>
    <P>I would also hope that, over the next five or six years, any person, in any walk of life, with a talent that can be shared with the community, will be given the chance to share it with his or her fellowmen in that area.  If we must have cohesion and co-ordination, that is where the 50 adult education officers will play their part, and it is to be hoped that there will be many more of them in the future.  So many persons within an ordinary community have so much to offer, if only they realised it and their potential was brought out.  This idea of having to get somebody to drive 60 or 120 miles to talk to a group is completely out, because at that stage you are coming to a very specialised field, and it might be that the participants might be asked to travel shorter distances than that.  I am talking about the teeming thousands of people who have a real hunger for adult education, but who are totally unaware of how to go about getting it.  There is also the competition of television.  There is a wonderful trend, and the years to come will prove it, for people to hunger for more education and a better understanding of the universe.  There is no doubt in the world that they will certainly come forward and it is up to the various agencies to fulfil their need.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to put on adult education classes of one description or another at a time when the idea is not so receptive and people are banging their heads off a stone wall, but I have not the slightest doubt that the general masses are ready for adult education, provided that the subject is handled properly.  The Minister, the Department of Education and all the voluntary organisations, working in close liaison with one another, have a huge job to do.  It can be easily said that the Government are not doing enough&mdash;what Government ever did enough, for that matter?  I like the idea of the adult education officers and hope that that scheme will be extended and that, when we are back here in a few years time, adult education will be on the <Col N="284" /> pedestal where I believe it should be.  So many people who, heretofore, did not get a chance in education, will certainly be on the right road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second motion in this session of Seanad Éireann which calls on the Government to identify their priorities in education.  I must say, at the outset, that my priority is concern for the understandable frustration of the average young student who, having completed the leaving certificate course and hoping to have done well enough to qualify for a place in university, gets a rejection slip from the CEO informing him or her that there is no such place available, but then reads in a daily newspaper of a venerable greybeard being conferred with a primary degree.  I do not say that education is the prerogative of the young, but I do say that the right of young people to an education&mdash;academic or technological&mdash;which will equip them for employment is a priority which should take precedence over other priorities, however well-meant and however desirable in a utopian situation that we do not now have.</P>
      <P>We have a constitutional obligation to provide free primary school education for our children.  We also have a legal obligation to provide free second level education and we all know the difficulties facing the Department in ensuring that these obligations are met.  We are all familiar with the difficulties of making more places available, of building more schools, of repairing and adding to existing structures, of adapting curricula to cater for disadvantaged students. I would venture to say that the Minister is put to the pin of his collar at the moment to meet his existing obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main problem any Government have on coming into office is to translate Opposition options into Government priorities.  In the Government's Green Paper, <i>Development for Full Employment</i>, laid before the House in June 1978, certain options were put forward. In the White Paper, <i>Programme for <Col N="285" /> National Development, 1978-1981,</i> published in January of this year, a priority was established, and that was the provision of adequate places for teachers and students at each of the three educational levels.</P>
    <P>Young people need to be well educated at all levels to get a job and as long as it is a priority of the Government in office to provide them with employment then there is an obligation on that Government to see that scarce resources are allocated in such a way as to meet that obligation.  We have for the first time in two centuries a growing population of young people.  We all remember that a little over a century ago, an unknown number&mdash;certainly at least one and a half million of our people&mdash;were sacrificed to prove an economic point. We now have a Government who have their priorities right and are determined to face up to the challenge that this growing population poses.  The parents of this country will not thank any Government in office if they allow themselves to be deflected by allocating already scarce resources to provide additional educational facilities for those who, though they may have a very laudable desire to better themselves, are fortunate enough to have employment. They already have their place in the sun. They have already had what has been called their first chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate because it enables us to focus on a very important area of education which has been described, rightly, as being the Cinderella, the poor sister, the neglected sector of education.  I particularly welcome the opportunity because it will allow us to look at education in a broad context and perhaps to begin to re-evaluate education itself and so I propose to begin by discussing some general values in this broader context.  I then want to turn to the question of developing a recurrent education policy and I would like also to refer to some immediate practical problems and bring <Col N="286" /> them to the attention of the Minister who is present for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beginning with the question of general values, we realise that education has become a specialist and a sectoral subject. It has become such a specialist subject that politicians are wary of entering into the field in case they might not be aware of the language which is appropriate to each specialist sector.  Indeed, one can safely say that we no longer can see the educational wood for the educational trees that are demanding attention.  The focus on adult education and the terms of this motion are a very good invitation to us to stand back and to identify some of the basic problems, values and needs in our whole educational system.  If we are honest and look in this way at our educational system we must see that it is riddled with discrimination, with the complement of discrimination, which is privilege, with lack of equality of access to education and, indeed, with a deployment of the resources of the State which diverts a very substantial part of those resources to areas where there is already a substantial contribution to the better-off sectors of the community who will benefit and which, therefore, deprives those most in need of these resources. These are fair, overall characterisations of our educational system.  They are features which have existed since the foundation of the State; they are aspects of which all of us can be to some extent ashamed&mdash;the fact that our educational system has remained one which provides education more as a privilege to a certain sector, which diverts resources to certain more privileged sections and which has not been able to provide the basic value of equality of access to education.  Nor have we seen education itself in its proper context because education must be looked on as a lifelong process.  This is not least because we have the capacity to continue learning throughout our lives and the kind of society that we are now living in demands that we learn and that we adapt to social change many times during our lives.  In order to do that, we have to see education as a lifelong process, as a continuing process and, in <Col N="287" /> any strategy which we evolve, we must place education in this context.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, in any approach to adult education, we must place it in this context.  In a way, for the reasons mentioned by a number of other Senators, adult education has become a debased term.  It means, to most people, night classes and it means night classes under difficult conditions and with considerable problems, some of which I will refer to later.  It is better to try to evolve an approach to the whole strategy of a recurrent education which will be available to more people at more times in their lives, and will be encouraged and facilitated in particular for those who do not have access to education at the moment or the possibility of a second chance or in some cases even a decent first chance.</P>
    <P>The development of recurrent education should have a very strong community focus.  We need to see education in the context of the needs of the local community, within that local community for opportunity.  This requires a very considerable understanding of that community and of their resources to provide this recurrent education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of 50 adult education officers.  It is hard not to welcome the allocation of manpower and the building up of specialisation by the appointment of adult education officers, but it is being done in an <i>ad hoc</i> and unstructured way which is not moving in the direction of a genuine recurrent education policy and strategy.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the submissions compiled by the Dublin VEC and submitted to the Minister on the forthcoming White Paper on Education. I would like the Minister to give us some indication in the course of his contribution to this debate of when we may anticipate this long-awaited White Paper and whether it is envisaged that it will deal in detail with the subject of recurrent education.  There is a need for some clarity in the use of terminology.  I have already said that I regret the fact that adult education tends to be perceived <Col N="288" /> as the provision of night classes. There is a very good UNESCO recommendation on the development of adult education which contains a clarification of what is meant by adult education.  It states that adult education denotes the entire body of organised educational processes, whatever the content, level and method, whether formal or otherwise, whether they prolong or replace initial education in schools, colleges and universities as well as in apprenticeship, whereby persons regarded as adult by the society to which they belong develop their abilities, enrich their knowledge, improve their technical or professional qualifications or turn them in a new direction, to bring about changes in their attitudes or behaviour in the two-fold prospective of full personal development and participation in balance and independent social, economic and cultural development.</P>
    <P>The recommendation brings in the need for a much broader perception of adult education which was adopted in the Murphy Report.  The Murphy Report has not received a positive and wholehearted response, nor have its recommendations been implemented in full measure.  When we talk about a strategy or a policy, which this motion invites us to do, we must think in terms of a strategy for recurrent education which understands that young people and adults must be adaptable and flexible, and must have the challenge of living in a society where there is an immense amount of alienation and a need for improvement, not only in the quality of the environment in which people live but also in the quality of their participation in affecting their environment.</P>
    <P>If they are to exercise any local power in relation to their environment then they need to be assisted by opportunities for further education.  We need to move from the approach of thinking in terms of night classes or even day classes for adult education and instead to ask what are the ways in which we can open opportunities for education to every adult in the country on a recurrent basis related to the needs, abilities, capacities <Col N="289" /> and motivations of those individuals. How can we ensure that the young worker has an opportunity to train and retrain perhaps several times?  There is increasing evidence that young workers may have to adapt to at least three different kinds of skills and work in an average working life under the rapid technological change which our society is already going through.  How are we going to ensure this?</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have mentioned paid leave.  This is something which other countries, notably Sweden, which was mentioned, and other European Community countries, are approaching very positively.  I would like to know if the Minister has any policy of trying to develop the perception in employers and in industry of the need for paid leave for educational purposes as a recurrent feature in the work-life and approach of the workforce in our society.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the specific factors which have to be borne in mind in talking about a recurrent education policy.  These factors are identifiable and have to be dealt with if we are to succeed in evolving a positive policy.  First, in regard to the social factors, I would refer to the submission made by the VEC on this, which points out that the access to education here is very narrow for a broad section of our community.  Even access to adult education is confined to what is referred to as the easy 20 per cent, a middle class. Access to adult education is virtually unobtainable for a significant working class element and it is not recognised as relevant to their needs or to the communities that they live in.  Very little has been done in regard to this and there is a need for very positive programmes to counter it.</P>
    <P>There are the political factors related to the strategy of recurrent education. The immediate political factor on which the Labour Party have a very positive policy is the question of equality of access to education at all levels.  This is the basic value underlying any policy of recurrent education.  The third element <Col N="290" /> which has to be taken into account in evolving strategy is the cost factor.  It is possible to say that as a country with very limited resources, we cannot afford the immense economic commitments that would be required in devising a system of recurrent education.  I believe that, because of the demographic structure of our population and the needs of our society, we cannot afford not to have a policy of recurrent education.  We must see it in terms of the life style of every citizen and ensure that the kind of comprehensive approach that we have does encourage this kind of participation.</P>
    <P>It will end by referring to a few practical problems in the kind of adult education courses which operate at the moment, particularly under the vocational education system.  I had an opportunity of speaking to the Principal in Crumlin College, which has about 800 participants in adult education courses at present. I asked the Principal what were the main problems that he would like to have drawn to the attention of the House in a debate of this nature.  He pointed out, first of all, that the rate of payment for teachers for part-time classes at £4 an hour is quite inadequate, that it is almost impossible to get a good response, that he is begging people to put on courses, that he is not able to get the kind of good teachers in the particular area that he would like to get.  So, the first point he would make is a money point.</P>
    <P>The rate for teachers for part-time class courses is too low.  Secondly, he sees a need for guidance for people who are undertaking the courses in the adult education system.  Very often it is a second chance and they are motivated to go back to a particular course for career or vocational reasons but they do not get career guidance or vocational guidance. They do not get a structure in what they are doing.  They participate in those individual courses and that is the end of it, whereas what is needed is great emphasis on this career guidance and vocational element, particularly in relation to adult education courses.</P>
    <P>There is a very exciting challenge to <Col N="291" /> us as a people to understand the need for recurrent education, to put every available resource into this and to create a different kind of society where we educate more of our citizens for more of their lives at the relevant times in their lives.  We must adjust our whole approach to education to that basic consideration.</P>

      <P>I was not going to speak to this motion but something that Senator Connaughton said has forced me to my feet.  I welcome the motion and I welcome all types of adult education. Senator Connaughton said that adult education should be for those who could give something back to the community.  I really cannot agree with this.  Anyone who can should benefit and especially those who are disabled in any way and who in their adult years, perhaps, have a chance to learn a little.  These people possibly have been illiterate but at the age of 19 or 20 due to various reasons they are able to learn again and if they can learn to read and write they will gain a lot but the rest of the country will not gain.  Does that matter?  Surely these people should have an equal chance with those of us who, according to a lot of us, have a very high academic IQ, which I do not have, but others do.  I would like to speak to those who have not a high IQ but deserve to have a chance to learn to the best of their ability to read, to write, to have the enjoyment of being able to understand poetry and prose.  Apart from that, I agree with what all the other Senators have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak to this motion with some emotion.  I do not mean that as a pun.  Senator Connaughton was kind enough to make mention of some of my own activities in the area of adult education.  The contract that I had with RTE in those days was as head of agricultural broadcasting and consultant on adult education.  At that time I contemplated giving the remainder of my life to it.  It did not work out like that but I have been extremely interested in it all my adult life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> I want first to approach the matter rather as Senator Robinson did, in terms of the wideness of it.  She used the phrase &ldquo;recurrent education&rdquo;.  In my own mind I always thought of it as continuing education.  It does not matter, we need not get into semantic things.  The reality about the production of enough to keep us alive is that our grandfathers were no better off than the Romans.  They had to work practically all their hours to keep themselves fed and warm and to rear their children.  Now, with the technological explosion, people have two needs.  Firstly, there is the structuring of time beyond the time in which they work.  Secondly, they have to face the fact that their life environment and the necessary knowledge brought to their work is changing with accelerating rapidity.</P>
    <P>There is the truism that the amount of knowledge in the world doubles every decade, and so on.  I do not know how those things are measurable.  It is only a way of saying that we all have to increase our knowledge all through our lives.  For none of us, whether we happen to have been &ldquo;highly educated&rdquo; when we were young or whether we happened to get &ldquo;very little&rdquo;, does it not matter.  We all have no option but to go on learning all our lives.  The more one lives through and experiences things, the more one realises that only continuing self-development and self-fulfilment become worth while.  They become a goal that anyone could define as something to be striven for.</P>
    <P>The need for adult education seems to me inescapable.  I was sorry that Senator Cassidy counterposed the education of the young with the education of the adult.  In cost-benefit terms, if it is put as cynically as that, we have to consider both.  We have to look at those persons in our society who simply did not get education or rejected it or hated it when they were young.  The Senator assumed that the education of the adult is directed towards the adults who have had their chance and who are employed. Surely it is important to educate those persons who cannot read, who are very numerous in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> In cost-benefit terms, again cynically, what could be more useful expenditure of money?  Surely it is important to provide the structuring of time in an acceptable way, if it can be devised, for the adult unemployed.  Lots of adults in our society have not had their first chance at all and desperately need continuing education.  Even the words we use are off-putting, because the image of education in our world is so terrible.  Whatever euphemism we have for adult education whether it is recurring or recurrent or continuing, it is still off-putting.  Those are broad considerations.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few pleas to the Minister which are based on my own experience. First, the thing has become cheap and possible because of the communications revolution.  There really is a communications revolution of a very extraordinary kind.  It is so extraordinary and so rapid that none of us, even those who work in a communications industry, as I sometimes do, cannot digest it.  Not alone can you speak to everybody in the country simultaneously and rather cheaply now, but nowadays you can store what you say, whether it is on a tape or a video-tape, and that can be reproduced cheaply and sent through the country at the time and place of the audience's choosing.  There is an absolutely incredible multiplication of the possibility through communications and, therefore, there is a reduction in the cost of the unit of enrichment or the unit of information.  That is something that has to be digested.  A very good model for us to think about is the open university in Britain.  I do not like the word &ldquo;university&rdquo;. I am not going to spend a lot of time on this now.  I hope we will get a White Paper we can discuss, but I think with respect both to the Minister and to his staff, we have a really desperate and profoundly divisive education system. We divide religions, the sexes and the classes.  It is very hard to think of more that one can divide.  We divide everything that is measurably divisible. We have this dreadful thing of dividing all of our education into two strands, one based on classics and aimed at producing <Col N="294" /> clerks and the other based on manual skills and aimed at producing persons subordinate to the clerks.  That is another vile division in our system and we are perpetuating it in a binary third-level educational system as well.  We cannot solve those things here and the solving is going to take a lot of time because there are a lot of entrenched opinions and a lot of entrenched people as well.  However, we might make a start in the area of continuing education for adults if we do a number of things.  One is to avoid all of those divisions by income, by sex, by religion and by class, all of which are absolutely stamped into our current system.  I mention the other thing with regret and with no disrespect for the persons involved.</P>
    <P>It is my profound conviction that the Minister has got to say that this resolution enjoins him to do three things and the first of them is to produce a policy and in the producing of a policy, and in the hope that it will be done democratically and then can be discussed, he has got to stay away from his own staff.  If he thinks that his own staff are capable of useful administrative things in regard to education, then I ask him to consider what is now called the National College of Art and the Museum.  If education of the sort that we are talking about&mdash;where even the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; would disappear and where the continuing development and enrichment of the person would be the objective&mdash;it has to be of its nature somewhat subversive&mdash;not more subversive than our society will currently permit but certainly a good deal more subversive than many of our current educational institutions. That means that it must be got away from a whole series of currently entrenched positions.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not possess the people who are open-minded and flexible enough to initiate and to make popular enough this sort of policy.  I know of instances where one might detect a bitterness in this, and there is a certain bitterness. The experiment of Telefís Feirme, which in its way was a world leader and aroused interest as far away <Col N="295" /> as Japan and India and had a whole series of innovations in it, was sabotaged by two Government Departments, the Department of Education and the Department of Agriculture, for reasons of their dog-in-the manger vested approach to the purveying of information. They throught that they and their staffs were the people to do it and that interlopers had to be got out.  If that is the approach, anything serious in adult education is doomed.</P>
    <P>We lack the appropriate words for this discussion because even the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; itself, because of the people's school experience, is intensely off-putting. Let us face it, most post-school people in Ireland hate their school experience. They become sentimental in drink usually and say they were the happiest days of their lives and they reminisce but if they are asked about their day-to-day experiences they will say that they were bitter and unhappy experiences and they do not want any more.  I regret to say that but that is my experience in talking to people.</P>
    <P>I listened to the plea about Irish culture and what Senator Cranitch said about our language and culture.  I wanted to make the plea for Ireland that language and music get an extraordinarily important role in our whole national ethos and in what we teach people, and that the skills that change the nature of the materials of the earth are very much despised and neglected.  At this moment of high unemployment we have shortages of craftsmen all over the country.  How ridiculous we are in our educational balance and educational efforts, because we are held up at a time of high unemployment in industrial development because there are not craftsmen and the clerks are so much more important in our culture than the doers.  I beg that there be no false division of that kind between so-called manual skills and intellectual skills&mdash;as if a brain did not guide the hand in manual skills, because they are not, of course, separate.  There is another split introduced nonsensically by our clerkridden <Col N="296" /> phoney culture in this island.  I use the word &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in that sense in both of its meanings and its less common one perhaps more strongly.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will initiate discussions, therefore, before he does anything, that he will get a wide forum and that he will seek all of the prodigious talent in this country and all of the clamour which seems to me to be prodigious also.  He has to give a structure to both the talent and the need, that the continuing development of personality and of skill all through life can be helped.  I am sure that in cost/benefit terms that is advantageous.  It is advantageous to the reduction of delinquency which perhaps is not a good motive.  It is advantageous with the provision of extra skills from adults so that we avoid the bottle-necks that I have referred to, which is in itself not a good enough motive either.  It is advantageous in the total enrichment of our society so that all of our citizens are more productive and more useful and less prone to do evil, and&mdash;to use an old fashioned word&mdash;are better people.  Then in cost/benefit terms it must be desirable, but to do this the Minister has to avoid all of the cleavages in our society which are fostered by our education.  He must get away totally from the image of an authoritarian and unloved thing which is the image of education at present.  He must also look for totally new institutions and stay away from the existing ones which all have a dog-in-the manger approach to their particular bit of this subject&mdash;I even hesitate to use the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;he must&rdquo; I hope he will forgive me, I do not mean he is compelled to do this or that: it is a mode of expression.  Obviously, the Minister is his own man and will do what he feels best, but it seems necessary that he should recognise the extraordinary strength that the communications revolution has given to him and therefore, enlist the advice of people who really understand that communications revolution, who really love and trust it and are prepared to exploit it to the full.  Along with the need and the <Col N="297" /> thirst, it is the third element.  The technology for life-long education now exists and above all he must go outside the existing institutions and avoid all the cleavages that we have introduced.</P>
    <P>We have an anti-educational system.  I do not propose to bring Pearse into it to any extent.  He has been fashionable in political debate these last weeks.  The &ldquo;murder machine&rdquo; is a suitable term still for what passes for education.  The Minister must break out from all of these things and then it is to be hoped that the revolution that will then get into third level and second level and first level education can be started at the adult level.  Above all, since the person is an entity and since culture is a unit, in the continuing development of feelings and skills through life which is called education&mdash;that is an entity too&mdash;and crafts must be as important as the arts and the very poor, very ignorant, very disadvantaged and illiterate must be more important than those who had their first chance.  These last are, in fact, quite few and by their educational experience are quite able to help themselves later on in life.</P>
    <P>I leave one last thought.  The great submerged, disadvantaged and undeveloped section of our community, programmed by their life experience to believe in their own inferiority, are women.  A programme of continuing education that does not set the liberation of women to a position of equality as a central target will not be able to attain its objects.</P>

      <P>My remarks will focus on the higher education system which might at first sight not seem very relevant to adult education as generally understood.  However, higher education, if we are to meet the challenges of the next decade or so, must extend beyond catering for a particular age group over a specific period of time.  In common with many other countries, Ireland has experienced in recent years a very substantial growth in enrolments in higher educational institutions.  Following the <Col N="298" /> recent census we can expect an everincreasing school-going population with the consequential demand for places in educational institutions at all levels. There have been welcome relevant developments in our educational system in recent years as illustrated particularly by the establishment of the regional technical colleges and the national institutes for higher education in Limerick and Dublin.</P>
      <P>Universities, of course, continue to make a valuable contribution and indeed the institution in which I work, University College, Dublin, last year had over 700 evening students pursuing courses in arts and commerce.  In addition last year there were more than 6,000 students in extramural courses.  In the light of our social and economic development to date and the direction of our development in the future, technical and technological education must be regarded as a priority area from now until the end of the century.  Technological institutions&mdash;and we need more of them&mdash;are well equipped to serve the needs of industry which is of crucial importance in generating employment for our young population in particular.  A well educated labour force with appropriate knowledge and skills is one of the best incentives this country can offer to our own native industrialists and to the much sought after foreign industrial investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland as elsewhere we concentrate a massive amount on education in early life and there is also strong emphasis on providing access to higher education for that minority among school leavers who seek entry into higher education institutions.  In the complex modern society in which we live, of which rapid technological change is so prominent a feature, the higher education system is presented with the challenge of educating people for a work life which will continue to change, as has been emphasised by several Senators, with increasing speed.  Knowledge is expanding rapidly but so too is the obsolescence of that same knowledge. Ideally, of course, people should have <Col N="299" /> access to and control over knowledge during their entire lifetime.</P>
    <P>Where then does higher education fit into the picture?  I suggest it has a role to play in helping the adult and in helping the employee.  This is certainly a considerable challenge with widespread implications particularly for the educational institutions themselves. While there has been some progress it is unrealistic, at least in the short term, to expect employers, whether in industry or the public service, to be prepared to engage in widescale release and financial support for employees to attend courses, whether to update knowledge and skills or to gain new knowledge and skills.</P>
    <P>In addition to conventional higher education, one approach to tackling this challenge could be along the lines of the open university in the United Kingdom. Here, the proposed NIHE in Dublin plans to introduce what they term a distant study series of programmes with the theme of recurrent education.  This distant study idea deserves close attention and the progress in NIHE, Dublin, should be closely monitored.  The distant study programmes as envisaged by the institute would be based on correspondence material supplemented by audiovisual material and local tutorial services. Interestingly enough in their deliberations I understand NIHE, Dublin, have considered the idea of radio and television services by way of supplementing their efforts in this field and they say that the cost is prohibitive. There are many advantages in the distant study approach.  First, it would provide educational opportunities to the community at large.  This could lead to reduced demand for places in higher education institutions thus easing a very real pressure point and problem for the educational authorities.  One suspects that at least some students pursue qualifications in higher education institutions immediately on leaving school because they feel they may never get a second chance.  Under distant study the actual time spent on study can be controlled by the individual to take account of a variety of circumstances, including <Col N="300" /> domestic arrangements.  One further advantage&mdash;and there are many&mdash;is that employees would have the opportunity to pursue courses irrespective of geographical location thus avoiding the isolation from access to further educational qualifications.  To those who might have misgivings about the concept of distant study, there is abundant experience from several countries abroad that it is possible to teach at a distance while achieving academic excellence.  I have confined my remarks to the higher education field but clearly it is the hope of all of us that our ideal, and indeed our aim, should be to provide educational opportunities for the entire community at any age whenever and wherever possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long but in the course of this debate, listening to the contributions being made, I felt obliged, as somebody from a country area who has only a slight spattering of second level education, to say something.  I welcome this motion.  In supporting it I would emphasise that, as far as the obligation to provide adult education is concerned, the area where it is most necessary is that area of educable people who have completed primary education and who, for one reason or another, were not able to further their education.  We are obliged to give that section of the community the opportunity for further education so that they can carry on the everyday life for which education is becoming more and more necessary. There was a time when people who could barely write their own names could get by; they could go to the fairs and the markets and to all the places where money was exchanged and property bought and sold and could work out calculations in their heads and pursue their business effectively and discreetly in a manner that many who were aware of their lack of education marvelled at. That day is now gone.  With the increasing use of technical and scientific terms, the use of scientific instruments, measurements, calculators and so on, those people are in the position where, <Col N="301" /> unless they have an education, they are completely at sea.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible to impart the amount of education required at this stage to a person who is able to take up employment.  For example, AnCO training courses could properly include two or three hours of literary education each day and a person who had brains but had lacked the opportunity could be given an education appropriate to his ability.  In addition, education should be imparted in the atmosphere of the workshop or the road works or wherever a person works so that it would not be divorced from his everyday environment; it should not be given in circumstances where people are hustled into a desk after working for a considerable number of hours and told that they are back again at school.  If the imparting of education were pursued in that way there would not be the same reluctance there is to going into the schoolroom and being taught by a teacher who is more accustomed to teaching children and who is not acquainted with adult education.  That is the first area that should be looked at. These people would be the most responsive and that is the area where education would be most beneficial to the nation. For that reason I urge the Minister to provide educational facilities of this section of the community.</P>
      <P>Second and third level education for other sections of the community are all very worthy causes.  But the nation is impoverished if it is looked at on the basis of those that have no education, no opportunity to fend for themselves in the technical days in which we live.  The Minister will find in a very short time that this section of the community has to be catered for and I hope that he will cater for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no disagreement in this House about the importance of adult education for the contribution it can make to the development of the individual and the betterment of our society.  There is no disagreement about <Col N="302" /> the need for a life-long process of learning and relearning.  I do not see this as just responding to the need of the individual but also to the desire of the individual for enrichment of his understanding and appreciation of life.  Obviously it is so important a matter that the Government must have a policy about it.  What has not been established by the debate, I think, is the second part of this motion which is that the Government must provide a comprehensive adult education service.  Various speakers, beginning with Senator Murphy, have mentioned the very wide range of facilities already available. Apart from the vocational education service there is a whole range of voluntary services provided by the Churches, universities, trade unions and institutions like Aontas and Macra na Feirme.  If any case has been made it is that the Government's place is to support, supplement and complement these services, not to override them or replace them by some comprehensive state adult education service.</P>
      <P>I say this also because a qualification must enter into one's mind about the future form and environment of adult education in particular but also of all forms of education.  The rapid technological change which has been mentioned this evening affects not just what needs to be learned from now on but also how it can be learned and the cost of learning it.  This aspect is extremely important because a lot of our discussion took place in the old fashioned environment of classrooms, extension of community centres, attendance at courses and so on.  That is becoming rapidly outmoded.  This approach ignores the enormous changes in telecommunications which will transform the whole scene within the next five to ten years.  Information, education on the principles, instruction in skills will within a few years be capable of being provided by television cassettes in one's own home as and when one finds it convenient.  The capital cost of the whole education process will be greatly changed&mdash;I would hope greatly lightened&mdash;by these new developments.</P>

Ach cé go bhfuil sé an-thábhachtach freastal a dhéanmh ar na riachtanaisí seo san saol eacnamaíochta, san saol ghairmiúil agus sa cheardeolaíocht, níor chóir, dar liom, dearmad a dhéanamh ar na buntáistí eile atá ins an oideachas do dhaoine fásta, buntáistí atá dobhraite ach a bhaineann le forbairt pearsanta an duine féin.</P>

Labhair an Seanadóir Hussey go háirithe faoi na mná sna ceantracha ar imeall na cathrach.  Bhéadh tionchar aige sin ar na pleananna forbartha a dhéanfaí maidir le saoráidí den chineál sin a leathnú amach.  Dá thoradh sin is mó ná ariamh an tábhacht atá anois le leas an phobail a bheith ina ghné <Col N="305" /> d'aon phleanáil a dhéanfaí ar chlár oideachais do dhaoine fásta.</P>
    <P>I have made notes of the suggestions made by Senators.  I will try to deal with as many of them as I can in the time available.</P>
    <P>In making a brief reference to the development of adult education in Ireland it would be appropriate to emphasise the importance of the provisions of the Vocational Education Act of 1930.  This legislation provided for the statutory provision of adult education courses at local level to meet the demands and needs of local communities. The provision made over the years, consisting of part-time day courses and part-time evening courses, grew to such proportions that it became the largest single statutory platform for adult education courses.  The fact that the vocational schools are dispersed over the whole country has meant that they could reach all areas and make available fulltime and part-time teaching resources for a wide variety of purposes.  The numbers participating in the courses provided by the vocational education committees have grown regularly from year to year.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that secondary schools have in recent years in many instances also become involved in adult education and I feel confident that, under the new arrangements being introduced by me, their contribution to the adult education provision will assume greater proportions in the coming years, with particular regard to the provision of facilities and of teaching personnel. There is a great field for improvement there.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the comprehensive and community schools was also of great significance in relation to the expansion of provision in the adult education sector.  They were established with the intention of fulfilling the educational needs&mdash;formal and informal&mdash;of the community in which they were located and the numbers participating in their adult education courses has been increasing steadily.  I would invite the <Col N="306" /> Members of the Seanad to examine the courses which the community schools provide.  They usually have a handbook which gives details of these courses and I think Senators would be truly amazed at the efforts that have been made in this area.</P>
    <P>The contribution from the third-level institutions&mdash;universities, colleges of technology and regional technical colleges&mdash;should also be noted.  Apart from the provision of part-time courses leading to degrees, about which Senator Martin was particularly proud the last time I was here and about which Senator Hillery spoke tonight, the university colleges have separate adult education or extra mural departments serving the adult education requirements, not only of those adults in the immediate surroundings, but also in adjoining and even distant counties.  Senator Connaughton is familiar with the adult education department of University College, Galway and he gave us his ideas on how beneficial it was to that area.  The colleges of technology in Dublin have always been associated with adult education activities, operating as they do under the control of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The regional technical colleges operate under the vocational education committees and make a valuable contribution to the adult education provision in their respective regions.</P>
    <P>There are also voluntary agencies in receipt of grants for their adult education activities.  Senator Whitaker made the point that the Government should be supportive of these and that their input should be sustained by the Government but that the Government should not dominate them or exclude them, and I agree with that point of view.  Other examples are the Dublin Institute for Adult Education; The College of Industrial Relations, Dublin; Muintir na Tíre; Macra na Tuaithe; the Irish Countrywomen's Association; and the National Youth Council of Ireland. There are many others&mdash;The National Association of Adult Education have a <Col N="307" /> particular function of seeking to effect the cohesion of the efforts of all statutory and voluntary bodies to promote adult education and to act as an advisory and consultative body to them.</P>
    <P>The National Institutes of Higher Education in Limerick and Dublin, working in harmony with the NCEA, may be expected to make a particularly substantial contribution to the promotion of adult education in the future.  Indeed, Senator Hillery in his contribution mentioned one particular innovative area where they are going to flex their muscles.</P>
    <P>In this short review I did not refer to the excellent work done in many areas under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labour, RTE and a variety of cultural and recreational bodies, grant-aided or otherwise.  I consider, however, that I have indicated in sufficient detail the present pattern to enable me to proceed to explain the aim and purpose of a new scheme for the appointment of 50 adult education officers which has been introduced this year.  I thought Senator Murphy's reference to them was singularly begrudging and unworthy of him.  He was followed in the same lines by, I think, Senator Robinson.  The idea for appointing these came from my perusal of the Murphy Report.  It was my own idea.  It was from the purely educational point of view that I approached it and, consequently, I feel somewhat resentful that it should be suggested that these officers were appointed by me, or the idea thought up by me, for other than educational reasons.</P>
    <P>In a circular to vocational education committees in August 1979, it was stated that I had given consideration to the basis on which a scheme for the appointment of adult education officers throughout the country might most effectively and equitably be organised, and that I desired to inform the committees of the arrangements which I considered to be most appropriate for the purpose.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged that the organisers should discharge functions of an organising and co-ordinating nature and <Col N="308" /> you can see from the use of those words that this can embrace both the voluntary bodies' efforts and the more structured efforts of the vocational eductation committees and others, and that these functions should include liaison with all appropriate local community interests.  It was the intention also that the organisers should have a role to play from an educational point of view in the context of the provision of courses for local economic development.  An outline of the most specific functions, duties and responsibilities of these organisers would include the following: to identify the educational needs of adults in the area&mdash;this is a research idea; to examine the existing provision of adult education courses and facilities; to suggest possible areas of co-operation between agencies and services engaged in the provision of adult education; to prepare for the VEC Adult Education Sub-Committee a Draft Annual Programme of Adult Education activities; to organise the programme as approved by the VEC Adult Education Sub-Committee and by the VEC; to provide an information and advisory service on adult education courses and facilities; to co-operate with other local statutory and voluntary organisations, especially with those with a particular interest in adult education; to prepare an annual report on the adult education programme for the VEC and for the Minister for Education; and to liaise with local economic interests in relation to the organisation of courses for the provision of skills needed for local development.</P>
    <P>I would envisage there, courses <i>in situ</i> in the area covered or if necessary through proper liaison to organise courses elsewhere outside the specific area of the organiser.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that at least one organiser should be allocated to each county area, with provision for more than one in some county areas and with an appropriate allocation for certain county borough areas.  Three of the organisers are to be appointed to cater on a regional basis, namely in the northwest, midlands and south-east, their duties being specifically related to the <Col N="309" /> Arts in the context of the report entitled &ldquo;The Place of the Arts in Irish Education: Report of the Arts Council Working Party on the Arts in Education 1979&rdquo;.  In the distribution of the services of the organisers, particular regard was had to special requirements, which include Gaeltacht districts.</P>
    <P>It was considered, in general, that the organisers might most appropriately be appointed by vocational education committees, under the procedures normally operative in the case of the appointment of vocational teachers, subject to the approval of the Minister in each case.  The full co-operation of vocational education committees and of the sub-committees appointed for this purpose was expected, to ensure that adequate consideration should be given to needs and aspirations in the matter of adult education of all the schools&mdash;vocational, secondary, community and comprehensive&mdash;in each area concerned so that a co-ordinated scheme might be developed for the benefit of the whole community.</P>
    <P>It was considered that each vocational education committee to which the services of one adult education organiser, or more, would be allocated, should appoint an adult education sub-committee under the provisions of section 21 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  Such committee should, as appropriate to the area concerned, be representative of such local interests as another vocational education committee and secondary, comprehensive and community schools within the area, as well as including, to whatever extent should be feasible, representatives of voluntary bodies whose experience and advice in adult education matters would be advantageous. The voluntary bodies in question would include Aontas, Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Tuaithe, Macra na Feirme, Banntracht na Tuaithe.</P>
    <P>The organisers would be required to hold qualifications recognised for purposes of appointment as teachers in post-primary schools, and would be expected, in addition, to have a capacity for work in adult education and/or community <Col N="310" /> development, to have had, in fact, experience in that field, to have a track record.  For purposes of appointment in a permanent whole-time capacity, it would be necessary for an appointee to satisfy the Department of Education as to his competency in the Irish language before taking up duty.</P>
    <P>This new scheme for the appointment of adult education organisers represents a continuation of the measures introduced in the sixties and seventies to provide greater educational opportunities for all our people.  I refer to the arrangements for comprehensive and community schools, the free education scheme, special free school transport scheme, the scheme of higher education grants and so on.  All of these brought about an extraordinary expansion in the numbers availing themselves of formal education.  It is particularly relevant, because a number of Senators very properly said that the whole idea in adult education, as in the other areas, is to provide access to every body and to provide equality of opportunity to our citizens.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that it should have been possible for me to take this step in the matter of expansion of adult education provision as a significant feature of the system of education as a whole.  It carries forward the movement initiated in the sixties for the expansion of education facilities which has been so successful and has contributed so magnificently to growth and progress in the economy and the sense of individual well-being and satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Now, I said I would take some of the points that were made during the debate and deal with them as quickly as possible. I must say a word of thanks to the people who contributed to the debate and also say that the points made have been noted by me and I will take account of them, even if I cannot, in the time available to me, deal with all of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy spoke of his own experience in a limited way in adult education&mdash;in particular, his experience with the Daon-scoil which was organised by the Ceard Cumann in Cork city, and <Col N="311" /> went on to establish the thesis that what was really at issue was educational opportunity, a simple matter of social justice.  He dealt with the adult education provision in University College, Cork. He said that some of the courses which they provided were simply watered-down versions of various disciplines at various areas outside the university city itself.  The whole idea of <i>éducation permanente</i>, which was very much the &ldquo;inthing&rdquo; a few years ago, seemed to have got lost somewhere along the way; the French were very keen on it, the whole idea of the formal period, retraining period, middle life period, education and training for retirement and so on.  The canvas was wide and well filled in and there has not been the follow-up on it and the commitment to it that we thought there would be when the whole idea was mooted.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Murphy referred to the community schools.  I have mentioned them already and would like people to have a look at their programmes because I think they deserve great credit, apart altogether from the old-established educational system which has been providing adult education since 1930.  I would like to have statistics on a national basis with regard to functional illiteracy.  We have some statistics on it, but I am not at all satisfied that we know the full extent of the problems.  By the very nature of functional illiteracy it is difficult to reach it and those people who have been pioneering in this field have discovered that the true illiteracy, where it exists, and functional illiteracy which exists on a wider scale, tend to conceal themselves. It is very difficult to get at them. There is an obligation on us to try to find out what the facts are and to provide the remedies to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to both city and rural drop-outs and the obligation which we have to those.  He referred to the folk schools in Denmark.  It is interesting to recall that the folk schools in Denmark were originally non-technical; they were not concerned with skills at all.  They were concerned with the folklore and <Col N="312" /> history and the spiritual side of their community, but it is generally agreed that, flowing from this, there developed a love for country, a love for education, a desire to develop the skills which sustained the economy.  In other words, though the specific purpose of the school was not the imparting of skills in effect, it meant that there developed as a result of the work of those schools, a more highly skilled community.</P>
    <P>The point that Senator Murphy made was a very valid one&mdash;that the over 45s, by their own sacrifices as taxpayers and in other personal ways, were responsible for the developments in education for the younger people that have taken place over the last few years and that there should be something available to them by way of adult education&mdash;some of the fruits of what they themselves, by their sacrifices, had made available to others. I accept that fully.  I accept also the Senator's point that &ldquo;Educate, that you may be free&rdquo; is capable of bearing a far wider meaning than, possibly&mdash;although we may do him an injustice in this&mdash;Thomas Davis had thought of at that time.  It is true that education when it maximises the choices of people is in fact freeing them to a great extent, and perhaps it is an aspect of education that we should emphasise more&mdash;the greater the education provided, the greater the freedom.</P>
    <P>I dealt already with the Senator's suggestion that my appointment of the 50 adult education officers was more a sop to job creation than to educational development.  I said I reject that suggestion and I reject it totally because it was purely in the educational context that I thought of it, and it was purely for the development of adult education services that it was put into execution.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey supported Senator Murphy's main theme and she quoted the former chairman of the Higher Education Authority about the importance of recurrent or second-chance education.  I should think that our adult education provision should develop in that line and I would like to comment here on something that I think Senator <Col N="313" /> Connaughton and others said: it is not enough to have the provision, you have to sell it, also, you have to inform the people that the opportunities are there, and even induce them to avail of them.  I worked for a while in London, where there were great opportunities in adult education available.  Many of the exiles from Ireland did not know about them; they were not sold to them; they were not helped to avail of them.  This was a great loss to them.  Of latter years, people have taken it on themselves to make known to exiles in the various Irish centres what the education opportunities available to them in adult education are and they are being availed of.  This is in line with social developments and so on in that particular area which I know well.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey said that especially young mothers in suburban areas should have provision made for them.  I do not know if it was not slightly utopian to think that each housing estate should have a special adult education school built; she even said she would sacrifice five houses to have one education centre. The general thesis is correct, that it could only enrich their lives and it could have a significant bearing in community development where young couples in new estates, thrown together from various parts of the city, do not know each other and there has to be some social vehicles for welding them together into a community; if it is an educational vehicle, so much the better.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey mentioned the importance of a training scheme for adult educators.  There is at least one university course available in the country and I think it arose directly from the Murphy Report.  The graduates of it are available as adult educators fully trained in that field.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch said that the onus seemed to be put on the Government to get everything done.  Some of the Senators referred to the voluntary bodies that make provision for adult education and said they should be sustained.  I am in agreement with that particular thesis. Senator after Senator referred over and over again to the expansion of <Col N="314" /> knowledge, the quick obsolescence of skills and the role that adult education should play in dealing with that problem. I see that there will be an obligation on adult educators to look after that factor in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch referred also to the use of radio and television.  It was interesting to hear Senator Hillery say that NIHE, Dublin, in its study of this matter had found that perhaps that particular aspect would be much too expensive.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Connaughton for his appreciation of the development which provides adult education officers in the various areas.  He made one very pertinent point and I think the organisers of the open university have also adverted to this, that those who have a certain amount of education have an appetite for more.  There is the danger that courses that are provided will be patronised by people who already have reached quite a sophisticated stage in their own education.  There should be a <i>caveat</i> lest they be allowed to monopolise it.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton also expressed his support for the continuation of voluntary effort.  He said one other pertinent thing, that general courses often did not excite any interest in areas where there had not been an earlier solid foundation in education.  He made the point that where specific courses, related to the specific needs of individuals, were organised the response was good in terms of numbers and of interest.  He was talking there in terms of what he called the 60 per cent who have nothing more than primary education.  Some people during the debate have been using statistics that are a bit out of date in that regard.  We must realise that a very high percentage of our population is now under 25 and that the statistic of those who have had only primary education has changed considerably.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Connaughton when he says that there is a great ocean of talent, great potential, which adult education can help to develop.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy made the point that there is a heavy obligation to look after <Col N="315" /> places for the youth and that is a first priority.  She was taken to task for this by Senator Keating, and I think unjustly so.  We must realise that we have a very heavy commitment to the formal, ordinary education course, as of now.  It is an interesting statistic, and a true one, that we have exactly three times the birth rate of the Six Counties at the moment in the Republic of Ireland, and a much higher percentage birth rate than they have in the United Kingdom.  It is our duty to see to it that to the maximum extent possible provision should be made for the young people.  They are not mutually exclusive but I agree, to a certain extent, with Senator Cassidy that we should not deprive the young people of first chance education, to develop adult education.  The resources are scarce, as she said, but what we have to do is try to cope as best we can with the formal period and make as much provision as possible for adult education.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson talked of adult education, very properly, in general, as she said, with regard to the provision of equality of opportunity.  She said that adult education was the Cinderella of the educational world; I do not accept that&mdash;it has not been from the very beginning of the century; it has had a very honoured place in our education system.  I think that she was on an ideological binge in part of what she said.  The intention of Government is to make resources available so that across the full spectrum of our society, irrespective of the economic situation, of the family, educational provision should be made; all parties in the Houses of the Oireachtas are committed to that.  I think one can get oneself hung up on an ideological clothes hanger and I think we should be very careful about that.  She said that what we have of adult education is <i>ad hoc</i> and unstructured.  I suggest the Senator does not understand the words <i>ad hoc</i> and unstructured, because what adult education is provided is structured, and well structured, in this country.  She made a very useful contribution but I think that in <Col N="316" /> some areas&mdash;perhaps she did not have enough time to develop her points&mdash;she was a little off beam.  She gave a long definition from UNESCO about adult education.  It put me in mind of the Spartan statesman who listened to a diplomat from another country and said, &ldquo;Your speech was so long that I had forgotten the beginning of it by the time you reached the end of it.&rdquo;  The essence of a definition should be that it be brief and intelligible.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson said&mdash;and I do not think anybody will dispute it&mdash;that we cannot afford not to have a policy for adult education, for recurrent education. She misquoted the payment available to teachers in the Crumlin College for the part-time work.  The rate of payment she mentioned is lower than one of the scales, at least, of payment available.  I agree fully with her that career guidance, paricularly in certain suburban areas anyway, is of the greatest importance, so that people who, some Senators said, may have hated school and hated formal schooling but have found a niche for themselves in adult education and want to go some place, should have the benefit of career guidance.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding made a plea for the handicapped and said that consideration should be taken of another aspect of adult education which surfaced in the debate in the speeches of several Senators&mdash;that is, the importance of adult education for personal development. I do not think that Senator Connaughton meant to exclude that aspect when he said that people would get adult education in certain areas and thus be able to put something back into the community. I do not think that he meant to exclude that important part of adult education which is connected with personal development.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating, I think, looks on education with a jaundiced eye.  His basic thesis, again correct, stressed the importance of the speed of change.  He stressed the importance of keeping on the learning process, that history had evolved, that now all the waking hours have not to be spent on toil, as they had been, and that what is done with the time <Col N="317" /> saved by technological advance is very important and should be filled with education.  He talked about the possibility for adult education in the communications revolution.  He said that the telecommunications revolution made the advances in adult education cheap and possible.  Senator Whitaker referred to this area as well.  The money saved in one area may be available to be put into this area of telecommunications.  This is something that will be very much alive in the next 20 years, at the end of the century.</P>
    <P>I reject Senator Keating's very pessimistic view of our education system.  He talked about division between clerks and their subjects.  He talked about division on grounds of sex, religion and so on.  He over-emphasised the blackness of it.  Thousands of people are educated co-educationally from the primary grade upwards.  Those who are not are not necessarily lost for ever.  He came back to a thesis upon which I heard him expatiate in another place about the clerks and the people with dirt under their fingernails.  This dichotomy is not what he claims it is in our normal society.  I would not accept that the clerks would arrogate to themselves any superiority over the people who are using manual skills.  Senator Conroy sent me a note with the words <i>Consilio Manuque</i> on it which he assures me is the motto of the College of Surgeons.  It was also that of the saint King Louis of France.  It means &ldquo;brain and hand&rdquo;.  I do not think there is in our society any superiority complex of the clerk over the skilled person, whatever may be the situation in other societies.  I am not being chauvinistic about this.  The skilled person in Ireland has a very honoured place even in our mythology.</P>
    <P>The Senator said that our education was authoritarian.  Perhaps Senator Keating is a little out of touch with the schools.  I will admit that our educational system was over-authoritarian.  I do not think that that over-authoritarian attitude continues today.  He made a plea for the women who have been programmed to believe in their own inferiority.  I must be consorting with the wrong <Col N="318" /> women.  He mentioned illiteracy and it is a question that we should take to heart.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery went through the institutions that were providing adult education and instanced the very interesting project of NIHE, Dublin, to develop what is called distant study.  He also emphasised the acceleration and change in skills and how important it is that we should deal with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Kilbride made a plea for the rural dwellers who had to leave primary school for one reason or another and who now have to cope even on a minor scale with scientific instruments and the skills that were not necessary in former times.  I accept this point that provision should be made to help him or her to deal with such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker talked about needs and he also referred to the desire of people to have an adequate adult education facility available to them for their own personal satisfaction.  He emphasised that the Government should be supportive of those who are involved in adult education and that this was a proper role for the Government in addition to making their own developments.  I was very pleased to hear him say that there was a possibility that some of the capital costs would be lightened in the future by the developments in technology, particularly in telecommunications.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Murphy and Senator Hussey for having put down this motion. I have learned a good deal from the debate and I hope that I may be able to act on some of the suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise not to detain the House too long at this late hour as we have already reached the normal time of Adjournment.  I am very thankful to the Leader of the House who has made time available for this motion, to the Minister for his attendance and interest, to all my fellow Senators who have contributed and to those who have <Col N="319" /> sat and listened with great interest throughout the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large measure of agreement on what our priorities would be if we had endless resources and if we could achieve the kind of society we all desire. Because I wanted to give the whole subject a full airing I see no point in attempting to divide the House on this motion. I accept and thank the Minister for his assurance that he has taken a note of the points made during the debate.  I do not intend to cover again what everybody said.  I made notes on what everybody said but the Minister has spared me a lot of the trouble there.  As he said, certain themes kept recurring throughout the debate.  One of the problems mentioned in the Murphy Report is that the real human tragedies of the people who are educationally deprived are not so much those who come along to adult education classes and who are aware of the opportunities, but the vast majority of the educationally deprived who are simply not aware that these opportunities and facilities are available.  The Minister, in the course of his statement, listed the facilities available but subsequently in his own comments made it clear from his own experience in London, an area where these opportunities were, that the pity was that people were simply not aware of them.  One of the most valuable activities being undertaken by voluntary institutes in Dublin and Limerick is to engage in what in jargon is termed &ldquo;outreach&rdquo;, that is to say, you try to contact our social system who are so demoralised by poverty and ignorance that they have not the faintest clue where adult education classes are or what potential improvement there is in the system for them.  How to contact that 80 per cent is a problem.  One, perhaps, naive suggestion as to how it could be done links in with another theme which kept cropping up throughout the debate, namely, the importance of telecommunications. Why not use the concept of an education information bureau something on the lines of the Health <Col N="320" /> Education Bureau?  If we think it sensible that the people can be reached through television, radio and press advertising in regard to their health, why could not the same idea be implemented in regard to the possibilities of self-fulfilment that lie in education?</P>
    <P>Senator Keating, Senator Whitaker and others referred to the communications revolution and said that the time to start availing of these facilities is now. Senator Cranitch said that we have two radio channels and, two television channels. I suggest that people do not want an endless supply of soporific entertainment. In 1974 Radio Telefís Éireann put on a series of adult education programmes.  It was a series called <i>A Question of Identity.</i>  Modesty would normally forbid me mentioning that I myself contributed to that programme, but it was a pronounced success.  It made few concessions to the viewing audience. The presentation of the programme was in a rather austere, conventional classroom format and yet the response was highly enthusiastic.  I do not understand why RTE, in view of their known interest in this kind of programme, did not follow that up with a whole systematic series of educational programmes.</P>
    <P>I accept everything that has been said here about the primacy of economic information at the moment and the need to redress our white-collar and clerical preoccupations but it seems that the people of this country need illumination on ideology and on concepts which are bandied about every day in the newspapers as much as they need technological education.  What a splendid idea it would be if on television there was an objective programme on the true nature and meaning of republicanism.  We would be rendering a service not only to our people but to our political parties.</P>
    <P>I want to comment also on the references that Senator Hillery made to the role of the universities.  I praised the role of the universities in this field, but the recent decision to do away with the gradual accumulation of credits for entry was a reactionery decision which runs <Col N="321" /> counter to the kind of approach we should be having to adult education.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what Senator Cassidy had to say.  She has a point and, to an extent, she corrected perspective. There is no reason why the resources for one area should necessarily exclude the other.  She said the Minister was put to the pin of his collar to maintain the existing services.  If that is so then we should all be rowing in behind the Minister to get <i>in toto</i> a greater percentage of the national budget for education. There are in our public services a large number of areas where there is a considerable wastage of money.</P>
    <P>At the risk of annoying the Minister further I will elaborate a little on what I said about Aontas.  Aontas are in some ways a more ambitious organisation than some of their European counterparts who have substantially more funding from Government.  Aontas, with a very tiny staff, attempt to hold seminars, publish periodicals and act as an advisory service and even as an in-service training unit.  They have 125 organisations affiliated to them and they are quite unusual in their comprehensive and representative nature.  It costs about £35,000 to run the organisation and they are running out of money.  Their revenue from Government sources was initially £10,000 in 1974.  It has now gone to £10,500.  I would like to divulge between ourselves the source of their main revenue.  It comes from a commercial interest who have motives of their own but it is quite undesirable that this organisation should ever have been funded by commercial interests and that their small staff should be preoccupied seeking commercial sponsorship.  It seems to be a crazy way of running this organisation.  I would recommend that point to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's generosity of comment on my contribution and I am sorry that I made him feel rather resentful when he understood from me that I attributed to him rather low motives for appointing the 50 adult education organisers.  In a sense I was reflecting a widespread feeling among <Col N="322" /> those in the adult education area that in the absence of any other more overall comprehensive policy statement this was the interpretation placed upon that action. I accept fully what the Minister has said and perhaps he would attribute my petulance and lack of generosity to the momentary symptoms of tobacco nicotine withdrawal.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its interest in this motion.  This is one of the moments when I am proud to be a Member of Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>Níor mhaith liomsa an rún a bhrú ar an Teach.  Ní thuigim, chun na fírinne a insint, cad a deintear sna cúrsaí seo?  Níor mhaith liom go dtabharfaí cúl láimhe don rún ach chomh beag.</P>

      <P>Normally in a motion like this where there is no contention the motion is withdrawn.  That means that the Seanad has noted the sentiments expressed on both sides.</P>
