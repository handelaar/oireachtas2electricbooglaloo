      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I hope we will have a happy relationship with him.  We are a little disappointed on this side of the House that the Minister for Agriculture is not here.  I am sure he has other business to do but we would have liked him to be here today so that we could direct our remarks to him.  I am sure what we will say will be conveyed to him by the Minister who is present.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Bill.  It is a very important Bill as far as the agricultural industry and the dairy industry are concerned. It provides for an amendment and an extension of certain provisions in section 6 of the Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1973. We can speak about the functions of An Bord Bainne and the dairy industry as a whole.  The future prospects for An Bord Bainne and the dairy industry are good. There are many pessimists who preach the gospel of doom but, as a person deeply involved in the industry, and in the production end of the industry, I feel we do not need pessimists now but optimists.</P>
      <P>We have been fighting our case in Europe and while we are trying to negotiate price increases for our farmers we must be optimistic.  The pessimists are endangering the case we can make in Europe and I hope my contribution today will help our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a case to make in Europe and encouragement must be given, not alone by Members of the Oireachtas but by the farming organisations, for the promotion of the future development of our dairy industry.  The producers&mdash;and they are the farmers&mdash;must be satisfied that, if they produce more, they will be compensated for doing so and they must be satisfied that there is and will be a market for their produce.  I believe the <Col N="647" /> markets are there and not enough is being done to seek out the markets that are there.  I will elaborate on that later.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne have a major part to play in the development of our future markets.  That is obvious.  Bord Bainne have been playing that part since their foundation in 1972.  They have made very little use, if any, of the intervention scheme.  Recently some butter has gone into intervention, but the amount is so small that it is not worth talking about. We would hope that our butter would be sold.  World production of dairy produce will increase.  With greater selling power within the producing nations, especially within the EEC, total production can be sold at a profit, which is the important thing.  There is no use in selling something if we cannot make a profit. Any profit we can make out of the sale of our produce comes directly back into the national kitty and, through the national kitty, into the farmers' pockets.</P>
    <P>Agriculture in Ireland accounts for 20 per cent of the gross domestic product and about 23 per cent of the working population.  The general work force does not understand how vital it is that the agricultural industry should expand.  The message should be told and told again to all concerned, all those people who are knocking agriculture at the moment, that nearly a quarter of the working population work in agriculture.  It accounts for about 40 per cent of the total Irish exports. People should think about the value of agriculture to the economy because of the exports which are generated by the development of agriculture.  It is time people realise that 40 per cent of total Irish exports are agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>Any downward trend in production in agriculture would have an effect on the total Irish exports because extra production in agriculture is exported.  Sixty per cent of Irish agricultural output is exported. Forty per cent is consumed at home That is a message for those who are doubtful about the value of agriculture to this country.  Any increase in agricultural production will be exported.  It is very <Col N="648" /> important that we should encourage more and more agricultural production. We can see our balance of payments and the effect that increased production in agriculture would have on that and we must try to strike a balance.  Every day as we take up the papers we see that the balance is going against this country.  If we produce more agricultural produce that must be exported; the only way we can get rid of it is through exports, and this will help our balance of payments.  It is very necessary that we give confidence back to the industry.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of confidence among the farmers and a lot of the blame can be put on the Government.  They are not encouraging agricultural production sufficiently. The introduction and threat of extra taxation on farmers do not give encouragement. Whatever section they come from, whether it is Government, trade or a trade union, people must think again of the effects that any downward trend in agricultural production will have on the country as a whole and on employment in the agricultural industry.  Of the working population 23 per cent are involved in agriculture.  Any downgrading of agriculture will hinder its development.</P>
    <P>Dairying is more important in this country than in any other country of the EEC and I will give figures showing that later.  It is easier for the other eight countries to bear the cost of a reduction in milk supply than it is for Ireland because of our dependence on milk production and in the way the dairy industry operates in Ireland.  Many of the farmers, because of land structure and climatic conditions, cannot change from milk to any other form of agricultural production such as beef, cereals or beet.  They are committed historically to milk production and the real example is the development of the creameries and the co-operatives.  The creamery industry developed mainly in the areas of high density in Munster, where 68 per cent or two-thirds of our milk supply to creameries is processed, giving employment to over 10,000 workers and a way of living to small and medium farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> Famous creameries come to mind and Senators will understand that I am naming them to show where they are situated, the type of land that is around them and the type of development that is taking place in those areas.  In those places very little of any other type of agricultural production can take place. The creameries that come to mind are Mitchelstown, where I have worked, Golden Vale, Centenary, Drinagh, Bandon, Ballyrowe, Newmarket and North Cork.  Those are all in Munster.  An examination of the situation of each of those will show that it is of the utmost importance that further development takes place in those areas.  In Leinster we have Avonmore, Wexford, Kilkenny, Callan and Westmeath creameries.  In Connacht, there is the North Connaught Farmers Co-operative, a recent development which is an amgamation of small creameries in that area.  I am sure many people here have read about that.  It is a result of the encouragement given by farmers, industry.  Government and other people who had an interest in the development of the west of Ireland.  In the west also are Kiltogher and Killasnett.  Then we go to Ulster where we have Lough Egish, Killeshandra, Bailieboroúgh and Donegal; again the picture is the very same.  The same type of area is involved and if you are going to allow the non-development of that area by the reduction in milk supply then we will get no respect from future generations.  It is necessary that further development within the industry through the development of the co-operative movement continues.  If the people are to be encouraged to stay in rural Ireland then rural Ireland must prosper.  It will prosper through the co-operative movement and the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>It is known worldwide that the demand for milk and dairy products will increase, but the main areas in which the increase will take place are in the countries of the Middle East and the USSR, who at this time pay a lower price for dairy products than is required to compensate for their production.  One product for which demand will increase and which should bring a reasonable income <Col N="650" /> is cheese; the production of cheese is very important.  The present Government made a mistake when they removed the subsidy on cheese on the home market because we should develop a taste for cheese at home as well as encouraging it internationally.  Cheese is wholesome and a good basis for a meal. It is a full product.  The highest demand for it at the moment is from western Europe but it is expected that demand will develop in North America, Eastern Europe, Japan and the USSR, and if we take our expertise to the oil exporting countries we may get a good return. Perhaps a deal could be made for the sale of our dairy products&mdash;cheese, milk, dried milk, skim powder and so forth&mdash;in return for the importation of oil into this country.  The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy might come together to do something about it. Demand is expected to decrease from countries which have a developed market economy.  There should be some demand for milk powder, condensed and evaporated milk powder especially in the oil producing countries.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne should now and in the future be actively involved in the sale of such products in those countries.  The countries that should be explored are: Algeria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mexico, Peru, Cuba, Brazil, Syria, the Phillipines, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, India and Egypt, which cover a vast section of the globe.  If we carry out a survey within those countries, if we go and speak to the people concerned there with exports and imports I am told the products can be sold, that their markets are wide open to development because these products can be used as raw materials.  Speaking as somebody involved in the dairy industry I am aware there is an expanding market in those countries for the re-processing or recycling of milk products.  In this regard the EEC should set aside some portion of its expenditure for the support of dairy products and the development of the relevant markets.  Ireland alone can do very little without the help of the other eight member countries from <Col N="651" /> whom finance might be made available for the type of survey to which I have referred in those countries.  Such money would be not alone well invested but everybody in the EEC would benefit therefrom.</P>
    <P>Our dependence on Britain for the purchase of our dairy products should remain in the future.  But because of the reduced consumption of dairy products, because, like ourselves, Britain will also gain from the sales of agricultural produce to the EEC, farmers in Britain will produce more if they are paid to do so.  In itself this will cause us many problems, if they are to be self-efficient in production and have a remainder for export.  Our greatest problem will be future negotiations with New Zealand in regard to allowing their cheese and butter into Britain.  This will be of great importance. The quota must be eliminated or severely reduced.  Let us all acknowledge that New Zealand had to be allowed time to find other markets.  I believe they have been afforded sufficient time now, with quotas ceasing by 1980, thus affording us breathing space to develop new markets within Britain.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne will have a major part to play in this development and I am sure, as in the past, will come up trumps in the future.  Bord Bainne's priority in the development of our export dairy products must be in finding out where are the best possibilities, product by product, market by market.  They must show that the Irish dairy industry has something unique to offer.  Our dairy produce has been well received anywhere it has been offered; Bord Bainne should have no difficulty in getting that across.  Bord Bainne must improve Ireland's image as a base of high quality food.  Their executive staff have been in the market place selling our products and emphasising their very high standard.  They must continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the more milk that is consumed within the EEC the less need there will be for its sale in other markets. The consumption of liquid milk within <Col N="652" /> the EEC absorbs only 25 per cent of the total production of milk.  It is essential that some Community promotion campaign be agreed to promote the sale of extra liquid milk.  To this end some portion of Community expenditure should be set aside for its promotion and publicity, so that milk and cream will carry the same weight in advertising products as beers and soft drinks.  The media data for the UK in 1978 shows an expenditure ratio of six to one in favour of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages.  In West Germany the corresponding ratio is an extraordinary 12 to one in favour of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages.  In the whole EEC the ratio in favour of soft drinks is in the region of ten to one. Therefore, it is necessary that something be done in that regard.  It is wrong and is defeatist for the dairy industry of the whole EEC to sit and watch its major markets slowly being eroded by those competing products.</P>
    <P>I am sure Bord Bainne and their counterpart marketing organisations within the other countries of the EEC have sufficient marketing skills and the EEC sufficient finance available to permit the right type of advertising of dairy products.  We have sufficiently bad advertising from a campaign organised by the section that wants to get rid of milk and introduce soft drinks into the production end.  The consumption of soft drinks and of milk cannot be compared. Milk has something to offer; it is a full food.  Soft drinks have nothing to offer except the quenching of thirst.  That type of ratio to which I have referred, ten to one, in favour of the advertising of soft drinks is definitely wrong.  The necessary money must be made available and, if it is, I am sure Bord Bainne will engage in the appropriate advertising.  Bord Bainne cannot do anything without finance being made available.  If the necessary finance is there I am sure Bord Bainne will not be found wanting and I am sure that the necessary finance would be made available if we sat down and thought about the problem, if we thought about the situation whereby because of advertising, soft drinks and beverages can command that type of market while <Col N="653" /> milk can command only one-tenth of the same size of market.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the co-responsibility levy.  It is necessary to say something about the effect the co-responsibility levy will have in this country in terms of production.  The enthusiasm has gone from the agricultural sector.  There is concern about the future of agriculture.  Some injection must be made in that industry to encourage the farmers to develop agriculture.  In this context I shall refer only to one aspect.  I will not refer to the local levies: the farmers themselves have referred to those but I will try to make my case on the basis of the co-responsibility levy as it affects Ireland more than it affects any of the other countries.  If we examine the amount of milk produced in the other member countries of the EEC <i>vis-á-vis</i> our own production we find that our production levels can have only a minimum effect on the overall picture.  In other words, our country has not really developed its potential in milk production. We are only half way there while the other countries are at their maximum. Therefore, to stop our production by putting a co-responsibility levy on our farmers is wrong and whoever is responsible for it must see that that is righted.  I could go back over a long period of years to show the development of the dairy industry and of milk production in Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Belgium, the UK and Denmark.  Any such examination would show that this co-responsibility levy now being imposed in Ireland is wrong.</P>
    <P>I have here the figures for production in the various countries in 1978 and I understand these will show an increase for 1979.  The figures were supplied to me by Bord Bainne.  In 1978 the production of milk in Germany was 5,000 million gallons.  In France 5,400 million gallons were produced.  In Italy, the figure was 2,100 million gallons; in Holland, 2,400 million gallons and in the UK, 3,400 million gallons.  In Denmark, which is a small country, the figure was 1,140 million gallons and Ireland <Col N="654" /> produced 990 million gallons.  If we compare two of the countries, Germany and France, we will be talking about 10,000 million gallons of milk while our drop in the ocean is 990 million gallons.  Over a period of years those countries have developed by reason of their having been members of the EEC for much longer than Ireland has been a member.  We are only recent members of the EEC.  With the kind of money that was paid for milk products during their time in the EEC, these other countries were able to develop their industry.  They developed it to the extent that the average cow in Germany and France produces 1,300 to 1,500 gallons of milk a year whereas the average yield of our cows is about 700 gallons per cow or only 50 per cent of the development that has taken place in Germany and France.  In that situation it is not right for the EEC to impose a co-responsibility levy on Ireland.  We have not been able to develop the production of milk as we would have developed it had we been in the EEC as long as those countries are.  The price of milk before we went into the EEC was so low that farmers were not encouraged to increase production.  Were it not for the encouragement the dairy industry gave to the production of milk we would have been a very poor country.  Unless we are allowed to develop further now the production of dairy produce, our country will be worse off.  Our farmers are very worried at the moment and I do not have to tell anybody that.  We all know it.  Unless we do something to help them and encourage them to develop the dairy industry, not alone will they suffer but every person in this country will suffer also because the dairy industry is giving employment to up to 20,000 people.  The dairy industry is giving employment in areas where employment is needed.  That is in parts of rural Ireland where there are not any other sources of employment. If we want to maintain the population of rural Ireland, especially of the west of Ireland, and of the west of Munster, of west Cork and parts of Kerry, of Limerick and of Clare, we must allow the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> Bord Bainne inform me that no matter how much we develop and how much we produce in dairying they will sell it.  The proof is there.  They sold it already.  The intervention system was not used by Bord Bainne until very recently.  They have assured me that if they get the necessary encouragement from the Government and our EEC representatives they will seek the markets they believe are available.  What is necessary is finance to allow the development of the markets abroad and to advertise our products abroad.  In my opinion, what is not necessary is the levying of the farmers in this area.  We are talking now about the co-responsibility levy.  If the other Ministers of the EEC are shown the make-up of the dairy industry, in the areas where the industry has developed, they will be convinced that the co-responsibility levy is wrong for the development of milk in those areas.</P>
    <P>Ireland will be worse off if milk production is downgraded.  There are thousands of people in this country who do not understand that, but they should be made understand it.  They will suffer if the population is not kept in the west.  If the population is not allowed increase in the west and in Munster, they must go somewhere to find work, and that will be to the major cities.  There will be an influx of people into Dublin from those areas.  Who will pay to house these people? The city taxpayers.  We heard that PAYE marches have taken place and we realise the people in the PAYE sector are paying too high a price already.  If we do not allow the development of agriculture, the PAYE sector will have to pay more. This will lead to chaos and confusion in the cities.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to encourage Bord Bainne to go out and do the job they were appointed to do.  We have very efficient people involved in the sale of our dairy products.  The personnel are willing and able to do more at very little extra cost, but we must encourage farmers to produce more, to increase their cow yield.  Our average cow yield is in the region of 660 gallons per cow whereas <Col N="656" /> the average yield in the countries I mentioned is in the region of 1,200 to 1,500 gallons per cow per annum.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the financial development of Bord Bainne since 1973. In 1973 Bord Bainne borrowed £43 million from the bank.  There was a guarantee of £20 million which covered 47 per cent of the borrowed money.  In 1974 they borrowed £45 million, the guarantee was for £20 million, 44 per cent.  In 1975 they borrowed £73 million, the guarantee remained at £20 million, 27 per cent.  In 1976 they borrowed £79 million, the guarantee was increased to £40 million, 46 per cent.  In 1977 they borrowed £103 million, and, under the new system introduced in 1976, they got additional credit from their suppliers. That was the right move.  That year they got £28 million credit from their suppliers. which totalled £131 million.  The guarantee remained at £40 million, only 31 per cent of the total.  In 1978 they borrowed £151 million and £47 million additional credit, which totalled £198 million, and the guarantee remained at £40 million, 20 per cent.  Today we are increasing the guarantee to £90 million. If Bord Bainne continue developing as they are and if they and the farmers get the right encouragement, that is all that is needed.  Bord Bainne will then have to borrow more from the banks.  This year that £90 million will guarantee about 50 per cent or 47 per cent of their loan, taking in the additional credit from suppliers. If we allow a situation to develop where that guarantee will be reduced from 47 per cent to 27 per cent, up to 46 per cent and down to 20 per cent over a period of three or four years, that is not the right way to go about it.  If we feel it is necessary that the cover should be 47 per cent or 50 per cent in a certain year, then it is necessary, in my opinion, that the cover should be around 50 per cent every year.  Some system should be introduced to allow the additional guarantee over the years.  Bord Bainne asked for more than £90 million.  I believe the request was in the region of £120 million and the idea was that 50 per cent of the percentage cover would be guaranteed. That is very good business and <Col N="657" /> something should be done in that regard. There should be a set coverage, maybe 50 per cent, which would engender more confidence in Bord Bainne.  There is always worry about borrowing money from banks because of the escalation of interest rates.  It is necessary to have some substantial coverage to guarantee borrowers.</P>
    <P>I have said enough on this Bill, but what I have said was necessary, I hope it will be accepted by the Minister.  I hope he will allow the development of agriculture to take place and the dairy industry to expand.  If that is done and the co-responsibility levies, and the other levies that are now being imposed on farmers who are only making a mere living are removed, there is no doubt that encouragement will be given back to the industry. We will all benefit, whether we are Senators, Ministers or people on the dole.  Every section will benefit from the development of agriculture and the dairy industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill before the House.  Its purpose is to increase from £40 million to £90 million the level of guarantee to An Bord Bainne.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture is here to listen to the debate, because his interest, dedication and commitment to his Department and to agriculture are widely known and recognised.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill are the practical recognition by the Government of the success of the board in their task of marketing the produce of our dairy industry and an awareness by the Government of the need to improve and to expand our existing marketing arrangements. As Senator Butler in his very constructive contribution rightly pointed out, dairying represents a major proportion of the agricultural industry.  Its success or failure reflects itself not only in farm income but also in our balance of payments, balance of trade and also in our job creation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an established fact that three out of every five jobs created in this country have a direct or slightly indirect <Col N="658" /> relationship with the argicultural industry, either in the processing of agricultural produce or in the servicing of the industry itself.  Our valuable livestock exports are, of course, completely dependent on the dairying industry. Therefore, it is obvious to all, I am sure, that any threat to the industry will have to be courageously and firmly defended by the Government.</P>
    <P>We give a lot of lip service to agriculture saying it is the backbone of the economy.  It is something that is said and commented on by a cross-section of the community.  I find that very often this lip service is not backed up by any kind of practical action.  At the present time there seems to be a greater emphasis on talking about, for instance, farm tax than the benefit to the nation of a progressive, expanding agricultural industry. I say this honestly and sincerely, and I hope I am not considered biased because I am a farmer: any action by the Government or the EEC which will inhibit or restrict farm development will in the long term be to the detriment of every sector of our community.  Senator Butler developed that point very well.</P>
    <P>Dairy exports have increased from £50 million in 1972 to £450 million in 1978.  The figures speak for themselves. It must be obvious that our economic survival as a nation is dependent, not only on the maintenance of that level of exports, but on increasing them as far as we possibly can.  It is in that context that I support the Bill which strengthens the resources of the body responsible for these exports.</P>
    <P>Tributes have been paid to An Bord Bainne by the Minister and Senator Butler.  These tributes and comments are richly deserved.  The board have fulfilled their obligation and commitment to the sale of our agricultural produce.  Positive proof of that is their ability to find new markets, and their ability to sell produce outside of intervention.  This latter point is relevant.</P>
    <P>This Bill comes before the House at a time when there are strong threats from the EEC of action to cut back on dairy production.  As mentioned by Senator <Col N="659" /> Butler, it comes at a time when farm profits are at the lowest for some years, and when the benefits of EEC transitional prices have come to an end.  It comes also at a time when farm morale, at least in the short term, I hope, is at a low ebb.  Some of this is justified, but much of it is created by an overemphasis by agricultural spokesmen on gloomy forecasts for the future.  This kind of talk is defeatist.  I would prefer to reflect on the more progressive and more optimistic forecast of our new director of AnCOT, Dr. Walsh, who indicated that the future for agriculture was good and that the current stabilisation of prices presented a challenge for farmers to maintain and improve their incomes through greater efficiency and greater production.  I believe, knowing the agricultural industry, as I do, that Irish farmers will respond to that kind of challenge.  They have responded to it in the past.  The very fact that we are talking here today about surpluses, if such exist, is an indication that farmers have responded to that challenge.</P>
    <P>After encouraging farmers to specialise, as we have through our various agricultural policies, encouraging them to improve their efficiency and encouraging them to invest heavily and to borrow for the industry, there is a serious obligation on the Government and on the EEC to protect that investment. Not more than 12 months ago even the banks were encouraging farmers to take more than they actually needed for investment.  It is a sad state of affairs to find that those same banks are now taking those farmers by the throats and asking them to reduce their overdrafts drastically overnight.  It is regrettable that such should happen to the agricultural industry at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point as firmly as I can here today, and I know that I am making it to a willing listener when I am making it to the Minister of State, that there can be no going back now as far as the dairying industry is concerned.  Farmers cannot be left, in my opinion, carrying the can for bad economic <Col N="660" /> forecasting or inadequate marketing regulations, most of them outside the control of our own Government and within the EEC.  It needs to be made clear that we cannot tolerate or accept any move by the EEC to restrict the expansion of our dairying industry.  We should resist any such attempt by using our power of veto, if necessary.  That is a strong statement, but I think the threat to the industry would be so serious from the national point of view that our Government would have to take drastic action if it was necessary.  I campaigned vigorously when the proposal was put before us to join the EEC, and I would like to think that I played as prominent a part as any ordinary worker could play in that campaign.</P>
    <P>One of the motivating factors in regard to EEC membership as far as I was concerned was that there would be unlimited markets for our agricultural produce and farming would benefit considerably. In fairness, it must be said that Irish agriculture has benefited&mdash;there is absolutely no doubt about that and I hope the same situation will continue into the future.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there is marked insensitivity at EEC level in relation to the individual problems of member states, and it will have to be brought home clearly to the Community that there is a marked difference between the economies of the countries constituting the Community itself, for instance between us and the large industrialised, full employment economy of West Germany. That must be contrasted with the small family-sized agricultural holding in this country, where 60 per cent of our holdings are below 40 acres.  We are dependent, as Senator Butler rightly pointed out, on that kind of farm structure to maintain the balance between the rural and urban communities, and also to ensure that as many people as possible are employed in the agricultural industry. It is our most important industry, and even though we are making considerable progress on the industrial side, agriculture will continue to be the main industry on which our economy is based.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> It is also important to realise that as far as earning an economic livelihood from the small farms&mdash;and I have indicated that 60 per cent of them are below 40 acres&mdash;the enterprise carried on on those small holdings is a viable enterprise which will give the highest level of economic returns to the farmers themeslves.  The Agricultural Institute and everybody associated with farm management in the country have clearly indicated and proved that the only worthwhile viable enterprise for that size of family holding is a progressive dairying industry or enterprise.  Therefore, anything that would interfere with the progress and development of that will interfere immediately with farm structures and with the livelihood of thousands and thousands of our smaller farmers.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler made the point that we differ from the other member states because of our later entry to the EEC. Germany and all of the other major economies had been building up their agricultural industry from the moment that the Community was established.  We in Ireland have been making progress. Irish farmers have responded magnificently to the opportunities provided by EEC membership but we are still only in the process of building up the industry and, therefore, because we are now expanding at a faster rate than the agricultural economies already established, any introduction of a levy or a cutback would immediately hit us more seriously than any of the other member states.  That would be a serious situation for our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to surpluses, because of the size of our agricultural industry in relation to the larger member states we are only producing 5 per cent of the total dairy produce of the European Community as compared with 25 per cent for Germany.  That must be a strong bargaining and arguing point for our negotiators when they sit around the table to fight the case for our developing agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I want to refer to.  In the larger agricultural enterprises in the other member states&mdash;I <Col N="662" /> quoted Germany as an example&mdash;the milk is virtually produced in factories.  It is produced from cows that are very often housed all the year and being fed on imported concentrates from outside the member countries, and there is no difference between producing milk, from concentrates that are imported, and we are importing the products&mdash;of which we are very critical as far as New Zealand is concerned&mdash;directly from outside the Community.  The net result is the same: milk is being produced from resources imported from outside of the Community.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with the observation that we have been assisted in this country through grants from the EEC to improve the efficiency of the industry, and I am proud and pleased to come from a part of the country where we have one of the most modern processing plants in Europe, and that is the new Avonmore plant.  That plant has been established with the initiative of the amalgamation of smaller creameries in the area, but also with excellent grant assistance from the EEC.  The economics of that new modern processing plant are based on an increased and expanding milk intake and, therefore, in that context any attempt to interfere with the expansion of the industry in the Avonmore area, or elsewhere in Ireland for that matter, will militate against the thinking and the planning behind the establishment of such efficient plants.  If the unit cost increases in these plants arising from a reduced milk intake, in addition to the levies which have been referred to, the producer will have to carry that increased cost.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of milk processing and the modernisation and the streamlining of the industry in general, we cannot tolerate or accept any restrictions imposed from outside the country in relation to that kind of development.  As Senator Butler pointed out, there is a need for Bord Bainne to explore and to do some market research into new products.  Somebody shopping in a large supermarket recently was amazed at the number of dairy products <Col N="663" /> there which are not produced in this country.  Here is a challenge to An Bord Bainne to do some market research into new products and to enable the industry to diversify further.  I conclude by saying that we have merely laid the foundation stone for an expanding industry and it would be disastrous to the national interest if any action at present were to restrict its development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House at any great length.  Most of my points have been very ably made by Senators Butler and Hyland, both of whom were remarkably at one from each side of the House, in welcoming the Bill and in reinforcing the House's confidence in An Bord Bainne as an agency for the promotion and development of the dairy indsutry.  One point that was not touched on is worth referring to, particularly at present.  The Minister referred to the present threat to the dairy industry, of continued price restraint and, much more important and serious, proposals in Brussels aimed at restricting increases in milk production and at reducing the cost of the Community budget of support for the milk sector, which proposals must be resisted.  The necessity of resisting them has been reiterated by the two Senators who have spoken before me today.  The reasons they put forward are cogent and convincing ones.  First of all, the importance in terms of employment and the importance of the demographic distribution of the dairy industry through the country, very often giving support to some of our most neglected, depopulated regions. Then there is the very important argument that a certain momentum has been built up in individual farms and in cooperatives throughout the country over the past decade, which momentum should now be beginning to produce substantial results and the threat to which at the moment would be disastrous for our farmers in terms of morale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these and other arguments put forward are extremely important, but it is also important to note that we live in a <Col N="664" /> world where huge areas of the world population are starving.  The EEC, when they came together, were probably motivated, in the first place, by economic concerns but many who supported the EEC&mdash;I was not a strenuous supporter myself, being sceptical from the beginning&mdash;saw them also as the centre of enlightened thought with regard to the world and its economy. One of the scandals to emerge in our times is, not the production of a great deal of food, which is a very good thing, but the failure to achieve equitable distribution of that food throughout the globe when so much human suffering meets our eyes every time we switch on a television set, and there are famine-strickened communities in the Middle East, the East and all over the Third World, while the EEC have mountains of beef, cheese, and butter and lakes of milk and wine.  The worst possible argument is that the answer to an increasing butter mountain is to stop producing butter.  The answer to it is to thank God to be able to produce it, to find ways of distributing it equitably and selling it and even, if possible of giving it away.</P>
    <P>That is one of ways in which the EEC have failed us.  They have a co-operative development plan, which has gone a certain distance, and a food aid plan.  One of their great achievements is harnessing enormous potential for production.  But that vision will be absolutely negatived and destroyed if at this stage the enormous potential for production achieved in Europe is cut back, dissipated, frustrated, destroyed because the mechanisms for distributing that food, so miraculously produced, cannot be found. In other words, the challenge&mdash;not just the national or the Community but the global challenge&mdash;to the EEC at the moment is not to stop production but to bend their unique energies to finding means of distributing what is best in what is produced.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler says the advertising of beer and soft drinks bears a terrifying relationship of ten to one to the advertising of something as wholesome and salutary as milk and cheese.  That is a moral scandal and that is where the <Col N="665" /> emphasis of our thoughts should lie, particularly as we approach Christmas and see the unequal distribution of our own nation's wealth&mdash;we walk along O'Connell Street and see all the begging children, and the great deal of poverty that we have.  To say that the answer to food surpluses is to stop production is a most selfish and perverse manner of thinking.  The moral case must be argued.  You cannot tell farmers to stop producing when people are starving.  All the arguments put forward by the Minister, Senator Hyland and Senator Butler are there, but there are very obvious moral considerations and that is one of them which I add to the arguments already put forward.  It is extremely depressing to hear economists speaking about economics as if it were science with the same implacable laws as, say, physics, or the law of gravity; if something is let go, it falls to the ground and that is a law.  They say that there are laws of economics which really make it impossible for us to distribute meat mountains or butter mountains among starving people.  That law is of human making; it is not like the law of gravity, which is a law of nature.  If that law has been invented by humans, surely they can harness their ingenuity and change it to make things different.  I have not that ingenuity, but there is something wrong in a world where there are mountains of food and, at the same time, millions of women and children are starving.  To stop producing would be a way back to chaos.  Means of distribution must be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in very close agreement with Senator Martin. There is no doubt about it that, no matter how one looks at the entire EEC policy, whatever else is the answer to our problem, to stop farmers from producing is not.  Once that happens, not alone will it remove a remote chance that a lot of starving millions will get our food, one way or the other, but it will also mean that you will have a lower standard of living for the farmers than at present.  So, in fact, you hurt two sections with that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> I am delighted to get this chance to speak this evening on this Dairy Produce Bill because like the Minister of State I represent an area which would be hardest hit if the confidence in farming and milk production was eroded.  Unlike Senator Hyland, I believe that there is a complete lack of confidence in farming. No amount of criticism by the so-called farm leaders and others will get it across to the farmer who lost money in 1979 that 1979 was a good year for farmers. He is paying 19 per cent on money borrowed for a development project based on milk.  He is unable to repay the bank manager or to fulfil his commitment to the ACC, because 1979 was a bad year for many reasons, apart from economic reasons.  No farmer big or small will believe it was not a bad year.  I want to put it on record that 1979 was a disastrous year.  I certainly speak with authority.  I am a farmer, and probably a smaller farmer than Senators who have spoken.  I understand the figures involved and I will come to them at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the dairy industry is at an extremely low ebb.  Farmers are the first people to recognise how well or how badly their industry is doing.  They are the very first people to respond to any type of progress or any opening which will give them a reasonable living for themselves and their families.  At this time of the year there are in-calf heifer sales all around the country.  This is the life-blood of the dairy industry.  Most farmers buy in their replacement stock at this time of the year.  At some of the sales in the past month or two you could hardly give away in-calf heifers.  Nobody can contradict that because I was at them.  People in that trade are selling those in-calf heifers for between £200 and £300 less per head than they got last year.  Ask any of those farmers what sort of a year they had in 1979.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute produced a figure a fortnight ago as a projection of the type of incomes farmers would have for the full year 1979.  The finding is that, on average, there will be a drop of 9 per cent in their real income.  I am not talking about their ordinary incomes.  I am <Col N="667" /> talking about the real income of the average farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I certainly agree with the previous speakers who talked about how important the entire milk question is to Ireland. Ireland is primarily a milk-and beef-producing nation.  There is a very good reason for that.  We have the climatic conditions which enable us to beat any competition from anywhere under certain conditions.  It is very important that at the Council of Ministers meetings we hang on to the advantages we have.  If there is any meddling with milk production and the future for milk production the Minister should go on bended knees to extract sympathy from his colleagues.  If that does not work, I suggest he should hammer the table&mdash;a very famous statesman did that once at the United Nations and it did not do him any harm&mdash;and use the veto.  The very life-blood of the Irish economy is at stake if they try to fiddle with the common agricultural policy in so far as it relates to us and, in particular, to our milk production.</P>
    <P>Every country joined the EEC for different reasons.  There were a few common aims but basically each country decided to join because they believed there was a better future for them in the EEC.  We joined primarily because we thought we would get away from the clutches of the cheap food policy of the British market which had damned us for years.  We joined because we could see a new horizon for every farmer in Ireland, big or small.  We joined because we believed that the extra income that ensued from our accession would mean we would keep many more families on the land or at least stabilise the population of the underdeveloped areas.  In the first four or five years it appeared that that would happen.</P>
    <P>While we can blame the EEC Ministers and the EEC Parliament for deciding to revamp the entire EEC budget in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy, it is only fair to say that because of Government action in <Col N="668" /> the past two or three years&mdash;certainly in the past year&mdash;any Minister for Agriculture arriving in Brussels to negotiate for and on behalf of Irish farmers would find that his hand was tied. There would not be much point in trying to convince the Ministers that we objected strenuously to the co-responsibility levy being increased at the same time as the former Minister for Finance slapped a levy of 2 per cent on most agricultural products.  I can understand how difficult it would be for our Minister to fight our case and say: &ldquo;We do not think the co-responsibility levy should apply to Ireland,&rdquo; but a few days previously he and his colleagues decided to place an indiscriminate levy of 2 per cent on most agricultural products, with certain variations. Immense publicity is being given to the revamping of the CAP.  When most farmers talk about the Common Agricultural Policy being changed, they think of it invariably as being changed against their better interests.  They have good reasons for thinking that way.</P>
    <P>We have a very proud record of being able to sell our milk products in markets far away from the EEC and in nearly every corner of the globe.  It is remarkable, particularly in the beef business when intervention was its saviour on a number of occasions, that we did not put dairy products into intervention.  If one can believe the rumour emanating from Brussels at the moment&mdash;and I stress that it may be only a rumour at the moment&mdash;it is proposed to ensure that for the 1980s milk supply there will be an over-production levy.  This levy on over-production would be an absolute disaster.  As Senator Butler said, there is no doubt that with rampant inflation, as we have it at the moment, wages depreciation and so forth, the processing industry in this country will have to ensure that 15 to 20 per cent of the total cost will have to be obtained somewhere to keep the industry viable and the only place to get this is on each gallon of milk as it is sent into the creamery.  From that point of view, every management committee of every creamery in Ireland expect that the 1980 milk intake will be up <Col N="669" /> by between 5 and 10 per cent.  If this ruling from the EEC comes into effect, any person who produces more in 1980 than he produced in 1979 will be penalised severely on every gallon of milk and I understand that it is possible that that levy could apply to even the smallest farmer in Ireland.  If that comes true, we will be doing the Margaret Thatcher on the EEC Summit.</P>
    <P>We will not endure this on any account and we will upset the meetings if we have to because this means so much to us.  An extra special fight would have to be put up to ensure that the small farmers will have an open licence to produce as much milk as is possible on whatever number of acres they have.</P>
    <P>If somebody comes out to the farmers, particularly the small farmers, and says, &ldquo;Look, we are stopping your milk production at this level and you cannot increase it&rdquo;, considering, as Senator Butler said, the vast potential that is in the dairying industry for more high yielding cows, more cows to the acre and so on, in a very short time a great number of people will certainly find themselves having to get out of farming employment. I can see terrible social problems arising from that.</P>
    <P>As most of the Senators have already said, should any type of shrinking occur in the dairy industry, it is not only the farmers who will suffer.  It is a well-known social problem and a worry for all persons engaged in agri-business of one type or another and all the industries that are related to agriculture in any shape or form, because a lot of jobs will be in danger.  It is amazing that when the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley is flying around the world doing his best to attract foreign industries to this country, we are presiding over a situation whereby we might let slip between our fingers the very traditional type of industries based on home-grown products. No Minister for Agriculture, Minister of State or Taoiseach will want to allow that to happen to our people.</P>
    <P>Significant too is the conflict in this country between the rural and urban <Col N="670" /> communities.  I would be first to admit that there are certain minority groupings of farmers in this country who are well able to pay farm tax, provided that it is structured in the proper way.  We will not go into that today.  I would also like to bring to the notice of everybody concerned that the recent farm management survey showed that of the full-time farmers in this country with under 50 acres, almost 40 per cent earned £2,000 a year or less.  That is £40 a week for a whole section of farmers and it can be assumed on those figures that the majority of that 40 per cent certainly would be from the disadvantaged west or the north-west. The only hope for that type of farmer is in dairying and that is acknowledged freely by the institute, the advisory service, the committees of agriculture, the Minister and everybody involved.  If they find that there is no room for any extra production, what will happen to them? This year the Government were less than good to the agricultural community with the 2 per cent levy, the 30-day test, the speculation over the farm tax, not to mention the resource tax which is supposed to be £3.50 per £1 valuation.  That kind of thing takes the confidence out of farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the great anxiety in the minds and the hearts of many western farmers at the moment in regard to their future.  How could any farmer be very confident at the moment with the low price of store cattle, the sheep trade not going so well and the whole business of our milk production under severe attack?  I appeal to the Minister of State here, and to the new Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister has a huge job on his hands.  I wish Deputy Mac Sharry very well in his new post because after the Taoiseach's his is one of the most important Ministries there is.  I would be less than fair to the farmers of Ireland if I did not say here that the former Minister for Agriculture did not stand in the best interests of Irish farmers or, if he did, his success rate was not what I would have expected of him.  I hope that the new Minister will make a vigorous fight over this milk problem.  He represents a <Col N="671" /> western constituency, he knows the problems of the small western farmer and when he will sit down at the table with his colleagues, the EEC Ministers, I hope he will go out for what he believes is right.  I understand that in the very near future there will be a very important meeting of the Ministers for Agriculture in the EEC on this subject. We wish the Minister well, but whatever else happens, he must come back with the result we want.  Nothing less is any good.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered as well that in this country our milk production is our oil.  It is as simple as that.  As far as the Irish nation is concerned, nothing is more important to us than our milk.  If one were to ask whether the Ayatollah would allow the Iranian oil to be plundered, I know well what his answer would be.  Will the Minister allow our so-called influential colleagues, our EEC partners, to wreck our economy?  After all, the reason we joined was to ensure that our economy be kept on an even keel.  There has been great talk about our windfall, or the gravy train, the great monetary reward our farmers received for joining Europe.  If one took the late sixties or early seventies as being the baseline, certainly then it could be contended that Irish farmers did quite well from the EEC.  But it must be remembered that that baseline was a low one and that over the years any financial progress made by farmers had to be ploughed back into the development of their holdings.  That is why this talk about our milk production is causing so much concern.  Many millions of pounds have been invested, millions of pounds borrowed; great expertise built up; people have been undergoing 100-hour EEC courses to arm themselves for good milk production only to find that the powers that be are now deciding they should not be in milk production.  This is something which our farming population will not stand for.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne have been one of the most spectacular agencies we have had in this country.  They have been spectacularly <Col N="672" /> successful in selling our products on foreign markets.  Indeed it is fair to say that they are about the only Irish salesmen who were able to convince the Eskimoes to buy ice lollies, and that is going fairly well.  I believe that whatever type of money is involved, or whatever type of expertise is required, it is important that Bord Bainne be given every facility to continue their good work because, if there is any type of cutback in our milk production every single member of the entire population will know about it to his or her cost within a year or two of its happening.</P>
    <P>It is very important also that these facts be brought home to the other sections of the community people who are not involved in agriculture, people who know absolutely nothing about it.  After all it is their country and future that are at stake as well and if anything happens the agricultural sector, in particular the dairying business, certainly everybody will be the worse off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what needs to be said on this subject has already been said.  I do not think I can add anything to the eloquent words of praise given to An Bord Bainne and the dairy industry generally.  Perhaps, however, there are a few ideas we could contemplate.  The first thing to be said about the dairy industry is that there are two sides to it: one is the whole question of our ability to produce the product and sell it.  The other is the effect on our industry here by any and every decision taken in relation to the common agricultural policy at European level.  The one taken at European level is one in which we can have an input, in which we have a voice perhaps even stronger than would be expected from a country of our size and its people, so proportionately small in European terms.  There is then the whole question of the world market for dairy produce.  Over and above that we have in our hands the means of production, the shaping and guidance of the industry in the direction we want it to take.  The first thing I would say about that is that we should not embark on organising a dairy industry until we have a clear indication <Col N="673" /> of what are the world markets, until we come to terms in our own minds about what we think is the future in Europe; not what we would like to see, not what we think can be or what should be, but what it is likely to be.  We must be realistic in our approach to that.  The other objective is that of looking at our resources and asking ourselves what we can achieve.  I do not often quote myself but many years ago I said to a group of young people, &ldquo;I will not let Mansholt tell me where I can or cannot make a living&rdquo;, and I did not.  I say that to Irish farmers today: they do not have to listen to Mr. Gundelach or anybody else telling them where they can, or cannot make a living.  Where they can make a living is more a question for the farmers themselves than for European policies or anything else.  If we decide that we are going to compete, if we make up our minds that because this industry is so vitally important not only to the 80,000 people, approximately, involved in it today, but to the people dependent on the industry and to the social and economic welfare of our people then it is important that we consider it in that context.  We should not have any false opinions about the ability of our industry, our natural resource, our climate and so on.  The truth is that whatever advantages we have from a climatic point of view we have disadvantages from a structural point of view.  Certainly a lot of our partners in Europe have gone so far ahead of us that we will experience difficulty in catching up with them.  If we are to catch up, we should fully realise and appreciate the problems involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people interested can get the figures and check out what I am maintaining. They will find that our performance is hopeless in relation to the Dutch.  Even if one excludes meal from the calculation, which we normally do because we maintain that the amount of cheap concentrates is grossly exaggerated, and reflect on the quality of herd management, grass, livestock and the way they preserve their winter feed, it will be found that they could still beat us on their use of grass and the way in which they manage their herds. <Col N="674" /> Therefore we must consider carefully the industry and the resources at out disposal.</P>
    <P>I know we have never prepared a plan for the development of our dairy industry at national level.  We have expressed hopes and set targets but we have never laid down a blueprint or a plan, or taken the necessary steps to execute that plan in the long-term.  I have always said we should set our targets at national level.  We have done that but, having done that, we have to look at the structure and see what needs to be done to put it right.  We must look at the expertise involved, reflect on the two per cent of farmers who have received any sort of training in the industry and ask ourselves what we can do to provide training for more of them.  We must consider the number of people involved in the advisory services and ask ourselves how many are required, how many dairy specialists per county, or per electoral area, breaking it down, giving them targets as well.  We must approach the farmers and ask them to participate in a plan.  That is not being done and has not been done.  I do not think that even the co-operatives have done that.  Some of them are starting now to work out projections on the basis of surveys and so on.  But the vast majority of the co-operatives went ahead with their buildings and developments&mdash;or did not&mdash;without carrying out the sort of surveys that were necessary, without consultation with the agricultural advisory services or the committees of agriculture. Therefore, I say no plan has been made and even at this late stage we should proceed to do so.  For example, take a look at the plan prepared by Mayo County Committee of Agriculture.  It is worth looking at.  They have set targets, appearing almost to be out of reach taking into consideration the national targets set.  They have set targets of 20 per cent per annum and they have made their advisory services in the different areas aware of this.  That is the way to approach it and the county committee of agriculture in Mayo are to be congratulated on their ambitious targets, the way in which&mdash;even in the face of all the <Col N="675" /> pessimistic talk&mdash;they have resolved that that area cannot be developed without a healthy dairy industry and have set in motion the plans and the movement to provide themselves with the necessary increases in milk production.  That is one side of it, a side we should not ignore.</P>
    <P>We should remember also that only two years ago a survey carried out by the Agricultural Institute showed that the low-yielding cows were to be found on the small farms.  Furthermore they found that 75 per cent of the people in the industry had no thoughts whatever about the level of yield they were achieving, no idea about how those yields could be improved by the improvement of fodder and no idea of whether they were doing a good job or a bad job. They had no conception of the effects of meal feeding on their overall results and neither had they any breeding plans.  But we did not take any notice of that.  We did not say &ldquo;Let us train graduates.  Let us train technicians&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In China, after the revolution, when they found themselves without doctors they took in people, trained them for two weeks and then sent them out to treat the sick.  We could even have approached our dairy industry at that level but we have not.  We have not even considered it or thought about it with the result that 75 per cent of the people engaged in the industry are not in a position to compete.  Those people have not got a price increase for the past two years.  I am not going to blame either the Government or the Community for that situation but the truth is that these producers have not got a price increase in two years.  We say that we must preserve the small family farm, that we must preserve dairying in the areas that need it.  But the truth is that the people who can survive are in those areas in which it is possible to diversify by, for instance, going into beet or wheat or barley.  The most vulnerable people are those in the areas where we cannot do without the dairy industry and where a living cannot be got on an average sized farm from any other agricultural activity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> For that reason we must consider the dairy industry not only in terms of the number of gallons of milk produced and the increase we get on that but in terms of the number of farmers we can actually retain in the industry, and that is important in the present situation of unemployment and considering that there is no other place for them to go.  The British, because their steel industry has failed to compete, are to let go 50,000 people within the next two years, and they appear determined to do that.  So we need not think that our people are going to find ready employment in Britain, as happened in the past.  We need the dairy industry and we must preserve every job that is in it; but this can be done only by increased production, by learning to compete.  All of us here have an obligation to make this fact known to the people in the industry.  We must not tell them blindly that we will continue to demand a living for them from the people of Europe and that they will be kept in their jobs regardless of whether milk is going to cost £1 gallon or £1.50 a gallon. That sort of reasoning will not get us any place; it will only lead us further up the blind alley, the <i>cul de sac</i> that we are travelling at the present time.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points on the whole question at European level.  The first point is that the average consumer in Europe does not realise the benefits that the common agricultural policy has brought them.  The average consumer in Europe does not realise that the common agricultural policy had more than the aim of retaining the maximum number of people in agriculture but that it had also the aim of making available adequate supplies of food at reasonable prices. Though it has succeeded in doing that, nobody has taken any notice of it in that sense.  They have had regard only to the benefits which are going to sections of the agricultural community.  They fail to realise that the actual prices of farm produce in real terms has dropped in the last ten years and that food prices have not risen as rapidly as has the price of clothing, energy or transport or almost any other commodity or service that one cares to look at.  Even butter competes <Col N="677" /> favourably with any of those I have mentioned in so far as increase in prices in the last ten years are concerned. Therefore, we have done a poor job in educating the consumers and the taxpayers of the European Economic Community on what they have got out of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>One need only have regard to those areas where the common agricultural policy does not apply to realise how beneficial that policy has been.  For instance, for some years past the situation in respect of potatoes has been one of scarcity and of exhorbitant prices.  People in that end of the food business will realise that the exclusion of potatoes from a common agricultural policy has not given any benefit either to the producers or to the consumer.  Similarly, you could say the same has been true of lamb and sheep generally in respect of which there is alternation between depressions and high points.  You find this situation in markets that are not regulated.</P>
    <P>The importance of the common agricultural policy has been undersold to the taxpayer in Europe.  The other problem is that the whole business needs more realistic looking at from a European level.  If the Irish attitude is to be that we must preserve the common agricultural policy, that we will not allow any readjustment, then I think we are adopting a very foolish approach and in the end I think it can backfire on the whole agricultural economy and on farmers. We cannot lead farmers to believe that it is just as simple as demanding this, that and the other from the Community. The first problem is that as long as the budget of the Community stays the size it is, as long as agriculture uses 8 per cent of that budget, and as long as dairy produce absorbs such a high proportion of it, we are going to create the impression in Europe that farmers are the only people who are getting any benefit from the European Economic Community.  We will have to get out of that log jam some way or other, and the way I would like to see us getting out of it is by means of a bigger Community <Col N="678" /> budget.  That is the point that should be pushed and stressed by our Ministers because there are other areas of need and I do not thing that we can continue to pit the regional policy, the social policy and third-world aid and all these other things against the common agricultural policy and expect it to survive, because it will not.  That is quite obvious and is an area which we should look at.</P>
    <P>The other point is that the same common agricultural policy will not serve the ten-cow farmer in County Cavan, County Leitrim or County Mayo as it can serve the 40-cow farmer perhaps in the midlands or the 100-cow farmer in the south.  We have to take that into consideration and adjustments in the policy will have to be made in favour of the smaller producer, particularly from the point of view of retaining employment when alternative employment is not available.  That is a case that must be put and must be put by our representatives who have the real power naturally in the Council of Ministers to negotiate alternatives to the present policy.  We must not go as the blind advocates of the common agricultural policy.  We must be prepared to readjust ourselves to new thinking and to working out solutions in the light of the fact that the dairying industry is so important to Ireland, a point which I think will be considered at European level.  In Holland I have seen family farms on which there were 200 cows and with yields of over 1,000 gallons per cow.  If the question is one of price alone, it is obvious that producers in the West of Ireland will be put out of business long before their counterparts in Holland if the freezing of milk prices policy continues. I think we have to readjust our thinking and consider what can be done&mdash;if special cases can be made for Ireland&mdash;while at the same time allowing the whole question to be looked into in a realistic manner.</P>
    <P>On the question of food for Third World countries and so on, of course it is a shame to say that food should be put into storage or that food should be dumped or sold to countries who are <Col N="679" /> spending their money on re-armament and so on while people are starving in the world.  That sort of naive argument is very easy to make and any of us who want to make that sort of argument must be prepared to pay the price of following it through to its logical conclusion.  If farmers are saying that they are entitled to produce food as long as there are hungry people in the world, then farmers must be prepared to make their own contribution in money just like everybody else to a solution to that hunger problem. Similarly, as a country we should bear up to our responsibilities in this regard. The European Economic Community actually proposed to cut the amount of money available for the assistance of developing countries and they have done that.  In view of the fact that there is a limit to the amount of money available to the Community under the present legislation, we would need to be realistic in our approach to all these things. Merely proposing solutions because they sound pleasing to the ear of people in the industry will not solve the problem.  We have a lot of thinking to do about all this but I believe that, since the dairy industry is so vital to the welfare of our economy, to the whole question of employment and our position within the Community, we can point to the fact that we lost 5,000, 6,000, or 7,000 jobs as a result of our membership.  There are many good cases to be made on behalf of Irish farmers and in favour of giving special concessions to Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>We should remember that, while Irish agriculture has not got an increase for two years&mdash;apart from a 1½ per cent increase in prices last spring&mdash;British farmers, in spite of the fact that they talk about the common agricultural policy, got three 5 per cent price increases this year arising from the Green pound devaluation.  This puts them in a much more competitive position compared with us than it did last year.  This is designed specifically to encourage greater production in Britain and to add to the butter surplus which is in the Community at a stage when British <Col N="680" /> policy is that production should be reduced.</P>
    <P>We must balance these things against each other.  In my view there is a good case to be made for Ireland, a case which will not fall on deaf ears.  I am confident that, if Irish farmers produce the milk and milk products, Bord Bainne are organised to sell them.  That organisation has grown and developed with the market and I am confident we will not find ourselves in any log-jam as far as marketing is concerned.  On the other hand, I would like to warn Irish producers that they must consider their competitiveness at all times.  As long as we have an industry in which 75 per cent of the people involved are not conscious of the importance of competition and the factors governing profitability and progress, then we have reason to be nervous about the future of that industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  If this Bill is welcomed by this House it demonstrates that we believe increased production of milk is necessary for the economy of this country.  We heard recently comments made by certain farmers that they would reduce milk production and possibly go into cattle or tillage because by doing so, and for the same net gain to them, they probably have less work to do.  That is a very short-sighted policy.  To increase milk production is a necessity for our economy.  For the good of the farmer it is necessary that the country is prosperous in the long term.  We all know there is big scope for increase in production here.  Some people have said that we can double it quite easily if we get down to it properly.  The only way we can get productivity is by increased production.  The only way we can get competitiveness is by increased productivity. This is what we must get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must visualise that the day can come when we will be dependent on our milk producing industry.  They must be competitive and they must be able to sell at a price which may not suit our competitors. That is the position we must get into.  We must use our benefits of climate <Col N="681" /> so that if the day comes when somebody has to get out of milk production it will not be the Irish producer.  I am glad some of the co-operatives are making moves to encourage suppliers to keep up their production because they realise the number of other jobs that come from milk products.  Bord Bainne have done a very good job up to now and will continue to do a good job.  We must at all times think of the other products that can be made from milk&mdash;in west Cork they are making alcohol from milk. Other things can be made from it.  This is what the farmers should think&mdash;keep up the production.  The only way a farmer can get security in farming is by carrying out that procedure.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which shows we believe this can be done and that this is the right road.  If everybody looks to the long-term rather than to the short-term all milk producers will agree that this is what should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice this Bill is being taken by the Minister of State.  I avail of this opportunity of saying I am happy he has been re-appointed to his position and I wish him well.  Deputy Hussey is a man who will genuinely, within the constraints of his position, represent the interests of agricultural producers, and certainly the smaller producers in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of saying a few words about this Bill.  I am conscious of the bad press that seems to be associated with milk and butter mountains and so on.  People outside the industry misunderstand what is involved in the success or the non-success of the dairying industry.  The purpose of the Bill is to extend the State guarantee to Bord Bainne Co-operative to the extent of £90 million, covering a period of three years-up to the end of 1983.  The Minister, in his speech last week, stated that the dairying industry is of central importance to the whole agricultural industry in Ireland and that its continued expansion is vital to the overall economic and social development of the country.  I totally agree with that.  The <Col N="682" /> dairying industry in the past decade has shown an amazing capacity to expand and to develop its production.  It has shown a capacity that is unrivalled and certainly not exceeded by any other section of our business community.  The guarantee to An Bord Bainne is to enable them to finance an increased volume of dairy products.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the present Bord Bainne Co-operative was first established in 1972.  They took over from An Bord Bainne, a State-sponsored body that came into existence in 1971.  The success of Bord Bainne&mdash;I would date its time of existence from 1961&mdash;has been outstanding.  It is only reasonable that we should pay a tribute to the people who led that pioneering effort by Bord Bainne in the early sixties&mdash;men like Tony O'Reilly, Joe McGough, his successor, and to the present chief executive, Mr. Brian Joyce.  Those men, and the teams who worked with them, had a high degree of marketing expertise and a very firm commitment to the successful functioning of the board.  Perhaps the measure of their success can best be judged by the fact that, when Bord Bainne were established in 1961, our total production of manufacturing milk was about 210 million gallons.  By the end of 1979 it is expected that the quantity of manufacturing milk will be something in the region of 900,000,000 gallons.  The value of dairy exports in 1961 was about £12 million and for 1979 will be almost £500 million.  That is successful marketing and, having had successful marketing, that gave confidence to the producers and they responded by expanding production on their farms.</P>
    <P>There were three major factors responsible for that success story.  There was the decision by Bord Bainne in the early days to convert milk into products other than butter.  Products such as cheese and chocolate crumb, milk powder, casein, evaporated milk, frozen cream and fresh cream were products into which milk was diversified.  Having achieved that diversification, the board then succeeded in establishing markets <Col N="683" /> throughout many parts of the world. When we look at the marketing picture it reminds me of the attitude of people in our neighbouring island in the early years of this century when they used to say with a certain measure of pride that the sun never set on the British Empire. Today we can say with a measure of pride that it is doubtful if the sun ever sets on the markets in which the produce of Irish dairy farms is consumed.  Not alone are Irish dairy products marketed and sold throughout Europe and the United Kingdom but from Canada down to Mexico, to Brazil and Peru, the Carribean, the Mediterranean, from the Middle East to Japan and the Phillipines, in 54 different countries throughout the world Irish dairy products are consumed. That is perhaps an aspect of the success of the Irish dairying industry that is not fully recognised.  The third and equally important factor in the success story of Irish dairy marketing was the establishment of the brand name Kerrygold as a symbol of quality.</P>
    <P>These are the factors that led to the success.  The response of the producers was amazingly good.  We have reached a situation today where, on the results of the increased production that we have had over the past 17 years or so, we can be satisfied that if the encouragement and the conditions are there the capacity of the industry for further expansion is still quite large.  We can provide badly needed exports for this country.  Irish dairy produce is a low cost export article because the raw material we require for it is in large part the grass.  The cost to the economy of producing milk is relatively low and the advantage to the economy from the export of our dairy products quite considerable.</P>
    <P>By continuing and ensuring an expansion of the dairying industry we can maintain additional people on jobs on our farms.  We can ensure that a native industry using native raw materials can continue to provide additional jobs in processing.  I understand that the number of people directly employed in creamery milk production at present is something <Col N="684" /> like 90,000 and there are several other thousands indirectly employed in servicing that industry.</P>
    <P>If there is one aspect of the story of the Irish dairying industry from 1961 to 1979 that I would express concern about it is that when we produced more than 200 million gallons of milk in 1961, something like 110,000 milk producers were involved in producing that quantity. Even though we had increased substantially that quantity of milk by 1979, the number of dairy farmers engaged in it had been reduced to 72,000.  That is a reduction that we should be deeply concerned about.  We have reached a downward trend among people engaged in milk production below which we cannot afford to let figures drop much further.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment very briefly on a report from the ESRI published in <i>The Irish Farmers Journal</i> on 30 November 1979 and commissioned by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society.  This survey covered quite a number of creamery areas in this country. In that survey there was a clear indication that there was a lack of confidence among a number of milk producers and particularly so among the larger herd owners.  The causes were identified as uncertainly with regard to taxation policies and considerable uncertainty about proposals emanating from the European Commission with regard to the curtailment of milk production. Fear was expressed in that report that people engaged in milk production were contemplating taking two steps.  Some were contemplating leaving milk production, and alarmingly they were among the people with the bigger herd.  There was also an indication that others were contemplating reducing herd size.</P>
    <P>In common with other Senators I would deplore the realisation of these fears.  I would Find it disastrous that there should be a lack of confidence within the dairying industry.  It is too vital to the success of the economy, and there is an obligation on all who are in a position of responsibility and authority to ensure that the confidence of the Irish dairying <Col N="685" /> industry is fully restored.  In view of the weeks that lie ahead, this uncertainly with regard to taxation and levies should be disposed of in a manner that will give confidence to Irish milk producers.</P>
    <P>The other factor that caused concern among our milk producers was the European Commission's proposal to reduce milk production within the EEC area. The method the Commission propose to achieve their objective is that, where to any creamery or manufacturing plant the supply should exceed 99 per cent of the 1978 supply, a duty or a tax of 3 per cent would be imposed.</P>
    <P>That proposal is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Rome.  What many of us voted for was the commitment that treaty conveyed that one of its objectives would be to ensure successful development of the agricultural industry within the European Community.  During the seven years of our membership, Irish agriculture and Irish dairying have benefited.  I would like to see the confidence which our producers have had over the years being restored to them.  I therefore say that there is a very firm obligation on the Minister for Agriculture and indeed on the Government to ensure that whatever is the eventual outcome of the discussions on the Commission's proposals for the reduction of milk production that outcome will not depress milk production on Irish farms.</P>
    <P>Considerable publicity has been given to a so-called butter mountain&mdash;some people have described it as a milk lake&mdash;but let us briefly try to assess how large this so-called mountain is, how urgent is the need to dispose of it, and perhaps more important still from the point of view of this country, who has contributed most to creating it.  My understanding is that the present supply of butter in intervention stocks in Europe represents no more than 60 days supply for the Community.  We have been told and directed that in relation to oil it is necessary to maintain 90 days stocks and why is there such alarm when the total stocks of butter in intervention in <Col N="686" /> Europe represent only 60 days supply to the Community?</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from a table published in a magazine called Food News of 30 November 1979, by the Food News Company of Blackheath Village, London. There is a table showing that the total stocks of butter in cold storage, or in EEC butter stocks, at the end of October, amounted to 297,000 tons; 177,000 tons, or 62 per cent, of that total is West German butter.  That quantity of Irish butter in the stocks there is 2,946 tons, or something less than 3 per cent of the total stocks.  The second largest quantity of butter is from the United Kingdom, more than 51,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have not contributed to any degree to the building up of these stocks.  In fact, the total creamery milk production in this country could be described as only a drop in the ocean where European production is concerned. The nations who have put the largest quantities of butter into these stocks are West Germany and Britain.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should look at the situation with regard to the butter that has originated in the United Kingdom.  We should bear in mind that at the time Britain was putting 51,000 tons of butter into European stocks, it was importing 120,000 tons from New Zealand.  The New Zealand butter that does not go directly into European stocks displaces a quantity of British butter that would be consumed in the British market otherwise and which is put into the building of the European butter mountain. We have not contributed to the building of that mountain, and I do not think, in view of the special conditions that obtain with regard to farm size and so forth in this country, that we should be asked to pay the penalty for dismantling that so-called butter mountain.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting that there is in the same magazine from which I am quoting a table showing the stocks of skim milk powder.  There is a total of 291,000 tons there, and of that 277,000 tons have been put there by West Germany. Our quantity of skim milk powder in the European milk powder stocks is less <Col N="687" /> than 3 per cent.  I would, therefore, suggest that we should not lose any opportunity to emphasise that through An Bord Bainne we have successfully marketed through many markets throughout the world the vast proportion of our milk production, and we have only leaned to a very small degree on the European intervention fund for a tiny proportion of our total production.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and support it.  I believe that anything that will restore confidence to the dairying industry is necessary and desirable.  I would hope that by our contribution here this evening our dairy farmers will get the message quite clearly that with proper direction and proper commitment from the Government the outcome of the common agricultural policy talks will be such as not to interfere with increased production on Irish dairy farms.  If we can get that message across we can continue the success story of the Irish dairying industry, we can again move into a situation where we can have increased production on our dairy farms, where through An Bord Bainne we can continue successfully to market practically all our production on markets throughout the world that give a good return, and that if we continue to produce an article of quality we will not have to depend on intervention to any greater degree than we do today.</P>
    <P>If we can continue the expansion that I am satisfied our dairy industry is capable of, we will maintain those who are already in employment in our industry. If we can succeed in increasing production we can increase the number of people the industry can employ and we can ensure that quite a number of people from rural Ireland will not be put in a position of having to chase expensive jobs in an already overcrowded labour market in this country.  My final word is that the Irish dairy industry is besically sound, through there may well be a slight loss of confidence there at the moment.  If that confidence can be restored, I believe the future can be as successful as the past seven years have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank Senator Howard for extending his good wishes on my reappointment to the Department of Agriculture, and I would like to thank all the Senators who have contributed to the debate this evening.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this very short Bill enables Senators to embark on a debate which goes into almost every facet of the dairying industry, and indeed other areas as well, such as the 2 per cent levy, the 30-day test and so on.  It is heartening to know that Senators are concerned about the success and the progress of our dairying industry.  We all accept that the dairying industry is of central importance to the whole agricultural industry in Ireland, and its continued expansion is vital for the overall, economic and social development of the country.</P>
      <P>For the industry to prosper we must have maximum efficiency in processing and marketing.  We must develop and exploit markets in a planned and economical way and earn a respected position for Irish dairy products.  The dairying industry, as everybody knows, has made extraordinary progress in recent years.  Milk output has increased by over 40 per cent and the value of milk produced for manufacturing purposes by over 50 per cent.  The value of the milk intake for manufacturing concerns has increased by about 400 per cent in that same period.  The value of Irish dairy exports in 1972 was £50 million and, in 1978, revenue from these exports exceeded £450 million.  This indicates the role which Bord Bainne have played in centralised marketing.  Everybody agrees that they have done a magnificent job over those years and, were it not for the efforts of Bord Bainne, the quoted figure of £450 million might not have been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dairying industry is today facing more difficult times.  Price restraint is the order of the day and we also face proposals from Brussels aimed at restricting increases in milk production. The Government are fully aware of the <Col N="689" /> serious implications of these proposals and, at this stage, I must again emphasise that they are only proposals.  I am sure that, by the time they are argued on, they will be far more acceptable.  We will be seeking to ensure that, whatever adjustments are made in the Community milk policy, the interests of the Irish dairying industry are protected. Everybody would want us to ensure that, whatever decisions are arrived at, our dairy farmers, both big and small, are protected.  The Members here can rely on the Minister for Agriculture and on myself to fight the case as best we can at the level of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>For the future, efficiency in production, processing and marketing will be of greater importance than in the past. Bord Bainne's role in centrally marketing the bulk of our dairy products will continue to be crucial.  If our markets are to be expanded, or if new markets are to be found abroad, it is Bord Bainne who will have the responsibility of exploring and finding those markets.  A lot has been said about the erosion of confidence in agriculture at present, particularly during 1979.  This was mentioned several times by Senator Connaughton in the course of his speech this afternoon.  I accept that things may not have been as well in 1979 as we would have liked, but I do not accept that there is that total erosion of confidence that we hear so much about.  We know that farmers, during the fall of this year, had to accept less for their cattle than they paid for them last spring.  In many cases, the responsibility and the blame for that could lie with the farmers themselves.  We know that they went out last spring and paid enormous prices for their cattle and, unfortunately, now they have to accept a lower price.  We, and everybody here, hate to see that happening. This is a situation for which the Government have no responsibility and about which they could do nothing.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the importance of protecting the common agricultural policy.  I would agree in full with that.  It is vital for this country that we should, at all times, defend the common <Col N="690" /> agricultural policy.  I was disturbed last week to see, in Brussels, the Parliament voting against the budget for 1980. This, to my mind, is a dangerous thing.  I hope that our Irish representatives ensure that, at Parliament level, they make every effort to defend the common agricultural policy, because we know that that policy is the one thing that encouraged Irish people to vote in such great numbers for our accession to the EEC.  I would hate to see any chinks in the armour there.  That is all I have to say on this Bill.  I think I have answered the points that were made.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the maximum amount of borrowing by the Industrial Credit Company which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and to increase also the maximum amount which the company itself may borrow. The Industrial Credit Company, which was set up in the early thirties, provides industrial credit, mainly of a long-term nature.  There is a limit in legislation on the extent to which the Minister for Finance may guarantee the company's borrowings.  This limit stands at £75 million at present.  Following discussions with the company recently, I have authorised the ICC to negotiate foreign borrowings in EMS currencies to enable the company to meet the high level of demand from industry for investment funds.  A total package of £50 million is envisaged up to the end of 1980, and it is <Col N="691" /> the intention that this money will be onlent by the company to Irish industrialists at keenest going rates for Irish currency.  The exchange risk will be borne by the Exchequer in return for regular payments to it by the company&mdash;there will be no exchange risk for the ultimate borrower.  The official external reserves will, of course, benefit from the inflow of foreign funds.</P>
      <P>The details of this scheme will have to be worked out, but it will be necessary for me to guarantee the repayment of the principal sums being borrowed under this package.  Since we are quite close to the limit prescribed in legislation, we now need to revise this limit.  As I mentioned above, this guarantee limit at present stands at £75 million and, as that limit would in any event be reached shortly in the normal course of events, it is now necessary to increase that limit to accommodate not alone the moneys involved in the package referred to, but to take account also of the vastly accelerated rate of business being transacted by the company.  I propose, therefore, to raise the limit set down in existing legislation from its present level of £75 million to £400 million and, as will be seen when I refer to the general borrowing of the company, this limit is in line with what I propose to fix as the limit on borrowing by the company for a further period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the company was first set up in 1933 there has always been a statutory limit placed on the extent to which it may borrow for the carrying on of its operations.  This limit has been increased from time to time as occasion required by amending legislation.  The existing limit on borrowing is £200 million prescribed by the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1977 Outstanding borrowings now total £127 million and are rising rapidly as the company's business is expanding at a rate which was not envisaged the last time the limit was increased.  On the basis of firm arrangements already entered into by the company, it is probable that the statutory limit will be reached by mid-1980. <Col N="692" /> Accordingly it is necessary to raise the present limit to enable the company to continue engaging in its very useful work.</P>
    <P>The new limit proposed, that is, £400 million, may be considered to be rather large.  ICC business is, however, growing steadily and is at present at a level of over £70 million per annum.  It is likely that this growth will continue.  On the basis of projections of lending requirements an increase of the limit on borrowings to £400 million should be sufficient to allow the company to borrow its requirements for a further four to five years before Oireachtas approval has to be sought again.  I do not think Senators will regard this period as too long.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that the Bill has the effect of making the limits for both overall borrowing by the company and ministerial guarantees the same at £400 million.  Certain aspects of the company's borrowing requirements to do not entail the furnishing of a guarantee, that is, borrowings from the exchequer, but the experience nowadays is that the financing of the company's operations is more and more being subject to guarantee. Deposits with the company, reflecting public confidence in the ICC, have increased substantially.  These deposits enjoy the guarantee of the Minister for Finance as to repayment.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary to provide a guarantee for the borrowing in EMS currencies to which I have referred earlier and for the company's borrowing from such institutions as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Coal and Steel Community. Guarantees are also being sought by other institutional lenders&mdash;this seems to be common practice nowadays&mdash;and as the Exchequer element in ICC's financing represents a diminishing proportion, it is considered appropriate to have the two levels the same.  Thus, the relationship which existed prior to the 1977 Act between the overall borrowing limit and the power to guarantee is being restored.  However, despite the fact that it is intended that the guarantee limit will be the same as the <Col N="693" /> overall borrowing limit, it will remain my policy to give a guarantee only where absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>In the year to December 1979 the company expects to have provided financial facilities totalling £74 million approximately for industry.  In the previous 12 months the company disbursed £42 million.  Most of the capital needed by the ICC is secured from non-Exchequer sources, and it is hoped that this position will continue.  Capital required for the operations of the Shipping Finance Corporation is provided by the Exchequer as it is re-lent at a subsidised rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten to 12 years, the ICC has expanded the range of its activities to a considerable extent.  The company's main activity, of course, is the provision of longer-term loans but it also offers a wide and sophisticated range of other facilities to meet the complex demands of industry.  These include share investment in industry, capital underwriting and issuing house services, hire purchase facilities for plant and machinery, equipment leasing and finance for distribution. In addition to the provision of capital, it has also a subsidiary company, Mergers Limited, which specialises in the field of mergers and takeovers by undertaking share evaluations and by advising in negotiations for mergers between firms. It is also concerned with shipbuilding finance through its other subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation.</P>
    <P>In view of the need for higher industrial investment to promote economic growth and generate much needed jobs, there will be a continuing and increasing demand for the facilities provided by the company.  I am most anxious, therefore, that the company should be in a position to contribute to industry the financial and organisational expertise which it has built up over the years in addition to financial assistance.  The present legislation, when enacted, will enable the company to maintain an appropriate flow of funds to industry.</P>
    <P>For almost 50 years now the ICC has been to the fore in the financing of Irish <Col N="694" /> industry.  Many of the successful industries established over that period started from modest beginnings with the assistance of finance provided or arranged by the company.  Facilities are provided for the establishment of new industries as well as the expansion of existing firms and the company has a tradition of giving special attention to proposals in regard to small projects. The continuing increase in the demand for the company's facilities is proof that its importance has in no way diminished with the emergence of present-day financial institutions in the private sector.  The present legislation will enable the company to continue its import role in the development of the economy, and I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>This is not contentious and from this side of the House the Minister will have full approval on the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1979.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy McEllistrim to the Seanad for the first time since his recent appointment as Minister of State, and we wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very straightforward.  It is merely a Bill to enable the ICC to borrow money which, in turn, they can lend to Irish industry.  The necessity for this Bill is proof of the very useful work which the ICC have been doing in the interests of this country.  I take the opportunity of complimenting them on an excellent job which has been done by them and which has gone quite unsung, because in the development of industry there is, of course, immensely important promotional work to be done by the Industrial Development Authority.  There has to be back-up by the local authorities.  The financial analysis of these projects, their feasibility or otherwise and the financial funding, especially in this age of escalating costs, are very important factors, particularly in the area of industrial development much of which is speculative.  I regret having to use that word, but it is in a hazardous risk area.  In comparison with much of the agricultural sector or the <Col N="695" /> services sector, there is undoubtedly a high risk factor in industry.  The ICC have been a very important arm of national development activity where for obvious reasons they had to do with national development.  They have had to work within different parameters from the commercial banking institutions in this country who have responsibility to shareholders and for profit.  They have a different objective&mdash;not that the commercial banks' objective is any less worthy but that is not their function.  It has been very much in the national interest that the ICC have existed and that they have done this extremely useful work.  I am glad to be in a position to pay a compliment to them for this work which they have been doing very quietly and without the kind of headlines that the IDA or other national agencies have been getting.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary because of the levels of funding at present.  We know, for example, that the borrowings in 1978 from the ICC amounted to £42 million. This escalated through this year with an estimate of about £74 million being lent to industry.  It is striking that the last Act under which the ICC had a limit of funds from the Exchequer was as recently as 1977 and that we are coming back such a short time after that to raise these limits.</P>
    <P>I will mention one or two details concerning the work which the ICC have been doing.  Of huge advantage to the country, in recent times of scarce money and extremely high interest rates, has been the access which the ICC have had to the European Investment Bank funds and the guarantee provided for the ultimate borrowers in this country by the Minister for Finance, in so far as interest rates are concerned, that the exchange risk is being taken by the Department and not by the ultimate borrower.  This has meant that in the field of industry this year, for example, ultimate borrowers have been in the position of being able to fund a considerable proportion of the cost of projects on a repayment basis of up to ten years with an interest <Col N="696" /> rate on a Fixed basis running at between 9 and 10 per cent.  This is particularly advantageous where similar type money from the merchant bank sector on a long-term basis has been running at rates between 20 and 25 per cent. You see immediately the advantages there have been to the borrowing public in the industrial sector through this facility existing under the ambit of the ICC.  Their scope has broadened, probably as a result of the original experience. This is not dealt with in the Minister's speech, nor was it his function to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The scope of their activity has broadened somewhat beyond the industrial sector in that there has been a considerable amount of funding of different areas of activity in the services such as supermarkets, stores, wholesale organisations and areas such as the restaurant sector, which is not widely known but which might be more widely known in the future.</P>
    <P>There is not much more one could say about this Bill because the scope of it is fairly narrow.  I welcome this Bill and I assure the Minister that it will have the full support of our party.  Again I compliment the ICC and their general manager, Frank Casey, and his staff on the excellent work being done very quietly over the last few years in the interests of this country.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  This is a noncontroversial Bill, as Senator Staunton has said.  I welcome the new Minister of State and wish him all the luck in the years ahead.  I am sure he will very shortly feel the calming effect of the Seanad Chamber descending on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make two or three brief points on this Bill.  A recent survey in the United States has shown that small firms there with fewer than 20 people employed have generated over the past ten or 20 years some 66 per cent of all the new jobs in the United States of America.  This finding in probably the most highly developed economy in the world underlines the importance of small <Col N="697" /> industries in any economy whether it is a developed economy or a developing economy as our own is.  The Minister in his speech and the reports from the ICC have underlined and spelt out their attachment to small industries and I would like to underline it here again today. They pointed out that some 90 per cent of the ICC's loan approvals in 1978 have been given to firms who employ fewer than 100 people.  This is commendable and I would like to see it continue. I ask that it be continued and that in some way special programmes for small industries within the ICC might be developed.  The now famous programme within the IDA for small industries is widely known and well respected.  I would like to see a similar type of programme within the ICC.  I am confident that there is a form of programme there and I would prefer if it were more generally understood and known by the public.  Too many firms are inclined to say when their day's work is done that they are, after all, only working for the bank.  They are, of course, referring to the large proportion of their overheads that go in the bank interest.  I would like to see the ICC having a special look at this question in regard to small industries. I am aware that in 1978 they borrowed some £2.5 million from the European Investment Bank and that that was lent onwards to Irish manufacturing industry at something of the order of 9 per cent.  This, of course, was admirable but I would like to see, not only a continuation of this but a tolerance, indeed a discrimination in interest rates towards the smaller firm, placing them in a better position to plan their growth.  Why not a special interest package for small industries along the lines of the IDA small industries programme?  What I am asking to be considered is an ICC special interest plan for small firms.  One job in every four in Irish manufacturing industry is in a small industry.  That is a significant proportion.  Most of these industries are grant-aided by the IDA, by Gaeltarra Éireann or by SFADCo which if examined is a trend growing at a very rapid pace.  What I am appealing for is for the ICC to continue to develop native <Col N="698" /> Irish industry, small industry, to run a campaign parallel to the IDA small industries programme, taking a special look at the interest rates available to small industries.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one other point. For example in this city&mdash;and indeed in others, but particularly in this city&mdash;where such a large proportion of our people now live the IDA have established a separate unit and have been doing tremendous work in the city centre. They have been buying sites and developing industries.  Can the Industrial Credit Corporation develop a parallel programme of loans at special interest rates for anybody in these areas who wants to develop industry?  I have the feeling&mdash;it is difficult to put words on it&mdash;that there is not sufficient dovetailing of schemes between the Industrial Development Authority and the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Perhaps that is not even desirable but, from the outside, it would appear to be desirable.  I join Senator Staunton in wishing the ICC well.  My remarks are meant to be helpful.  The work they are doing for our economy is known and respected by all of us in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Senators in welcoming to the House the new Minister of State and wish him success in his Department, success to himself and his colleagues, which is important to all of us.  We shall endeavour to be as constructive and helpful as possible in our suggestions and amendments.  We have no quarrel at all with this Bill.  Of course it is purely a technical measure. As has been said by two speakers already, it is a pity that the work of the ICC is not sufficiently advertised.  I said this in the debate on the Agricultural Credit Bill: if there is any one question constantly put to me by constituents, by people over a wide area, it is a question in relation to the financing of businesses, farms and things of that nature.  I receive more of that sort of inquiry than almost anything else.  Consistently over the years I have had that experience.  I find that the majority of people, even those engaged in industrial and commercial <Col N="699" /> activities of various kinds, are not aware of the existence of the ICC.  They have not been sold in the way perhaps that the Agricultural Credit Corporation have been sold to the world of agriculture.  I welcome also the fact that the ICC in the past couple of years have expanded their activities into the fields of commerce and trade.  While this may not be the area in which primary wealth is produced nevertheless we must have efficient, well-financed services for the development of a healthy economy. Without these, naturally, our industry would be at a disadvantage.  Therefore I am glad to note the ICC have started to develop in that area, one no less worthy of their attention than that of manufacturing.</P>
      <P>This relates to the questions we raised on the last Finance Bill.  I think the Minister made reference to the £50 million it is envisaged borrowing abroad. I take this to be different from the European Investment Bank money. Presumably this is money which the Industrial Credit Corporation will borrow on the European market and, we have been told, at a very competitive interest rate.  This will be passed on at the going Irish rates to Irish industrialists.  I can understand the reasons for the ICC so doing.  Nevertheless I should like to advance again the argument I made here when the question of the ACC arose and to refer to the fact that no explanation or answer was given on that day to it.  Indeed, new Ministers may not always have the answers to the questions we pose here, which is understandable.  If not, perhaps at some future date they would write to us, explaining the reason for their failure to do so or where we are wrong if we are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this whole question, I cannot understand&mdash;and I have been saying this for the past 12 months and I think I was probably the first person to bring it privately to the attention of Ministers&mdash;why, having joined the EMS we are still forced to pay the sort of interest rates we would have been paying were we not in the Community, the same <Col N="700" /> sort of interest rates being forced on us by the British money market rather than the European market.  If our Minister for Finance and our Government are convinced that we can hold our currency within the limits imposed by the EMS at present then I cannot understand why we are afraid to allow this sort of borrowing knowing that at present there are very few fields of industry in Ireland, or agriculture, that can withstand these current interest rates.</P>
    <P>If there is any one factor&mdash;and people can be misled in this&mdash;that can prevent the growth and development of agricultural industry at present it is these sorts of interest rates.  While as a country we have been fairly bold and courageous&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;about the sort of borrowing we are prepared to undertake as individuals, we are very conservative in every branch of industry about the level of borrowings we are prepared to risk.  Interest rates always have been something of which the average Irish businessman was very conscious, perhaps too conscious at times, but certainly at present they represent a vital element in every consideration about business, industry and commerce. For that reason the ICC are uniquely placed to give that sort of leadership.  We cannot expect it from the commercial banks.  It is obvious that vast amounts of money are being made at present in the banking system in this protected area and that the only competition in the area of industry and commerce must come from the ICC.  If the ICC are to borrow abroad, if the Government believe that there is not a grave risk of serious devaluation of our currency in the foreseeable future, then why must the ICC charge Irish borrowers interest rates comparable to those they can get anywhere else, assuming they could get the money?</P>
    <P>If the value of our currency does not drop then in time will the ICC pass on this money, or retain the profits, or will they spread it out between people who will borrow in more settled times with less risk involved?  One way or another, perhaps it is the wrong approach.  Being <Col N="701" /> in the EMS, if there is a risk involved, the Government should tell us about it or, alternatively, allow us the advantages of borrowing in foreign currencies.  I will say that, juse like the arguments which I advanced in the case of agriculture where we are selling in the European market, we are selling our industrial goods in the European market as well.  If the ICC were to borrow on behalf of Irish industrialists in European markets, then it must be borne in mind that those industrialists will be selling their goods in European markets.  And, assuming that our industrialists have confidence in themselves, in their competitiveness, there is not a risk involved even if our money devalues because if it does the price of the product we are selling will go up, so I think there is a lot of confusion in this respect.  I may not have all the answers but I think what I am saying makes sense.  I do not see why in present circumstances we should be saddled with rates of interest of 20 per cent and above in some cases when there is clearly an alternative which can be operated by semi-State bodies to ease the whole money market considerably.</P>
    <P>That is the most of what I wanted to say about this matter except, of course, that the ICC will find themselves servicing small, weak industries.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the organisation expanding themselves and their staff to the situation where not only will they be able to consider cases, evaluate them and decide whether to finance them but that should have something that is very lacking in the whole area of Irish industry. We have made considerable progress and, in fact, our industrial development is something of which we could and should be proud.  During debate on the previous Bill we talked about the success of the dairy industry.  The success and competitiveness of Irish manufacturing industry is even greater than that of the dairy industry and this should be recognised.  Our ability to compete in the new found markets in Europe is very heartening.  Outside this country the success of Irish industry within the European Economic Community is more appreciated <Col N="702" /> than it is at home.  Nevertheless I would suggest in that area that the ICC should perhaps as a semi-State body consider placing more emphasis on expertise and advice to the people who seek finance so that not only will they be able to make a quick evaluation of the creditworthiness of the industry or of the applicant but they will be able to follow this up with the sort of advice which is needed in Irish industry and with the sort of expertise in which we have not had a tradition.  We have a lot of learning to do in this regard.  Most of the advice that we have got from the financial institutions already in existence in this country has been rather negative.  I should like to see the development of a positive financial advisory service coming together with the financial help that the ICC can give us.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill too and to re-echo to some extent what my colleague.  Senator McCartin, has been saying.  We both spoke, using the same tune, on the Agricultural Credit Corporation Bill.  However, I would not be quite as optimistic about it as he is.  I have been trying to wrap my brain around the subject to see if I can understand why it is that the financial institutions and the Department are somewhat conservative in their approach to exploiting the availability of low interest money on the European scene as opposed to the high interest money that is available in London.  As I said before, given that we have joined the EMS, one would expect to see it being exploited.  If we are confident of being able to keep our currency in line with European currencies through the mechanism of the EMS, then perhaps we should have a bit more confidence in borrowing money and accepting the exchange risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry through their director have been making the point that for small industry it is essential that this particular facility should be exploited and that in an atmosphere where there might be a tendency to cool down expansion there must not be any retraction in the development of small industries because that is where the employment <Col N="703" /> is and can be.  I am delighted to see in the Minister's speech that in fact now the ICC are being used as a mechanism to explore this.  They had already started in a small way.</P>
    <P>There is a very definite statement here from the Minister that the exchange risk will be borne by the Exchequer in return for regular payments to it by the company. There will be no exchange risk for the ultimate borrower.  It will be very interesting to see on what terms the ICC will work that one through.  Presumably, if they can borrow at say something like 8 or 9 per cent and if they will start on-lending at maybe 12 or 13 per cent, the margin in between will be shared and some money out of that may go to the Exchequer as a means of covering the exchange risk.  I presume that something like this is in mind.  Certainly it is a step forward and my only hope would be that if the ICC in their first efforts can show that this is a good mechanism, it will be expanded so as to keep up the investment in industry which is required and which will be more than ever required in the future.  We will have more opportunity to talk about this when we are addressing the Appropriation Bill later.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if the world is awash with cash, which is a statement I made here a couple of weeks ago, we should be scouping up a bit of it.  That is the game we are in.  With the increasing oil prices now around the corner&mdash;I did not hear the news today as to what is happening at the OPEC meeting&mdash;more funds will be looking for an outlet in the European scene.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ICC, I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate them on the tremendous contributions they have made to the development of Irish industry down through the years, a contribution which in many ways has been hiding under the bush.  Though Fóir Teoranta are an independent body, the ICC are the back-up body who provide a good deal of the expertise required to help Fóir Teoranta to evaluate difficult situations.  They play a very valuable role in our society and this should be <Col N="704" /> well recognised by everybody.  Another of their roles which I take the opportunity to draw the attention of the House to is that they are the training ground for many of the young merchant bankers who are emerging and who have emerged.  I have never actually looked at the statistics but from personal knowledge, experience and contact with the people I would say that a very significant percentage of the merchant bankers operating in that expanding sector did their training in the ICC.  This is an indirect spin-off for which the company should receive due recognition.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to congratulate the ICC on their achievement down through the years.  I happen to have been a borrower from that organisation and I certainly found that when borrowing money from them at any time the best advice was readily available to one.  They would discuss the project concerned and help the borrower in every way.  It is easy enough for people to say that they should lend money at a cheaper rate but they are always prepared to lend money at the rate at which they are borrowing at the time.</P>
      <P>That is a fair enough recommendation because it shows that they are not anxious to make an over-profit on it.  They are quite prepared to tell you the rates at which they are borrowing.  Their honesty is certainly without question.  Not alone that, but they would be prepared to accommodate you if you wished to borrow money from them at a fluctuating rate or, if you wished to borrow from them at a fixed rate.  They do a very good job. Up to now, we have always associated them with a body who were prepared to help industrialists, let them be large or small, but they are now prepared to help the people who are distributing the goods.  That is the category I come into. I wonder where the people at that end would be if they were depending on the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think they are doing a very good job and I want to congratulate them.  Both Houses should give them every encouragement  <Col N="705" /> because they are prepared to help every section of the community, within reason.  Some borrowers may go to the ICC looking for money, but for many reasons the ICC may not be prepared to finance them.  They are the best judges at that stage.  Occasionally they make a wrong decision, but 99 times out of 100 their decisions are correct.  I sent a number of small and large industrialists to them and they were most helpful.  I want to put it on the record that the ICC are doing a very good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join the previous speakers both in welcoming the Bill and in complimenting the Industrial Credit Company for the sound and constructive work they have been doing in developing Irish industry and services with very little blowing of trumpets.  I would also like to joint them in welcoming and wishing well to the new Minister.</P>
      <P>My principal reason for joining in the debate is to offer some thoughts about interest rates which might be helpful. There are low interest rates where inflation is low and where capital is relatively plentiful.  Therefore, interest rates are much lower in Germany, where inflation rates are between 3 and 5 per cent, than in Britain or Ireland where there is an inflation rate of 16 or 17 per cent. The reason is obvious.  If people who are saving are offered a rate of interest less than the going rate of inflation, they are being asked to save at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised by Senator McCartin of why do we not, when we are in the EMS, benefit from access to the low interest rates in, let us say, Germany. We could, of course, go to Germany&mdash;and, in fact, the Government and other State bodies do&mdash;for Deutschemark loans, and we get them at nominally low rates of interest.  But the kind of borrowing we are talking about for re-lending by the Industrial Credit Company is not borrowing lent today to be paid back in six months or a year, that is over the kind of period for which we would have some vision of how the exchange rates were likely to go.  We are talking about borrowing for terms of <Col N="706" /> from 15 to 25 years; and therefore, as we extend the horizon, the degree of risk grows enormously.</P>
    <P>We all know that if a differential of inflation rates like we have at present between ourselves and Germany persists for a long time, the rates of exchange between the Irish pound and the Deutsche Mark will have to change considerably. They have already changed, even in the short time we are in the EMS. If one borrows at a low interest rate for a long period, one takes on a very considerable risk of having to pay back a lot more because the exchange rate will have changed over the period to repayment.</P>
    <P>If the Industrial Credit Company were to borrow in the German market and relend at the same rate of interest, somebody either the company itself or the Government, would have to guarantee it against loss on that transaction. It would not be re-lending in Deutschemarks to an Irish firm.  No Irish firm would take that risk.  Such foreign currency loans are available already through the banks to any number of Irish industrialists, but they do not show the slightest interest in them because they know that an exchange risk exists. They also know that, if they were to cover themselves forward to purchase Deutschemarks against the repayment obligations, they would be paying in the price of the forward money an extra rate of interest which would virtually wipe out the original advantage.  This is the reason why, on a purely commercial basis, no industrial borrower wants to take on a Deutschemark obligation.  It would only be taken on if the State intervened, as it has done in the case of the Industrial Credit Company on a limited scale, to guarantee them against the risk.</P>
    <P>I myself pointed out here, when we were discussing the EMS, that one should not expect low interest rates in consequence.  There were journalists and others promising us that sort of situation in the EMS, but I tried my best to discount these expectations.  I pointed out that even at the time of the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; that existed prior to EMS and in which Denmark <Col N="707" /> was a partner, rates of interest in Denmark were at least 9 per cent higher than they were in Germany.  My contribution is that one must expect considerable differences in interest rates as long as there are differences in inflation, and these differences in inflation themselves presage the likelihood in the long-term of changes in exchange rates and, therefore, of what is at the outset just a feared risk becoming an actuality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank the Senators for welcoming me today. It is not a very easy job coming here for the first time.</P>
      <P>Senator Brennan asked about special interest rates for small industries.  Small firms enjoy a very special position in the ICC and in the IDA.  The ICC lay great emphasis on small firms.  Senator Brennan mentioned further global loans from the EIB for small industries which are being currently negotiated by the ICC. These will be on-lent at fixed interest rates, with the exchange risk covered at present.  EIB loans to the ICC amount to £22.5 million.  There is also close collaboration at all times between the ICC and the IDA.  Senator McCartin also spoke about interest rates.  Interest rates here are generally high.  This is an international trend.  It will take time for the benefits of the EMS to be extended here.</P>
      <P>In my introductory speech I said that the mechanics surrounding this package have not been determined. A breakdown of the lending rate will have to be made as between the basic costs, the administration margin, and the margin for exchange risk cover.  The precise arrangement to meet the exchange risk cover&mdash;a percentage charge payable by the ICC or as a function of the difference between the actual costs to the ICC inclusive of their management expenses and rate of on-lending&mdash;will also be settled later. This is all I can say on this matter at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of publicity raised by <Col N="708" /> Senator McCartin.  we will look closely at it and in future we will ensure that there will be more publicity given to the ICC.  In the past wide publicity has been given and they continue to publicise a lot.</P>
    <P>On the matter raised by Senator Mulcahy, this is an attempt to put a package together for the industry in the EMS markets.  The rate of interest will depend on the rate at which the ICC will borrow and have a small margin of profit.  Obviously, if the present borrowing package is successful consideration will be given to its expansion.  A sum of £50 million at this stage is a very big step.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central purpose of the Payment of Wages Bill, 1979, is to amend the Truck Acts, 1831 to 1896, so as to enable employees engaged in manual work, who are covered by those Acts, to be paid their wages otherwise than in cash, where both those employees and their employers are agreeable.</P>
      <P>The intention behind the Truck Acts was to safeguard the employees to whom they apply against abuses in relation to payment of wages by providing protection against payment in kind; against interference with the employee's freedom to dispose of his wages as he thought fit and against unreasonable or unfair deductions from wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restriction at present obtaining in respect of payment of their wages <Col N="709" /> otherwise than in cash to employees coming within the scope of the Truck Acts arose unintentionally as a result of the Currency Act, 1927.  Section 1 of the Truck Act, 1831, required the wages of such employees to be paid in the current coin of the realm; section 8 of that Act made it lawful to pay wages, with the employee's consent, in legal tender notes or by bearer cheque drawn on a bank which was within 15 miles of the place of employment and which was licensed to issue bank notes.  The latter restriction has had the accidental effect of making payment by cheque illegal since section 60 of the Currency Act, 1927, removed the banks' powers to issue bank notes. Hence the need for this Bill to bring the present situation into line with the original intention of the Legislature and to restore the pre-1927 position.  In so doing, it will end, too, the differentiation in law in this matter between manual and non-manual employees.</P>
    <P>I am already on record as saying that any movement away from payment of wages in cash will be essentially an evolutionary process, which can best be effected with the goodwill and co-operation of all concerned&mdash;employers, employees, trade unions and the various financial institutions.  My intention in bringing forward legislation is to facilitate that process by legalising it for the future and by regularising it as regards the past, with one essential condition: payment of wages otherwise than in cash may be effected only with the mutual agreement of the parties involved.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the central purpose of this Bill is to make certain amendments to the Truck Acts.  It is logical, therefore, that employees covered by the Bill should be those to whom the Truck Acts apply.  Its scope extends also to employees encompassed by the Hosiery Manufacture (Wages) Act, 1874.  As that Act was designed to protect hosiery workers by curbing abuses in connection with payment of wages in kind and with deductions from wages, it is considered as legislation related to the Truck Acts.  Despite an indication <Col N="710" /> to the contrary in the volume of the index to statutes for the year 1874, the Hosiery Manufacture (Wages) Act applies to this country.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any other piece of legislation, this Bill will enable the wages of employees concerned to be paid otherwise than in cash, provided that either the employer and employees&mdash;or authorised person&mdash;have signed a document for that purpose or that there is in force a written agreement to that effect between the employer and the trade unions representing the employees in question. In practice, it is probable that unorganised employees will avail themselves of the document option, with organised employees preferring that of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I should like to elaborate on these two options in some detail.  Where the document is concerned, it must fulfil three requirements in order to be valid: it must specify the agreed non-cash method of paying wages that is to be used; it must indicate the way in which the use of that method is to be terminated, in accordance with the conditions set out in the Bill for mutual and unilateral termination&mdash;bearing in mind that the period of four weeks notice in the case of unilateral termination is the minimum period; and it must be signed by both the employer and employees&mdash;or authorised person&mdash;involved.  Employees may give written authorisation to some other person to sign the document, and unilaterally to terminate the use of the non-cash method specified in the document, on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not preclude insertion in the document of additional items and any such items could be cancelled by either party in whatever way they had agreed, without prejudice to the remainder of the document.  Where the document relates to more than one employee, termination may be effected by individual employees without affecting the validity of the document in respect of the remaining employees involved.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would draw attention to the fact that existing arrangements between <Col N="711" /> employer and employees involving the payment of wages otherwise than in cash will if necessary be deemed to be a document signed in accordance with this legislation, and can be terminated in the same way as such a document.  In this way, the use of any non-cash method which may have been used in the past in contravention of the Truck Acts by virtue of the Currency Act, 1927, will be regularised.</P>
    <P>As to the second option&mdash;the employer/trade union agreement&mdash;in essence, it permits the employer, or a group of employers of which the employer is a member, and any trade union or other body of persons recognised by the employer for the purpose of collective bargaining negotiations, of which the employee is a member, to have a written agreement about paying the employees' wages otherwise than in cash. Termination of the use of the specified non-cash method will be effected under and in accordance with the agreement, that is to say, either following a review of the position, if the agreement provides for a periodic review, or by one party giving notice to that effect in writing to the other party concerned, such notice being that which was specified in the agreement and being a period of not less than four weeks.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the employer/trade union agreement may be made either before or after the passing of this Bill.  This agreement option will apply to a trade union or to a staff association recognised for collective bargaining purposes.  It could also, of course, apply to a multi-union situation.  It would cover a contract of employment if the terms of that contract had been negotiated with the trade union or unions involved.  It would bind prospective employees who were members of the trade union, or who became members of the trade union on joining the firm in question, which was party to an agreement of this kind with the employer.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the two options contained in this measure I should like to clarify that the employer or the employee <Col N="712" /> or his trade union can take the initiative in relation to suggesting that wages might be paid otherwise than in cash.  The payment of the wages by a non-cash method can only be done, however, by consensus.  If one or other of the options are taken up the non-cash method to be used will have to be chosen among the list of payment instruments and modes of payment referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This list, which follows generally on the provisions of section 26 (6) of the Central Bank Act, 1971, includes: cheques, bank drafts, promissory notes or other documents issued by a customer for the purpose of enabling a person to obtain payment from the customer's bank account, payable orders and other documents issued by a public officer for the purpose of enabling a person to obtain payment from a Government Minister, as well as cheques and other documents drawn on trustee savings banks.</P>
    <P>Additions may be made to the list by regulations made by the Minister for Labour following consultations with the Minister for Finance.  Thus, provision is made for flexibility in relation to the possible future establishment of new kinds of financial institutions, payment instruments or modes of payment.  It will be seen that the existing list affords both employers, employees and trade unions a wide variety of non-cash methods from which to make a choice, so as to facilitate their being able to use the one most appropriate and suitable for their particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>While good industrial relations practice would dictate that the employer should ensure that his employees are fully consulted before any change-over to non-cash payment were made, in this instance it is essential to remember that, under the Truck Acts, the consent of employees is explicitly required before payment otherwise than in cash can lawfully be made.  Such consent must, of course, be freely given.  In this connection, the Payment of Wages Bill contains provision to ensure that neither pressure nor coercion will be exerted on the employee <Col N="713" /> where the payment of his wages by a non-cash method is concerned.</P>
    <P>Towards that end, any term or condition of an agreement will be null and void if it requires a person to sign, or to authorise another to sign on his behalf, a document agreeing to the use of a non-cash method, or not to terminate the use of any such method where it is already being used to pay wages to the employee involved.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that, where an employee is required to work at a place other than his usual place of employment, or is absent from work by reason of illness, on leave or with the consent of his employer, he may prefer, in any of those circumstances, to be paid in cash. If so, all he has to do is to notify his employer in writing to that effect and that written notification will then supersede any document he may have signed or any agreement with the employer to which his trade union is party.  However, if the employee does not send written notification to his employer, the employer will be notified to pay him his wages by means of any of the non-cash methods referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main provision concerning deductions is not restricted to employees coming within the scope of the Truck Acts; it embraces all employees, both manual and non-manual.</P>
    <P>It obliges the employer, where he makes a deduction from the employee's pay, to give that employee a written statement indicating the gross amount of the salary or wages payable and the nature and amount of the deduction.  Examples of deductions would include those for income tax, social welfare, Voluntary Health Insurance, a contributory pension scheme and so on, virtually all employees should, in effect, be affected by this provision.  In the circumstances, since itemised pay statements would have to be prepared for practically the entire workforce, it is only fair that employers should be given some time in which to prepare themselves.  I intend, therefore, to wait about a year after the Bill has been enacted before bringing this provision into operation by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> I should like to emphasise that employers will be required to take such reasonable steps as are necessary, not only to ensure that the pay statement is treated as confidential until it becomes the property of the employee, but also to ensure that the information itself, which is contained in the statement, is treated as confidential by those who are privy to it.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the terms of any statute referred to in the Bill, the employer will be permitted to make deductions from wages to which the employees in question give their consent.  In this way it is proposed to resolve, with retrospective as well as future effect, a certain difficulty which has come to light in relation to the Truck Acts and related legislation.  The general effect of the Truck Acts is that no deductions other than those required or permitted by statute can lawfully be made from the wages of any employee to whom the Acts apply.  For that reason many deductions&mdash;such as, for example, the recovery of overpayments of wages, or contributions to pension schemes&mdash; which might appear desirable to employers and employees alike cannot lawfully be made, even on a consensual basis, because of those Acts.  One can readily appreciate that the relative provisons in the existing law, while originally designed for the employee's protection, can now be against his own interests.  If they have not caused that much difficulty up to the present it is almost certainly due to their having been in large measure ignored.  They remain, not alone a dormant anomaly, but a potential barrier to developments for the employee's benefit.</P>
    <P>Where the employer and employees, or their trade unions, have signed a document or where an employer/trade union agreement is in force about the payment of wages otherwise than in cash, the employer will be prohibited from making any deduction from any wages of the employees by reason only of the fact that the wages are not being paid in cash.  In other words, the employer will not be permitted to charge his <Col N="715" /> employees for paying them by means of a non-cash method, or to deduct any bank charges incurred by him in the process.  This could not be allowed, especially since the use of the non-cash method in the first place will be by agreement between the employer and employees, or their trade unions.</P>
    <P>The earliest consultations on the Trust Acts, of which I am aware, date back to 1959 to a committee which was set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and which was representative of the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Needless to say, that was long before the Department of Labour was established.  I understand that the work of that committee was discontinued before any conclusions were reached.  Following representations from the Minister for Finance in the context of the National Savings Campaign, the committee was reconstituted in 1964, to examine the possibility of a limited amendment to the Truck Acts, for the purpose of legalising payment of manual workers' wages by cheque in cases where the consent of the workers and their employers was forthcoming.  The recommendations of the committee were accepted by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and are now reflected in the provisions of the Payment of Wages Bill.</P>
    <P>I might add that the majority of those changes and additions, which have been made to the text of the Bill as presented last February, is based on the outcome of the more recent consultations with interests concerned at ministerial and at official level earlier this year.  Accordingly, in commending the Payment of Wages Bill, 1979, to the House, I am happy to say that its revised text is acceptable to both the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  With the co-operation of employers, employees and trade unions involved, I hope that this measure will help to bring the payment of wages of manual workers more into conformity with modern conditions by providing a framework for those who wish to move <Col N="716" /> away from the system of payment in cash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this party I welcome this Bill.  It is interesting to note that it comes here with the approval of all the parties who will be interested in it when it comes to operate on the ground. Apparently, the approval is unanimous and there is no dissent in the terms of the approval.  I go so far as to say that that must be a unique situation for a Bill.  I note, too, from the Minister's concluding remarks that the earliest consultation on amending the Truck Acts took place as long ago as 1959 and continued spasmodically up to the present day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It struck me, when the Minister was introducing the Bill, that there was one startling omission from his speech, and that was the real reason why this legislation is now being put forward.  If it had no urgency for the last 20 years, one is entitled to ask why, in 1979, has this commendable piece of social legislation now been brought forward?  It is odd that the Minister gave no reason, other than the perfectly valid one that he wants to amend the law and bring it into conformity with present social and commerical conditions.  We are entitled to speculate as to whether there might be any other reasons.  Quite obviously, the first reason that strikes one as to why the legislation is now being brought forward is the need to take large sums of cash out of temptation's way from the many robbers who are plaguing our society at the moment.  It is commonly assumed among the public and, indeed, I am sure it is recognised by the employers' organisations and by the Congress of Trade Unions, that such a reason is a perfectly valid reason; in the context of our times, it is a compelling reason of the highest urgency.  I find it slightly, dishonest might be too strong a word, on the part of the Minister not to have acknowledged this reason in his introductory speech.  I did not read the debate in the other House; that omission may not have been made in the course of his speech to that House.  Listening to him here, it struck me as extremely odd that he would not recognise that a compelling <Col N="717" /> and urgent reason to amend the Truck Acts was to correct the situation where large sums, by way of payrolls, are being held weekly in thosuands of places up and down the country in most vulnerable situation and have provided easy pickings for the gangsters who are plaguing our society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it tends to cure and deal with that problem.  The number of armed robberies of payrolls that have been taking place constitutes a problem of magnitude, and a problem of urgency requiring, not just the partial cure that this Bill will bring as a consequence, but other measures on the part of the Government.  The number of robberies is startingly large and is growing as rapidly as our inflation rate; the amount of money that is being robbed is even exceeding our inflation rate.  This has very serious consequences for society, because this money, in turn, is financing other illegal operations of one kind or another.  It may be financing what we are pleased to term ordinary criminal activities, but what I fear is that this money is financing subversive organisations to continue in their illegal, dangerous and deadly activities.  Any piece of legislation which may tend to curb&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged for that ruling. I can appreciate the sensitivity of the Minister in my dealing with the subject which he chose to ignore when he was opening the debate.  The fact that I speak about it probably adds to his embarrassment and possibly provoked his interruption.</P>
      <P>I was making the point that the Bill is of benefit because it reduces the opportunities for the robbery of large sums of money.  I was making the point that it is important that those opportunities be reduced because those stolen sums of money are finding their way into hands that are inimical to our society and our State and are financing further depredations and damage to our social fabric.  I want to emphasise that the solution to that problem, and the bringing of it to an end, is a matter that requires an urgency not just on the part of this Minister but more especially on the part of his colleagues who are directly charged in that area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not going to be possible to remove temptation or opportunities totally from the way of would-be robbers. Efforts should be made to reduce their opportunities by increasing the security precautions in firms that might decide in the future not to avail of the provisions of the Bill for the payment of wages otherwise than by cash.  It will be some time before there is widespread availing by employers and employees of the changes proposed in the Bill and during that interval the temptation and opportunity will be there.  It should be brought home to people who have temporary custody of large amounts of cash on their premises for the purpose of paying wages that they have a duty to protect that cash as strictly as possible.  I do not think the banks have discharged their responsibility in this regard.  It is too easy for banks to be robbed.  There are simple inhibiting features that could <Col N="719" /> be built into the bank premises physically.  There are modes of operation that could be arrived at which would inhibit large-scale robberies.  Likewise, in the case of employers to whom this Bill applies there would be ways and means, in consultation with the people in charge of our security, whereby they could improve the security of their premises or their cash offices pending the coming into operation of the measures proposed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to encourage the adoption of all possible means by people in charge of large sums of cash that will prevent the robbery of that cash, because the dreadful consequences to our society are too serious to be treated lightly and require a serious and thorough response from anyone who can help.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister if it was in his mind when bringing forward this Bill to do something to counteract the ease with which robberies of payrolls have been taking place.  Does he want to see a situation where that temptation or opportunity will be removed?  I would be interested to hear from him on that.  Would the Minister be prepared, pending the coming into operation of the Bill in its fullest extent, to urge employers to adopt as stringent security measures as possible, so as to at least inhibit these robberies?  The police are always available to offer expert advice, and I ask the Minister to encourage employers in this situation to seek it.</P>
    <P>The operation of the changes will be voluntary and it will be a matter for the parties to agree.  It is encouraging to know that the Bill is being brought forward with the blessing of both the employers' side and the employees' side. That agreement has been obtained from the two associations, The Federated Union of Employers and The Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  One might say that it is an agreement in macro-terms. The Minister now has an obligation to get in touch with individual firms, individual employers and employees in certain firms and encourage them, directly through his Department or through their trade unions or staff associations, <Col N="720" /> to avail of the changes proposed in the Bill.  What we want to do is get cash out of circulation as quickly as possible.  The urgency of the problem puts an onus on the Minister to take unusual steps towards implementing his legislation as soon as possible.  It is not enough for him to appeal to the Federated Union of Employers or Congress.  He has to go behind them to the individual members on a company basis and ask them to implement the provisions as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister may encounter certain opposition because one of the first things employers or employees may say to themselves is that if they go from cash to cheque they are putting a certain amount of trouble on themselves.  An employee is more likely to complain because he has the bother of cashing the cheque, and of deciding the venue where he is going to cash it.  It may not suit him to cash it in a local shop, the amount of his cheque may be confidential to him.  The bank in his area on a Friday evening may close at 3 p.m.  That is a factor that could inhibit the widespread use of the changes proposed.  The Minister will have to consider approaching the banks so that their long opening day, which varies from town to town, is standardised to a Friday throughout the country to enable employees to have the option of going into a bank.  It is a more impersonal place for the transaction than, perhaps, going to the local grocer or butcher and changing a wages cheque there.  It can be a matter of some sensitivity, particularly if there are deductions being made from the cheque for one thing or another.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider that, because it could be a factor that would inhibit the use of the measures proposed.</P>
    <P>There is a situation that will arise in the case of a bank strike, not unknown in this country and something we have to assume can happen again.  The possibility of that happening could be a factor inhibiting workers or employers from using the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister will have to think about how he is going to overcome that objection should it be raised.  It is a valid objection, <Col N="721" /> because if there is a bank strike cash gets scarce and there will be a certain unwillingness on the part of shopkeepers to change cheques, although they will balance that against the custom that will be coming in as a result of changing the cheque.  It will be a factor that will make the cheque in the employee's hand less attractive than hard cash, a factor that might inhibit him from making an agreement under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, too&mdash;and I think this happened at the time of the more lengthy bank strike&mdash;there was a situation where certain shopkeepers were left with cheques on their hands when the banks reopened.  The cheques were dis-honoured because the business in question had gone into liquidation during, and possibly as a result of, the bank strike.  I think this happened in the case of one particularly large company in this city.  While wages cheques may have some priority in liquidation, that is scant enough consolation to the person having to answer to a shopkeeper for a number of wages cheques.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has provided in the Bill for the termination of the agreement and one could say that in the event of a bank strike the parties mutually terminate the agreement and payment in cash can then take place.  If there is not mutual agreement to terminate it and it has to be terminated unilaterally, it requires four weeks' notice.  I think that in the situation which I have outlined four weeks could be too long.  The Minister would want to consider some procedure whereby an employee could unilaterally terminate the agreement in the event of a bank strike so that he could be paid cash and not be forced to cash his cheque to a shopkeeper who may not want to cash his cheque because the fingers of quite a few people were burned with wages cheques following the longer of the bank strikes.  That sort of word spreads around very quickly and in the event of a bank strike a person employed in a firm that had any question mark about its viability might find himself left with a useless piece of paper.  This might be a real problem and the Minister would <Col N="722" /> want to give consideration to it.  I think the right to terminate unilaterally at four weeks' notice is a good one; but four weeks in the context in which I speak is, I would submit to the Minister, too long.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Minister's speech, there are one or two queries I would put to him for clarification when he is winding up the debate.  He mentioned in his speech that the agreement for payment by cheque has to have three requirements to be valid.  I raise no question about them.  They are perfectly proper.  He also says that the legislation does not preclude insertion in the document of additional items, that any such items could be cancelled by either party and so on.  I would be interested to know from the Minister what other items he would have in mind or what he would anticipate could come into the document agreeing for payment by mode other than cash.  I do not know whether we have Post Office Giro at the moment in this country.  I have an idea that it was introduced but never operated.  I would ask the Minister to let me know if Post Office Giro would be covered by the modes set out in section 3 (3) paragraphs (a) to (g) or would it have to be provided specifically in regulations by the Minister?  Would Bank Giro, which we do have, come under the existing definitions? I think it probably would.  It could probably be in the form of a draft. However, the Minister can clarify that for us.  If Post Office Giro or Bank Giro do not come under the methods proposed, I suggest to him that he should make regulations, as a matter of urgency, to permit payment by both of those ways or by only one of them if only Bank Giro is available.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes changes in the law to permit deductions from wages.  That is good and I am glad to see that it is being made retrospective.  I am not aware of any cases where deductions might have been made by consent, but invalidly, and were recovered.  It may have happened. Unfortunately, the Minister can hardly go so far as to cure those situations; but at least where there has been no action for recovery up to now he is regularising <Col N="723" /> the position.  He is also going to make provision for the confidentiality of the nature of deductions being made from wages.  I commend him for that.  That is very desirable but it is going to be a difficult thing to achieve because a certain number of people will be involved in the making up of wages and wages slips. There is the possibility that a very sensitive deduction may be involved&mdash;for example, as a consequence of an attachment order or the like or payment of maintenance under a court order or agreement.  While the Minister is to be commended on his desire to obtain confidentiality in this area, I just wonder if it is an empty hope?  I would be glad to hear from him as to how he thinks this might be solved.  I take it that deductions made on foot of an attachment order will be covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The last question that I have for the Minister relates to situations where the agreement for the payment by cheque is made not by the individual employee but by a trade union or by a staff association on his behalf.  The Minister mentions that there could be a multi-union situation in a firm, so I presume that if there were three unions in a firm the firm could have separate agreements with each of the unions.  What I worry about is the position of an individual worker who might decide he does not want to be in a union at all&mdash;of course he may be caught by the closed shop and not have any choice, his freedom thereby limited, regrettably.  Let us suppose, for example, it is not a trade union situation, that it is a staff association situation, that all the employees are in the association, and that, there is an agreement with the association.  If the person resigns from the association and wants his payments in cash thereafter, is he, as an individual, entitled to opt out of the arrangement made by his staff association with the particular employer?  Can he determine the agreement as an individual though it was entered into on his behalf by his association?  If there is any doubt about that, the Bill should provide that possibility for such a worker.  I think the <Col N="724" /> individual's freedom and rights demand that that option would not be taken away from him and that it should be there for him as an individual if he wants to reassert his right to obtain his wages in cash.  He might have excellent reasons, reasons perhaps to do with confidentiality, reasons that could be commercial, reasons to do with the method of family budgeting, any number of good and valid reasons.  He might want to opt out of the arrangement made by his association or trade union.  I would like to be reassured by the Minister that such a person will be entitled to opt out on giving the four weeks' notice as in the case of an individual agreement between a worker and his firm.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say except that I welcome the Bill.  It is good for the social reasons that the Minister mentioned or hinted at in his introduction but even better for the security reasons I mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not concerned with ensuring the security of payroll moneys.  The central purpose of the Bill is to restore the payment of manual workers' wages by cheque or other non-cash method of payment to the position which obtained prior to the Currency Act of 1927.  However, with the expected changeover to non-cash methods of wage payments to manual workers which should follow this enabling legislation, the opportunities for robbing payroll cash by criminals should diminish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill legalises the payment of manual workers' wages by cheque or other payment instrument, thus ending the distinction in law between manual and non-manual workers.  This is a small but significant change, because any measure that removes distinctions between these two categories of workers is welcome in that it advances the approach towards a single status for all employees in the workforce of any organisation.  Too often in the past distinctions between manual and non-manual workers have served as a source of irritation and potential conflict.  I share the view that payment by cheque <Col N="725" /> or other non-cash method should not be compulsory, but hope that through agreement in individual employments payment of manual workers' wages by non-cash methods will quickly evolve and become the general practice. Clearly, both employers and workers will need some time at least to adjust and to prepare for non-cash methods of payment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to make the point that many workers do not use the facilities of financial institutions.  This legislation will likely lead to an increase in contact between manual workers and financial organisations, particularly banks.  Such contact, in turn, should lead to creating a greater awareness of the wide range of banking services available and, for example, may well serve as a stimulus to saving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill meets all the requirements of the trade union movement in respect of this matter.  I have only one reservation but I do not think a great deal can be done about it.  It is the same reservation mentioned by Senator Cooney&mdash;the four-week period before a system of payment can be revoked.  I would ask the Minister to consider this period as it appears to be a bit too long in the event of a bank strike or other problems.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I want to mention which may be related to this subject.  I read a letter in the paper the other evening from the wife of a soldier serving in the Lebanon.  She complained that her money was paid by cheque.  She presented the cheque in a bank and was told that as she did not have an account in the bank they could not cash it unless she produced somebody who was known to the bank.  If that situation prevails in respect of the wives or dependants of soldiers serving overseas, the Minister should ensure that their cheques are cashed on demand in any bank.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  For a number of years I have been involved in the payment of wages in a small company and we have been using non-cash methods of payment.  Senator Cooney <Col N="726" /> referred to the methods of non-cash payment. I should like to instance what I consider to be a competitive element in banking.  A bank official asked me if he could talk to my staff in connection with the payment of wages.  A short time afterwards bank accounts were opened on behalf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of some of the employees. It may have been in contravention of the Truck Acts but from that time the wages were lodged each week to the individual accounts of the employees in the bank involved.  Anybody who did not open a bank account was paid in cash.  I have found that there are difficulties in the non-cash method of payment for both employee and employer.  As Senator Cooney said, these difficulties arise during bank strikes when wages have to be paid in cash.  There should be no difficulty with the four-week period if both employer and employee agree that wages can be paid in cash during a bank strike.  As employees must be paid it is up to employers to overcome the difficulties that might arise.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Bill provides that an employee be given a document stating his gross earnings and his deductions. Irrespective of what way he is paid, he will know exactly what he is being paid. On occasion employers have created difficulties by lodging wages to accounts without giving employees the relevant documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney referred to security in dealing with cash.  It has only recently been brought to public notice that large sums of money are handled by junior clerks in big organisations.  These people should not have been responsible for the large sums of money which they have been handling.  Thank God they got away with it without too many problems.  It is not too long since the banks in the College Green area wheeled millions of pounds across to the Central Bank for burning.  Unfortunately those <Col N="727" /> days are gone.  It is very important that a girl should not be sent to a bank unaccompanied, even if she is only collecting £1,000 in cash.</P>
    <P>I worked in a bank at one stage and the security element in banks in 1960 was no different from the security element in banks now.  They have no security in 90 per cent of the banks in this country.  There is a ruling, I believe, whereby bank staff are told not to hinder anybody who comes in to steal money. The easiest place to steal money at present is the bank because of the lack of security.  A banking institution is an institution which is dealing in cash, in a product, and banks are probably the least security-minded bodies in this country when you consider the commodity in which they are dealing.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides for the payment other than on a cash basis of wages.  I would sincerely hope that every firm in the country would look at the consideration in the Bill but I also would like people to ensure that wages are not paid in documents that can be cashed in pubs.  That has happened in England for many years where certain groups of workers were paid by cheque and the employer knew that the cheques could not be cashed in any other place on the Friday night except in certain pubs which ensured that the employees had to go to these particular pubs and the owners of these pubs were the only gainers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney mentioned banks staying open on Friday evenings until 5 o'clock.  However, if we are going to have payment by cheque we must ensure that wages are paid not on Friday but on Thursday so that the employee will have the opportunity to cash the cheque before Friday evening.  It is very important that what happened in England does not happen here.  The men on the lump who were earning good wages found that the only place they could cash their cheques was in the pubs.  That is something <Col N="728" /> which I would not like to see here.  That is one of the main reservations I have about the Bill.  Banking organisations will have to change their times of opening; employers will have to change the pay day to ensure that there is at least one banking day after the issue of the cheque.  The Bill is a good one and I sincerely hope that every employer and employee will think about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill very much as a step towards what I hope will be a society in Ireland where there will be far less cash, an almost cashless society.  It seems to me that we are all very pragmatic about this Bill.  To a great many people it appears that in fact there is a breakdown, a very crucial breakdown in society, because hardly a day goes by when we do not hear of some major robbery of some large amount of cash.  People just shrug their shoulders and say &ldquo;There they go again.&rdquo;  It also appears that nothing is being done about it and certainly this Bill means that something has at last begun to be done about it.</P>
      <P>The remedy for that breakdown involved in such large scale robberies is available.  This Bill will make it more available.  It is also very cost-saving if people could understand how economical it would be.  Senator Cooney mentioned the fears he felt about the destination of a great deal of the money which was being robbed.  It has been estimated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will have the effect obviously of cutting down the number of robberies and that is a very desirable effect indeed.  When we consider that so many remedies are available to us for arriving at a situation where there is less cash around, it is amazing that we have not taken steps like this long ago and arrived at large scale translation of every kind of transaction into, for example, credit transfers and payments by cheque.  In France and Germany more than 90 per cent of <Col N="729" /> wages and salaries are paid by cheque or credit transfer and I think that figure also applies to Sweden.  I wonder have we got a figure for this country, as to what proportion of wages and salaries in Ireland are paid by cheque or by credit transfer.  I suspect that it is less than 50 per cent, possibly less than 25 per cent, but I do not know.  I am speaking on this Bill to try to convey to a Minister of the Government that there seems to me to be a great deal of alarm being felt by ordinary people about the lawlessness that exists in terms of robberies.  I welcome this Bill as a step towards dealing with that phenomenon as well as towards more effeciency for employers and employees alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a strange situation, I suppose, that we should be here on the verge of 1980 making it legal to pay wages by cheque particularly when one has regard to the virtual revolution in the method of payment throughout the world.  I refer to the now famous credit card system, or plastic money as it has come to be known.  There is a plethora of these credit cards and I suppose it is to a certain extent catching up on that revolution in the method of payments that a Bill like this comes before this House at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking through this Bill the key item in it, from my point of view, is the idea of consent, that is, making it necessary to have the consent of the employee and the consent of the employer before any alteration in method of payment is made. I know, from looking through the Minister's speech in the Dáil and hearing his speech today, that he is not anxious for, nor would I seek any element of compulsion in this area.  But, given the attraction of paying by cheque, I would ask the Minister to have a close look at the possibilities, ask his Department to examine closely some method of introducing incentive, some method of making it more attractive to reach this particular agreement, some incentive to encourage the changeover to a non-cash basis.  I am not clear in my mind at this stage as to what type of incentives one could introduce, what type of financial <Col N="730" /> or other incentive one could introduce, but I daresay that there are incentives, ways of encouraging employees and employers alike to make this necessary changeover because it is worth making. If the encouragement and the incentive are not given I would fear a little that many employees, particularly manual employees, would stay on the cash option. From their point of view it saves them from going to the bank; it saves them the extra chore of getting familiar with the bank manager; it saves another person along the chain knowing the exact amount of what they take home. What I am saying to the Minister and to the Department is that I think this Bill is excellent; it is a great Bill but it must be helped to work with a package of incentives to encourage this consent on which the whole Bill hangs.  It seems to me that, if we cannot get that consent, and get the two sides together to make the necessary changes, then the operation of the Bill will be in some danger.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Bill obliges written statements about deductions. This is very important.  Many companies I am aware of do this as a matter of course.  It is probably the rogue firms, to a certain extent, who do not do it.  I wonder also is there any way of policing this?  Is there any way of monitoring it? Could it be, for example, in some way linked with the taxation system?  It is a nice Bill but I am anxious to see that it is monitored or policed in some way.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, also, of what will be in most workers' minds.  It is not the huge moral or other question of whether they would like cash or a cheque.  I am afraid it will be something quite simple and quite straightforward: whether or not they can get out to the bank to cash the cheque.  I would encourage firms, as I am sure the Minister will, to organise easy access to cashing facilities for these cheques.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to mention because I am not clear whether or not there is operative legislation on it.  It seems to me that we have got to a stage where everybody has to be paid on a Friday, and everybody has to take home his <Col N="731" /> cash, or his cheque, or whatever it is, on that day.  I often wonder if some national effort could not be made in some way to stagger this on a firm basis, so that there would be fewer security targets and the whole operation could be streamlined.</P>
    <P>The point Senator Hillery made is a very valid one.  Payment by cheque will, indeed, bring workers into close touch, many for the first time, with financial institutions and financial advice generally and, hopefully, this would encourage saving.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make to the Minister is that a problem may emerge under this legislation.  There may be a lack of consistency within particular firms, with some employees opting to change over and other employees deciding to stay on the old system.  I wonder is there any way in which the Department can encourage some consistency. I see a danger that if it is messy from the employer's point of view, if he has got some employees saying: &ldquo;I want to change over&rdquo; and others saying: &ldquo;I do not want to change over&rdquo;, then it becomes an administrative headache for the particular employer.  Given that situation, some small employers are quite likely to withdraw the kind of consent that is needed to make this system work.  That would be a pity.  Is there any way in which the Department could examine the idea of trying to do this on a firm basis in some way?  I suppose what I am referring to is really the age-old idea of work place democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spear-headed much enlightened legislation in the other House and in this House, and I for one am glad that he has added this Bill to his list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Lanigan I have had experience in this field.  I do not think we need worry about some of the reservations that have been expressed by some Senators.  In one case in which it was put in, it was probably deleted because it was put in on an optional basis.  In other words, those who wished to be paid by cheque could be so paid, <Col N="732" /> and those who wished to be paid cash could be so paid.  After it was in operation for some time, it was so beneficial to the employee that everybody offered to join the system, even manual workers. There is more than just the advantage of security for employers in a system such as this.  As wages have increased, the physical job of bringing money from a bank, the physical job of distributing a large amount of money, and the physical job of recording it are so simplified by cheques that the benefit to the employer is considerable.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is in his interest to give an incentive to the employee to operate it.  Such incentives can cover the difficulty about the payment on Friday.  It has to be covered and has been covered without any difficulty whatever.  Also on the question of the four weeks' notice, in one particular case where it was introduced, the system was agreed with the trade union, and the first week it went into operation there was a bank strike.  I cannot say exactly how it was done, but those employees were paid by cheque during the whole of the bank strike and it worked to their disadvantage.</P>
      <P>One case has assisted in savings, because the banks were co-operative.  It is in their interest to get more accounts. A system was operated so that employees had two accounts, a savings account and a current account, and the employees were able to get interest on any money they did not use.  There are several gains in this Bill.  I welcome it.  I do not see the necessity for taking any more precautions than are in the Bill already.  They are sufficient.  We have to accept the practical situation that this is a tremendous gain to an employer if it operates.  He will see that it operates to the benefit of the employees, because he will want it to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on behalf of the business community, and particularly large firms.  As we know, the professional bodies such as the FUE and the ICTU have been pushing this for many years.  Indeed, I tried to get it as far as 25 years ago but the main <Col N="733" /> resistance was because of what Senator Brennan mentioned, the confidentiality of the wage packet.  The manual worker could give to the housewife as much as he thought fit and only one person knew what was in the wage packet.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Fintan Kennedy's welcome for the Bill.  I only hope its implementation will be smooth, because it would be regrettable if any unrealistic obstacles were put in the way of arriving at consensus.</P>
      <P>We cannot ignore security.  Everyone feels this.  There has been too much talk about bank robberies but, with the enormous inflation now, you have the muggings and the bag snatching, and obviously they are growing with the amount of money that is in circulation.  I hope all parties will agree to facilitate payment in other than cash in the various forms suggested under the Bill. As an evolutionary process, even an immediate basis of part cash part-cheque would be a development, particularly during periods of Christmas holidays and summer holidays where there is double or treble the amount of cash in circulation. Perhaps we could agree to pay in the second or third week in the form of cheque as a beginning.  I should like to see a maximum of £20 in cash and the rest in cheque form to facilitate both employee and employer.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the Bill regularises certain procedures that have been in operation and I wonder will this facilitate, for instance, the deduction of union dues which I know has been pressed for so many years.  I agree that the taxation system as it is now will obviously facilitate the documentation of the deductions.  We have an example of this in our own pay forms which we get through the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards bank strikes I would not be too worried.  We have carried on without the banks on many occasions, and it falls to the larger firms to take the place of the banks.  They will, obviously, facilitate many employees both of their own and other sections of the community in keeping cash in circulation.  I welcome the Bill and I look forward to <Col N="734" /> its rapid implementation as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few brief words to say.  From the trade union point of view, we are happy that the Minister has gone as far as possible in this situation.  We have no problems at all in regard to this Bill.  It regularises situations that are illegal at the moment.  Where people are being paid by cheque.  In our own tinpot way we negotiated our way through certain situations, maybe not in accordance with all the conditions laid down in the Truck Acts, but we did it in the interests of security.  Senator Lambert referred to large amounts of money lying around. Generally speaking, at the moment most people would be happy to be paid by cheque.  There were a lot of problems at the introduction of the system whereby certain payments were stopped at source through payment by cheque many workers felt that they were handing over their union connection or communication to the employer when they did not pay their union dues directly.  Generally that attitude is gone now and we are very happy that the Bill has been brought in to regularise the situation.  I thank the Minister again for accepting many of the views of the ICTU and the measures that are being taken.  We are quite happy with the Bill.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadoirí as ucht an fháilte a chuireadar roimh an mBille seo.  In thanking the Senators for their welcome of this Bill, I will make a few points in reply.  First of all, Senator Cooney referred to the security aspects of this Bill.  I say to him that, despite the broadening of my portfolio and the increase in my responsibilities in recent times, I am still not responsible for the portfolio of Justice and this is not a security Bill.  This Bill is an effort to facilitate employers, employees, employers' organisations and trade unions for the payment of wages by non-cash method.  It is a desirable step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is deliberately very flexible in its approach so that through the <Col N="735" /> recognised system of free collective bargaining that exists in this country we may see more and more advance and improvement in the payment of wages by cheque or other such methods.  Some Senators suggested that perhaps I should police and monitor.  This is not the approach either.  But I and all of us in this House should encourage as many people as possible to avail of the facilities now being afforded by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some speaker said in the other House that we cannot eliminate all the movement of cash, but if it does reduce the movement of cash and as a result reduces some of the targets of these robbers, then the Bill will obviously be a benefit in that respect as well.  Speaking in the other House, I condemned people who engage in that type of activity, but I said that this Bill was to remove anomalies that had resulted particularly from the passing of the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who welcomed the Bill.  It is very desirable in social legislation of this nature that the Minister for Labour sets out to achieve agreement between both sides of industry. He does not always get it, but on this occasion we worked out a formula for legislation that was acceptable to both sides of industry.  This was a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney asked some questions. I will try to reply to some of them. He asked what I meant when I referred to other items on a document.  I was saying that the document could form part of a broader agreement embracing other items such as productivity deals and so on.  That is the point I was making there. The bank strike provision was raised by Senator Cooney and others.  That is a contingency situation and I have full faith and confidence in the ability of the employers' and trade union organisations, the employers and employees, to meet a contingency situation if and when it arises.  We should not legislate for the more positive and normal activities of the industrial world.</P>
    <P>On the question of the individual opting out, an individual cannot opt out <Col N="736" /> of a union agreement freely entered into under the normal democratic rules of his union.  This is understandable in this or any other situation.  Any digression from that would not help in the industrial relations field.  Of course, he may exercise his rights in the case of absences from his normal place of work due to illness or for any other reason.</P>
    <P>The four weeks was referred to by a few speakers, I do not believe that four weeks is too long in this situation.  There must be some order.  If, for example, a particular system of payment is agreed on and is put into operation, anything less than that would create extreme difficulties and perhaps call for a change to a different system.  I have discussed it with both sides of industry who accepted entirely the four weeks and it would be undesirable that we should effect any change there.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey asked about figures of payment in this country as compared with others, but we do not have figures available.  In addition to encouraging and enabling people to do something positive for the future, we are also legalising some things that have happened in the past, as Senator Harte said.  Agreements have been entered into on behalf of non-manual workers and the passing of this legislation will give official recognition to and legalise the situation and we all agree that that is highly desirable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank all those who made contributions here for the welcome given to the Bill and I add my voice, and I hope that Senators will continue to add their voices, to encourage the change over to non-cash methods.  Basically the Bill is flexible legislation that enables employers and employees to go ahead with non-cash payment.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney and others raised the question of the cashing arrangements. Senator Brennan made the point about staggering the payment of wages and that quite a lot of wages are paid now on days other than Friday, perhaps not for the reasons he intended, but for people's convenience.  In regard to our banking institutions we seem to be well serviced in this country.  At this stage I do not intend <Col N="737" /> to go into a lot of detail but the statistics are that there is an associated bank office for every 2,800 persons. Therefore, we are much bettered serviced than on the European scene generally.  As Senators are aware, under section 3 of the Bill there are quite a number of options open on the non-cash method of payment.  I do not believe that that would be a cause of difficulty to any significant number of people.  The flexibility within the Bill protects those for whom difficulties may be created.  Being a person who represents a scattered constituency, both urban and rural, I realise that in some rural areas there may be some difficulties but I believe that today they they are not insurmountable.</P>
    <P>I thank the Seanad for welcoming the Bill and I would ask for all Stages today, if that is possible.</P>

      <P>On subsection (1) (a) (ii), clause (II), the effect of this question of the length of notice required to terminate the agreement has been raised by myself and supported by a very experienced trade unionist, Senator Kennedy.  He thought that four weeks in the contingency situation that we adverted to was too long.  The Minister says that he would rely on the good sense of employers and employees to deal with whatever contingency might arise.  He might well be right but equally he might well be wrong in that for some particular reason the good sense needed might be missing and it might not suit one of the parties to agree with the other to terminate the arrangements during the existence <Col N="738" /> of the contingency.  Consequently the party who would have to take unilateral action would be stuck with having to give four weeks' notice.  The Minister shares the objective of all of us here that this Bill would come into operation as quickly as possible and that its use be as widespread as possible.  To ensure that, we should remove from the Bill any factor which might cause people to have second thoughts or even first thoughts about it.  The Minister could look at this question of the length of notice under which a person can unilaterally determine the agreement. Would the Minister have any views on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concern with this point.  But, having discussed it with both sides of industry, realising and appreciating the need for that four weeks, there is the other outlet that would possibly satisfy the Senator if he is still concerned: there is nothing to prevent something being written into the agreement to provide for any contingency. I believe that for the normal operation of these procedures the four weeks is needed; not only is it desirable but it is needed.  If it is felt that there is a necessity in any such agreement being drawn up there is no reason why both parties could not write into that agreement some arrangements for contingencies such as have been mentioned by the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that both sides of industry do not like the Minister to encourage them, or to direct them, on what they might do. As I said earlier, I believe that both sides of industry are sufficiently responsible people to be able to control that situation if it arises.  I would say, however, that within that agreement there is adequate room, if necessary, for such a contingency <Col N="739" /> to be written in.  I suggest that the Senator might accept that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To get back to the original question of the rights of an individual or an employee to opt out when the agreement was originally entered into on his behalf by a trade union or a staff association, I made the point that his rights as an individual should entitle him to opt out if he, as an individual, wants to, notwithstanding that his colleagues want to continue their payments by cheque. I take the Minister's point that when an agreement is entered into by a trade union it should remain binding on all its members until all its members collectively decide to change it.  That is a good argument where conditions of work with regard to pay, or such matters are concerned and in order to have a certain order about proceedings.  But in a case like this, where a person's wages are concerned and their method of payment, I suggest to the Minister that that argument does not apply to the problem I am relating.  Again, the person in question might be a member of a staff association; it might not be a trade union situation. It could be a staff association.  The ease with which a person could opt out of the obligations entered into in that way would be considerably easier than if it was a trade union situation.  I would feel very strongly that an individual should be entitled to opt out and have his wages paid to him in cash though his trade union has agreed that all its members would be paid by cheque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to my last point, said the agreement could provide for this.  I suggest to him that he might urge on staff associations and trade unions that the agreement should give individual members the right to opt out.  There is a certain amount of contradiction, when we are urging the universal application of this Bill, to make provision for somebody to opt out.  Nevertheless, there <Col N="740" /> could be situations, for compelling personal reasons, where an individual might seriously want to opt out.  I think his freedom as a person demands that he should have that right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I cannot accept the Senator's line of argument at all.  I believe that this Bill in its entirety, and section 3 specifically, are very flexible.  In other words, we have a document where the individual has complete freedom to opt out if he so wishes. We have the agreement which is an employer-trade union agreement.  I do not think it would be in the good interests of work place practice.  If that is a democratic decision taken by that specific trade union negotiating on behalf of that group of workers to agree to a particular method of payment, I do not think it is desirable that an individual member may have the freedom to opt out of that agreement.  Also he has the opportunity&mdash;if for any reason he is ill or not at his place of work&mdash;of waiving that freedom, because circumstances may change.  It would be highly undesirable that I should facilitate such opting out.  I feel it could only cause problems rather than help the situation.</P>
      <P>Of course there is the other aspect of it as well, that if an employer, his organisation and a trade union have agreed on a particular method of payment then that method should be the one accepted until such time as there is a new agreement made or there is a change in the circumstances for all.  I do not believe that giving that option to the individual in the trade union situation and in the agreement situation as distinct from the document would in any way help but that it would damage the situation rather than improve it.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very flexible.  It is an encouraging and enabling piece of legislation that has been discussed in great detail with both sides of industry and accepted by them.  An amendment of the kind proposed would certainly not help in any way but could be source of irritation and possibly of disruption in a work place and we have enough disruption already on that front.</P>

      <P>This gets back to one of the malaises of modern society.  The individual does not count any longer.  The trade unions have to be listened to and the employers' association have to be listened to.  To justify his stance here, the Minister puts forward a very rigid doctrinaire sort of argument, an argument that nearly made <i>in terrorem</i> of trade union power.  The Minister says it would cause problems if we were to gring in what I am suggesting.  What problem would it cause if there was provision in an agreement to enable an individual have his weekly money paid to him by way of cash even though his colleagues want to be paid by cheque?  The basis of this whole idea is that it is voluntary, that there is no legal compulsion on people to accept payment by cheque but here we have a provision that in effect is going to make it compulsory on someone to accept payments by cheque even though he may not want to, even though it might seriously inconvenience him or seriously prejudice him.  The Minister is disregarding the individual for the sake of a pointless conformity in this area.</P>

      <P>I am not taking either side on this point but the banks have got to send their officials in to sell the idea to any trade union or organised body.  The bank officials will be messed around until such time as the workers get what they want out of the transaction.  In the democratic process when you argue along these lines, when you have got all the conditions you want, it then goes to a vote of whether the majority agree or disagree.  If there is disagreement, the acceptance of being paid by cheque is not on.  There are situations where the employer has agreed to pay all the cash payments for the cheque transactions during a period of four or five years.  By and large, agreement is never reached in matters of this kind before there is a good deal of argument, usually extending over a six-month period.  I used recommend to the people I represented that they be awkward until such time as they got what they wanted but when people get what they wanted and when <Col N="742" /> they have gone through the democratic process of a vote there is an obligation on them as well as a right and they are bound by the majority decision the same as they are bound in a normal trade union transaction agreed between the employer and trade union through the negotiating machinery.  We as a trade union people have the means at our disposal for dealing with this situation.</P>

      <P>There are two other points I would make to the Senator.  This section was discussed in more detail with both sides of industry than was any other section in the Bill. The document and the agreement were discussed in very close and very great detail and I am satisfied that the suggestion as made by Senator Cooney would not be helpful.  Senator Cooney said that I was adopting a doctrinaire line.  That is not true.  The point I was going to make to him, and which has been made already by Senator Harte, was that I was supporting the democratic decision of a group of people.</P>
      <P>But the Senator must also appreciate the employers' situation in a scene like that&mdash;that if what he is proposing were freely available it could mean, to carry it to its logical conclusion, that the employer might have to contend with a number of different methods of payment in respect of different groups of people. Consequently, I do not see any merit in the argument put forward particularly in view of the fact that on the document side there is freedom and that on the group side or on the trade union agreement side the same freedom does not exist but for very understandable reasons. One has to reach a decision, taken by a majority of members, as to whether payment by cheque is acceptable until such time as that agreement expires I would ask Senator Cooney not to press his point of view on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cooney's suggestion would be creating a very dangerous precedent because all matters relating to working conditions are negotiated between the employers and the unions.  If we bring in this exception in this case we <Col N="743" /> will create a precedent whereby in any working condition one employee could stand out against what is agreed, in which case there would be chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that point that in most trade union situations an agreement is entered into and that if there is to be order it has to be binding on everybody, but we can differentiate between the subject matter of the agreement. The argument put forward by Senator Jago is valid where the subject of the agreement is the rates of wages, or the division of work, or the hours of work, and where, therefore, what is agreed for all will be binding on all equally because if an individual were to be allowed opt out of that situation obviously you would have a chaotic situation very quickly.  There would have to be uniformity there, but we can differentiate that situation from the one proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>What I am seeking is to allow a person to opt out and effect nobody but himself.  If he decides to take his wages by cash instead of by cheque he is not upsetting the whole <i>modus operandi</i> in the factory.  Lines of production are not going to be interfered with.  He may cause certain administrative difficulty to his employer in so far as he will have to be paid in cash and the others paid by cheque.  I do not think that is a high price to pay for allowing him have this freedom.  I do not think it is a good argument to say that it would be inconvenient for the employer, that if we let this exception come in, substantial numbers might seek payment one way and substantial numbers payment another way, because it is envisaged in the Bill that where agreement is made on an individual basis each individual will make his own arrangement.  In a factory of 500 employees where the arrangements are done on an individual basis and not through the trade unions there could be any number of arrangements.  I am seriously outnumbered but I still have to make the point in favour of the individual in this humble situation.</P>

      <P>I attach the greatest importance to the work of the Employment Equality Agency who are entrusted with the task of helping to achieve basic employment rights for one-third of all workers in this country.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear at the outset that the Government are fully behind the agency in their work.  In fact, the record of my own Government in relation to the achievement of equality speaks for itself.  I want to remind the Senators that it was under a Fianna Fáil administration that the Commission on the Status of Women was established and that it was under Fianna Fáil Governments that the implementation of many of that commission's recommendations was effected or set in train.  That the Coalition were not wholeheartedly committed to the principle of equal treatment for men and women workers is proved by the manner in which they attempted to delay the introduction of equal pay in the public sector.  I can assure you of the full commitment of this Government to the achievement of equality, and not just in the field of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> The important role of women in our society is evident: 28 per cent of all women over 15 years are in the labour force and that figure is increasing; 27 per cent of the total labour force are women; and 33 per cent of all employees, that is excluding the self-employed, are women.</P>
    <P>Their contribution will become even greater as their participation in all areas of economic activity increases.  Already there is one female employee to every two male employees; from a purely economic point of view, apart from any question of personal rights, we cannot tolerate a situation where the development of the skill and talent of half of the population is neglected.</P>
    <P>It is unhappily true that, due to the traditional attitudes to work, training and education, women are still effectively, if not legally, barred from a range of jobs, even in sectors where there is a shortage of workers to fill existing vacancies.  It takes time to change attitudes. We cannot expect in a few years to change the face of society.  We must encourage that change.  We all have a role to play in that.  We can take the essential steps which will lead ultimately to the goal we seek: society does not change fundamental attitudes overnight.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made and there is evidence that the situation as regards employment for women is improving.  As regards training, a total of 4,418 women were trained by AnCO in 1978, an increase of 64 per cent on 1977.  The proportion of women trainees rose from the level of 5 per cent in 1974 to 30 per cent in 1978.  Over 15 per cent completed courses in traditional male skills.</P>
    <P>AnCO plan to increase the number of places available in their training courses to 3,260 by 1983.  I hope to see many more girls availing themselves of the better opportunities for training which will result from the expanding facilities being provided by AnCO.</P>
    <P>CERT, too, are making a valuable contribution in the promotion of the employment of women workers.  All their training courses are open to both men and women and more women are being encouraged to become managers.  Hitherto <Col N="749" /> only about one-third of the managerial positions have been held by women.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department are aware of the important role they have to play in the employment of women in areas which have traditionally been considered as totally male preserves.  Employers are made aware in the first instance of the rights of women under the 1977 Employment Equality Act.  Women who register with the service are advised of the opportunities available to them outside the traditionally female employment areas. They are encouraged to broaden their horizons in their search for suitable employment. It is of interest to note here that over 6,000 young people participated in the work experience programme since it was introduced in September, 1978, and about two-thirds of that number were girls.</P>
    <P>Apart from progress in the areas of training and placement, two Acts are on the Statute Book which give women a right to redress where there is discrimination in relation to pay, access to employment training and promotion. Under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 almost 300 equal pay cases have been referred to the equality officers of the Labour Court.  A further 30 cases of alleged discrimination in conditions of employment have been referred to the Labour Court under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  To date, the Acts have benefited many thousands of women workers.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Acts is being monitored by the Employment Equality Agency from whom I have just received a report with recommendations for the amendment of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.  I am having these amendments studied at the present time.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me, however, to suppose that the enactment of legislation outlawing inequality in regard to pay and conditions of employment could be relied on to eliminate all discrimination in employment.  Traditional attitudes towards women and work have tended to condone discrimination.  Changes in these traditional attitudes will involve a <Col N="750" /> long-term educational process to which legislation can only be a contributory stimulus.</P>
    <P>That attitudes are beginning to change is beyond doubt.  Women are now beginning to enter occupations which were traditionally held by men.  A striking example is the relatively large number of female applicants&mdash;30 out of 170 applications&mdash;for a trainee fisherman's course, an occupation which in all countries up to now had been a male bastion. This I believe is a desirable move.  It is encouraging to see that in this area of activity there will be a worthwhile percentage, and this is an indication of the progress that is being made.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I attach the greatest importance to the task given to the Employment Equality Agency under the legislation.  The most important task to be tackled now is that of changing attitudes to employment so that women can in future enjoy equal opportunities with men.  The annual report of the agency records the dedication and success with which they have approached the difficult responsibilities imposed on them under the 1974 and 1977 Acts, namely:</P>
    <P>To work towards the elimination of discrimination as between men and women in employment and to promote equality of opportunity between men and women in relation to employment generally.</P>
    <P>The research role of the agency is of considerable importance.  They have commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to study institutionalised sex differences in subject choices and examination performance in Ireland's Post-Primary Schools.  This project is costing £114,000 over a period of four years.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the study is to find out to what extent inequality in the employment and career opportunities open to boys and girls might be caused by the curricular choices available in post-primary schools.  I believe that this study should provide us with concrete evidence of how to remove certain inequalities in the matter of preparation for the world <Col N="751" /> of work.  In this respect girls are placed at a disadvantage in competing on an equal footing for employment when they leave school.  I believe this study can be of tremendous help in that respect.</P>
    <P>The agency have applied for a substantial increase in their grant for 1980 and the Government will, of course, consider the application as favourably as possible, having regard to the many demands from Government Departments and other agencies on Exchequer resources in the present economic climate.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Members of the House must realise there are, of course, many calls, many demands on Governments, from Departments and all agencies.  The Government will consider the applications as favourably as possible. That is what I would say in respect of any agency or any Government Department when asked about it prior to Estimate time.  If the Senator wishes to comment on my phrasing or my method of speaking, I do not know how she could refer to it as being complacent or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I take Senator Robinson's point.  She has given me the courtesy of staying in the House.  I take her reference to &ldquo;fixed costs&rdquo; to mean administration expenses such as salaries and rents.  Normal incremental increases and increases under national pay agreements mean that the salaries paid in 1979 are higher than in previous years.  Rents have been increased. Senator Robinson is therefore correct in saying that fixed costs are higher as a percentage of total expenditure in 1979.</P>
      <P>As regards separate accommodation for the agency, I would support the agency's contention that it is desirable that they should be housed elsewhere than in Davitt House, the headquarters of the Department of Labour.  A balance has to be struck here as to when it is achievable.  The same applies to the Labour Court who have had that desire for years and it is only now being accomplished. I accept and support the contention that it is desirable that the agency should be housed elsewhere than in Davitt House.</P>

The Government have spared no effort to reduce unemployment <Col N="753" /> levels, and significant progress has been recorded.  In the strict sense, however, &ldquo;full employment&rdquo;, however defined, is not a prerequisite for equality of opportunity.  First, even with a limited number of job opportunities, these opportunities through positive action could be made equally open to boys and girls.  Second, even with full employment and abundant employment openings, discrimination could lead to a situation where a very narrow range of occupations would be open to women.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, an overall shortage of employment opportunities is likely to have severe adverse consequences for marginal groups in the labour force, and particularly for new entrants.  Married women returning to work after a period of child-rearing fall into this group.  I am therefore generally in agreement with Senator Hillery in that full employment, and rapidly growing employment, provide more opportunities for such women.</P>
    <P>A point made by both Senator Robinson and Senator Hillery is that the court is not the most appropriate body to deal with equality claims.  This is also an opinion held by the agency as is clear from their submission to the Commission on Industrial Relations.  I listened with great interest to the points of view put forward by both Senators.  As of now, I have an open mind on this subject. I would not at this stage like to come down on one side or the other.  It is a question which I would expect to be dealt with by the commission and which will therefore be considered in due course.  However, the role given to the Labour Court by the 1974 and 1977 Acts corresponds to the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the question of adequate staffing of equality officers and delays in hearing cases, including her own case.  As regards the equality officers, the numbers and grades of equality officers are kept under review in the light of changing work-loads.  I am, however, at the moment arranging for the introduction of an improved organisation <Col N="754" /> structure for equality officers and for an increase in their numbers from three to five.</P>
    <P>As regards delays, it is important to note that the vast majority of claims are settled by direct negotiation between employers and employees.  The hearing of actual disputes, however, takes time. Equality officers cannot get the investigations under way until they have job descriptions, details of disputes and, where possible, submissions with supporting arguments from both sides.  The vast majority of cases are investigated quickly when the necessary documentation is available.</P>
    <P>Senators might like to know that at 30 November there were 84 cases in hands, falling into the following categories:</P>

    <P>Senator Kennedy pointed to the scarcity of resources and to the fact that the Department of Labour also needed staff to do their work adequately.  I agree fully with the Senator that the Department have many important tasks in hands which require adequate staffing, but I might point out that since I became Minister in July 1977 the number of staff in the Department has been increased by 42 per cent, underlining the great deal of new work which has been undertaken in the various areas which are the Department's responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning, and I will repeat, that this Government support the agency's efforts, and I want to take this opportunity to compliment the agency members and staff on what has been achieved to date.  I also want to wish them well in their work in the coming year and in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Employment Equality <Col N="755" /> Agency on this historic first report and also to congratulate Senator Robinson on putting down this motion and allowing us to debate it.  I consider it is an historic report.  It is also a very hard-hitting report which is unlike a lot of official documents of this kind.  This is, perhaps, due to the fact that the previous Minister in the last Government who appointed the chairperson and staff of this agency was courageous.  Perhaps there were circumstances enabling him to be courageous at that time but the chairperson of the agency is an unusually committed woman and is surrounded by an extremely efficient and committed staff. They have not been daunted by the magnitude of the job which faced them.</P>
      <P>I consider that the establishment of that agency and the issuing of their first report in fact represent a milestone in the social evolution of this country.  Having said that, I consider that it is a pity we have to have such an agency at all.  It is necessary because the injustices against women have been so extraordinarily marked and so enormous over the years that it required a separate body like this to begin to tackle them.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's speech which we have just heard.  I agree totally with Senator Robinson who thought it extremely complacent.  It did not indicate to me any commitment to undo the wrongs which the agency feel and state are stopping their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of the establishment of the agency and the kind of work they are doing for Irish society both economically and socially are enormous. If you create, as this agency sets out to do, decent conditions of work for women and decent wages for women then you will obviously create a desire to work. You will obviously attract more women into the work force.  More and more women have been going into the work force in the last few years because of two major developments in Ireland and in other countries&mdash;the education of women and the possibility now for women to control their fertility.  These have been two major factors in encouraging <Col N="756" /> women to take up occupations outside the traditional occupation which they have always had.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not&mdash;and I know very well that the Minister and most male politicians do not like it&mdash;the agency's work will be responsible for attracting more and more married women back into the work force.  That trend has been visible over the last 15 years and will very soon double and treble if the agency are allowed to do their work properly.</P>
    <P>In 1966, the number of married women gainfully occupied was just over 25,500.  In 1977, that number was 84,500.  In 1966, it was 25,000; 1971, 39,000 and it went up to the staggering figure, in 1977, of 84,500.  As a percentage of the work force, married women in 1966 were 2.3 per cent and in 1977, 7.5 per cent.  This is a trend which will continue very rapidly.  No matter what they say, this strikes fear into politicians' hearts because it has such enormous implications for our unemployment statistics.  That, however, is a very negative way of looking at it.  Women now are educated, able, active people who have an enormous contribution to make to lowering Ireland's dependency rate which is the highest in Europe&mdash;certainly the highest in the EEC&mdash;and have the opportunity to make a great difference to the economic future of this country.  Politicians should not be so negative in the way they view the emergence of a new and active work force.  In the future, women with the equal educational opportunities which they are now beginning to achieve will have career and family ambitions very like men.  They will have a small family. They will, perhaps, work part-time, or not at all, while they are having their children and for a few years thereafter. They will then return to work and continue a work pattern and a life pattern, as their husbands do.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency's job is to make sure that women can have this normal work life on equal terms and that the work life for a woman is no longer confined, as it manifestly is now, <Col N="757" /> to low paid, single sex work.  One vital sphere in the progress of women to this stage will be maternity leave.  We have legislation which purports to create equal opportunities for women, but without maternity leave and paternity leave, which leaves a great deal to be desired.  A backlash frequently happens among women who become very worried when they hear us all talking about married women working.  In that hostility towards the concept it is very important to distinguish between two kinds of work in the home; one is the work of mothers and fathers of young dependent children and the second area of work in the home is simply that of providing a service for other adults&mdash;be it grown-up children, or husbands, or brothers, or whatever&mdash;the service of housekeeping.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that you divide the two&mdash;housekeeping in one area and the care and rearing of young children in the other.  It is extremely important that we realise the difference between these two roles and improve the legal and financial status of the person who stays in the home doing the very important work&mdash;and it is work&mdash;of caring for and rearing young children.  Decent conditions must be created, and that work seen to be very important, a point which in Irish society has very much neglected.  The Employment Equality Agency's work, on the other hand, is to make sure that woman's whole life will not be modelled on the few years she will spend in her home doing that work.  The primary reason for the establishment of the agency was because women are regarded as people with very limited aspirations, except for that very important work in the home.</P>
    <P>When we consider the report it is impossible to ignore the effect on political life of women's narrow role and their exclusion from it.  In this House it is quite obvious, and even more so in the other Houee, that women have been outside the political area.  Our single sex legislators have failed women over the years, helped by the absence of women from the Dáil and Seanad.  They failed <Col N="758" /> women, both in the work force and in the home.  This legislation and the establishment of this agency have been due to the emergence, in the past ten years, of a reflective and an angry women's movement, not confined to this country but international. Nobody can make any claims to the contrary.</P>
    <P>If this social evolution is to continue to the benefit of society with no conflict between the important role in the home and outside the home, we must put the report into perspective.  If the agency are hampered by an appalling lack of facilities and money it is no good whatsoever for the Minister to say that he and his Government are totally committed to the abolition of discrimination against women.  Desperate situations require desperate remedies and the agency, in their report, list some of the problems facing them, because of the imposed budgetary constraints.  They list the inability to acquire separate premises which makes their separate identity impossible to achieve.  They were unable to commission absolutely necessary research; they are understaffed and could not fill staff vacancies.  Given those drawbacks it is quite remarkable that they have managed to do the amount of work they have done.</P>
    <P>The most recent report to hand is on their formal investigation under section 39 of the Employment Equality Act, into the recruitment policy of bus conductors in CIE.  Following that formal investigation, as we all know, CIE had to change their recruitment policies and we now have the beginning of the recruitment of female bus conductors.  In a comment which comes with this report on CIE, the chairperson of the agency says that employers in the State section must be seen to set an example for private employers by eliminating the sex of job seekers as a factor in recruitment policy.  This report on CIE is a major document which should be studied by all public companies; it has far-reaching implications. That the Employment Equality Agency are able to undertake that kind of work is a remarkable tribute to them considering the disabilities under which they labour.</P>

      <P>I shall not need the two minutes.  I shall conclude by referring to the motion which is before us: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the First Annual Report of the Employment Equality Agency.&rdquo;  The motion mentions, in particular, the limitations which have been put on the agency by their insufficient Exchequer grant.  The Minister's statement here has been totally inadequate and I am very disappointed with it. Senators should make a very strong point of showing the Government that the Seanad, as a whole, feels that this area of discrimination must be tackled and tackled properly.</P>

      <P>I do not in the least doubt the Minister's sincerity and that he is genuinely concerned with the Employment Equality Act, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, and the functions of the Employment Equality Agency, but it does not begin and end there.  I know the intention is there but, apart from the problems which we may have in the New Year, there is no money and there will be cutbacks all around in 1980.  There is nothing on the horizon to show that money will be forthcoming for the important work of this agency.  The Minister is sincere enough but what makes this matter more disturbing is the fact that the equal pay legislation was not introduced by us at all, it was imposed on us arising out of our membership of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a trade unionist I know there are many people who are sincere about this but we cannot say that there has been a very definite change in attitude towards women in our society.  All we can say is that we have been artifically drawn into a hurried situation whereby the Employment Equality Act, 1971, became the means of enshrining the principles of equality and the establishing of the Employment Equality Agency.  The agency, sincere though it may be, have expressed in their report that they are being hampered in their work by lack of sufficient <Col N="760" /> funds.  There is no evidence to show that the funds will be available for research, education through seminars and publicity in the next budget.  Representations were made to the Minister by the agency about the inadequacy of the grants but the Minister could not help them even though he wants to do so.  He believes in the principle but is not in a position to come forward with the funds. The pressure will have to be kept up by the trade union movement at the highest level and by all the interested bodies to make sure that the money needed is made available.  I do not know where it will come from.  I am afraid that in the New Year some kind of indirect taxation will be introduced.  I am not in favour of that but if that has to be, some of that money should be channelled into this area.</P>
    <P>Those involved in the agency are running up against all sorts of difficulties and this motion was put down to highlight some of them.  One of the functions of the agency was to keep the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act and the Employment Equality Act under review. The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act needs a lot of attention and research.  If one looks back to 1970 one will see that females, on an hourly basis, were earning 56 per cent of the male rate and, on a weekly basis, were earning 47 per cent of the male rate.  In 1975 it was 61 per cent of the male hourly rate&mdash;a sort of improvement&mdash;and 53 per cent of the male weekly rate.  Those improvements did not come about by virtue of the Acts I mentioned or the Employment Equality Agency but as a result of national wage agreements.  In fairness to the Employment Equality Agency, there was an improvement after it was established and in 1978 the female hourly rate rose to 64 per cent, and the weekly rate to 55 per cent of the male weekly rate.  There has been good work in this area by the agency.  What I have said could also be interpreted as indicating a slowing down rather than a movement forward.  It is anybody's argument as to whether it is a gain or a slowing down compared with the 1970-1975 period when we had a gain through national wage agreements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> The agency is keeping the matter under review but we are experiencing all sorts of difficulties.  For example, the average basic male rates have increased by 48 per cent through national wage agreements.  While national wage agreements were responsible for those improvements the Acts dealing with equal pay had little effect.  It is possible that the reason why the Acts are not having any effect is that the agency does not have the funds to employ more equality officers. The Minister has told us of the number of extra posts that have been created but the whole question of seminars, education and the work that has to be done to change attitudes cannot be realised unless the agency gets more money.  To give effect to its functions it must have a lot more money.  It must be remembered that 85 per cent of what the agency gets goes on salaries. The work of the agency is very far-reaching. It must get over attitudes of fellow worker against fellow worker and of employers who are not prepared to bring forward any positive policies in any direction.  Some employers are not prepared to look at redundancy agreements and settle female claims the same way they would settle male claims.  Some are not prepared to look at employment opportunities for females in the same way as they are for males.  The agency look for creches, pursue maternity leave claims and are involved in the whole question of the co-operation of the trade unions, AnCO, the National Manpower Agency and the IDA.  To work within that whole complex area and try to change attitudes is not easy.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to create employment in circumstances in which the concept one is talking about cannot be realised.  This is a total reforming campaign to redress inequalities not only in wages, salaries and working conditions but problems of discrimination in social welfare, and where universal equal benefits for equal contributions in social welfare are concerned. It also involves the questions of measures of leisure, the allocation of resources and the question of average earnings.  The agency must create a climate where people will start to work in <Col N="762" /> this direction and get the independence to employ the extra people they need to deal with those complex problems so that they can put employers and trade unions in the happy position of being able to negotiate.  Instead of this we have the situation at present where women are told that jobs must first be given to men. This is the way that women are treated at the moment.  This is the kind of obstacle people are trying to overcome. Where you are dealing with males, for example, in the redundancy situation it is definitely first in, last out.  Other things are argued then, the question of qualification, re-training and so on, but in the case of women, very often men involved in the redundancy situation get the benefit of the doubt and the women are made redundant.  It may be that they have not sufficient muscle to put forward their case or that the appropriate organisations do not come forward to help them.  Therefore they have to suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>If the Employment Equality Agency are to give effect to the principles enshrined in the Act, the agency must be given the money to do the job.  If we are going to talk about increasing production, having better industrial relations and so on&mdash;we will have a long debate on that matter soon&mdash;the climate must exist to help create good industrial relations. Women are not just going to sit back any longer; they have been very active and have been successful in many ways.  Now we have the legislation and it is the job of this House and the other House to ensure that it is implemented.</P>
    <P>It is not an easy thing to say we are going to investigate the extent of discrimination against women in Ireland.  It is not an easy thing to set out our approach to education, training, employment opportunities, the family as a whole and the family on social security. By and large all areas of life are going to be involved in those particular Acts.  This agency are charged with making sure that the principles enshrined overall are implemented.  If the agency do not get the money, that will be the end of their activity to a great extent and it might throw us back a number of years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> I will conclude by reminding the Seanad of what the agency actually undertook to do in the first year.  In their press release the agency said they launched and completed their first formal investigation under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, with regard to Aer Lingus.  The agency undertook a review of the protective legislation banning women from working at night in industry and recommended repeal to the Minister for Labour.  The agency investigated certain employment regulation orders that set minimum wage rates for the clothing industry and forced the removal of discriminatory weight-lifting clauses.  The agency monitored and largely eliminated discriminatory job advertising in the national and provincial newspapers.  They corresponded with and assisted many individuals on problems with regard to equal pay in employment. The agency conducted a publicity campaign and held their first major seminar on the theme &ldquo;Women's Place in the Irish Economy, Present and Future&rdquo;.  The agency embarked on other initiatives in the area of employment equality which were referred to in greater detail in the report.  Yet at the end of all that, it was unfortunate the agency had to say, &ldquo;the agency felt constrained in its activities in the period under review by the limitations imposed upon it by the insufficient Exchequer grant under which it operated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When the agency made strong representations to the Minister, he had nothing to give them.  I know from a statement here tonight that the Minister means to see that the agency will have the means by which they can progress.  I know that he is sincere about it, I have said that three times.  The money is the important thing.  The agency looked into many problems.  From the introduction of the Act until the end of 1978, the equality officers issued 68 recommendations on equal pay.  These recommendations involved less than 2,500 female workers, which is a small number.  In the case of 65 claims, females achieved equal pay.  The figures are less than impressive <Col N="764" /> and I agree with that.  This is taken from a statement issued by Congress. In all cases involving over 20 workers, only about half the claimants had a favourable recommendation.  In other words, about half of the recommendations issued up to the 31 December 1978 actually had to be appealed and the vast majority were appealed by the employers rather than by the workers.  The court upheld most of the recommendations, 69 per cent, and in only one case the equality officer's recommendations was rejected or amended by the court.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of the appointment of equality officers. Much more is needed in this particular area.  No matter what anyone says, if the money is not forthcoming to provide the facilities for this agency, then we cannot look forward with any degree of hope to the type of industrial relations that we should be envisaging for 1980.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief because I think the case has been more than adequately made for the motion. However, I do not want my silence to be construed as indifference.  The very worst thing that could happen to the women's movement in general, the movement for women's equality, is that it should be left exclusively in the hands of women.  In a society heavily dominated by male influences, there is an inertia about the women's movement, a passivity, a disinterest.  That will not be finally overcome until men go on the record in support of the claim for women's equality.  That is why I was glad to hear Senator Harte speaking very convincingly in adding his voice to the eloquent case made by Senators Hussey and Robinson.  I want to express my warm support for the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who spoke to this motion. Without exception they spoke in support of the important work done by the Employment Equality Agency and the need for adequate funding and other support for the agency.  I would also like to thank the Minister who was present when the <Col N="765" /> debate began and who contributed to the discussion this evening.  I felt it necessary to interject that I found his remarks very complacent.  If he re-reads them on the record he will see that they did, in fact, sound unreal and remarkably complacent for the very substantial problem that we have as a country and the Employment Equality Agency have in seeking to achieve equality of the sexes.  I felt at the time, and it is borne out by what has happened, that the Minister might disappear and that the only way in which I could convey my remarks to him was by stopping him in his stride and describing his contribution as complacent. He was annoyed at my interjection and the Chair reprimanded me but, in fact, at a certain point, you have to say to somebody, &ldquo;Look at the reality of the situation.  Look at the reality as my colleague Senator Harte described it. Look at the reality as Senator Hussey would speak about it.  Identify with the real needs of the situation.  Do not just fall back on all that Fianna Fáil have done, all that this present Government have done.&rdquo;  Can we not have the honesty at times to face up to the real needs of the situation and realise that, even though we have quite good and adequate legislation&mdash;some of it at least dictated by our membership of the European Community&mdash;we have totally failed to ensure the implementation of that legislation as a reality for women workers in this country.  Until we do make a reality of equality in the work place all other attempts to achieve equality are not really going to bring about a mature integration of women, with their enormous potential, into the economic and social life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the fact, and I quote him, &ldquo;that it takes time to change attitudes&rdquo;.  But attitudes do not change automatically on their own.  The whole purpose of this debate was to draw attention to an agency which has the legislative powers and the legislative functions and the legislative responsibility to change attitudes, but which says of itself that is is underfunded to the job that it was set up to do.  It says in its report that it cannot discharge its <Col N="766" /> responsibilities, that it cannot carry out its functions because it has not got enough money to do it.  The way in which we change attitudes by bringing in legislation in this area.  We bring in legislation guaranteeing equal pay, guaranteeing equality of employment and no discrimination on the basis of sex or marriage.  Secondly, in order to make a reality of that we have to enforce it. We have to carry out research.  We have to ensure that any discrimination that exists is removed on an individual basis if somebody appeals against discrimination or on an overall basis by having surveys of particular sectors of industry, whether in the public sector or in private industry.  We have to have the kind of educational role which the agency is beginning to discharge in examining curriculum developments which condition girls and boys in their own perception of the role they can play in society. There are so many other areas where work must be done.</P>
    <P>I was not satisfied or encouraged by the Minister's response to the points that have been made by me, by Senators Kennedy and Hillery, on the last occasion when this motion was being debated, about the need for further funding for the agency.  He said that he would view the matter sympathetically but that they had to balance it against other considerations.  I think what we were all waiting for was some sense that the Minister had the same kind of perception of the work of the agency; that it was not just a question of giving them an additional amount for 1980 which kept pace with the rising cost of living, but a new perception of the role and importance and significance of the work of the agency.  That seemed to be lacking from his speech.  I hope that this will not be lacking when it comes to the hard decisions on budgetary policy and on the budget which would be appropriate for the agency next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also rather vague and insubstantial in his comments on specific questions that were raised.  He is not here at the moment to respond, and I can only put those questions again.  He <Col N="767" /> did not make any specific response to the point that was made about the need for specialist staff for the agency and I would like to make this point again.  The Northern Ireland Equal Opportunities Commission have advertised for an enforcement officer.  It seems from the advertisement that they are looking for somebody who would have a specialist legal training and be able to discharge a particular responsibility as an enforcement officer.  Now this seems to be the kind of specialist staff which the agency would require to carry out the important functions in the area of monitoring and enforcing the provisions, both of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  Some sense that the Minister appreciated the need for this legal expertise, whether on a permanent basis as extra staff for the agency or at least to allow the agency to contract out specialist legal work, to pay for the legal research, for the legal enforcement work on a part-time basis at least, would have been appreciated.</P>
    <P>I believe that the most important area where the agency has a greater potential role to play is in the need for greater capacity for research and education and to make the work of the agency better known through the media.  Here again the Minister did not make any specific reference to the points that had been raised about the need for a greater budget for the agency to publicise its work and a greater need for an improvement in resources for research and development.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey, understandably, shared with me a certain frustration at the complacency of the Minister's contribution and tried to urge the importance of the value of securing a commitment to education for equality because we are a country which does not have an identifiable ideology of equality.  You can see that in other countries where, because of the inner process of the country, there is a sense of the importance of promoting the achievement of equality between the sexes, equality in the work <Col N="768" /> place, equality under the law, equality in the home because of a different perception, of the responsibilities in the home. This comes from within that country as a strong force.  We have not had that in this country for various reasons to do with our own background, our own cultural evolution.  We have other strengths but this is not one of them. Therefore, it is all the more important that when we establish legislation and give an agency functions and powers, we understand that that agency has a more significant role to play than it would have to play in a country where there was a strong ideology of equality; has more work to do in trying to cope with the attitudes and with the complexity of the problem and with the conditioning in a society where there is high unemployment, where we have a very young population looking for work and the need to promote the values of equality itself and of the potential contribution of women in society.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey made references to areas which are particularly important and in which the agency could have an important role to play: legislation for maternity and paternity leave, where Ireland is lagging behind other European Community countries and the necessity of distinguishing, in relation to work in the home, between the important role of caring for the upbringing and welfare of young children and the quite different responsibilities, what should be at all times shared responsibilities between the spouses, of the actual running of the house.  Once again, in almost all approaches to equality, although there may be more access to jobs and more possibility for married women to work, they still carry most of the burden of housekeeping in the home, they still carry most of the responsibility for running the home and for all the chores and planning.  I believe that the agency has a very important role to play in pointing out the greater need for balance between the sexes at home as well as in the work place.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the contribution by my colleague, Senator Harte, <Col N="769" /> because he spoke as somebody with a knowledge on the ground as a trade union official of the kind of barriers that there are, of the conditioning that exists. For example, he spoke with great insight and knowledge about the problem in relation to redundancies, that when you have redundancies in a sector where there are male employees, then there is no problem.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are clear, the priorities are clear.  It is a question of first in last out.  It is as simple as that.  But if you have redundancies in a work place where there is a mixture of male and female employees, then there is great pressure: it is less important that the women are working; their whole role is more frivolous in relation to work; they really should be at home looking after the children, I certainly heard this from a number of married women who are working for the support, sometimes for the entire support of their family.  In a redundancy situation they are the ones that are most vulnerable and most likely to be jettisoned.  It is this kind of attitude that we most need to cope with.  It is this kind of area that we need to have close monitoring of in order to ensure that the legislation for equal pay and the legislation for equality of opportunity is a reality.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Murphy to the passiveness of women's organisations.  I would not agree with that.  Women's organisations are tired of calling for greater equality, particularly in relation to employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Murphy has had an opportunity to correct that because one of the great problems that women's organisations have in seeking reform is that they repeat over and over again the discriminations that exist, the discrimination between the male and female wages, discrimination in the fact that there is no legislation for maternity leave, that there <Col N="770" /> are not the facilities that would assist in encouraging women who want and have a need to go out to work, the facilities of creches and playschools and other kinds of supports to enable them to go out to work.  Let us look to the future.  The problems that face us now in a rapidly changing society hold a great challenge and a potential role for the Employment Equality Agency because we are aware as a country of the need for rapid development in industrialisation and the need for the rapid introduction of modern technology and the training of people to take these jobs.  This is a great potential for developing the contribution of all citizens, male and female, in responding to the need for greater adaptability and greater training.  This will not happen unless the Employment Equality Agency is mandated in a very positive way to assist in its happening, to assist in cooperation with the National Manpower Agency, with the IDA, with AnCO in ensuring that the potential is realised.  If the agency is given an adequate budget&mdash;I said in my opening speech that it should be given at least a trebling of its present financing&mdash;if it is given at least that, if it is given support and encouragement both in its monitoring and enforcement role by having an enforcement officer with legal expertise to carry it out and in its educational and research role, then there could be a transformation over a fairly short period of time in the general attitudes in society, in the conditioning of girls and women and in the conditioning of man in our society.  This would be of enormous benefit to the country particularly as we are a very young country.  We are dealing with a very young population.  We are dealing with rapid change and we are dealing with a situation where we need to develop the potential.</P>
      <P>For all of these reasons I again express a disappointment that while the Minister was here he appeared to be fairly complacent, more or less satisfied with the situation.  I think I can speak on behalf of the women of Ireland: there is no room for complacency, there is no room for satisfaction.</P>

    <P>I end my final 30 seconds by extending <Col N="771" /> a welcome to the House to the Minister of State.  Deputy Seán Calleary. We share the same native town in Ballina and it is a happy event to note a Ballina person sitting in the Minister's chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides Senators with an opportunity for discussing the expenditure which it covers and also, in line with previous practice, provides an opportunity for general discussion of the Government's expenditure and financial policies in that context.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the main purpose of the Appropriation Bill, which has to be passed before the end of the year, is to give statutory effect to the sums voted by the Dáil for the supply services.  In addition, the Bill authorises the utilisation of certain departmental receipts as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This present Bill also authorises a small issue of £22,435 from the Central Fund.  This is provided for in section 1 and it is required to make an excess, which has been cleared by the Public Accounts Committee, on the Vote for Army Pensions in 1977.  The Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965 does not authorise the issue of moneys for an excess vote&mdash;hence a special section is necessary in the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2, which is the principal section of the Bill, appropriates to the specific services set out in the Schedule to the Bill the sum of £2,734,766,505, <Col N="772" /> comprising the 1977 Excess Vote of £22,435, referred to already, the original Estimate of £2,432,749,000 and Supplementary Estimates of £301,995,070.</P>
    <P>As is the normal practice, I do not intend to make any general statement at this stage.  In my concluding remarks I shall attempt to deal as fully as possible with the various issues which will be raised by Senators during the course of this debate.  I look forward to an interesting and constructive discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity of congratulating the Minister of State.  He has probably been welcomed to this House already.  My welcome is to him personally not to him in his capacity as Minister of State because I must confess to some disappointment that the Minister for Finance has not done the Seanad the honour of coming here particularly for this debate.  Perhaps he will be here tomorrow to hear the contributions that are made and while it may be normal practice to make a short opening statement in the debate on the Appropriation Bill, I nevertheless feel that in the particular political circumstances of the moment we might have expected the Minister for Finance, newly installed in his office, to come here and let us know, on the first opportunity for a major debate in either House of the Oireachtas, his views on the economy, his economic philosophy, the problems of the day, his analysis of how they have arisen and his suggestions as to how to solve them.  For personal reasons the Minister might have been particularly glad of this platform to dispel the notion abroad that he is the puppet of the Taoiseach when it comes to financial matters.  I have noted that the Minister said in reply to those accusations that he is not the puppet of Deputy Haughey and that he will be his own man.  This is the place where the Minister should have dispelled that notion, if it is mistaken. The Minister could have indicated to one House of the Oireachtas, his views on the state of our country.  An opening statement by the Minister in the context of these times would have been particularly valuable and would have been a <Col N="773" /> peg on which we could have hung this debate so that the whole exercise, instead of being meaningless, might have taken on some meaning.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Government as much as the last Government do not have a very high opinion of the importance or worth of this House in so far as Ministers of the Cabinet, where they have a Minister of State attached to their Department, invariably ignore this House.  I protest about that practice and I hope that that protest will be heeded in the places where it needs to be heeded and that in our proceedings from now on particularly in next year's session we will see here as frequently as the exigencies of their offices permit, Ministers of the Cabinet.  It is due to the status of this House that this be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling, but it is a little difficult to talk about the state of the country as many of us will want to, and about our economic predicament without having guidance from the current office holder as to his views which will obviously inform the debate from the point of view of the rest of us.  To some extent the debate is now pointless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common case with everybody, including Members of the Government, that the economy is in difficult straits. While some of the difficulties have their origin in external factors it is also common case that many have arisen from a mixture of policies that were fundamentally unsound and policies which were alright but where there was not sufficient political courage or ability to take <Col N="774" /> corrective action when those policies conflicted with trends that were not foreseen or trends of a magnitude that was not foreseen.  We have in essence overspent and we have over-borrowed and, like a firm, a country that engages in exercises like that is engaging in a reckless policy.</P>
    <P>The deficit on current account is alarmingly high and one has to recall that doubt was expressed at the time of this year's budget as to the validity of the figures projected on that occasion. Those doubts were pooh-poohed and when the leader of our party expressed those doubts, he was accused of indulging in a pointless numbers game.  When dealing with the economy of a country one must deal in figures and must make sure that the figures or numbers are accurate and reasonable.  The outturn of the year's operations has proved beyond any doubt, that this year's budget was startlingly wrong.  As a result, we are left with a huge gap in current account.  In addition, the general economic strategy in so far as it released a large amount of money into our economy as predicted by the manifesto, has had the effect of throwing our balance of payments into disarray.  This was foreseen, though it was not in any of the economic documents published in the last 18 months or so.  It was not sufficiently highlighted nor was our attention drawn to the dangers of it.</P>
    <P>There was a hope that the &ldquo;Buy-Irish&rdquo; campaign would have a much greater effect than it actually had.  This is an instance of the policy beginning to run off the rails because certain predictions were not being fulfilled and of an inability to tack to take account of that.  The &ldquo;Buy-Irish&rdquo; campaign was commendable and it is regrettable that there was not the level of response that it should have evoked from a patriotic population. There are many reasons for this.  An explanation might be found in the fact that we were for so long a tariff-protected economy and the range of goods was limited and to some extent of lower quality than foreign made goods, and the novelty of having a wide range of foreign <Col N="775" /> goods has not worn off.  That was a big factor in the failure of the &ldquo;Buy-Irish&rdquo; campaign.  I assume that the &ldquo;Buy-Irish&rdquo; campaign has failed but I am interested to hear the views of the Minister on how useful or otherwise that campaign was.  I am also interested to hear if it is intended to continue with that campaign.  It seems to have lost its impetus in the last number of months.  There seems to be an unspoken recognition that a dead horse is being flogged.</P>
    <P>If that is so we should be told.  If the public learned that the appeal to basic patriotism has been unsuccessful, it might possibly have the effect of shocking them into a realisation of the way they have failed in what was a national duty.  Like so many other things in modern Irish life we as individuals felt that it did not apply to us, it applied to the other fellow.  Its failure was a substantial contributing factor to the balance of payments difficulty that we now find ourselves in.</P>
    <P>I see three major problems facing the economy in the year ahead.  The first is to correct the balance of payments imbalance; the second is to improve the revenue to the Exchequer; the third is to cut back on Government spending.  Each of these is politically difficult because it will involve measures that will not be popular with the electorate.  It will involve measures that might cause actual hardship to many people.  One wonders just how much room for manoeuvre the Government have in correcting each of those headings.  When one considers that the PAYE people are up in arms about their burden, have taken to the streets, and their spokesmen have threatened all sorts of dire consequences if their burden is not eased, it is inconceivable to think that the budget in February will be able to levy more tax on that sector.  If that is attempted we will be coming to a stage where the country might well be ungovernable because of the reaction of the people in that category.  The tax situation at present is becoming oppressive in that there is an air of menace about tax collection.  We hear nothing but talk of <Col N="776" /> sanctions, prosecutions and people going to jail.  To try to enforce the tax regime like that seems oppressive.  There is talk of recruiting hundreds of more functionaires into the Revenue section. The country will be over-run with functionaires.  In every aspect of Government they are on the increase.</P>
    <P>As far as the PAYE payer is concerned, I cannot see how there is any more room to increase his contribution to the Exchequer.  He has a very live expectation of having his contribution decreased and he can see no reason why it should not be decreased.  He feels it should be decreased because other sectors are not paying their share and he points his finger at the farmers.  The question then arises, can the farmer next year be looked to as the person who will bring in the much needed extra funds to the Exchequer to try to close that horrifying gap?  I do not think he can.  The time for catching the farmer is gone because the boom in agricultural incomes is gone. Agricultural income this year will show a drop in real terms and the outlook for next year is no brighter.  Consequently, if the income increases are not there and if the level of income is dropping, it is difficult to see how the Exchequer will be able to manipulate extra revenue out of that sector.</P>
    <P>We had the suggestion that they would pay the levy, the special taxation applicable only to themselves.  Resources tax was mentioned and we all know the reaction that these proposals produced. If they are proceeded with next year that reaction will be there again and even more violence because the economic scene in the agricultural sector has disimproved since they were originall made.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult to devise and implement a taxation regime for farmers that will have their confidence.  They are entitled to be satisfied about what is proposed for them.  They are entitled to have a tax regime that is no better or no worse, but the same as for any other citizen engaged in business.  That, for self-employed farmers engaged in the agriculture business, will be a form of accounts. They will be entitled in their accounting <Col N="777" /> practices to the same allowances and the same techniques and practices that are applicable to any other self-employed businessman.  All of us know that if that is to be the tax regime for agriculture the yield, particularly having regard to the fall in incomes, will not go anywhere near meeting what the Exchequer needs.  I cannot see that the farming incomes, if farmers are to be treated in the same way as any other citizen, will come in and help the Exchequer in its hour of need.  From my knowledge of that community if there is any attempt to impose a resource tax, which is a new name for rates, or if there is any attempt to continue the levy, the reaction will be as unsympathetic and possibly just as hostile as the reaction from the PAYE payers.  We know from past experience, and the present Taoiseach has reason to know it more painfully than anybody else, that the farmers are prepared to go a long way in making their case.  They are prepared to go to jail.  They have done it in the past and there is an air of dissatisfaction and disillusionment among that sector of the community at present.  If there is any attempt to impose taxation on them that is different or oppressive or that they see as harsh in relation to any other section of the community, they will react in possibly extreme measure.</P>
    <P>The self-employed are also being mentioned as another area where there is a lot of cream to be gathered for the Exchequer, the imputation being that there is evasion and avoidance on a very wide scale.  If there are loopholes through which tax is being lawfully avoided they can be legitimately closed in the budget legislation.  I am not saying there is not evasion.  It is the ambition of everybody paying tax to try to evade as much as he safely thinks he can.  Nobody has ever quantified and I do not think anybody can ever quantify accurately&mdash;estimates have been made but at best they are only gestimates&mdash;the extent of tax evasion by the self-employed sector.  Having regard to their numerical proportion within the community and to the magnitude of income into the Exchequer, I do not think that the amount being evaded would be <Col N="778" /> of significance in meeting the gap that has to be met.</P>
    <P>There is the factor, with serious social consequences, that in curbing that evasion extreme sanctions may have to be applied.  If they have to be applied in an extreme or widespread fashion to curb evasion totally, in turn they may have a disincentive effect.  They can foil investment; they can have a disturbing social effect.  If a law is not obeyed voluntarily almost unanimously by those it effects, it is well-nigh unenforceable.  There is talk of outlawing unofficial strikes.  We would all like to see them outlawed.  If a Bill is passed outlawing unofficial strikes and 1,000 workers take unofficial action, how can the law put 1,000 workers into jail?  That is the harsh reality of it. Unless a law is obeyed voluntarily, it becomes impossible to enforce.  If we reach the stage with the self-employed that they are being harried and chivvied by the imposition of criminal sanctions, we are in a very wrong and bad social area.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the Exchequer from the point of view of getting in extra taxation is extremely bleak.  In think the Taoiseach is on record as saying it is not intended to increase the tax burden, but I am subject to correction by the Minister. Many citizens will be listening with anxiety to what he has to say on that matter. I was surprised that such a specific statement should have been made by the Taoiseach at this stage before his Minister for Finance and his other Cabinet colleagues have got down to framing their Budget and seeing how their sums are working out.  I certainly read his statement as a commitment that there would be no further tax burdens.</P>
    <P>He may have to go back on that statement or, perhaps, he is just recognising the reality of the situation as I have been outlining it, and the difficulty, or rather the impossibility, of getting any significant amount of extra taxation from any of the three broad groups in our society. We have, of course, the old reliables, but taxing beer, cigarettes, and so on, or increasing the rate of VAT is very much a double-edged weapon.  These items all <Col N="779" /> figure in the consumer price index and any taxation imposed on them&mdash;and I cannot see a situation where taxation increases will be excluded&mdash;will push up the consumer price index and this, in turn, will have a spin-off in demands for wages, and off goes the spiral again.</P>
    <P>As I see it&mdash;and I am only an amateur economist&mdash;the other two alternatives left to the Minister are to look at the expenditure side of his sums and see what he can do there and, when he has looked at that, to look at his borrowing possibilities.  It seems that we will now have to employ here much of the policy being operated in the United Kingdom by the Tory Government.  There will be severe and in some areas quite savage cuts in public expenditure and, as a result, many of the services to which citizens have become accustomed will be curtailed in scope and in quality.  The question that arises is: in what areas will these cuts be made?</P>
    <P>The question also arises: what will be the reaction of the citizens who will suffer from the effects of these cuts?  It is not for me to offer to the Minister for Finance any advice as to the areas in which he should make his cuts.  I have no doubt that his colleagues in Government, when they debate the departmental estimates, are offering him excellent reasons why their estimates should not be cut.  The only person who can argue that with confidence and get his own way is the Minister for Justice, and I speak from experience.  I will deal with the Minister for Justice in more detail later on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cutting back of expenditure, it will be an interesting exercise particularly by the present Government, when one considers the spending Departments and the personnel in them, and when one considers all that in the context of the political trauma of the past couple of weeks.  It will be a very interesting exercise and if one could capture one of the flies on the walls of the Cabinet room, it would be an enthralling exercise to hear what he would have to say and particularly what he would have <Col N="780" /> to say with regard to whether we now have a Government with a presidential style or a Government with &ldquo;collective&rdquo; responsibility in the real sense of that word.</P>
    <P>To use the phrase some political commentator used in a book, is the Taoiseach chairman or chief?  It will be very interesting to see if there are any clues following the settling of the Departmental Estimates and the production of the budget figures next year as to whether our new Taoiseach is chairman or chief.</P>
    <P>The style of the man would indicate that &ldquo;chief&rdquo; will be the role that he will seek for himself, and &ldquo;chief&rdquo; is the role that he would like to play.  Whether he is allowed do that very much depends on the mettle of the people he has appointed to share Cabinet responsibility with him. Time will tell, and we will have to wait and see what happens.  It appears as if the thrust of the budget strategy will be a severe cutback in expenditure.  That will be forced on the Government because the options for bringing their books into balance are so limited, and that is possibly the only way in which they can do it.  That way is fraught with political and social difficulty.</P>
    <P>Much of the political difficulty is eased because of the size of the majority in the Dáil.  There is no political difficulty in putting through even harsh measures. There would be possibly a long-term political difficulty in the sense that the Government who would do so would have to face the electorate eventually. Undoubtedly the thoughts in the minds of the Taoiseach and his colleagues will be that something will turn up before that happy day arrives.  Consequently, the political difficulties of a cut-back in public expenditure may be in the future and because that is so, we can look with a fair amount of certainty to cut-backs. I do not know where they will come.  I am apprehensive that they will be geared to affect the sections of our society who do not have a lobbying power, and that includes the more helpless persons in our society.  The social welfare classes are not organised in strong and militant lobbies <Col N="781" /> where they can command publicity, where they can raise political scares. They are a soft target when it comes to cutting back.  There is nothing whatever in the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party to show that they have a real concern for the under-privileged in our society.  On the contrary.  They have not been neglected, but they have never got as much of the cake as they were entitled to.  That is in the tradition of the Fianna Fáil Party, and I am afraid that tradition will reassert itself now in this time of budgetary stringency.  We will have to wait and see.</P>

      <P>I provoked a reaction at last.  I say that because I know my history.  When we came into office in 1973 over 500,000 people were living below the poverty line of bare subsistence when a party who were committed to cherish all the children of the nation equally had been in office for over 16 consecutive years.  For the first time the old age pension age was reduced from 70, at which it was fixed in 1902, and substantial increases were given immediately to social welfare recipients. This year their increases will not keep pace with the year's inflation, so far as I recall though I may be out a percentage point.  If that is the history of Fianna Fáil with regard to social spending those people can look forward with some trepidation to the cuts in next year's budget. The cuts will be tailored political rather than socially.  High profile areas where there are militant lobbies to object when the cuts come on them will be avoided and we will see substantial cuts in the social welfare area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are already signs of it.  The signs are principally a tremendous amount of red tape in the payment of grants.  Social Welfare cheques are being delayed and letters are unanswered.  There is delay of up to many months and there was evidence of this at the time of the by-election in Cork.  The one feature that was mentioned to our canvassers time and time again was the delay in paying social welfare payments.  The administration <Col N="782" /> could not have become so bad so suddenly that such a massive delay on such a wide scale could have occurred. There has been a general direction to slow down, slow down.  That is understandable when one considers the appalling mess that the Exchequer is in. The fact is that there just are not funds in the Exchequer to meet these payments. With regard to housing grants, the inspector comes not once, not twice, but three times and on every visit he finds something else wrong and the payment of the grant is delayed.  Every Deputy and Senator is plagued with people coming in to him.  Farmers come complaining that headage payments and other grants from the Department of Agriculture are being held up.  They are slow.  In all Government Departments there is ample evidence at the moment that there is a slow-down on payment. All this adds weight to what I am saying, that there is a dire financial mess.  Dire measures will be taken to rectify it and the poor citizens of the country are going to suffer.</P>
    <P>The question arises then of placing responsibility for this situation and we know already that one victim in the witch hunt has been blamed for the situation we are in.  Deputy Martin O'Donoghue has been dropped from Cabinet level.  To pinpoint him as the person responsible for our economic situation was a callous political gesture.</P>

      <P>Speculation, I agree, but it is speculation of a kind that causes one to say to oneself before one makes speculation, why was Deputy O'Donoghue dropped?  He is the architect of the Fianna Fáil manifesto. He is the economic adviser to the former Taoiseach and was in that position for many years.  Economic unrest is widespread throughout the country.  It is commonly admitted by their own backbenchers that they are getting a hostile feedback.  This has been proved in the elections that have taken place during this year.  The hostile feedback that they are getting from the electorate has <Col N="783" /> to do with the economic situation.  Who is responsible for the economic situation? Deputy Martin O'Donoghue primarily and former Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, secondly.  The result is a <i>putsch</i> in the backbenches fomented by this unrest that they have been spreading throughout the country and their own unease about their political future.  What happens after the <i>putsch</i>?  The man who has been pinpointed as the economic architect of Fianna Fáil policy is gone.  Of course, it is speculation, but it is not unreasonable speculation.  I do not think anybody would deny that it is accurate speculation. Why was he not kept?  He is a highly-qualified academic economist, a man who devised a strategy that swept Fianna Fáil into power with 82 seats. When we hear the answer to that then I will know whether I am speculating.  He has been pinpointed as the ogre and he has been shoved away and his colleagues are distancing themselves from him.</P>
      <P>Likewise his colleague the former Minister for Finance, has lost the race. He is staying in the Government but he has been moved out of the prime ministry charged with the economy of the country.  He has also&mdash;to use a slang word&mdash;been pinpointed as a fall guy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, there is a clever exercise of the new regime distancing itself from the old regime, pretending to the country that it is different, whereas the personnel, with four exceptions, are the same Government who were in charge of the country since 1977 with collective responsibility; and every man sitting around that Cabinet table had an input, if he so wished, into the economic policy of the Government.  Those who are still there cannot absolve themselves from blame by a witch hunt among their less fortunate and more vulnerable colleagues.  It is discreditable.  To try to pretend to the electorate that that was a different Cabinet, a different Government, and that this now is a whole new Government and a different scene and &ldquo;we had nothing to do with the sins of the past&rdquo; it is cute political exercise.  It is <Col N="784" /> ridiculous because every man sitting around that table was responsible and had ample opportunity to make his own personal input into every aspect of the Government's economic policy.  When the budget was being debated it was open to every Minister to make his contribution. If any Minister felt so badly about the way the economy was moving or that the economy was being messed about and that there was incompetence on the part of the Ministers charged with our economic affairs, it was the duty of that Minister, if he considered it sufficiently serious, to opt out from the collective responsibility.  However, opting out for honourable terms is not a characteristic of the Taoiseach.  He was prepared to stay there with the rest of his colleagues and take part in his economic debates and because of that he is as responsible for the present economic mess as are the men that he has fired into the wilderness.</P>

      <P>The Chair is of the opinion that a debate on Government policy is in order and the Chair would hope that speakers would keep to the policy.  It has been the traditional approach to the Bill in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, but I find it difficult to talk about economic policy without also talking about the architects of it.  It was not automatons who devised it; it was men sitting around the Cabinet table.  If one descends to personalities, that is not unreasonable, in the present political context in which we have had a change of Government and in which we are trying to analyse why the present mess happened and what are the chances of getting out of it.  The team that is now going to clean up the mess is essentially the same team that created it.  However much the team and its chief may want to distance themselves from the previous team, they cannot do so because essentially <Col N="785" /> it is the same team.  I am afraid we cannot look forward with great confidence to the improvement that is required to clean up the economic mess we are in.</P>
      <P>I foresee, too, in the context of a cut-back in expenditure, a lean time for the local authorities.  Last year they got, as far as I recall, a 10 per cent increase on their estimates for the previous year. That 10 per cent, now that the outturn of inflation for the year is 16 per cent, has not enabled them even to mark time. They have gone back, and it will be interesting to see what percentage increase they will be given next year.  They do not know, and next year starts in ten days' time.  Yet the local authorities do not know how much money they are going to have to spend next year.  So far as I am aware they have not made their estimates. They cannot discuss which works they are going to carry out because they do not know how much money they are going to get.  This is an appalling way to run a country.  Then local authorities will be blamed for bad planning, but how can they plan when they do not know what their budget is going to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This too is symptomatic of an inability to run a country properly.  It is symptomatic of the chaotic situation that we are drifting into and the practical effect of that situation up and down Ireland for hundreds of thousands of workers I am afraid, will be catastrophic. How many of them are going to have to be let go?  How many people working on the roads and all the other schemes that local authorities engage in will be prejudiced in their employment prospects for the coming year and do not know it? The appalling condition of our roads, that are patently unable to deal with the traffic that is using them at present, is a matter of great urgency.  But, because of the financial policies of the Government, the funds of the magnitude required to solve that problem are not available, or even remotely available.  Driving up and down the country one comes on, here and there, a mile of a road being done, then being left for six months with a display <Col N="786" /> of painted tar barrels; it may be 12 months before anything else is done on it.  There is no cohesion, no planning in that area.  That is because no proper financial provision has been made on a continuing basis, so that local authority engineers will know what they will be able to spend and local authority members will be able to plan coherently in advance and in time.</P>
    <P>I foresee that in the local authority area there will be a considerable cutback in expenditure.  Again this is an area where the effects of the cutback are to same extent hidden.  They have a low profile.  The money filters down through the county councils and the local authorities.  There is a scheme knocked down here, a scheme reduced there and the adverse effects of the cutback are dissipated and do not impinge immediately and centrally on any one group so as to provoke harsh political reaction.  That is the other area where one will see a considerable cutback in the local authority scene.</P>
    <P>Then the question of borrowing arises&mdash;whether the Minister will be tempted to avoid some of these harsh consequences of cutback in expenditure by resorting once more to a high level of borrowing.  I hope he does not for the sake of the country's finances, for the sake of the country's currency and for the sake of our reputation as a mature, responsible nation governed by reasonably mature, responsible men.</P>
    <P>Our borrowings are reaching a level where they are nearly becoming scandalous, where we could shortly find ourselves in the humiliating position that Britain found herself in a couple of years ago when the inspectors from the IMF arrived at 10 or 11 Downing Street&mdash;wherever the Chancellor of the Exchequer lives&mdash;and told him what he could have in his budget, told him how Britain was going to have to be run.  If they are prepared to do that to a country as powerful as Great Britain, one need not have any doubt that they would not be long packing their bags and landing in Merrion Street to tell us how to run our affairs.  Certainly, if we continue <Col N="787" /> to engage in borrowing at the level that we have done for the past couple of years, that is an inevitable consequence. Indeed, it is a consequence I would welcome if we were to continue to engage in borrowing at that level.  If we were to continue borrowing at that level we would be bankrupting the country and I would welcome anybody who would be prepared to come in to save us from ourselves.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I hope the temptation to ease the consequences of cutting back in expenditure by resorting to more borrowing will be resisted.  It will be a hard temptation to resist because, as far as the man in the street is concerned, we have become so blasé about millions that when he reads figures in the papers given out by the Minister for Finance, or reads them in the financial pages, he skips down them and says: &ldquo;They are not for me.&rdquo;  We have become used to reading of millions, thousands of millions.  Indeed, if we look at the Minister's opening statement the figures there are frightening in <Col N="788" /> their magnitude.  There may be a temptation on the part of the Minister for Finance to continue borrowing at the level of previous years in order to ease the need to cut back so that it will not be as harsh as I think it has to be and should be.  There is that temptation there. It is a political temptation, because this is not something that impinges on the man in the street.  Of course, it is something that has very serious national consequences.  But as far as the man in the street is concerned, who is often very tempted himself to borrow if he is in a bit of difficulty and can see nothing wrong with it, he does not realise the extent to which we, as a nation have over-borrowed. He may not realise the dangers that we are in.  Consequently, there may be no political reaction from him to proposals to increase or maintain, never mind increase, the level of borrowings.</P>
