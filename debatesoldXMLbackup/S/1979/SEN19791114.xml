      <P>Last week I asked the Leader of the House if it might be possible to arrange to take motion No. 15 on the Employment Equality Agency, which is a motion of considerable <Col N="102" /> urgency because of the fact that the agency claim to be under-funded to achieve the functions they have been given under statute in the area of ensuring equality of employment.  The urgency is that the House ought to have an opportunity to take this motion before the budgetary provisions in January in order to be able to express a view on the first report of the Employment Equality Agency.  I wonder if the Leader of the House has been able to make any arrangements for this motion to be taken as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a point on that.  It was conveyed to me yesterday by Senator Ryan that it would be feasible to take motion No. 5, which stands in my name, today.  I demurred because any motion would require a week's notice, at least, to the mover of the motion.  While welcoming the suggestion that this motion should be taken soon, certainly, as I say, I would want a week's notice, I would suggest that motion No. 5 should be taken next week.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Murphy, I do not agree necessarily that a week's notice should be given to somebody.  From the time Members table motions they should be ready to have them taken.  I was told about a motion in my name at 7.30 the evening before and, despite the fact that it was inconvenient, I was willing to allow that motion to go ahead.  Other Senators who table motions should be prepared to take them when the Leader of the House decides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>

      <P>I certainly agree with Senator Harney that when Senators have been pressing for a motion to be taken they should be ready to go on at relatively short notice.  It is not a question of always being able to fit in a motion exactly when the mover would like it.  In this case I had to bear in mind that I had been asked to take motion No. 15, and it is quite possible that it would have been taken today.  Because the Minister for Education will be here today taking a Bill it seemed appropriate to put in a motion on education to be taken with the Bill. I found in the end that the mover of the motion was not willing to take it at what he regarded as short notice.  As things stand at the moment, it is not possible to take a motion today.  Certainly, I will endeavour to have a motion taken next week.  I would ask those who are next in line to have a motion taken, and particularly when they are pressing me to have their motion taken, to be ready to go on.  It may not be possible for me to give more than a few days' notice.  I will endeavour to give notice if I can, but it may not always be possible.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one or two very brief comments on this Bill.  Two weeks ago it was discussed briefly in the House.  Today we have an opportunity of taking a look at it again. This kind of legislation is absolutely new. It is a new concept on the Irish scene.  It is the kind of legislation that is widespread in other countries, especially in continental Europe.  One thing bothers me about the Bill itself.  It is quite a small <Col N="104" /> Bill.  It does not say very much, but it enables the Government to achieve quite a number of things under its general umbrella. It is an indication of a certain amount of dishonesty.  It is before the House today as a direct result of one of the promises upon which the Government achieved office some two years ago.  They promised to remove car tax which contributed a considerable amount of money to the Road Fund over the years.  Many people thought it was a nice bonus to have the tax removed from their cars, especially younger people.  Its removal contributed quite considerably to the huge majority the Government now enjoy in Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister of State if he will elaborate further on the reasons why the Government at this time seek to bring in this kind of legislation. From my experience of motoring on the Continent, if one has to use the toll roads from Strasbourg to Paris, or even from Paris to Le Havre, it is quite expensive, especially when one compares that kind of taxation with the car tax we accepted before the last general election.  The Government have introduced this Bill to milk the already hard-pressed motoring public for considerably more money than they were paying before.  Yet the Government got good value from their initiative in promising to remove the car tax.</P>
      <P>On the merits of the Bill, it would appear from press reports that it is enabling legislation to allow some investors or big businessmen to move into this area.  Are the Government and the Department of the Environment convinced this is an appropriate way to finance road construction and the provision of infrastructures? We must remember that our road infrastructures are in a deplorable state.  I am not blaming the Government particularly but we have not got the flyovers, and so on, which tend to speed up traffic.  We have not got the ring roads which reduce traffic needs.  The traffic in Dublin certainly needs tremendous thought, not to talk of finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in the southern capital over the <Col N="105" /> past three or four weeks and the traffic there is appalling.  Their system of one-way streets is just not possible to follow. Also they have not got adequate signposting.  The traffic system in Cork city is nothing short of a national scandal. Are we now to take it that the Department of the Environment are handing over this snarled and tangled problem to the private sector?  This is certainly something new.  The Minister of State in his Second Stage speech to the House did not elaborate on the plans or the ideas his Department have for the future utilisation of this Bill in real terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill would not be utilised apart from the provision of one bridge in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It seems rather a wide Bill if the Government and the Department of the Environment propose to utilise it for that sole purpose.  Those of us who travel around the roads will not have failed to notice the very small amount of arterial road repairs and road construction undertaken during the summer.  Perhaps the Minister might like to give us an indication as to why so little was done at a time when there appears to be so much room for improvement.  For example, it takes over 40 minutes to get through Naas at any time of the day.  This retards transport and commerce to an unnecessary extent.  The local authority should be encouraged to move a little faster.  It is just not good enough for people to have to wait 40 minutes to get through a reasonably small provincial town.  The present infrastructure is not able to cope with the mix of large and ordinary private traffic.</P>
    <P>The Minister might tell us whether in the coming years a more dynamic approach will be taken, and spearheaded by the Department of the Environment, to tackle the traffic problem and the road infrastructure problem right across the country.  This is long overdue.  It has been promised and it is difficult to see any light at the end of the tunnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. Under section 3 of the Bill, a road authority may make a scheme for the establishment of tolls in respect of the use of a public road to carry all kinds of general traffic.  I should like to ask the Minister of State whether it is possible for him to give us a clearer idea of the Department's reasons for introducing this kind of Bill.  In his opening speech two weeks ago, he did not mention what the motivation was for introducing this Bill at this time.  He did not suggest that it would solve any particular problem. For that reason he might be more explicit. I suspect that in a narrow political kind of way the Bill is a substitute for the car tax which the Government removed some two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting for some contributions from that side of the House.  There seems to be a silence on this Bill from the Fianna Fáil side which reminds me of the brevity of the Minister&mdash;not the Minister of State who is here today&mdash;when introducing this Bill some considerable time ago in the other House.  That opening speech has been noted by a number of contributors.  It must stand as one of the briefest and least illuminating speeches made by a Minister in either House for a considerable number of years.  As Senator McDonald was hinting, we are still not very much the wiser.  The only specific proposal I can see that this Bill is intended to cover is a matter which has come before another forum in which I participate, that is, Dublin City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to the proper and democratic order of things, Dublin City Council, as the road authority in Dublin, have been considering the specific proposal of Mr. Roche for a toll bridge which would link the East Wall and Ringsend.  The proposal was adopted in principle by Dublin City Council at their meeting on the first Monday of this month.  There was a reference from the General Purposes Committee to the city council in relation to this toll bridge and approach road to connect Ringsend with North Wall Quay and, after a vote, this was adopted in principle.  I objected to <Col N="107" /> this not least on the grounds that the Bill which would give a statutory basis for Dublin City Council as the road authority to enter into any kind of negotiations had not even had its Second Reading in this House.</P>
    <P>I am wondering what the real background is to this Bill.  Is there anything else except Mr. Roche's proposal for a toll bridge and approach road in Dublin?  Has Mr. Roche been impatient with the Government who may or may not have entered into an agreement to bring in legislation to facilitate his proposal to operate a toll bridge and to make a profit out of operating it?  It seems to me that there is nothing else behind this measure, that that is the beginning and the end of it, and that the Government have not been efficient enough for Mr. Roche, so that he had to go before the city council when that body did not have statutory power to enter into any negotiations to get their agreement in principle before there was legislation grounding it.</P>
    <P>This is a reflection on the approach to the vital question of traffic in various cities and towns and specifically, for my purposes, traffic in Dublin city.  Here we have an <i>ad hoc</i> piecemeal measure.  The Minister of State in introducing it to this House described it as an enabling measure.  Of course it is an enabling measure which enables the relevant road authority to enter into discussions with a private entrepreneur, if that entrepreneur wants to build a toll bridge, or an approach road in a particular area, and to charge a toll in order to make a profit out of the enterprise.  That is what the Bill is about.</P>
    <P>If we see it in an overall context of traffic chaos in Dublin of an urgent need for a Dublin traffic authority, an urgent need for major legislation in order to give an overall traffic authority in Dublin power to begin to cope with the real traffic problem, then we have some measure of the lack of overall concern and interest on the part of the Government. They do not seem to be on top of the job, with the effect that traffic is getting <Col N="108" /> worse and worse.  The snarl is getting worse and worse.  The pollution by traffic is getting worse and worse and the city is grinding to a halt.  If anybody doubts this I would refer him to the paragraph of the Fourth Report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  The report was specifically on CIE, but it also dealt with what it called traffic restraint in Dublin.  There are a number of paragraphs, beginning with paragraph 72 of that report, which identify the seriousness of the problem and the need for a major response to it.  At paragraph 88 the Joint Committee states:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee believes that there is a need for a high-level coordinating authority and this should take, if necessary, the form of a new statutory authority.  It should have powers to develop and execute a traffic management strategy for Dublin as a whole, and to ensure that the measures it proposes are enforced.  It should cover Dublin as a whole and result in necessary changes in the relevant by-laws, and parking regulations and have powers to introduce bus priority schemes throughout the city. Such an authority would have considerable implications for CIE and for the Gardaí.  The Joint Committee urges the necessity of a new authority for this purpose, and trusts that the local authority will also recognise this need.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this House is focussing on an <i>ad hoc</i> once-off measure, because a private entrepreneur has come forward with a proposal for a toll bridge in a particular area.  When this was discussed in detail at various meetings of the General Purposes Committee of Dublin City Council and in the council chamber itself, on the first occasion it was sent back from the council chamber to the General Purposes Committee and on the first Monday of this month it was passed in principle on a majority vote by the city council.</P>
    <P>The issues became clear.  First of all, as far as Dublin is concerned, is a bridge needed at that particular part of Dublin? <Col N="109" /> Is it necessary to have another bridge at that particular point to link Ringsend with North Wall Quay?  If so, why are the local authority not prepared to ensure that the bridge is built, as the local authority up to now have assumed responsibility for the road system in Dublin?</P>
    <P>A separate matter is this: if this bridge is necessary and is to be built, then why is the fundamental decision in principle being taken&mdash;and it is a fundamental decision in principle&mdash;to hand over the building of the bridge to private enterprise and to allow private enterprise to operate under by-laws prescribed specially for them by the local authority to operate a profit-making enterprise with no time limit on it, a profit-making enterprise indefinitely, so that not only those who seek to use it, but those who need to use that bridge several times a day, would have to pay the toll and therefore fill the coffers of the particular private enteprise company?</P>
    <P>In the city council there were many references to the fact that this was becoming an ideological debate.  There is a very important ideological issue here. It is the first time&mdash;and we should be aware of this&mdash;that part of our road system, our transportation system, is to be handed over, a piecemeal part, a profit-making part, to private enterprise. We should be aware of the implications of this for our whole transport system, and for our traffic and our flow of traffic. Does this mean that where some other private entrepreneur in some other city, or in some other part of Dublin, comes up with a good idea for making profit, we will have pressure on the road authority, the city council, to make the necessary by-laws to facilitate him?  Are we to be at the beck and call of private enterprise to build certain bridges or certain toll roads in certain parts of the city?  Have we a Government who will listen genuinely to the desperate appeals from residents of residential areas of Dublin?  I can speak for the residents in the areas of Rathmines, Rathgar, Dartry, Orwell Road, who are oppressed by heavy and persistent traffic at all hours, <Col N="110" /> heavy vehicle traffic through residential areas.</P>
    <P>We all know that the travelling rate of CIE buses in Dublin is one of the slowest rates in any European city and we know that the flow of cars through the city every day does not make any kind of sense.  Therefore, I would reject this Bill on several grounds.  I reject the idea of private toll bridges for the profit of entrepreneurs. I reject the idea that, if a bridge is necessary, it will not be built by and under the control of the road authority, as has been the case always.</P>
    <P>I also reject this piecemeal and unconnected approach to the whole transport and traffic problems in Dublin specifically and also in other cities and major towns around the country.  It is strange if you look at the legislative order of priorities of this Government what seems to determine the priorities.  It seems to me that Mr. Roche is able to determine Fianna Fáil priorities in relation to coping with traffic and transport problems in the city of Dublin.  For those reasons I reject the idea of a Bill enabling road authorities to negotiate with private entrepreneurs in this way.  I believe the Bill is specifically related to Mr. Roche's proposal.  I do not believe there is any other specific proposal in mind at the moment.  Obviously it will be open to another private entrepreneur to come forward and approach another road authority once this Bill is passed through both Houses.  This is not the way to start approaching one of the most serious and urgent problems facing us.</P>
    <P>Apart from what I have talked about&mdash;the economic undermining of our capital city by the fact that the transport system is not working properly, the fact that traffic is moving at such a slow pace in the city&mdash;there are also very serious environmental problems and very serious energy problems on which we are not getting any leadership from the Government in coping with them.  This Bill does not spell out any leadership or any sense of the proper order of priorities in relation to traffic and transport.  Therefore, it is a revealing measure.  What was perhaps <Col N="111" /> most revealing of all was the very minimal speech made by the Minister in the other House when introducing the Bill.  That to me spoke volumes.  The Bill can be understood if you go back and read that opening speech by the Minister.  He did not want to say anything about it because of its whole motivation, because of the whole approach of this Government to coping with that major problem.  This Bill should be rejected by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of other Senators who spoke on the Bill.  We have just heard Senator Robinson on one of the head-hunting expeditions she usually carries out in this House when she attacks people who are not here to defend themselves. This despicable type of conduct has been part and parcel of the Senator's approach to the problem.  Let me make the position clear in relation to the Bill itself and the Labour Party's attitude to it. If the Labour Party members of Dublin Corporation had their way we would have half a bridge.  Half of them are for it and the other half are against.  That is the way they vote.  They are a half-a-bridge party.  We see now where Senator Robinson stands.  Which side of the bridge is she on?  Is she on the side for building or for not building?  Maybe she can explain party policy on this problem.  It is important that we should have the overall situation rather than the viewpoint of a crank on either side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Party policy is clear. We oppose private toll bridges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>A constructive and positive approach to this matter is needed.  If the traffic is in chaos, which it is, then some remedial measures must be taken.  The ever-changing situation in relation to this city and transport development means there has to be new legislation to up-date the procedures and make available more outlets in a positive way.  New legislation like this is <Col N="112" /> necessary and desirable.  The solutions of many problems in this city have been impeded in the not-too-distant past by head cases of all types.  Every effort made by Dublin Corporation to speed up the movement of traffic and to adjust the road system has been met by the same type of violent opposition we heard today from Senator Robinson.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party and others opposed to the Government have had a majority in the Dublin Corporation for a number of years.  In fact they were in Government for a number of years.  Maybe the Senator does not hear me, but I want to get through to her loud and clear that her party were in Government for a number of years when this chaos was developing.  Dublin is slowly coming to a standstill.  Maybe the Senator and other people want to see the city and the country tied up.  Maybe they want to ensure there will be no movement within our city.</P>
      <P>We do not want half a bridge.  Half a bridge is no solution to this problem.  Of course we need additional bridges across the Liffey.  Is the Senator so out of date with the situation that she believes there is some doubt about this situation?  Has she ever seen the traffic travelling in Dublin city?  Obviously she has not or she would be up to date with the problem.  Over the years each and every member of Dublin Corporation sought additional facilities across the Liffey to meet the ever-increasing flow of traffic.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the traffic chaos in the city is one we must take positive measures to deal with.  Whatever the situation is in relation to its development, assuming that an industrialist was prepared to put money into the development of an industry in Dublin, would the Senator object?  We have entrepreneurs willing to invest money.  Would she at the same time ensure that the industry would not be developed?</P>

We should open our arms to people who are prepared to solve our traffic chaos.  The Senator seeks to pick out individuals who, in their belief, are making a contribution to the city.  This Bill does not name individuals; it is not related to an individual.  The individual was named by the Senator.  He is a responsible and honest businessman.  Any reflection other than that is an appalling insult to this House.  He has been well known for a considerable period because of the employment his companies give.

      <P>The Labour Party policy is absolutely confusing to me. Half the Labour Party are for and half are against tolls.  That is not party policy; that is not a common approach to a problem.  That is what is wanted in Dublin city at the moment.  On every occasion honest efforts are made, there are people who wish to disrupt them.  We want to see every avenue explored to ensure that some remedial measure will be taken because of the introduction of this Bill and other Bills to solve these problems.</P>
      <P>I hope commonsense will prevail in this House and in other forums in relation to this chaos.  Bridges are needed soon to ensure the free flow of traffic in this city.  Commuters know well that the present chaotic condition is the result of inactivity.  Some of that inactivity was brought about by pressure groups who had control of the corporation for some time.  This seems to be the problem in Dublin at present.  Apparently the Senator is prepared to cause further chaos when efforts are being made in the city, in this House and in other forums to alleviate the distress and the vast problems that will confront us now and in the future.</P>
      <P>I hope when the Bill is passed it will be examined to see where it can fit in to our general needs and so ensure that we will have a smooth traffic flow.  Our roads are in a very bad condition, particularly in the cities.  If this Bill alleviates even one situation, it will have done a good job.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing in new legislation to meet ever-increasing changes in the development of the nation.  This nation is still evolving. There are new pressures and problems. There will be more new problems and pressures in the future and new legislation will be required.  Work should not be impeded by cranks or pressure groups inside or outside this House.  We should do what we think is right in the interests of the community as a whole, and we can get on with the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have ideological <Col N="115" /> views about the proposal to build toll roads.  Such a proposal may help to alleviate the situation in which we find ourselves, with traffic problems and poor approach roads to many of our cities.  I would not object either to toll roads being built and managed by local authorities or necessarily, on ideological grounds, to toll roads or, bridges managed, constructed and run by private individuals.  One wants to look at the problem from a broad perspective.  It could well be that one type of operation is suitable in one situation while another is suitable for another situation.</P>
      <P>In general terms I would favour toll roads.  The very high cost of infrastructure should be paid for by the user and it should not all come out of taxes.  I would welcome a situation in which local authorities, for example, found that they could recover the high cost of special roads or bridges by charging tolls.  This is a transference of the cost to the user and, generally speaking, I favour this.  It should help us to cut down our public borrowing, otherwise the whole charge would be on central funds.</P>
      <P>Basically, this is a good idea.  I hope this Bill is not framed simply with one proposal in mind, as Senator Robinson suggested.  I do not have any feelings one way or the other about this particular proposal.  I am not against it ideologically.  If the appropriate authorities favour that specific proposal, I would generally take their viewpoint. But, in broader terms, there is a very good argument for increasing our road building capabilities by encouraging input of funds and expertise from the private sector.  When one examines approach roads&mdash;the Dublin-Cork or Cork-Mallow roads, the main road out of Dublin to the west as far as Enfield&mdash;one realises that by any standard, Irish, European or international, their situation is critical.  I welcome legislation which would help to deal with this problem and ensure that the situation is tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, problems particularly when private enterprise or even <Col N="116" /> the local authorities are involved. Senator Dowling pointed out that there are objections to all these schemes.  That it is the democratic process.  There should be objections to such schemes because some people are going to suffer and one has to take the overall good into account.  The sort of developments which lead to spaghetti junctions and road intersections with great waste areas underneath and surrounding them, are proposals that should only be put into practice after very careful deliberation.  One of the most important aspects of this problem is to ensure that proper controls are exercised when such projects are being put into operation. For example, not only planning problems occur here but the problem of overcharging on toll roads is something which should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I suggest that toll roads should come under the aegis of the National Prices Commission to ensure that the tolls are not too high to cover the inefficiency of the operator, whether a private enterprise, private entrepreneur or a local authority, or that the toll reflects overcharging by the private organisation. It would be a good thing if the tolls where subject to the scrutiny of the National Prices Commission.  There might be merit in a proposal to exempt buses from tolls and encourage the buses to use the toll roads.  Also, it is a possibility that agreements might be entered into by local authorities whereby the local authority might take over a toll road from a private enterprise company when the initial outlay and a suitable profit had been recovered.  I would like to see local authorities taking the initiative in using this legislation to improve our road system and to recover some of the costs which I certainly believe in the case of these very expensive roads, and bridges should be borne by the user.  I welcome that and I would like the Minister to comment on the possible scope of the move by local authorities to make use of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  We all know that we are trying to get an expansion in industry and that our industrialists <Col N="117" /> have criticised the infrastructure behind industry, one of which is the roads.  Since we entered the Common Market there has been a build up in the usage of our roads, particularly in the last two years, since industry has begun to expand at a fairly fast rate.  The traffic on our roads has increased enormously. The bulk of this traffic which is blocking the roads are the vehicles coming from outside the country.  There are more of these big vehicles using our roads at the moment than there are vehicles owned by companies in the State.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the fact that tolls are used on the Continent and our vehicles going to the Continent pay toll charges.  I do not know what arrangement is made in the EEC for a contribution towards the cost of our roads by the vehicles which are coming from outside, but if we have tolls this will be one method of getting users from outside to contribute to the cost of our roads.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald mentioned that they have a small traffic problem in Cork.  No doubt some Members of the Oireachtas on their recent visit to Cork came across this and will agree.  The Cork problem has been examined by world experts and there is a programme for solving it.  This programme will be spread over several years and will cost well over £100 million&mdash;an awful lot of money.  Already finance has been arranged by the Government for this programme and bridges will be built inside the city.  The difficulty about Cork is that it is built in a valley, with a river in the middle, and access to it from outside is very difficult.  There is only one solution to the traffic problem in Cork, that is, to by-pass the city altogether.  This is in the programme.  Either a high level bridge or a tunnel is to be built down river to meet by-passing roads.  What we are talking about is a cost of about £20 million for one bridge or one tunnel.  This is put ahead of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that if any industrialist paying for the costs of his vehicles could get rid of the extra costs for fuel and labour, which the hold up in Cork city <Col N="118" /> costs him at present, by paying a toll to get that bridge built earlier, he would be very glad to do it.  Personally I am not terribly concerned whether the toll would be the responsibility of the local authority or private enterprise, but the sooner that bridge is built the nearer we will be to solving the traffic problem in Cork city.  That will allow the very fast development of industry in Cork to continue, which no one in Cork wishes to stop.  Senator West asked the Minister to include one category free of tolls.  I will ask for another&mdash;perambulators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this Bill with caution and with some reservations.  I am concerned with the implications that will flow when this Bill becomes law.  It represents a serious and radical development where roads and bridge development here are concerned.</P>
      <P>I read the Minister's Second Stage speech.  It conveyed the very clear impression that the power to levy tolls, and to bring into operation a road or a bridge on which tolls would be charged, would be an exceptional, isolated and rare occasion. Senators seemed to convey the view that in their minds this legislation is intended to deal with one single project. If that were the case I would not be as deeply concerned as I am.  I feel that the reality of the situation is that the powers made available under this Bill are widespread and far-reaching.  It is conceivable to envisage a time when practically any road or any bridge could be subject to the payment of tolls.</P>
      <P>This Bill will enable tolls to be charged by local authority or private enterprise to finance the maintenance and management of roads and bridges.  Conveying that power to private enterprise is a radical step and there is every reason why we should consider very deeply the implications of what is proposed here.  It can very easily happen that we will find ourselves putting a most vital and essential part of our communications system under the control of private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned safeguards. He said, &ldquo;I would emphasise that it will be the statutory road authorities, and <Col N="119" /> they alone, who will decide&rdquo;.  We are now coming to a stage, as those of us who are members of local authorities realise&mdash;with the continuing restraint on the availability of finance to local authorities to carry out and develop their plans within their respective counties, even though it will be their prerogative to decide whether they will allow this development to take place&mdash;that unless they have adequate finance they may well be left with no option.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the intention behind this Bill is to supplement the activities of the local authorities in the provision of roads and bridges.  I see a danger here.  We are not solely going to supplement the local authorities in discharging this function, but we may well supplant them in doing this work.  It is also implied that it is necessary to proceed to this unique development here. This is perhaps an admission that in the foreseeable future the resources local authorities will require to discharge their normal work may not be available to them, not in the amount that would be desirable, and consequently we have to look to a new development and a new means of providing the facilities our communities require.</P>
    <P>I take the view that this is the beginning of what will be a widespread development. By imposing tolls, which can also be imposed to ensure the maintenance of roads as distinct from the development of roads and bridges, this in its own way is the reimposition of the road tax on cars which was removed a few years ago.  If the local authorities cannot interest private enterprise in the construction of a particular road or bridge, they will have the power under this Bill, admittedly with the consent of the Minister, to impose a toll for the construction of roads and bridges and for the maintenance of roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew attention to the fact that toll roads operate on the continent, in Brazil, the Philippines and the United States.  My understanding of this is that if tolls operate on roads in these countries they are operated on what we <Col N="120" /> would regard as super-roads&mdash;the motorways, the autobahns.  Under this Bill the Minister is not proposing to confine the charging of tolls to the type of road on which they are charged in other countries.  The Government are making it clearly available under this Bill that road tolls may be charged on any road and any bridge.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to Irish people who had motoring holidays on the Continent in recent months and who had experience of toll roads in France.  Their judgment of the scheme was that it was an expensive means and a costly addition to their normal holiday expenses.  If the people who use the toll roads of Europe were asked to give their opinion, they certainly would not favour what is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Government's road development plan of the eighties.  He stated that they hoped the private sector would respond to the opportunity to participate in the development of the country's road system.  Let us be logical about this.  Private enterprise will respond provided the return on investment is adequate, provided the profit margin is satisfactory.  In other words, private enterprise will respond if the incentive is good enough.  If private enterprise does not respond the first incentives provided by the Government or local authorities, there will be no option but to increase the incentive until it becomes sufficiently attractive.</P>
    <P>I have read the report on road development for the eighties and I have no criticisms to make, but it would not be unreasonable to say that the effect of the Bill will be to leave the more attractive sections of the road development programme up for grabs to private developers.</P>
    <P>Tolls can be applied to the maintenance of roads.  This situation could have undesirable consequences.  The public have already contributed through taxes and rates towards the provision of roads, but they may be asked to pay a second time through tolls for maintenance. In view of the fact that I regard the Bill as a radical and <Col N="121" /> serious development in our road programme, I have reservations about the rights of the public to make effective objections to proposed developments.</P>
    <P>I note that a notice must be served by the local authority, that there is an initial period of a month and a further period to two months within which objections can be made.  We are talking about a total period of three months and about a substantial development costing millions of pounds.  We must safeguard the rights of the individual who may be affected by the development.</P>
    <P>Because of the complex nature of the proposed development, the period of one month for public notice and two months for the making of objections is too short and could discriminate against an individual. On Committee Stage I shall ask the Minister to extend the period and to include safeguards in the Bill for the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also stated that the Bill provides an additional option.  In view of the diminishing resources available to local authorities I believe that it will become the only option.  Even though the Bill provides for the right of local authorities to set conditions under which roads may be constructed and tolls charged on them, the fact is that the real control of local authorities over the setting of satisfactory conditions will be limited.  The Bill does not provide for the rights of people such as land owners on either side of a toll road or at each end of a toll road who may have to cross the road or bridge several times a day.  I should like the Minister to assure me that this aspect of the matter will be taken care of without disadvantaging the people concerned.  The natural progression of events from the passing of this Bill could be the imposition of tolls on every road and bridge requiring development or maintenance.  It is for this reason that I have strong reservations about the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of Senator Dowling's outburst it is necessary to put on record the view of the Labour Party.  We are not opposed to toll roads or toll bridges, nor do we favour toll roads or toll bridges.  If the argument is proved <Col N="122" /> that tolls roads or toll bridges are necessary, we contend that the State should reap the rewards on behalf of the people.  That is the Labour Party policy. We have not heard any good case, either in the Dáil debate or in the Seanad debate, for the lending of toll roads and toll bridges to private enterprise.  Why should the State not make the money on behalf of the people?  That is the simple view of the Labour Party, and it is unambiguous. So the question of whether or not Dublin Corporation are confused is simply explained by the fact that the argument that toll bridges are the best way of dealing with the problem has not yet been won.</P>
      <P>It would be foolish to dismiss the fact that we might need toll bridges or toll roads.  I am not so sure that private enterprise would be easily attracted to toll roads because of the problem of the acquisition of land and the length of time taken to pass legislation.  Toll bridges would be a more attractive proposition. On the other hand, there is the problem in relation to private enterprise of acquiring land from people and giving it into the hands of private speculators to build houses and so on.  It is just an extension of one thing into the other to put it into private hands.  Basically the Labour Party are opposed to this kind of thing. We believe that the roads belong to the people; we believe the State should administer them on behalf of the people.  It is easy to hand over land to speculators for building houses on, but it is not easy to put people into houses because of their prohibitive cost.  If we are not careful we will shortly have to pay for the air we breathe.  This is the crazy way in which society is developing and this is our basic objection to it.</P>
      <P>Other arguments have been made extensively in both Houses.  It is worth putting on record for the benefit of the House that there is no confusion in the Labour Party on the question of toll roads.  We should like to hear the argument proved for toll roads and toll bridges.  If the argument is proved, we would like to see the State controlling toll roads and toll bridges on behalf of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Harte's view.  There is nobody against toll roads, but at the moment it is hard to be in favour of them.  We all know that the traffic situation is desperate and something will have to be done immediately to solve that problem.  Senator Robinson and other Senators explained the situation in Dublin city.  No effort has been made to improve the situation which is worsening all the time.</P>
      <P>With regard to private enterprise, I would not like to think that this Bill is, being introduced for the sake of one road or one bridge in or around Dublin city, because this problem exists all over the country and I have no doubt that the Minister of State realises that.  Would there be any danger that private enterprise would move into the area where there is a heavy volume of traffic and ignore the area where there is very little traffic, where the income would not be so great?  If that is the situation, I think Senator Harte is right in saying that the State will have to provide the capital and keep out private enterprise.  If we are going to give the cream of the income from toll roads to private enterprise at the expense of the State I do not think it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jago made a very good case for Cork where traffic is a serious problem.  He said that they had a plan ready and invited people from all over the world to look at it, but when will the plan be put into operation?  Will it even be put into operation in the eighties? Can we convince ourselves that the problem of traffic in our cities and large towns will be solved by the eighties?  I hope I am wrong, but I do not think it will be.  Up to a few years ago we had a Road Fund, which may have been raided on various occasions by various Governments instead of being used for the roads.  This was a pity and none of us has a clear conscience on it.  The Road Fund no longer exists.  The only contribution to the Road Fund is from commercial vehicles.  I do not suppose we get anything from the commercial vehicles that are coming in from the EEC.  We have a large number of commercial vehicles. <Col N="124" /> The tax on some commercial vehicles ranges from £300 to £1,000 per year, which is a substantial amount of money.  Would the owners of commercial vehicles have to pay tolls as well as tax?  The Minister should tell us exactly what is going to happen.  I know that the present cost of servicing commercial vehicles is out of control.  As it stands, the Bill enables a local authority with the consent of the Minister to order the collection of tolls on any road or bridge. That is not fair.  It would be fair to collect tolls on any road or bridge built on or after the date the Bill becomes law, but it would be wrong to collect tolls on roads that are in existence.  Naturally, one looks at the manifesto that the present Government put before the electorate in the last general election, and on which they won the election.  They said they had prepared a major road development plan designed to meet the traffic density in the eighties.  I hope that that will happen and I would like the Minister to tell us where the money will come from, if it does not come from private enterprise. What is the thinking of the Government on the collection of this money?  I am satisfied that the full amount will not come from private enterprise. They may be lucky enough to get some of the capital from private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I associate tolls with the old landlords. When I was young I attended agricultural markets in various towns in my county.  People who sold cattle had to pay a toll to a representative of the landlord who owned the market yard. There is no doubt that Irish people resent tolls.  I have no doubt that the Minister for the Environment or the Minister of State have researched this matter.  The House is entitled to know what the Minister knows.  We should be told what is being charged and why they decided to use tolls.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is clear that our road system is a disaster.  Our roads are deteriorating day by day.  The Government should try to solve the problem immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one principle <Col N="125" /> relating to traffic which it might be worth discussing.  It is a principle drawn from the area of what is known as operations research.  It is based on mathematics.  As a channel being used by any set of elements in traffic becomes fully utilised, any increase in the flow of traffic through it increases the delays at a rate which is out of all proportion to the small increase in the number of elements going into the traffic.  In other words, if the maximum utilisation of a channel is near and 10 per cent extra traffic is added to it the delay of each item of traffic could be increased by as much as three times, not 10 per cent. That is a fundamental principle of queueing which can be shown mathematically. Our difficulty is that in places like Dublin and Cork, in the main urban areas, we are near the maximum capacity position and any small increases have huge effects.  One report I looked at showed that the average speed of CIE buses between 1971 and 1977 had been reduced from 14 miles an hour to seven miles an hour in the city.  In effect, the delay time is doubled.  At peak time the average speed is down to as little as three miles an hour only.  That is a measure of the problem we have.</P>
      <P>The Bill enables us to find another way of increasing the capacity of the system.  Any increase in the capacity makes a great difference because an additional 10 per cent increase in the maximum utilisation reduces the delay time by one-third by the same principle.  In other words, if the channel capacity could be increased by 10 per cent, for instance, adding another bridge in Dublin would increase the capacity by 33? per cent in the upper area of the city where we have the main flow and the main difficulty. That would make a great difference to the average delay time.  This is what we are talking about.  We should get on with the job and this Bill enables us to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the question of a toll bridge for Dublin has been on the table for a few years.  I am sure that the person who has an interest in doing something in Dublin must be worn out from bringing <Col N="126" /> his entrepreneurial idea from one group to another.  In Dublin city there are a number of Departments and authorities involved in determining whether or not traffic is going to flow freely.  The chief engineer of the corporation takes an interest in traffic.  Funds are coming through the corporation, and central funds are coming through the Department of the Environment.  CIE are providing public transport and getting funds through the Department of Tourism and Transport.  The Garda have responsibility for regulating traffic in a particular way under the direction of local authorities.  In Dublin there are three local groupings involved between the urban area, Dún Laoghaire and the county.  Organisationally, that is a formula for disaster in relation to improving the traffic flow in Dublin.  We must do something about it.</P>
    <P>The transport study of 1971 gave a figure for road costs.  In present day money those costs would be of the order of £400 million.  The rapid transit study for CIE produced a figure of £200 million.  If some entrepreneur comes along and says: &ldquo;I will try and get the agreement of the people.  I will go along Ringsend and I will talk to the people, I will make deals with the communities so that I will provide a community centre as part of the total deal, I am inclined towards giving it a chance.  We are not selling the roads of Ireland to private enterprise. We are increasing the capacity of the main channels of the upper part of the city by 30 per cent.  This could make a great difference to the average delay time.  It would be very difficult to estimate the improvement that would come from this, so my view would be to let that go ahead while making sure that any of the problems that would arise from interfering with people's rights and housing are fully explored and that they have the opportunity to have their say.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in Dublin is that people living in areas like Clontarf, Dún Laoghaire, Mount Merrion and so on want to get into the city rapidly, to their work and people living in houses along the proposed routes have been complaining, <Col N="127" /> and rightly so.  If they have a complaint they should have a place to air it and to work it out.  In the meantime Dublin's traffic snarls up more and more, and something must be done about it.  This Bill is one way of going about it.  I support it and hope that we get on with it.</P>
    <P>The objective is to improve traffic flow.  There has been much discussion about the relative merits of using buses versus using rail and private transport. The facts are that five million journeys are by rail, 200 million by buses. Therefore, the question of making the roads more effective and more efficient is prime.  Experiments were made with bus lanes but they were not successful and some recent reports have recommended more experimentation.  I often think of the foresight of our ancestors in building wide roads to suit their horse carriages. The Dún Laoghaire to Blackrock. Blackrock to Ballsbridge road is a fine wide road.  Every morning the two left hand channels are packed with traffic on the way in and if one ever sat in a queue there one would find that the two channels in the right hand side coming in the other direction are under utilised.  I often wondered: why not put a bus in the middle channel?  Let the buses use one of the two channels that are under utilised and have it switched by traffic lights so that in the morning the bus uses one side and in the afternoon it uses the other.  There must be a variety of tricks of that kind used in other countries which could be tried out.  I see the toll bridge idea as another way of contributing and I would say in relation to the rest of the traffic plans that we try out the effect of the toll bridges and then see what happens after that.</P>
    <P>I disagree with all the talk about integrated and comprehensive plans.  What happens is that the more one goes into it the more costly one sees it is and the more any move is delayed while the overall plan is examined.  In relation to comprehensive road development in Dublin&mdash;which obviously is going to <Col N="128" /> give rise to difficulties if motorways are going to pass through or over people's houses&mdash;it should be done step by step to see what happens at each stage.  Look ahead and have some alternative.  Write out what some possibilities might be but do not get absolutely hung up.  Take it step by step and then revise the situation. Review it and see what the next step should be.  For me, the toll bridge is a first step.  If we do not see another bridge over the Liffey soon we will not even be able to see the river.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of regret that the Government should have to resort to the toll system to finance major projects on our roads.  It is perhaps an admission by them that the finance is not there and will not be there to meet the improvements and requirements that will be necessary in the future.  It is pathetic that at a time when there is a greater need than ever for the Road Fund&mdash;that much maligned fund which over the years grew into a treasure chest&mdash;it is no longer there.  In any country where over a period of 30 years there was one car on the road and where now there are ten cars a very severe measure is needed to remedy that situation.  That the Government is without the Road Fund can largely be laid at its own door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that this Bill is introduced as a way out both for the Government and for local authorities. Local authorities will be reluctant to resort to this Bill.  There is a certain intrinsic pride with local authorities that they are responsible for any major road improvements within their own catchment area.  They will be reluctant to have to resort to the Bill but they may well be forced to do so.  When all is said and done we might well be bringing more multinational corporations on our heads and shoulders in regard to roads as we have them on our head and shoulders in other aspects of our economy at the present time.  When approaches will be made by large building and construction companies to provide a dual carriageway or improved networks in a local authority, no matter what the inclination on the part of the local <Col N="129" /> authority to accede to that request or application, there will be certain pressures brought upon them by the Department of the Environment that they should accede to the request of the multinational building companies and they might well be allowed to have their head.</P>
    <P>If I thought that this Bill was completely in line with what was envisaged in the road development plan brought out earlier this year, my reservations would be less than they are.  To indicate how I feel the Bill has departed from the principles laid down in that plan I would refer the House to page 44 of the road, development plan for the 1980s, paragraph 85.  It states that:</P>
    <P>The accepted principle of toll roads and bridges is that the facility to be provided offers an alternative route to road users who may choose to pay for the convenience of using the toll facility.</P>
    <P>The principle enunciated in that paragraph, which is an admirable one, is that whatever road networks may be provided will be as an alternative route to what is already there and road users have the option of using it or not using it. Within the terms of the Bill I do not see either of those principles of the alternative or the option to the road users enunciated.  The Bill is a departure from that admirable principle laid down in the road development plan for the eighties.</P>
    <P>If major road improvement works are carried out by a private company and that company approaches the Department to have tolls levied on it, will the Department be able to say: &ldquo;No, what must be provided is an alternative route to what is already there?  I do not think the Government will have that discretion under the Bill.  Will there be an option open to road users to use the improved network or to go on to an existing road network?  It would be easy for the Department, the building company or the local authority to argue that there are other road networks available.  This country has a lot of minor and county roads.  We do not want to have the sort of an option open to people, after <Col N="130" /> providing a major road improvement, that they can be told that if they do not want to use it they can go via point A, B, C, D, E, which will probably take them 30 or 40 miles off the main road, with the additional dangers and risks to personal safety inherent in such a variation.</P>
    <P>If this Bill were as specific as the road development plan is in regard to the principle of the toll system, I would have much fewer reservations than I have in regard to the whole matter.  If I felt that the road development plan projections were likely to be adhered to, I would also have fewer reservations.  With the financial stringencies at present, which will increase in the future, many excuses are likely to be put forward for delays in the implementation of the plan.  I could see the excuses coming under the heading of the fact that oil will become a scare commodity and therefore there may not be the same demand on the roads in the future as in the past.  Our roads are inadequate to carry the traffic on them, and even with a lesser growth in road traffic in the future there is still a crying need to bring them from their present inadequate state to what would be at least commensurate with the amount of traffic being carried on them.  If a road is in the same condition as it was 30 years ago when it was carrying one car, and is now carrying ten cars, then a deplorable stage has been reached in regard to our road network system.</P>
    <P>As regards projections in the road development plan each of us will look at what is laid out for our own particular counties or regions.  A woeful omission in regard to County Louth is that on the main Belfast-Dublin thoroughfare which, considering its distance from Dublin probably carries a greater volume of road traffic than a corresponding location in any other part of the country, the road networks are not envisaged to be completed until 1984 or 1985 and in another instance not until 1989.  In regard to the Derry-Dublin road through County Louth no improvements are envisaged in this plan.</P>

      <P>The State should provide a proper road network.  It has always been a sacred principle that people from anywhere in the country have a right to use the roads.  As I see this Bill expressed there will be an attitude confronting the public in the future decade where they will not be able to use the roads unless they pay a toll for particular passageways.</P>
      <P>This has come about from a scarcity of finance.  I would think more of the Government if they were to express that as the reason for giving in to the toll system.  In the White Paper and in the Minister's speech it is said that approaches were made from private concerns; that they could well have a part to play in providing improved road networks.  The Minister should tell the House the volume of these approaches and if since this Bill was printed there has been a follow-up on the part of any private building concerns who are more than willing to go ahead immediately and do what is available for them to do under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I regret that I do not altogether go along with the Bill.  If it was as specific as the road development plan on which it is based in regard to the principles that should underlie any toll system, my reservations would be much less.  Regrettably I do not see those principles being adhered to by this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for the constructive comments, criticisms and discussion of the Bill.  It is hardly necessary for me to say that the Bill is breaking new ground and that we will learn from experience as the provisions of it are applied in practice.  For this reason, there is an inbuilt flexibility in many of the sections in the Bill.  This flexibility is matched by a carefully considered set of safeguards with particular emphasis on the interests of the general public.  The provisions of the Bill offer ample protection against any unwarranted proliferation of toll charges and against profiteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> Having made these general remarks, I should like to deal with some of the questions raised by Senators in the course of the debate.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald raised, in particular, the absence of specific borrowing powers in the Bill. The legal references which he quoted from Street were, however, superceded by section 4 of the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960.  The 1960 Act provides the general power for all borrowing by local authorities.  This Bill under section 12, will be cited together with the Local Government Acts 1925 to 1978.  This collective citation includes the 1960 Act and, accordingly, specific borrowing powers are not necessary in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald also mentioned the matter of toll facilities in the United States of America and in particular the Connecticut turnpike. American toll projects would offer little, if any, valid comparisons with any projects that might be undertaken in this country because of the vast differences in the scale of projects, required level of investment, traffic volumes and so on. For example, the Connecticut turnpike, which the Senator mentioned, runs for a length of 129 miles.  It required a bond issue of the order of £230 million to finance it and has a toll income of £15 million and a concession income of a further £1 million per annum.  It is obvious, therefore, that traffic volumes run at very many times the number of vehicles on even our busiest roads.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to what he called the intrusion of private enterprise. He asked whether local authorities could not administer a toll facility.  Other Senators mentioned this as well.  The answer is, or course, that they could. The major principle of the Bill is to empower the statutory road authorities to do so.  They would, at the same time, have the option under section 9 of the Bill of making an arrangement with private interests to participate in the financing, construction and managment of toll projects.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald raised the old question about the abolition of car tax <Col N="133" /> on cars up to a certain horse power and that this had an adverse effect on the allocation of money for roads.  This is not so.  In 1976 there was a total allocation of approximately £20 million in respect of roads.  This year the allocation is something in the region of £47 million. That shows the rapid growth in expenditure on our public road network.  As well as that in recent years the pattern has developed that the income from road tax was being appropriated more and more for Exchequer purposes.  For instance, following the significant increases in road tax imposed by the previous Government in the 1976 budget, the Exchequer take increased from about one-third to one-half of total receipts.  In effect in 1976 despite total receipts of £38 million approximately, the making of total grants of £20,705,000 in that year for road work purposes required the making available of an additional £5,356,000 by way of voted moneys.  This illustrates that the original primary intention in relation to the levying of road tax&mdash;that is the funding of road works&mdash;had by 1976, to a great extent, been eroded and that road tax had, at that stage, become more and more an indirect form of taxation.</P>
    <P>In abolishing road tax as from 1 August 1977 on all cars not exceeding 16 horse power and on all motorcycles, the Government effectively removed taxation of which a high proportion had become a more regressive form of indirect taxation from the date of implementation of the 1976 budget increases, which was 1 March 1976.  In connection with this abolition of tax, however, the significant aspect was that central Government expenditure on road works did not decrease but rather was substantially increased in 1977 and onwards.</P>
    <P>It was also mentioned during the course of the debate that there was now little revenue, if any, in respect of road tax.  There is indeed still a significant income from road tax.  The revenue from road tax this year is expected to be in the region of £19 million, which is very significant and important.</P>

      <P>Senator McDonald asked if a more dynamic approach will be made in relation to roads.  The road development plan is a clear indication of the Government's intentions in this regard.  Indeed, the amount of money made available this year is the highest in the history of the State, at more than £47 million in grant allocations.  With regard to the Naas by-pass, the Minister has approved the motorway scheme made by the council.  The ball is now in the council's court to progress the scheme, which I understand has already been started, as expeditiously as is practicable.  They have and will continue to have the Minister's encouragement and assistance to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson queried the number of applications received which could be regarded as coming within the scope of this Bill.  The reality of the situation will not be known until the Bill becomes law and until local authorities and private enterprise consider it.  In reply to Question No. 3 in the Dáil on 14 March 1979, tabled by Deputy Quinn, inquiring about the number of organisations, private and professional, which had contacted the Minister expressing a positive interest in participating in the provision of toll roads I stated:</P>
      <P>As I have already intimated in the course of the debate in the House on the Local Government (Toll Roads) Bill, 1978, there have been a number of expressions of interest in the concept of participating in the provisions of improved road facilities on a toll basis and I do not propose to disclose details of these at this stage.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of road authorities have been approached...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would repeat that the Government welcome the response from the private sector at the prospects of capital being invested in suitable toll projects which <Col N="135" /> will help to supplement the amounts being provided in the public capital programme for road and bridge improvements.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also mentioned that under this Bill private enterprise could proceed to take very high profits for an indefinite period.  This is not so.  A study of the Bill will clear any person's mind in this regard.  Senator Robinson also queried the purpose of the Bill.  In my opening statement I set out the purpose of the Bill.  The general principle advanced has been that a private company or person would finance wholly or partly and construct a public road or bridge and recoup their capital by charging tolls for the use of the facility.  The Government have previously indicated that they are open to the idea that suitable road projects might be constructed on a toll basis in association with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>This Bill will fill a major gap in existing road legislation by enabling tolls to be charged on public roads.  The road authority will make a toll scheme.  The public must have an opportunity to inspect the scheme and object to it if they wish.  A public inquiry must be held if there are any objections.  My approval must be given to the scheme.  These measures are designed to protect the public from a proliferation of tolls.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables road authorities to enter into agreements with private persons or companies in relation to the financing, construction, maintenance and operation of toll roads.  The power to make such an agreement is reserved for elected members of a road authority.  My approval will also be necessary.  It is very important to stress that the Bill is only an enabling one.  It will enable road authorities to construct roads in association with private enterprise on a toll basis where suitable projects exist.  It will provide road authorities with a further option for financing and constructing roads.  It may allow the timing of some major road projects to be very much advanced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> The Bill serves its purpose by enabling tolls to be charged and enabling private enterprise to become involved in relation to finance, construction, maintenance and management of a road or proposed road in respect of which a toll scheme has been made.  The Bill necessarily provides for other related matters; the inspection of toll schemes by the public, public inquiries into objections, by-laws for the operation and management of toll facilities, exemption from tolls, agency arrangements between road authorities and regulations to enable the Bill to have full effect.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator West that this Bill was not framed with one particular proposal in mind.  A number of parties have shown interest in the schemes.  Interest has been expressed by private enterprise in the possibility of developing toll roads and bridges.  Road authorities at present are not empowered to accept an offer from a private person or body to co-operate in the financing, design, construction and operation of a road or bridge nor are they able to charge a toll on a public road.  The possibility of constructing roads or bridges at a number of locations by way of toll schemes has been mentioned.  There is one firm proposal, which is public, and relates to the construction of a toll bridge over the Liffey from East Wall Road to York Road, Ringsend, in the administrative area of the Dublin Port and Docks Board by the Ringsend Bridge Company Limited.  The Department are aware of tentative proposals and inquiries in respect of toll roads and bridges in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.</P>
    <P>Senator West also stated that he would like to see tolls being charged coming within the scope of the National Prices Commission.  The position is that the fixing of the tolls will be made under by-laws which will be framed by elected members of the road authorities.  These by-laws can be amended or altered at any time as deemed fit by the elected representatives.  If it is not done in this manner, it would be necessary to go through the long procedure again to revise the scheme, hold a public inquiry, <Col N="137" /> consider objections and submit the scheme again for approval.  The tolls can be amended at any time by the elected members by merely amending the by-laws.</P>
    <P>Senator Jago mentioned the position in Cork, and he also inquired if it would be possible to exempt prams from toll charges.  This is a matter for the road authority.  I would raise no objection to such a proposal if it is submitted.  I presume, in respect of any toll road or toll bridge, that a footpath would be provided.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to road problems generally.  Senator McDonald referred to Naas and Senator West referred to Dublin and Cork.  Senator Dowling referred to Dublin.  I should like to refer the Senators to the road development plan.  It incorporates the major proposals revised by Cork Corporation, Cork County Council, and Kildare County Council for the Naas by-pass.  It also incorporates all the major projects envisaged in the road development plan for the eighties.  For example, in Dublin there is a proposal for the St. John's Bridge due to commence in 1983, Heuston Bridge in 1980, and the Liffey crossing and approach downstream of Talbot Memorial Bridge&mdash;that is the Macken Street site&mdash;in 1983.  I would urge the elected members of Dublin Corporation to consider seriously these proposals and to set in train the work required to carry out these projects to a final conclusion.</P>
    <P>In relation to Cork, there are some major proposals as well under the national road development plan.  A grant of £1 million approximately was made available recently by my Department in respect of the transportation study in Cork city.  Most counties are covered under this scheme, and it includes a by-pass which relates to Killarney town.</P>

      <P>I will take the Senator there some time.  Senator Howard referred to the abolition of the car tax.  I have explained that position already.  He also said that it appeared to him that, under <Col N="138" /> this Bill, the proposal is that private enterprise should supplant rather than supplement the national road programme.  I can assure him that is not so.  He also made the point that there should be a longer period than two months for lodging an objection.  In fact, it is provided under the Bill that a period of not less than two months must be allowed for objections.  That is mentioned specifically in section 4, so his fears in this regard can be allayed.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds queried allowing private enterprise to come into the operation of road works, including bridges.  This will mean that, according as private enterprise enters into the scene, more money will be available for roads and bridges, and for improving our national road network.  On the other hand local authorities will also have more money because they will be relieved of the jobs and the schemes which it is envisaged will be carried out by private enterprise.</P>
      <P>Some Senators asked whether or not finance will be made available to fund the national road development plan for the 1980s.  I can assure the Seanad that I am confident that the Government will be in a position to finance this scheme.  I urge the elected members of road authorities to make sure that their councils and corporations are fully aware of what is contained in the national road development plan and that their administrative and technical staff set about preparing the necessary plans and acquiring the necessary land so that these schemes can progress in accordance with the plan.  We often find that schemes are held up due to delays in land acquisition and to the fact that there were delays initially in planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte asked whether it was right or wrong to have private enterprise involved.  He was afraid that the entrance of private enterprise into the field of constructing and maintaining roads and bridges might interfere unduly with local authorities.  I can assure him that this is not so.  Local authorities can decide about this in the same way as they decide whether to carry out road works <Col N="139" /> or housing schemes by contract or direct labour.  In other words, they can weigh up the pros and cons before they enter into any commitment or prepare any scheme as to whether it is feasible to proceed under this Bill or to carry out the work themselves.  I am sure they will bear in mind the cost and the savings, whatever their ultimate decision is.  The road authority can take over a road under the scheme at any time, because it is a flexible scheme.</P>
    <P>I have answered Senator Markey's main query regarding the projections for the 1980s and the financing of the scheme during the 1980s.  At the moment the end of the 1980s might appear to be a long way away, but I am sure Senator Markey realises as well as I do that time moves swiftly.  We are now approaching 1980 and it will not be too long before we will be well into the 1980s.  I am confident that the Government will have the resources to implement this road plan in full.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude there are a few points which I should like to make.  Some Senators asked whether there is any danger of a proliferation of tolls.  Will there be widespread impositions on existing roads?  The answer is no.  The intention is simply to provide a further option for the financing and operation of suitable road facilities, most likely river crossings, for the benefit of the public. There will be no question of an indiscriminate power to charge tolls, or of their being widely applied to existing roads.  The overall responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment for the public road system are provided for.  The Minister's approval will be necessary for the implementation of toll schemes and the making of agreements between road authorities and private interests.  This control will enable me to ensure that there will be no unwarranted or unacceptable toll schemes and that scarce financial resources will be applied to the best effect in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Some Senators asked whether anybody can build a road or a bridge and charge a toll on its use for profit. <Col N="140" /> The straight answer is no.  This Bill reaffirms the powers and functions of the road authorities in relation to the public road system.  The underlying principle of this Bill is that each road authority will continue to be responsible for the provision of roads and bridges in their area of administration.  The Bill enables them, however, to enter into an agreement with other persons or bodies to finance, design, construct and manage any particular road or bridge.  They will also be enabled to charge a toll on a public road subject to satisfying the conditions of this Bill regarding public notice of charging of tolls and the agreement of the Minister for the Environment.  These provide them with new options regarding the financing and operation of public roads and the involvement of private enterprise, while retaining all their statutory duties and functions in relation to public roads.</P>
    <P>The elected members of the road authorities in relation to the charging of tolls are important.  This Bill provides that a road authority must make a toll scheme before charging tolls on a public road.  The making of a toll scheme will be a function reserved to the elected members of the authority.  This ensures that tolls cannot be charged on a public road, unless the majority of the elected members of a road authority are satisfied that such an action would be the best way of fulfilling their obligation to provide a satisfactory road system and of applying scarce financial resources in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The other important decisions under the Bill which must be made by road authorities, the making of by-laws, entering into arrangements with private interests and making agency agreements with other road authorities, are all reserved to the elected members of the local authorities concerned, and the approval of the Minister for the Environment will be necessary to the charging of tolls.</P>
    <P>A question has also been asked as to whether the Minister will be able to insist on tolls being charged in some instances. The answer is no.  This Bill will not give the Minister a power of direction in relation <Col N="141" /> to the institution of tolls.  While there are good arguments for the inclusion of such power because of the financial contributions made for roads from the Environment Vote, any such directions could come into conflict with the quasi-judicial functions vested in the Minister in relation to acquisition of land, motorway and toll schemes, and also in relation to public local inquiries.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides protection for the public against exploitation.  Section 3 provides that before a toll charge can be introduced it will be necessary for a local authority to formulate a toll scheme and to give public notice of such a scheme. Section 4 of the Bill provides that it will be necessary to conduct a public local inquiry into the proposal.  We must also bear in mind the fact that toll roads will be subject to general road traffic laws in relation to speeds, drivers' licences, vehicle registration and taxation, construction of vehicles, drunken driving, wearing of seat belts, and so on.  Section 1 defines a toll road as a public road or proposed public road and toll roads will, therefore, be subject to the general traffic laws applicable to all public roads.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank Senators for the tone of this debate, for the constructive manner in which the Bill was debated, and I strongly recommend that the Bill be passed by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Is Bille an-thábhachtach é seo agus tá áthas orm gur le mo linn-se mar Aire a chuirfear an Bille seo ar Rolla na nDlí. Má chuimhnítear orm in aon chor sna blianta atá le teacht, tá súil agam gur i <Col N="142" /> leith an Bhille seo a chuimhneofar orm.  I mo thuairim-se is bun-chloch í sa chóras oideachais agus beidh tionchar an-mhór aici ar an gcóras sin as seo amach.  Mar is eol díbh, dar ndoigh, is é cuspóir an Bhille seo go hacomair ná bonn dlíthiúil a thabhairt do Chomhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais atá ag feidhmiú ar bhonn <i>ad hoc</i> ó Márta 1972 i leith. Pádraig Ó Fachtna, T.D., a bhí ina Aire Oideachais ag an am sin agus thuig sé go rí-mhaith nach raibh an córas a bhí ann maidir le cáilíochtaí a bhronnadh dóthainneach dos na coláistí a bhí ann ag an am agus nach bhféadfaí é a leathnú chun riachtanaisí na gcoláistí nua ag an dtríú leibhéal a shásamh. B'shin é an fáth gur bhunaigh sé Comhairle Náisiúnta na gCáiliochtaí Oideachais agus is so-fheicthe anois cé chomh críonna is a bhí an tionscnamh sin.</P>
      <P>Le linn do'n Comhrialtas a bheith in oifig, bhí a lán cur agus cúiteamh faoi'n gceist seo agus cinneadh i Mí na Nollag 1974 nár chóir cumhacht a thabhairt don Chomhairle céimeanna a bhronnadh agus nuair a bheadh céimeanna le bronnadh ar mhic léinn ó na coláistí den tríú leibhéal taobh amuigh des na hollscoileanna go gcaithfí na hollscoileanna a shásamh agus gurb iad na hollscoileanna a bhronnfadh aon chéimeanna a bheadh le bronnadh.  Níor aontaigh mé leis an mbreith sin ag an am agus thugamar le fíos i rith an toghacháin i Samhradh 1977 go n-athrófaí an breith sin nuair a fhillfeadh Fianna Fáil ar oifig mar rialtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ráiteas a d'eisigh mé i Samhain 1977 dúirt mé go raibh gach gné den scéal pléite ag an Rialtas agus go rabhamar-na lán tsásta go rithfeadh sé le leas na nollscoileanna chomh maith le leas na gcoláistí eile ag an dtríú leibhéal cumhacht chun céimeanna a bhronnadh a thabhairt thar nais do Chomhairle Náisiúnta na gCáiliochtaí Oideachais. Rinneamar amhlaidh agus cinntítear an breith sin sa Bhille seo.  Cé go bhfuil an gné sin den scéal an-thábhachtach ó thaobh bharr an structúir, is den riachtanas í freisin go mbeadh córas náisiúnta ann chun cáiliochtaí ag <Col N="143" /> leibhéal an teastais agus an diploma a bhronnadh ar mhic léinn a éiríonn leo i gcúrsaí aitheanta i réimse éigin den teicneolaíocht. Clúdaíonn an Bille na cáilíochtaí sin freisin.  I gcás na gcailíochtaí seo go léir, tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh meas othru sa tír seo agus i dtíortha eile agus sin é an fáth go bhfuílím chomh ghabhtha sin sa Bhille le ceisteanna maidir le caighdeán na gcúrsaí agus seasamh na gcáilíochtaí ón gcomhairle.  Tá gach iarracht déanta agam ionadaíocht ar an gcomhairle féin a bheith comh leathan agus is féidir, ó thaobh saol eacnamaíochta na tíre chomh maith le hinstitiúidí oideachais. Níl sé éascaí an ionadaíocht ceart d'fháil i gcás chomhairle den tsaghas seo ach measaim go bhfuil an t-ionadaíocht atá molta sa Bhille seo go maith agus cé go bhféadfaí locht éigin d'fháil air, is dócha, bheadh an scéal mar an gcéanna maidir le aon tairiscint eile ina leith seo.  Tá an cothramaíocht ceart, measaim.  Glacfar leis go ginireálta go gcaithfidh an Chomhairle Náisiúnta, nuair a bheidh siad ag pleanáil agus ag comhordonú cúrsaí, áird a thabhairt ar chostaisí i leith a bhfuil faoi chaibidil acu.  Faoi Acht um Ard-Oideachas, 1971, tá sé de dhualgas ar an Údarás um Ard-Oideachas comhairle a thabhairt do'n Aire Oideachais faoin ghá atá le hinstitiúidí nua ard oideachas, cén saghas institiúidí ba chóir a bhunú agus cé'n saghas structúir ba chóir a bheith acu.  Chomh maith le sin, ní misde do'n Údarás léirmheas a dhéanamh go rialta ar an t-éileamh agus an gá atá ann d'ard oideachas.  Tá sé de réir tuisciona mar sin gur trí'n Údarás a thabharfaidh Comhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais comhairle don Aire i leith costais na gcúrsaí atá á moladh acu agus costais pé athruithe a bheadh ag teastáil in aon chúrsa ionas go bhféadfadh an chomhairle glacadh leis.  Tá an socrú sin idir an Comhairle agus an Údarás i bhfeidhm le achar réasúnta fada cheana féin agus tá ag éirí go geal leis.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill, I feel that I should sketch in for the House the history of this development.  The <Col N="144" /> Steering Committee of Technical Education in a report submitted to the Minister for Education in April 1967 said:</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which demand could be stimulated would be to give due recognition to the various awards to be obtained in the Regional Colleges.  We recommend the establishment of a National Council for Educational Awards, responsible for (1) setting standards of admission to, and qualification from, courses in technical education; (2) approving examination syllabuses in appropriate courses provided in Regional Colleges or other technical schools; (3) awarding certificates and diplomas to those successful in approved examinations; and (4) negotiating reciprocal recognition of equivalent qualifications with other countries, particularly Britain and the EEC.  At the highest levels, the Council would discharge functions similar to those of the Council for National Academic Awards in Britain, but it would also be responsible for the awards at technician and crafts levels.  It would be duly representative of educational and professional institutions, industrial, commercial and cultural interests and the appropriate State Departments.</P>
    <P>In their first report which related to the year 1968-69, the Higher Education Authority expressed concern about the status of technological and technician education in this country and drew attention to the need for national recognition for that part of the educational system.  They said that they had raised with the Minister for Education during a discussion with him the question of establishing a National Council for Awards and that the Minister had asked them to furnish him with a report in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Authority stated that when they were examining the general situation in regard to higher education in this country, they encountered a well-established demand and, in some areas, a long felt need for further and more advanced technological and other specialised third-level courses.  That there was such a demand <Col N="145" /> and need on the part of industry and of students, actual and potential, had been the experience, in the first place, of the colleges of technology which were immediately and directly involved in the matter.  That the existence of this demand and need had already been confirmed by two studies carried out under the aegis of OECD&mdash;&ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Training of Technicians in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority were satisfied that if technological education was, in accordance with its function, to keep in step with the growth of the country's economy, its content must be further upgraded and the scope of its operation extended.  The Authority considered that a serious impediment to the upgrading and extension of technological education and hence to its attraction for potential students was its lack of a range of national awards in the form of certificates, diplomas and degrees.</P>
    <P>The Authority considered it possible that, at first glance, it might be thought that amending legislation which would enable universities to give degrees or other appropriate awards to suitable students of technological education institutions would be a solution, particularly as many technological courses were comparable in content and standard to those given in universities.  The colleges of technology already produced science graduates and fully qualified architects and engineers as well as occasionally providing courses in specialised fields for their own and university personnel at post-graduate level.</P>
    <P>The Authority considered, however, that there was a basic difference in primary function between the universities and the technological institutes and that it would to a substantial extent be a departure from the nature and aim of a technological institution for it to have its curriculum and methods conform to university requirements.  The Authority mentioned also that a technological institution, while providing courses of degree standard for a certain proportion of its students, must also serve students who have completed an adequate post-primary <Col N="146" /> education, but have not fulfilled university entrance requirements, or may not desire to follow a university course but wish instead to proceed to third-level education in certain other specialised fields.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised, the Authority said, that technological education was not to be considered as confined to the teaching of industrial and commercial skills.  Every course of that kind should have an appropriate element of the humanities.  It was understood, however, that in the organising of this ancillary element the prospect of the practical applications in industry, commerce and the professions of the knowledge thus acquired had to be kept firmly in view.</P>
    <P>Having due regard to the considerations to which I have referred the Higher Education Authority came to the conclusion that if technological education were properly to serve its students and function in the fullest interest of the economy, a concrete step towards this should be the establishment of a council for national awards, with the safeguard that the standard of the diplomas and degrees awarded by it be in no way inferior to those of the universities.  It considered that the council should be given powers on the following lines:</P>
    <P>(1)  to grant certificates, diplomas and degress to persons who had successfully completed courses of study at third-level educational institutions other than universities;</P>
    <P>(2)  to determine the conditions governing the grant of such awards;</P>
    <P>(3)  to approve courses of study to be pursued in order to qualify for such awards, including, where appropriate, arrangements for industrial and commercial experience in association with such a source.</P>
    <P>Having considered the Report of the Higher Education Authority and all other relevant considerations the Government decided in February 1972 to set up the National Council for Educational Awards.  This council was <Col N="147" /> established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for a period of three years from March, 1972 with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Function</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  To promote, facilitate, encourage, co-ordinate and develop technical, industrial, commercial, technological, professional and scientifc education and, in association with these, liberal education.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Particular Functions</i>
    </P>
    <P>2.  To grant and confer certificates, diplomas, degress and other awards to and on persons who shall have pursued at educational institutions recognised by the council courses approved by it under conditions approved by it and who shall, to the satisfaction of the council, have passed examinations and/or other tests set or prescribed by the council appropriate to the courses of study as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>3.  To grant and confer certificates, diplomas, degrees and other awards to and on persons who at the time of the establishment of the council were pursuing at educational institutions courses of study approved by the council under conditions approved by it and who, subsequent to the establishment of the council shall to the satisfaction of the council have passed examinations and/or other tests set or prescribed by the council appropriate to the courses of study as aforesaid;</P>
    <P>4.  To award and confer degrees to and on persons who to the satisfaction of the council, shall have carried out research at a standard approved by the council under conditions approved by the council at or under the supervision of educational institutions;</P>
    <P>5.  To appoint from time to time such and so many boards of studies as it considers necessary for the proper exercise of its functions and to assign from time to time to these boards of studies the supervision of such areas of study as it may deem fit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> The <i>ad hoc</i> council consisted of a chairman, 21 ordinary members appointed by the Minister for Education, three additional ordinary members co-opted by the council by resolution and a director who was also a member of the council. The constitution of the 21 members appointed by the Minister was as follows:</P>
    <P>Seven members holding academic posts in universities;</P>
    <P>six members with teaching experience in a higher education institution other than a university, at least three of whom held teaching posts in such institutions;</P>
    <P>five members having experience in industry, agriculture, commerce, public administration or related fields;</P>
    <P>three members having experience in post primary education.</P>
    <P>In the first annual report, 1972/73, of the National Council for Educational Awards, the chairman in the foreword to the report stated that the establishment of the council marked an entirely new and very significant development in relation to third-level education in Ireland. He stated that for the first time in our history it was now possible to give authoritative national recognition and status to third level non-university educational institutions and to their students who passed examinations and tests of the standard approved by the council. This recognition was to be expressed in the national certificates, diplomas and degrees which the council was empowered to award.  The council believed that this would lead to a more widespread appreciation, both nationally and internationally, of the very important contribution made by these institutions to economic, social and cultural development and would significantly enhance their general standing.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition Government in connection with their decisions of 14 December 1974 on higher education decided that the National Council for Educational Awards should not be given the power to award degrees.  The council <Col N="149" /> as reconstituted in December 1975 was not formally given this power.  In view of the fact, however, that a degree level course in hotel and catering management in the regional technical college in Galway was already under way at the time of the reconstitution of the council and since no university was as yet in a position to validate the course in question, the National Council for Educational Awards was empowered to award degrees to students who successfully completed this course in 1976 and 1977.  The intention was, however, that in non-university institutions, where degrees were to be awarded to students, such awards were to be made by the universities.</P>
    <P>This was the situation when I became Minister for Education in 1977 and my first consideration had to be to set the situation right by restoring its degree awarding function to the NCEA and establishing an appropriate basis for the establishment of the council under statutory authority.  I now propose to summarise the main provisions of the Bill as it has been presented.  While for this purpose I shall refer to some sections of the Bill I do not propose to go into detail in relation to such sections beyond the point of indicating their relationship to the general purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should draw attention to the interpretation of institution in section 1 of the Bill.  It is stated that an institution to which this act applies means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  An Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha,</P>
    <P>(b)  the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin,</P>
    <P>(c)  the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick,</P>
    <P>(d)  Thomond College of Education, Limerick,</P>
    <P>(e)  any regional technical college,</P>
    <P>(f)  any institution specified by an order made under section 20 of the Act by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Since there is only one institution in <Col N="150" /> existence of the kind referred to at (a), (b), (c) and (d), it is appropriate that the name of the institution should be given. In the case of (e) the individual regional technical colleges are not named as they come under the composite definition of the category of colleges referred to.  The provision at (f) allows for the recognition of any other institutions specified in an order made by the Minister and is necessary to meet the situation of colleges to be included for the purpose of the acceptance by the NCEA of courses being followed in them whether these colleges are already in existence or whether they come into existence at a later date.  This degree of flexibility is necessary in the existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 2 states that the council shall be known in the Irish language as Comhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais and in the English language as the National Council for Educational Awards.  It is to perform the functions assigned it by this Act.</P>
    <P>The general functions of the council as set out in section 3 are to encourage, facilitate, promote, co-ordinate and develop technical, industrial, scientific, technological and commercial education, and education in art or design, provided outside the universities, whether professional, vocational or technical, and to encourage and promote liberal education.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 3 specifies some particular functions of the council. These include the function of conferring degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards to or on persons who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the Council is satisfied have attended or otherwise pursued or followed courses of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under supervision of, an institution to which the Act applies and which are courses which for the time being stand approved of by the council, and</P>
    <P>(2)  have either attained a standard regarded by the council as satisfactory in examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability <Col N="151" /> which are either prescribed or set by the council or which for the time being stand so approved of and relate to such courses or have performed in a manner regarded by the council as satisfactory other exercises approved of by the council, or</P>
    <P>(3)  the council is satisfied have attained an acceptable standard other than by way of (1) and (2) and have carried out under the supervision of an institution to which the Act applies and in a manner regarded as satisfactory by the council, a programme of research approved of by the council.</P>
    <P>The council may also recognise a degree, diploma, certificate or other educational award conferred, granted, or given to persons who successfully complete the courses referred to or approve of such courses of study or instruction if it is satisfied that the standard in general of both:</P>
    <P>(1)  a particular course of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of, an institution to which the Act applies and relating to professional, scientific or vocational education&mdash;which course may be concerned with liberal arts; and</P>
    <P>(2)  the examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability conducted in relation to such a course</P>
    <P>corresponds or is analogous to any relevant standards for the time being in force in universities.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 3 (2) states that the council may assess the standard maintained for the time being by any institution to which the Act applies as regards any course of study or instruction approved by the council.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of promoting degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards conferred by it, the council may:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> (1)  take such steps as it considers appropriate either within or outside the State,</P>
    <P>(2)  co-ordinate, or assist in co-ordinating, in such manner as it considers appropriate, any two or more courses of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of, one or more institutions to which the Act applies,</P>
    <P>(3)  for the purpose of enabling students to attend or otherwise pursue or follow particular courses, assist the transfer of students from one such institution to another such institution.</P>
    <P>I attach very considerable importance to these provisions in relation to the steps which the council may take to promote its degrees and other awards within or outside the State.  I may assure the council that it will have the full support of the Minister for Education in this matter.  I anticipate that it will have also the support of educational authorities and other professional groups which will be affected in relation to the recognition of qualifications awarded by the NCEA. I would expect that there would be no reluctance in regard to the promotion of these qualifications and advice to students to follow courses leading to them in substitution for qualifications which may have been sought after from outside the country hitherto.  This is because of the absence of the appropriate provisions for a fully satisfactory range of qualifications certified and available within the country.</P>
    <P>I consider it also extremely important that arrangements should be worked out to facilitate the transfer of students as appropriate from one institution to another and the co-ordination of courses between the regional technical colleges and the national institutes for higher education, as well as where appropriate the National College of Art and Design, and, in certain instances, the universities, to facilitate the students and secure the maximum opportunities for advancement throughout the whole range of third-level education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> It should be noted that under subsection (2) of section 3 the council may, through the higher education authority, advise the Minister in relation to the cost of providing, or continuing to provide, or the financing of any course of study or instruction approved of by the council or the cost of modifying any course of study or instruction to the extent necessary to secure its approval by the council.</P>
    <P>It will be generally accepted that the NCEA in planning and co-ordinating courses will need to take into account at the same time the financial consequences of such planning and co-ordination.  Under the Higher Education Act, 1971, the HEA has responsibility for advising the Minister of the need or otherwise for the establishment of new institutions of higher education and the nature and form of these institutions and it must also maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education. It is appropriate, accordingly, that it is through the Higher Education Authority that the council would advise the Minister in relation to the cost of providing or financing of courses approved by it or the cost of modifying any courses of study or instruction to the extent necessary to secure its approval by the council.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) provides that the Minister may by order assign additional functions of a kindred nature to the council but any such order cannot be brought into force until a resolution approving of the draft order has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas. Section 3 (4) requires the council to endeavour to promote the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture. Section 3 (5) confirms the validity of acts done by the present council in so far as they relate to awards made and courses approved of.</P>
    <P>The Council is to consist of a chairman, the director and 23 other members. Section 5 sets out the procedure for the appointment of the members of the council other than the chairman and director.  In this connection I should <Col N="154" /> emphasise that the provision made in this article is for the purpose of establishing a council which would be best able to discharge the functions being assigned to it under section 3.  The individual members are not being appointed to promote the particular individual interest of any separate institution and their allegiance is to the council and not to the institution on the recommendation of which they may have been appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Any division of representation on the council will be criticised on one basis or another.  Tá sé seo ráite cheana féin agam as Gaeilge.  I have tried to create the situation in which representation on the council will be as broadly based as possible and give fair representation to both educational interests and those involved in the economic life of the country. I feel that the formula which is proposed in the Bill will ensure in so far as that is possible, that we get the balance right.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that nine of the 23 members other than the chairman and the director shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister and it is subsequently provided that before making a recommendation under the section the Minister shall consider to what extent industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce, any of the professions or the management, staff and students of any institution to which the Act applies need representation on the council.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining members, two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin; two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick; two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of Thomond College of Education, Limerick; one shall be appointed on the recommendation of the National College of Art and Design; four shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from amongst those who are members of the staff of any university in the State or of any constituent or <Col N="155" /> recognised college of such a university, and finally, three shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from amongst those who are members of the governing or managing body or of the staff or student body of any institution to which the Act applies.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the council may establish boards of studies.  It may request a board of studies to make, in relation to specified subjects, courses of study or specified branches, areas, aspects or other divisions of education or research, recommendations to the council concerning any one or more of the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  the courses of study or instruction therein to be followed by persons for the purpose of obtaining an educational award from the council;</P>
    <P>(b)  standards to be maintained as regards any such course or other conditions subject to or in accordance with which any such course is to be conducted;</P>
    <P>(c)  the standards to be applied and maintained in relation to examinations or tests undertaken by persons attending or otherwise pursuing or following any such course.</P>
    <P>In relation to making recommendations to the council, the board of studies has to have particular regard to the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  the standard of the work and the facilities for the time being available at any institution at which the course of study or instruction being considered is conducted or at which it is proposed to have the course being considered conducted, as may be appropriate;</P>
    <P>(b)  the curriculum and syllabus of the courses of study or instruction being considered;</P>
    <P>(c)  the requisite qualifications or the proposed qualifications of persons conducting the course;</P>
    <P>(d)  the arrangements and facilities provided, or to be provided, for the <Col N="156" /> practical training of persons attending or otherwise pursuing or following the course;</P>
    <P>(e)  the arrangements and facilities provided, or to be provided, for the examination or testing of the persons concerned;</P>
    <P>(f) the standards required or proposed for admission to such courses and</P>
    <P>(g) the standard required or proposed for the award of any degree, diploma, certificate, or other educational award at the conclusion or at any other stage of the course.</P>
    <P>The following very important proviso is also included.  A board of studies in making recommendations in relation to the standard required or proposed for admission to a course for, or for the conferring, granting or giving of a degree, diploma, certificate or other educational award, shall have regard to any corresponding standard required by a university in the State and shall not recommend a standard which is lower than such a standard, if any.  I have already on other occasions indicated that I anticipate and expect that the NCEA will pay particular attention to maintaining the standard of its awards whether at degree, diploma or certificate level, and I now repeat the emphasis which I desire to place on this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>By way of conclusion to this introduction of the Second Reading of the Bill, I desire to draw attention to a statement of a former Minister for Education, Deputy Padraig Faulkner, in his address to the National Council for Educational Awards on the occasion of the inaugural meeting of the council on 11 April 1972, and to my own statement of 18 November 1977, announcing that the NCEA would be the degree awarding authority in the case of students who successfully complete degree level courses in the national institutes for higher education, in Limerick and Dublin and in Thomond College of Education, Limerick and in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Faulkner, stated <Col N="157" /> that the existing system of awards could neither continue to meet the needs of existing colleges, nor had it any prospect of extension to fulfil the requirements of a third-level non-university sector which was significantly expanded by the addition of the regional technical colleges, the College of Physical Education and the Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  He also stated that the achievement of a national self-sufficiency in this area appeared to be a desirable objective in itself and one which could be realised by pooling the expertise of people from the universities, from technical and general education, from industry, from business, from the professions, and from research.</P>
    <P>In my own statement of 18 November 1977, I stated that the Government, having had an opportunity of considering all aspects of the matter, were convinced that the best interests of the universities and the NIHE, Limerick and Thomond College of Education would be served by restoring to the National Council for Educational Awards the power to award degrees in the case of NIHE and Thomond College of Education.  This would afford the NIHE and Thomond College of Education the flexibility and freedom which, with the support of the NCEA, would enable them to develop to the fullest extent programmes, the foundations of which have been firmly laid during the course of their association with the universities.</P>
    <P>I stressed that a serious responsibility rested with the NCEA to ensure that the degree awards granted to students who successfully completed courses in the institutions for which the Government decided they should be the awarding body were comparable in value and esteem with similar awards granted by other degree awarding authorities, on the basis of comparable courses at home and abroad.  This was a task which presented to the NCEA a challenge which the Government felt confident they would meet responsibly and wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>The NCEA were first established by a Fianna Fáil Government in the full conviction <Col N="158" /> that they would make an extremely valuable contribution to the progress of education in this country.  It is on the basis of the same conviction that I recommend this Bill to the House establishing the council on a statutory basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this National Council for Educational Awards Bill 1978.  We agree in principle with the introduction of the Bill and the giving of statutory effect to the work which had been carried on up to this by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee established in 1972.  The background to this is a revolution in education, especially since the advent of free third-level education.  I particularly welcome this Bill because since so many people are going through third-level education many problems have developed.  The essential problem seemed to be that it was every mother's wish to have her son or daughter go to university and qualify with the magic handle of a degree after their names; and all the benefits of a good life that would follow from that.  We are having a crisis in education today as a result of these types of attitudes for which the Government are not responsible.  This is a human attitude.</P>
      <P>I welcome the upgrading and in-stitutionalising of technological education under the Bill.  We are beginning to learn that technological education is extremely important.  Looking at the crisis in universities today and the problems relating to the employment of those who qualify in Arts disciplines, when we see the extent of industrial development and the hope that such industrial development gives to future generations, it is time we gave due recognition to technological education.  We are going to see a reaction against the attitudes of the last ten or 15 years with more and more young people coming to realise the value of the type of education we are speaking about this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the flaws in the language in this Bill, and to an extent one or two sections of the Minister's speech, is the extent <Col N="159" /> to which I detect a type of inferiority within this sector, <i>vis-á-vis</i> university education, because he makes reference in three or four places in the Bill and in his speech to the necessity for standards emanating from the technological section which must be equal to universities. It is not a question of standards being equal to the universities, it is a question of standards being standards that are applicable to the institutes in question.  I do not think this obsession with what is happening within the universities is necessarily relevant.  We want standards that may even exceed those in universities. The choice of language in harping on the university syndrome is a little undesirable.</P>
    <P>A very broad aspect does not relate to the <i>minutiae</i> of the Bill.  It has a little to do with democracy, because we are giving the council very sweeping powers.  In section 3, for example, the general functions of the council are to encourage, to facilitate, to promote, to co-ordinate and to develop technical, industrial, scientific, technological and commercial education, and education in art or design, provided outside the universities, whether professional, vocational or technical, and to encourage and promote liberal education.  This is a vast, awesome and powerful function.  One of the problems we are learning in the country in recent years is that we are having a crisis in democracy.  We have found, through the development of many of our semi-State bodies, a situation in which at the inaugurative stage of such semi-State bodies, when the national mood in 1927 or 1932 or 1935 seemed to indicate that a semi-State body should be established to perform a particular function which seemed valid in those years, we gave those bodies very substantial powers.  We shielded them from the Oireachtas by the trappings under which the Oireachtas is arranged and under which the Government function here. We find that these semi-State institutes have become embedded in a groove, and the yardsticks by which they were founded have changed.  Feather-bedding can <Col N="160" /> exist to a certain extent.  Attitudes should have changed but have not and there are all kinds of other problems.  In many cases the bodies which have been established 20-30 years, are not performing today as efficiently as they might in the national interest.  If there were more cross-fertilisation there might well be reason why many people working in such sectors could usefully be working in the interests of the State, but in sectors other than those for which they were created.</P>
    <P>We are talking about technological education today.  We are giving this council very substantial powers.  By the grace of God they will do a very good job.  If the State is fortunate to have a competent Minister in charge of education during the tenure of the council, there should be a measure of democratic control over the council.  Should the council not carry out their function as envisaged by the Government and by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the country would be badly served.  We must give thought to the development of more committee work within the Oireachtas. Our existing committees are working within limits in relation to personnel and the facilities which are available to Members of the Oireachtas.  The democratic principle of control and liaison, of consultation and dialogue, could equally exist in the field of education as it does in relation to semi-State bodies, the EEC and many other areas of State activity.  I suggest to the Minister that his Government give some thought to this issue as we see the council developing.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a simple one.  It was dealt with in detail on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  It gives statutory existence to the-<i>ad hoc</i> body which had existed for some years.  I should like to take the opportunity to compliment the <i>ad hoc</i> body on their excellent work in uplifting technological education and on the extent to which they were able to inform the people of the work which they have been doing.  The growth of the regional technical colleges and other institutes for which they have been responsible has been a remarkable development and is <Col N="161" /> filling an obvious gap.  The <i>ad hoc</i> committee were established in 1972 and worked under three different Governments in difficult circumstances and they did a very good job.  Evidence of their good work is the constitution of the new council in the broadest terms.  We have argued about the functions of the council, whether it should come under the heading of the comprehensive third-level sector or whether it should be in a binary situation.  The Minister has opted for the binary method.  There are merits in the comprehensive route and there are merits in the binary route.  We are living in a very small country with only three million people and we should not become too absorbed in arguments about the system.  It seems that in both instances there are advantages and disadvantages.</P>
    <P>The disadvantages in the comprehensive system relate to the technological sector being under the umbrella of the universities which have existed for a long time and have more academic and financial clout.  The weakness in the binary system is that whilst the technological sector is being given the chance to breathe and grow, which is a good thing, we will not get the cross-fertilisation that is necessary and desirable between the technological institutes and the universities.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for his commitment to this cross-fertilisation, to the possibility that students in the different areas of learning in the technological institutes will be able to attend university.  At the same time, it is merely the Minister's view in November 1979, and I do not know if the Bill provides adequate cover for this matter. It may well do so in so far as the council's commitment to this type of cross-fertilisation is concerned.  However, under the binary system we are dealing with universities which are not covered by this Bill.  They may not accept the Minister's view of their obligations in this regard, and I would welcome the Minister's comments in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to <Col N="162" /> the possibilities of technological students going into universities for different reasons.  This is something we would need to look at in two ways.  The present trend in employment means that there will be more scope for people to move from the universities into these institutes than in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>The question of membership of the council is a thorny one.  The composition in broad terms is equivalent to the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement and we are not quibbling with it, but it is naive of the Minister to express the view that those members who have been nominated by their various bodies&mdash;the regional technical colleges, the colleges in Dublin or the universities&mdash;should represent the council and not their own institute.  In the first instance, they have been appointed by the Minister to represent the council in the broadest sense.  Under the system which the Minister has set, whereby the members will be nominated by the various institutions, it seems a bit naive to expect that they will not bear in mind the interests of their own institutions.  The institutes themselves will have their own interests naturally at heart.  In nominating people to represent them on the council they are going to have regard to the kind of people who would best represent their interests.  There is nothing wrong with this.  It is similar to the EEC where we have a Commissioner appointed by the Government to represent the community in the broadest possible sense.  However, we hope that the Commissioner will remember that he comes from this country and will bear its special interests in mind.</P>
    <P>I share the view of some other Senators that the director should not be a member of the council.  The director should be subject to the decisions of the council and should attend all meetings of the council which he is requested to attend.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which deals with the upgrading of an essential part of education.  In his speech the Minister quoted the chairman of the National Council in 1972-1973.  The Chairman stated that the establishment of the council <Col N="163" /> marked an entirely new and very significant development in relation to third-level education and that for the first time in our history it was possible to give authoritative national recognition and status to third-level non-university education institutions and to their students. I wholeheartedly concur with that view.  We will not be negligent in supporting the Government in any development in this sector.</P>
    <P>There is only one wide gap at present which needs attention.  We are talking about the technological institutes, but in terms of education in the broadest sense and personal development, a great many people have not had the opportunity to attend universities or technological institutions; indeed, many people have not had the opportunity to attend secondary school.  There is a great will to learn and a great interest in adult education.  The closing of these gaps should give us a more comprehensive educational policy.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos caithfidh mé an óráid bhreá chumasach seo a thréaslú leis an Aire féin.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuaireamar, ó tháinig mé isteach sa Teach seo pe scéal é, óráid chomh maith leis an cheann a fuaireamar inniu.  Ceithre is fiche leathanach agus gach aon abairt agus foabairt ar fheabhas.  Tá abairt amháin ann a léíríonn croí an fhir féin, an dtogras agus an cumas atá sa bhfear, agus an tsuim a chuireann sé in a chuid oibre. Deir sé:</P>
      <P>Má chuimhnítear orm in aon chor sna blianta atá le teacht, tá súil agam gur i leith an Bhille seo a chuimhneofar orm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dar ndóigh, dá mba rud é gur Chú Chulainn féin a bhí in a Aire Oideachais i láthair na huaire seo ní fhéadfadh sé dul ar aghaidh níos fearr ná san.  Is Bille antábhachtach ar fad an Bille seo.  Is cuimhin libh sa bhliain 1908 ritheadh Acht agus de thoradh an Achta sin bunaíodh an Ollscoil Náisiúnta.  Ní dóigh liom féin ó shin i leith gur ritheadh Bille ar bith ar aon tábhacht leis an mBille atá <Col N="164" /> os ár gcomhair anseo anocht.  Ins an ráiteas a thug an tAire Oideachais thug sé staid na cúise ó thosach, an fás a tháinig ar an Chomhairle, agus diaidh ar ndiaidh a tháinig an fás san.  D'fhéadfá a rá go raibh stad ann go ceann tamaill, le linn tréimhse áirithe.  Ansan tháinig an Rialtas nua isteach i gcumhacht agus tháinig an tAire Oideachais isteach leis agus ó shin i leith d'fhás an smaoineamh, d'fhás an Bille go hantapaidh, agus tá an Bille os ár gcomhair anocht agus is mian liomsa cúpla rud beag a rá mar gheall air.  Tá an staid tugtha ag an Aire.  Ní gá dul siar air sin.  Tá fás agus forbairt na teicneolaíochta ag teastáil go géar ón ár dtírín beag seo.  Tír beag, tír na hÉireann agus is ar intleacht mhuintir na hÉireann, ar dhíogras mhuintir na hÉireann, ar mhisneach mhuintir na hÉireann agus ar scileanna mhuintir na hÉireann atá todhchaí na tíre seo ag brath.  I gcónaí riamh bhí cáil agus clú ar na cearduithe seo againne.  Siar, siar tríd na haoiseanna agus fiú amháin ins an bhéaloideas féin cantar agus instear scéalta agus labhartar na cearduithe iontacha a bhí againn, na cearduithe, na dealbhóirí, lucht deartha agus tá feabhas a gcuid oibre siúd le feiceáil sna sean chaisleáin, na sean-mhainistreacha agus mar sin de. Bhí na scileanna acu.  Tá an-intleacht ag muintir na hÉireann ach é d'oibriú go ceart, go cruinn agus go héifeachtach agus go críostúil.</P>
    <P>In his commendable introduction the Minister gave us the story that led up to the presentation of this Bill.  It is an interesting story and it shortens the amount of speech-making that would otherwise be necessary here tonight.  On a Bill such as this it would be necessary to get the background first and present it bit by bit in an orderly fashion so that people could understand what led up to the formation and the presentation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It has to do mostly with the development, the teaching and the fostering of technological education.  Section 3 (1) of the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>The functions of the Council shall be generally to encourage, facilitate, promote, co-ordinate and develop <Col N="165" /> technical, industrial, scientific, technological and commercial education, and education in art or design, provided outside the universities, whether professional, vocational or technical, and to encourage and promote liberal education.</P>
    <P>That section of the Bill possibly answers most of our economic problems for decades and decades to come.  Skills are wanted, never more so than at this time.  I never saw that quite so clearly as I did during the International Apprenticeship competitions which were held in Cork recently.  We had the cream of apprentices from all over the world competing for the highest honours in the world championships in 34 or 35 different trades.  I went there with thousands of others to see what went on.  I was so fascinated that I could hardly tear myself away from it.  When I saw those young boys and girls showing their skills, their absolute dedication to achieving perfection in the trades of their choice, I was delighted.  I came home elated.  The night of the presentation of awards I saw how well our own little country did with its limited number of entries.  Curiously enough, the major awards went to the far eastern countries&mdash;China, Japan, Taiwan&mdash;and some of the European countries from which we expected great results did not come up to the same standard.  The people in Japan, China and Taiwan are anxious to get ahead and they dedicate themselves to achieving perfection in so far as it is possible to achieve perfection at the human level.  Starting with our present generations of young boys and girls, future generations have a wonderful chance to achieve perfection in skills.  As a race, we can be very skilful.  We have a tradition of tradesmen, sculptors and so on.  Wonderful work was done by our artists and tradesmen, in regard to such things as cut stone, high crosses and so on.  We are a most adaptable and imaginative race and we can produce the results if we make up our minds to do so.</P>
    <P>As the body without the spirit is dead, so also are high skills and technology unless accompanied by what we badly <Col N="166" /> want at the moment&mdash;dedication to work; working not for the sake of money but working for the sake of the work in order to produce perfection, create more employment and a decent living, not alone for ourselves but for our brothers, our sisters and the rest of the country. Unless that spirit is inculcated during the teaching hours and hours of instruction, the results will not be what we hope they will be.  Education must not be confused with instruction.  People can be instructed to carry out certain skills, but where will it lead us if all these skills are only used to make more and more money for people themselves to the exclusion of their brothers.  I hope these points will be borne in mind by the HEA and by the council.  Not by bread alone doth man live.</P>
    <P>This is the year in which we commemorate Pádraig Pearse.  What would Pearse say if he were here today?  He would refer to the three great things that he regarded as being basic as far as education is concerned&mdash;fostering the right ideas; having discipline and inspiring people to achieve their highest potential. The only way in which a high potential can be achieved is to develop one's own potential and cultivate the attributes of charity, co-operation, loyalty and practical patriotism.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the final page of his speech:</P>
    <P>I stressed that a serious responsibility rested with the NCEA to ensure that the degree awards granted to students who successfully completed courses in institutions for which the Government decided it should be the awarding body were comparable in value and esteem with similar awards granted by other degree-awarding authorities, on the basis of comparable courses at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I hope that point will be borne in mind because from time to time we have complaints of certain university degrees and so on awarded here not being recognised abroad.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>This was a task which presented to the NCEA a challenge which the <Col N="167" /> Government felt confident it would meet responsibly and wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Government will.  The Government have always done it and the present Government will continue to do so.  For the seven years that the NCEA have been in operation on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis&mdash;from now on it will be on a statutory basis&mdash;extraordinarily good work has been done.  I cannot commend too highly the college nearest to my home, which is the Cork Regional Technical College, where extremely good work has been done in the short time of its existence.  It has a devoted principal and staff.  Many of my former students and pupils who went there are very pleased with the progress they have made and with the courses in the college.</P>
    <P>In all these institutions facilities should be made available for liberal courses, for courses of instruction in cultural matters.  I cannot commend the Minister too highly for including section 3 (4) in this Bill which reads:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions the Council shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>We must always bear that in mind.  We are a small country.  We have to depend on our skills and abilities.  We must bear in mind at all times the idea of preserving our culture and skills.  One of the curses of this country at the moment is this rash of selfishness and jealousy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that great progress has been made by the NCEA.  As proof of that I was delighted to read in yesterday's <i>Cork Examiner</i> a report of a speech made by the Chairman of the NCEA, Dr. Tom Walsh, when presenting awards at Carlow's Regional Technical College.  Dr. Walsh said that when this year's programme of conferring ceremonies was completed the NCEA would, since 1972, have given 10,000 awards, the majority of them in engineering, science and business study. <Col N="168" /> That is a remarkable achievement, agus mar fhocail scoir, guím gach rath ar Chomhairle na gCailíochtaí Oideachais agus guím gach rath agus fad saol ar an Aire Oideachais féin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which, in upgrading the work of the NCEA, is also a very significant step in the organisation and progress of education. The NCEA have had their ups and downs but with the introduction of this Bill, I hope their course will be smooth from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the function of education to help people towards self-fulfilment or is it the function of education to help people to fulfil a vital role in society?  These two aims are, not always in complete harmony with each other; in fact they can quite often be in direct conflict with each other.  There is no doubt that we have a high percentage of young people in our population.  A young population which has not been given the skills which the country needs for its development would be an extremely unhappy population and one which would, once again, take to the emigrant ship.  This is something which we hoped had long ceased to be an important feature of life for us.  Because of this concern for the future planning of society's needs, I am slightly worried about the composition of the NCEA.  In reading the report of the NCEA for 1977-1978, I notice that there were 30 members.  Among them there were one architect and people involved in the IMI. The rest of the people, including those appointed by the Minister, were all either academics or involved in the administration of academic institutions&mdash;people from VEC's, regional technical colleges and officials generally.  There were a number of practical people on the various boards of studies and ancillary boards.  There was a high level of nonindustrial people who could not be described as being involved in the production end of the economic system. There is a great need, which has not been realised, for a high degree of rapport between education on one side and industry on the other.  I hope that the functions of the NCEA as defined in this Bill do not <Col N="169" /> exclude branching into research and co-ordination in consultation with industry.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this Bill that there will be a chairman, director and 23 other members.  Nine of those will be directly appointed by the Minister and there are seven other appointments by the Minister but he is limited in those seven appointments.  I hope that of the nine who will be appointed by the Minister there will be an extremely strong element from industry, people who will be able to sit down and work out the future needs of industry and how we are going to channel people into fulfilling a vital role for Ireland and into self-fulfilment at the same time.</P>
    <P>There is very little use in producing 2,000 people with a degree in business administration if there is no business for them to administer.  When I say that I am echoing the sentiments of many groups, particularly those involved in the furthering of industry and employer groups, who have been saying again and again that the emphasis must now shift towards providing the kind of expertise that industry needs.  We are all aware at this time of high unemployment that there is a great shortage of skilled workers.  It is a feature that is mentioned again and again.  There has to be co-ordination particularly in the area covered by the NCEA.  There should be, of course, co-ordination in university education.  That has been very much lacking, and as a result we have many problems for faculties and difficulties about admitting people to faculties because there are too many people with qualifications.  In the composition of the council, there is an extraordinarily strong argument to be made for involving people from industry.</P>
    <P>In any Bill or document that comes before us to do with education, there is one question which must be asked when we talk about institutes or constituent colleges of universities.  Section 5 (1) (f) states that the Minister may appoint people from:</P>
    <P>those who are members of the staff of any university of the State, or any college or institution which is a constituent <Col N="170" /> college of, or is recognised by, such a university ...or institution standing for the time being designated for the purposes of this section by the Minister,</P>
    <P>What is the standing of Maynooth at present in this type of list of recognised colleges?  We were informed by the Supreme Court last week that Maynooth is a seminary.  What is the status now of Maynooth when it comes to choosing people from universities or constituent colleges?  It is a question which will arise again and again in any legislation on education, particularly higher education, and is one which must be faced up to.</P>
    <P>In the composition of people in the 1977-1978 NCEA, there was only one woman.  Women have played and do play an important role in education.  Unfortunately, they have not made it to the top.  They are not the voices that are listened to, neither in the Department of Education nor in many other areas.  One does not find them heading large Departments. This means they are excluded when it comes to the formation of such bodies as the NCEA.  The greatest under-utilised natural resource of this country is its women.  I would ask the Minister, in the 16 appointments he will be making to the NCEA, to pay particular attention to the role that women have to play and have played in education.  The Commission for the Status of Women report was extremely strong on how the country had been held back by the single sex education we have and continue to have to a large extent and by the channelling of women into very narrow areas despite the fact that they show, in second level, that they are equal in every respect and better than men students at Leaving Certificate level.  Special efforts have to be made in every appointment area, and I hope that we will shortly see an improvement on one woman in 30 members of the NCEA.</P>
    <P>I welcome the document which was brought out in May 1978 on recurrent education.  The NCEA brought out this document.  They also refer to it as permanent education which was obviously a translation of <i>éducation permanente</i><Col N="171" /> used by the French.  It was a significant and welcome document because an incursion by the NCEA in the growing and dynamic field of adult education would be extremely useful.  It is an area which needs investigation and a new status.  I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss this very shortly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to follow the example of his colleague the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and get the best brains of industry and the academic world to help in running the country, to complement and strengthen the brains in our civil service.  I hope this will be possible for the Minister to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as being a Member of this House I happen to be a Chancellor of a university.  In both capacities I express a warm welcome for this Bill.  The Minister in his opening statement referred to the Higher Education Authority's original report on technological and other specialised third level courses.  He mentioned that they said it was possible that, at first glance, it might be thought that amending legislation which would enable universities to give degrees or other appropriate awards to suitable students of technological education institutions would be a solution, particularly as many technological courses were comparable in content and standard to those given in the universities. I agree with the Higher Education Authority in discarding that view and in recognising that there was&mdash;I might not go as far as the Authority in saying a basic difference in &ldquo;primary function&rdquo; between universities and technological institutions as they did but, at least a difference in orientation and purpose which justifies their having separate but, I would hope, closely co-operative, development possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which the Higher Education Authority considered very desirable and which I would like to emphasise is that technological education should not be confined to the teaching of industrial and commercial skills but that every course of that kind <Col N="172" /> should have an appropriate element of the humanities.  This point was well brought out in a remarkable recent lecture by Professor Patrick Lynch, who was also Chairman of the OECD study group on Investment in Education.  In the seventh Robert Kane lecture he said:</P>
    <P>Mankind can enjoy the myriad benefits of technology only if its origins, development and possibilities are fully understood ... the technologist must constantly be aware of this philosophical framework within which he is working.</P>
    <P>The obverse to that, of course, which Professor Lynch also brought out, is that the academic person must also be aware of the technological environment in which he is working.  He put it much better when he said:</P>
    <P>I believe that academic adaptation is essential if universities are to humanise society.</P>
    <P>So even if there be, in the interest of both, some degree of separate development, each&mdash;the purely academic and predominantly technological forms of education&mdash;needs the support of the other if we are to have a humanised society.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given for having a separate system of awarding degrees and diplomas was that it was a serious impediment to the upgrading and extension of technological education, and hence to its attraction for potential students, that there was no such range of national awards.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another impediment which is worth considering and which I am sure is engaging the Minister's attention, namely, that at second level, where one would hope interest would be stimulated in the pursuit of further knowledge, there is probably still in Ireland must too great an emphasis on purely academic education. There is need to do more than we are doing to up-grade the status of vocational and technical education.  I was privileged within the last year or so to be invited by two teaching orders, one male and one female, to sit in with them <Col N="173" /> in their consideration of educational policy in their secondary schools over the next five or ten years.  I was very pleased to find that one of the main considerations engaging their attention was the point that the country's development requirements would suggest that there be a greater emphasis on technology rather than purely academic and administrative pursuits.  They were wondering how they could best contribute to this.  Both these orders, I was glad to see, intend to do something, through their influence on parents and through their influence on children, to upgrade the status of technical education and make it more attractive for children to follow as a learning process.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Bill which sets up the National Council for Educational Awards will be accompanied and supported by a greater emphasis at the second level of education on technical or technological studies&mdash;not to the exclusion of academic pursuits, of course, because it is very important to know the principles, the why as well as the how, but so that there will be a better balance and a better co-operative reaction between these two forms of education in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak too highly of the Bill.  It is very satisfactory and takes us out of the doldrums in which third level education has laboured over the past few years.  The need for this kind of education has been identified for quite a long time.  As regards the obsession with university education as the only kind of third level education acceptable, that notion will take a long time to die.  There is a great deal of prejudice of that kind.  If that prejudice can be dispelled it is by this kind of structure.  The drafting of the Bill is a credit to the Department and to the draftsmen who put it together.  I like the fact that while the practical functional aspect of education is strongly stressed&mdash;it clearly is the senior partner in this kind of education&mdash;the junior partner of a liberal education&mdash;the importance of humanities&mdash;gets sufficient emphasis too.  It would be dreadful if the <Col N="174" /> specialisation in technological and practical utilitarian concerns were carried out to the exclusion of the humanising disciplines of poetry, history and literature in general.  I am glad to see that in the Minister's speech and in the Bill the importance of that humanising function is acknowledged and catered for.</P>
      <P>The other aspect of the Bill that is of great importance is that one can look forward now to a creative tension between the two systems, the NCEA graduates and the university graduates, that will act as a sort of fertile ground for emulation and proper rivalry between the two.  Even more so I look forward to an increasing degree of co-operation. The public may not be aware of the degree of co-operation that already exists. I do not know how widely known it is that if a student passes his first year in an NCEA institution in the regional colleges of technology or in the NIHE with credit, it entitles him to enter university and by-pass matriculation.  That is very important.  There are many bright students who go through secondary and vocational education and due to bad luck, to the fact that they may be late developers, that they may be sick at the time or there may be some domestic difficulties that put them off their stroke, they may not matriculate.  We know this. There are hundreds of very bright children who are not able to make it into the universities.  It is a rather heartbreaking situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be well publicised that this is another way.  It is a way towards an admirable degree, an NCEA award degree, but it is also a means of getting into a university. In other words a good first year's work can entitle them to transfer. That is one form of transfer that is possible and it is happening a good deal.  It is remarkable how well these students do when they go into university.  I understand that in one year in Galway in the honours class, I think it was in science, the first three places went to somebody who had transferred from the regional technical college.  In other words, the standards are there.  The personnel is excellent and this kind of transfer is <Col N="175" /> already going on with the co-operation and goodwill of the universities.  There may be some elements in the universities that are a bit reluctant about it but, by and large, the degree of co-operation is remarkable.</P>
    <P>I have experience of this because I teach in a university and my discipline involves a very large graduate programme in Anglo-Irish literature. Over the past ten years or so there has been a substantial number, it is a minority, but a number of students who have come from polytechnics, particularly in Northern Ireland.  If they get a high degree there and come to the top, they come and do the MA and their degree of achievement is very high.  It is as good as anything that one will get from our own university, in some respects higher.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the NCEA degree as being in no way a second class citizen.  It is just another kind of degree, and that is the kind of hortatory thing I should like to stress.  It is probably unnecessary to draw the Minister's attention to it, but it is something we should keep in our minds.  The excellence of these degrees depends on the standard being very high.  That is very obvious, it is a truism.  They must never be allowed to be seen as anything but of the first excellence. In order to do that it is essential that the awards be only awarded on the highest, most meritorious standards and criteria and that it never comes to be seen as the easy way out, as a second best.  The really big challenge there is in the appointment of personnel.</P>
    <P>There is an incredible pool of teaching talent at present and a great number of them unemployed.  There are Ph.Ds going a begging.  All Ph.Ds do not necessarily make good teachers but there are a lot of very good people around.  It is of the utmost importance that appointments to these positions, both in the NIHEs and in the regional colleges of technology, be made with roughly the same standard in mind as the universities should have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> There is a very bad tradition of nepotism in Ireland.  It is happily on the way out but there is a backlog of political influence, family influence and all kinds of skullduggery with regard to the making of appointments.  That should not be yielded to for a moment.  Now is the time to make a firm resolution about it.  The personnel appointed to these institutions should be of the very highest academic standard, so much so that they will generate their own standard of excellence and that it will be regarded as a considerable honour to be appointed to the staff of one of them, as a distinction equal to the distinction of serving on the staff of a university.  That can be done, but there is only one way to do it, by an absolutely puritan attention to standards and absolutely impartial academic criteria in the appointment of such people.</P>
    <P>As these are colleges of technology and as the technological or the utilitarian side of education will be stressed rather more than the merely disinterested pursuit of knowledge, as it is called in the trade, research will have to go hand in hand with teaching.  There necessarily are laboratories there.  There is a great deal of what they call sophisticated educational hardware around, but the resources for research should be made available so that bright people teaching in these institutions would have facilities and money for research.  If they have that kind of bent, if they are research people, they should get fairly generous time off in order to pursue research side by side with their teaching.  Teaching alone shrivels up.  It tends to get attenuated and bloodless if it is not backed up by research, by the pursuit of knowledge, by the obsessive concern of the individual with his own subject. In other words, they must never be seen merely as teaching institutions.  The research element of them should be developed.  In this, there could be a very great deal of creative competition with the universities.</P>
    <P>The third point is also important. Senator Whitaker referred to it and that is that as regards the second level of <Col N="177" /> education some policy will have to evolve with regard to making them aware of what is available in these NCEA's degrees.  What I mean is that university graduates would not be human if they did not prefer university degrees.  It will be important that they do not infect their pupils with a sense of the superiority of the university degree over this.  Instead they should make their students aware of the difference.  It is not just career guidance, because career guidance sometimes puts people into wrong paths, but the teachers themselves could be able to spot the kind of boy or girl and say: &ldquo;That child would be much better off in the long run going for an NCEA degree than going into a university&rdquo;. The consciousness of the double choice will have to percolate downwards into the schools.  I do not quite know how the Minister can set about doing this, but it has to percolate down.  There is a good deal of prejudice to be overcome, because secondary schools as distinct from vocational schools are manned almost exclusively by university graduates who suffer from the same kind of prejudice that anybody else will&mdash;the prejudice in favour of the kind of background that they themselves had.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey made an interesting point when she spoke about the question of adult education.  It has not really been tackled properly in this country at all. The report on adult education is still gathering dust and nothing has been done about it.  The Murphy Report is all of eight years old now.  The universities have done a little.  My own university&mdash;if I may blow its trumpet a little&mdash;has done a great deal with regard to night degrees.  It is the only university institution in Dublin that does night degrees, and it has the biggest extra-mural programme in these islands.  Quite brilliant and one of the great success stories of modern Ireland is that extraordinary UCD extra-mural programme which involves literally thousands of people in the evening who are hungry for education: adults, women who have reared their families and now have a little time on their hands&mdash;all kinds of people come to these courses, but, of course, it <Col N="178" /> is only people in the metropolitan area who can avail themselves of these courses.</P>
    <P>These regional colleges and these institutes are obviously very well positioned in order to cater for that need. It has to be a secondary need.  They have to get the first thing first, the actual central problem of educating their own under-graduate students.  Obviously they could become great centres of cultural energy in different parts of the country, and this is a consideration which should be very much borne in mind by anybody in charge of that area.</P>
    <P>I read the Bill very aggressively and listened quite critically to the Minister's speech.  Credit should be given where credit is due.  This is really an excellent Bill.  If it is put into operation with the same elegance as it has been defined for us here, it can enable a very major contribution to be made to the life of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">

      <P>In the past we were concerned mainly with agriculture.  In recent years we have introduced some agricultural education, but maybe not enough yet.  The population is growing and, therefore, to be able to get jobs for this growing population, we have to enter industry.  Therefore we have to concentrate on the field of technical and technological education.  I am not an academic.  When I prepared myself for life I went through technical and technological education, but I had to go outside this country to get it.  Today I am very glad to say that we can be gratified by the advance we have made in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in Cork there was evidence of this, in that we were able to put on the international apprenticeship competition. This showed the interest in technical education not alone in this country but in other developing countries.  In fact, our group did very well, but the country which took the most gold medals was Korea.  We should be gratified that we had the buildings, the equipment and the staff to be able to put on this competition. I regret to say it did not get the <Col N="179" /> publicity it deserved.  Within the past fortnight we had graduation day at the Cork Regional Technical College and numbers of students got their diplomas and certificates.  It was significant that so many of them got their diplomas and certificates <i>in absentia.</i>  In other words, they had already got jobs before they received their certificate or diploma.  This is an island and of all those who got diplomas in the marine sector only one was present.  All the rest of them were literally at sea.</P>
    <P>We have developed our technical and technological education.  I more than welcome this Bill because it is a move to give it the status it should have.  I support everything Senator Martin said.  I should also like to say that business is taking an interest in this advancement.  Recently there was a publication on careers in industry by the confederation of Irish Industry which would interest students in going in for technological education rather than academic education in the university.  I welcome the Bill and I agree with Senator Whitaker that, if we can improve the status of technological education we should do so to make it acceptable to those who wish to go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the six speakers who contributed to the debate on this Bill to establish by statute the National Council for Educational Awards.  I made some notes and I will try to deal with the points made by the various Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Staunton indicated that he felt some of the wording of the Bill showed the Bill as thinking of technology as something inferior to the universities because the universities are mentioned in the context of the Bill.  In another place, as is said, we debated this at some length and I indicated there, as I do here, that the universities are mentioned simply in discussing standards by way of analogy, that there is no purpose or intention to import the ethos of the universities into the technology sphere, or into the assessment of the awards whether at certificate, <Col N="180" /> diploma, or degree level in this sphere.  Since the middle ages the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; has been recognised as something which stands for an internationally recognised standard.  What we meant by referring to universities at all in this Bill, and in this context, was that we were looking for the kind of recognition at home and abroad for these awards that has been given traditionally to the awards in the universities.  Nothing more, nothing less than that was meant.  No idea of inferiority at all was implied.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton referred to the work that the award assessing and granting council would do in the development of our industry.  My opening speech indicated that the people who were thinking in the late sixties about this development had this idea in mind when they thought originally of forming the National Council for Educational Awards.  He referred to the danger of a council becoming divorced from any body that could criticise it and being insulated or cocooned in such a way that the Oireachtas would not have an opportunity of examining its actions and activities, as he alleged happened in the case of some semi-State bodies.  The power of the Minister for Education given to him in the Bill to appoint for a fixed period and to change the personnel is sufficient check on this and would put a brake on self-perpetuation of any kind of power group in the council.  Senator Staunton had praise for the <i>ad hoc</i> council and this praise is well deserved.  He mentioned in passing the binary system and the danger of the development of the technological sector and the university sector on separate parallel lines so to speak.  The whole purpose of our educational thrust at the moment is to see to it that there is as much transfer as possible&mdash;and Senator Martin referred to this later on in the debate&mdash;and that there is cross-fertilisation which is the word used and it can be used with regard to ideas, and even actual bodily transfer from the colleges of technology to the universities and <i>vice versa</i> from the universities to the colleges of technology, I am sure the activities of the National <Col N="181" /> Council for Educational Awards will help in this respect.</P>
    <P>We thought the universities might not be inclined to play ball in this regard but, as Senator Martin has mentioned, already there is an intake in the universities from the technological colleges, and I hope the process will not be all one way.  I hope there will be transfers from the universities, a horizontal transfer, a horizontal mobility, between the institutions, and that the activities of this council which is an award-giving council will help in that regard.  I mentioned in my opening speech the importance of the coordination of the courses in the regional technical colleges with those in the national institutes for higher education.  I would hope for an extension of that to the universities, with two-way traffic.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton thought that perhaps I was naïve in thinking members of the council would not feel themselves to be representing the institutions from which they come.  Impartiality is quite possible.  On the <i>ad hoc</i> council it has been done.  People can abstract themselves from their own institutions and give service&mdash;altruistic, unbiased, unprejudiced service&mdash;to the council.  It has been done in the past by people from the universities and people from other institutions, and I am quite confident that it will be so in the future as well.</P>
    <P>He referred to his desire that the director should not be a member of the council. After much consideration and due consideration and thought, and despite debates and amendments in another place, we maintained that the director should be a member of the council for good and sufficient reasons but, in particular, because he should be fully <i>au fait</i> with everything that is going on in the council.  He cannot have the same strength if he is not a member of the council.</P>
    <P>As did other Senators, Senator Staunton mentioned adult education.  I gather we may have an opportunity to debate adult education in the not too distant future, both in connection with the National Council for Educational Awards and on its own.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> D'fháiltigh an Seanadóir Cranitch roimh an Bhille agus luaigh sé go raibh stad le himeachtaí na comhairle ar feadh tamaillín ach gur tháinig borradh faoi na himeachtaí tar éis don Rialtas seo teach isteach in oifig arís.  Do luaigh sé chomh thábhachtach is atá sé go dtiocfadh forbairt agus forbairt mhór ar an teicneolaíocht. Duirt sé go raibh sé a dhith ar an dtír agus ní doigh liom go bhfuil aon bhaill den Seanad seo nach n-aontaíonn go hiomlán leis an dtuairim sin.  Dúirt sé go raibh clú agus cáil ar na cearduithe, ar na dealbhóiri agus ar lucht deartha sa tír seo le fada an lá&mdash;go raibh clú agus cáil ar na daoine a bhí ag plé leis na himeachtaí sin agus go raibh sé indéanta againne foirgnimh nua a thogáil ar an sean tradisiún sin.</P>
    <P>He mentioned in particular, as did Senator Jago later on the international competition for apprentices which took place in Cork this year.  Senator Cranitch was pleased that Ireland performed very well with a small number of contestants in that competition.  This is true.  In the context of the Bill we are debating, one would hope that one of the effects of the statutory foundation of the National Council for Educational Awards would be that we would be competing over a wider range of skills in any future international competition.  This could be and will be a very desirable outcome of the establishment of this council.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch went on to mention&mdash;and this was mentioned later by Senator Whitaker, Senator Martin and others&mdash;that giving the skill alone is not sufficient.  The Biblical quotation by Senator Cranitch was that the body without the spirit is dead.  He went on to say that high skills alone were not enough.  There also has to be a commitment to the development of self, family and country.  He mentioned in this context the centenary of the birth of Padraig MacPiarais and his particular ideals, fostering of ideas and discipline, and inspiring others.  It is interesting to note that the Pearse family were skilled workers in stone, and perhaps it was relevant that Senator Cranitch should <Col N="183" /> mention him in this context.  He also commented favourably on the fact that an obligation on the council to develop the Irish language and maintain it and sustain it is incorporated in the Bill. Quoting Dr. Walsh, who is the present chairman of the <i>ad hoc</i> council, he mentioned that the <i>ad hoc</i> council has already made about 10,000 awards in certificates, diplomas and degrees <i>in toto</i>, over half of which were in engineering.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey welcomed the Bill and wished it a smooth passage.  She raised the age-old question as to what was the purpose of education.  Was it self-fulfilment or was it to make a contribution to the growth and development of society?  I should think the answer to that is that it should be a self-fulfilment in the growth and development of society.  There is no reason why these objectives should be mutually exclusive. She made a very pertinent point about our young population.  She made the point that it is unique in the European Economic Community.  It is true and it is a great challenge.</P>
    <P>She mentioned a burning question at present, that is, imparting skills to young people which they may not be able to use, skills that may be obsolete.  In this context there is a great deal of head-scratching going on in particular about the silicone chips and all the people the development of this field of technology may throw out of work.  It is a problem. People are worried about it.  This theme has recurred in Senators' speeches.  We will have to aim at a basic training which will sustain and fertilise the imparting of new skills when specific skills that are learned and rewarded by the NCEA become obsolete.  A good deal of careful thought will have to go into this whole field, the field covered by the National Council for Educational Awards, between now and the end of this century.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred also to the composition of the council.  If she read section 5 (2) she would see there was no danger of the council itself becoming overweighted with administrators and <Col N="184" /> academics, as she said, because the Minister must take cognisance, according to the Bill, of to what extent &ldquo;industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce, any of the professions or the management, staff and students of any institution to which this Act applies need representation on the Council&rdquo;.  All those areas will have to be attended to in putting the council together.  &ldquo;Industry&rdquo; was the word she used, and she came back time and time again to it.  I am sure she did not mean to exclude commerce, fisheries, agriculture, and so on.</P>
    <P>She then went on to say&mdash;and she was talking about her own constituency here I am sure&mdash;that women were the greatest under-utilised resource of Irish society.  It is interesting to note in this connection that one of the most skilful performers&mdash;although she did not win any prize&mdash;at the international apprentices competition in Cork was a diminutive South Korean who took part in the plumbing competition and was performing very well when I was there, but unfortunately she did not get any medals.  This, of course, bears out the point that Senator Hussey made that this is an area from which women should not be excluded.  She referred to &ldquo;<i>education permanente</i>&rdquo;, a term the French invented and then shrunk back from, but it is an area we will probably have a chance of debating in the near future, current reeducation, &ldquo;<i>education permanente</i>&rdquo; adult education.  They are not necessarily all the same things, but the National Council for Educational Awards has a competence with regard to all these areas and can be usefully employed in developing courses and awards to suit the needs of people who are either second-chance students, or doing refresher work, or doing sabbatical work.  The potentialities are great.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker then went on to quote the HEA in its original study on the needs in this sector.  He said he would not accept the strong word &ldquo;basic&rdquo; difference between the universities and the technological area, but that he would accept that there was a differentiation in orientation and purpose.  Those were the <Col N="185" /> words he used.  I am glad he referred to it, because it is relevant to the whole idea as to the relationship that should exist between the two.  There may not be a basic difference.  There is certainly a difference in ethos.  It is our intention that through the NCEA and the co-operation of the universities, which is very important because they have an independence they pride themselves on and nobody wants to interfere with it, the technological people and the universities may influence each other and transfer, and the council should be an instrument in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker welcomed an appropriate element of the humanities as being catered for by the NCEA, and went on to quote Professor Patrick Lynch who referred to the importance of understanding the philosophical framework in which the whole subject of technology must be placed.  It recalls the old debate of over 20 years ago and Professor C.P. Snow's lecture &ldquo;The Two Cultures&rdquo; which probably was a misnomer.  At least, some people would contend that what he should have been writing about were two aspects of the one culture.  Professor Snow made the point very strongly in that lecture that people who were trained in the humanities went around sneering at advanced technologists because they were ignorant of Hamlet.</P>
    <P>He went on and made the point very strongly&mdash;I remember when reading the lecture getting a metaphorical kick in the stomach when I came to the sentence&mdash;that the technologists would be equally justified in criticising those who dedicated themselves to the humanities if they did not understand, I think, the second law of thermo-dynamics.  I hope it was thermo-dynamics; it could be aero-dynamics, but I think it is thermo-dynamics. When I reflected for a quarter of a second that I had not a clue what the second law of thermo-dynamics was I knew that Professor C.P. Snow had made his point and made it very strongly.</P>
    <P>It is specifically for that reason that this Bill covers the technological range <Col N="186" /> and also mentions the promotion of liberal education.  It links up with something that I mentioned already, that is, arising out of what Senator Hussey said, that if skills become obsolete and you have to retrain, there must be some fat there, there must be some fertile soil there upon which the new training can be given.  This, to a great extent, will be provided by, but not exclusively, the liberal arts studied under the aegis of the NCEA in accordance with the powers given in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker went on to refer to the second level and said there was much too great an emphasis on academic education.  Senator Martin referred to the same thing later on.  I accept that this is so, although I have certain reservations about it.  Where the big weakness has been is in the acceptance of a stereotype. The ordinary academic course is followed, <i>ergo</i> all other fields are shut out&mdash;either go to the university, or to specific clerical or administrative jobs.  It is the thinking that is wrong there, the type-casting&mdash;I cannot get the right word&mdash;casting people in the role because of the studies they followed up to Intermediate Certificate or Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>If we could get people thinking of apprenticeships, if we could get people thinking of regional technical colleges, no matter what kind of school they went to, then we would be achieving greatly.  I am not saying there is not a certain amount of truth in what Senator Whitaker said.  Perhaps we do not call the attention of the secondary schools to the fact that their range is not large enough or wide enough.  We, perhaps, should see to it that there are technological areas covered in all post-primary schools, both traditional secondary and vocational schools.  Far more nefarious has been this idea that because a leaving certificate has been achieved in certain subjects, all other areas are completely shut off.  Recently many people who did ordinary academic courses turned towards RTCs, not merely in the business field but in the purely technical field and have achieved a great deal.  This <Col N="187" /> is true of Bolton Street and Kevin Street in Dublin, of the regional technical colleges as well as the NIHEs.</P>
    <P>It is important, as Senator Whitaker said, to make people aware of this.  There is the question of the how and the why. The practical answers the how and the philosophic answers the why.  Perhaps there is not enough of how in the purely secondary schools and too much why and in this Bill we are trying to avoid too much of the how and too little of the why in technological education.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin welcomed the fact that liberal studies were not excluded, that they were acknowledged and to be catered for by the council.  He hoped for a creative tension between the technological sector and the universities. I do not know about creative tension but I suppose it is a possibility.  Mediaeval theologians used to talk about &ldquo;a holy rivalry&rdquo; in theological studies.  It often did not stop at a &ldquo;holy rivalry&rdquo;.  If this creative tension could be created, I am sure the interchange of students, the working of university personnel on the National Council for Educational Awards, the transfer of students from universities to technological colleges and <i>vice versa</i>, will create something of a tension, and hopefully it will be a creative one.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the horizontal mobility which already exists.  It is something I particularly welcome and would like to see continuing.  He referred to polytechnic graduates in particular who do post-graduate work in his own university college and talked about how highly they achieved.  He mentioned students from the city which was first in technology in Ireland for a long time, namely, Belfast, which has a very interesting technological section in their museum.  One of our poets who is living down here but is from the North, has one particular poem where he uses technological imagery very well, imagery that he borrows from the shipyard.  I am sure some other Members of the Seanad recall the poem I am thinking of.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> He talked about the danger of nepotism in the selection of personnel.  It is a danger we have with us always.  All societies, institutions and other organisations have it also.  I agree with him totally that there is only one way to exclude it and that is by insisting on the highest possible standards for the people employed by the council.  I can assure him, from my knowledge of the council, that that is the only criterion that will be used in the selection of personnel for the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>He mentioned the importance of research.  I mentioned this at least briefly in my introductory speech.  A provision is made for research areas under the influence of the National Council for Eduational Awards.  I agree that knowledge becomes attenuated if it is not sustained by research.  If a teacher is working on his capital, maybe a meagre capital at the start, he will run out of ideas and knowledge very quickly.  The council will have a role to play with regard to research.</P>
    <P>There is one <i>caveat.</i>  The regional technical colleges and the NIHE's were thought of in the context of providing technicians, technologists and skilled people for our industries.  This is their major function.  While I agree with the Senator that provision should be made for research, because an educational institution without research is like a human being without a head, it is not paramount; it should not be allowed to interefere with the functioning of the institutions covered by the National Council for Educational Awards.  There is no intention in the Bill, or on the part of the Government, to in any way curtail research or research facilities, but we are keeping in mind the main objective of the institutions that were established and which are covered by the National Council for Educational Awards Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin also mentioned the second level, especially secondary schools, and their lack of sufficient awareness of the areas in technology where they might choose to make their careers.  That point was made by Senator <Col N="189" /> Whitaker, Senator Martin and others and is a good point.  It might be possible to get ideas from Senators as to the best way to go about shedding a little light onto that dark corner.  I am not going back on what I said already about the stereotyping of people by the courses they follow, even in their immature years.  This is something I have always decried.  I do not think their horizons should ever be narrowed to that.</P>
    <P>I want to deny emphatically before the House and the men of Ireland, as the councillor said once, that nothing is being done for adult education.  We may have an opportunity to discuss that later. The Senator went on to say that University College Dublin has a very good record, both in provision of night degrees, and in extramural courses, and I totally agree with him on that.  They are varied, interesting and given at the various depths required by the students.</P>
    <P>Certain other efforts have been made in the recent past.  I had the privilege of appointing adult education officers&mdash;more than one, two or three in some cases&mdash;to all the vocational education committees to develop adult education in the various vocational education committee areas.  We will have an opportunity of debating that aspect of our educational system possibly in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Jago was very pleased that awards were now available within the country and stated that when he was looking for an educational award he had to look outside the country.  He also alluded to the international competition for apprentices and talked about the Far East and how the apprentices from the Far East excelled in that competition. That was one of the most fascinating aspects.  Equally fascinating to me was the fact that the various tools they were using were all scaled&mdash;they were all <i>pro-rata</i> the size of the individual.  For the most part, the tools used were much smaller than those used traditionally in Western Europe.  The apprentices were much smaller as well.  It was a revelation to see the speed and skill with which they were working.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> Senator Jago made a very pertinent point when he said that the awards for those who graduated, either with a diploma or a certificate, in the field of marine technology proved the importance of the course and the usefulness of the course.  Only one of them was there to receive the award because the rest were literally at sea.  He said business people were becoming increasingly interested in attracting young people into the field of technology where the National Council for Educational Awards operate.  He instanced the recent publication by the Confederation of Irish Industry of a book on careers which is also relevant in this field of the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senators for their contributions on the Second Stage.  Tá áthas orm gur fháiltigh beagnach chuile dhuine roimh an Bhille.  Tá fhios agam go mbeidh rath ar an obair a dhéanfaidh an Chomhairle agus cumhacht reachtúil ag an Comhairle ón mBille seo.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for this concept so far.  For me it started in 1966, for him it started three years ago.  I hope that in interpreting the Bill the great emphasis placed on the quality of work will emanate into other circles of education, particularly university education, and that the Bill will give the Minister some powers in this regard. What I am getting at is that until the National Council for Education Awards <Col N="193" /> examined what a degree was, probably most people had not thought about it, they did not have to think about it.  The professor of physics or the professor of engineering professed that subject, but never had to profess the subject of the educational process that encompassed his own subject.  The fact that there are now some 500 to 600 academics backing the NCEA is a great opportunity to improve the standard of education, in the sense of the education process, in the Irish scene.  This Bill seems to provide the Minister with a chance to encourage that from his own prestigious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also provides, as I see it, an opportunity for the Minister to encourage the flexibility he mentioned in his summing up of the Second Stage debate.  The first NCEA produced a diagram which showed how this flexibility could operate in movement from one stream to another.  I do not think what we are doing here is giving the blessing to binary education.  We are giving a blessing to the introduction of that part of our educational system which the country lacked.  The Steering Committee Report written in 1966 said that where you were <Col N="194" /> not able to justify a demand where it should exist, where the need existed, then you have to go ahead and do it.  This is now under way and I wish the Minister the best in implementing it.</P>

I am glad he emphasised the quality of the work I have been insisting upon and the flexibility which was referred to by a number of Senators.  I see, in much the same way as he does, that we are not setting up a binary system but the council we are establishing here by statute will act as a lubricant to make the horizontal and vertical transfers in the third level easier.</P>
