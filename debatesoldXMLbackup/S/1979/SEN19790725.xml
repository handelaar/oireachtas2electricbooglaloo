      <P>Could the Minister give us some information on this section?  It provides, as I read it, for the devolution to local authorities of the administration of certain housing grants, presumably new grants or improvement grants.  I understand that in the past certain experiments were carried out by way of giving to selected local authorities power to look after the inspection and payment of grants.  Could the Minister give us an indication of how they worked in the past and what his intentions are for the <Col N="1492" /> future?  I would be particularly interested in hearing from the Minister how much autonomy he proposes to allow local authorities in the event of these powers being devolved to them.  I would not like to see a situation where powers are devolved and every action by the local authority has to be referred back to the Custom House for validation or for approval. If there is to be devolution I would like the Minister to assure us that it will be real devolution.  In that connection, how can he give real devolution when he now controls the financial division of local authorities totally since the abolition of rates and the introduction of the new regime whereby their budget is fixed in the Custom House by a flat percentage increase irrespective of the needs of the local authority?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was devolution towards certain local authorities on an experimental basis.  This worked very well but it was necessary to make a change due to the centralisation of grants.  For example, when the £1,000 new house grant came into operation it was more feasible to operate this from one centre in the Department rather than through various local authorities.  The very same applied in respect of house improvement grants. It was far more feasible to operate the £600 house improvement grant than to devolve the system to certain local authorities.  Prior to the coming into operation of the £600 house improvement grant we had the £200 housing reconstruction grant which was payable by the Department and a supplementary £200 housing reconstruction grant which was payable by local authorities. There was no question of local authorities not having the finance to carry out schemes should it be found necessary to devolve any further work on to the local authorities.  The housing authorities would do the inspections themselves, receive applications and they would be recouped the full cost by the Department.  They would work within a framework of regulations which would be made under this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that there is less than an enthusiastic acceptance of devolution by the Minister and by the Department.  It was a very welcome initiation, which was established about four or five years ago.  It had certainly great advantages which, in my opinion, far outweigh the advantages the Minister has only been able to enunciate since the £1,000 grant was introduced two years ago, since when it has been necessary to centralise the matter in the Department. The advantages that I saw from this devolved system of administration was that it cut out an awful lot of duplication and overlapping of work that went on, both in the actual compilation of planning schemes, in the inspection of those planning schemes and their finalisation. Such advantages far outweigh any administrative advantage that might have arisen as a result of the introduction of the £1,000 grant.  I would regret that there should be any departure from this precedent which was established four or five years ago, as regards devolved schemes being given to local authorities. They are highly capable both of administering and finalising any local authority housing schemes, they have the staff and certainly if they do the work it will cut out a lot of duplication and overlapping that went on before this devolution was introduced four or five years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the initial stages of schemes, such as the £1,000 new house <Col N="1494" /> grant, it is necessary to have them centralised due to the fact that it is important to have consistency as regards decisions.  That is one of the principal reasons.  For administrative purposes, it can be carried out in a more efficient manner at a centralised position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Do those reasons mean that there will never be devolution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I said in the initial stages and when there is experience of the scheme having been operated for a number of years, then consideration will be given to devolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially is it not the position that the housing grants for new houses and for improvement grants have been payable for a great number of years?  The level of grant or the details of the regulations may change from time to time, but the principle has been in operation for a great number of years.  It would seem to me that if there are administrative difficulties in the way of devolving these payments or if there is need to try to get consistency in the application of standards, these problems should have been solved by now.  The Minister should be able to know at this stage if devolution is feasible or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one case where we are allowing administrative problems to take precedence over what is the basic operation of the Department of the Environment and the local authorities, namely the provision of housing for our people.  There have been considerable delays in the past in regard to the finalising of housing schemes due to the overlapping which has gone on.  For the sake of the administration of this £1,000 grant and other grants for houses we are allowing ourselves to forget the most important basic aspect which is the provision of houses at the quickest possible rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not all local authorities are famous regarding the rate of completion of housing schemes.  Reverting to what the position was before 1973 will make the provision of houses by local authorities&mdash;and the Department who ultimately hold the key to the whole <Col N="1495" /> situation&mdash;slower than it has been over the past four or five years.  This is the fault I find with this centralisation that is going on again, that local authorities will be slower in providing the houses that are needed due to over-lapping and inspection. I do not think the Minister should allow just the administration of the grant aspect of the provision of local authority houses, or any housing, to take precedence over what is the major aspect of the situation&mdash;namely the actual completion of the houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the £1,000 new house grant there was a means test in operation in respect of all other grants.  The local authority were the most appropriate body to carry out that means test because they had the staff who were in a position to assess means and to submit actual reports on applications to the Department.  This has all changed as there is no means test for the £1,000 new house grant nor is there a means test for the house improvements grant.  Neither is there a means test for the new grant of £600 for the conversion from oil heating to solid fuel heating. Local authorities are quite free to build single rural houses and to build local authority schemes up to a certain number without consultation with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section because one of the most unsatisfactory aspects of the administration of housing grants in the recent history of this country has been the fact that the administration has been cock-eyed.  There has been a system under which somebody building a house subject to grants by the local authority or by the Department has had in the first instance to apply to the Department of the Environment and then to his local county council for payment of the first part of the grant.  There are too many anomalies in this.  It simply means that one in the first instance writes to the Department, gets an application form, completes it and returns it.  One subsequently applies to the county council and when part of the house has been built one notifies the <Col N="1496" /> Department.  In turn, the Department inspector looks at the extent to which the house has been completed and decides whether the Department can pay the grant.  Subsequent to that the Department are in the business of notifying the county council that the first half of the grant has been paid, at which stage the county council are empowered to pay their part of the grant.  Then the circus continues when the house is completed because at that stage the applicant applies again to the Department.  There is a further inspection by the Department inspector to consider the question of the payment of the grant.  If this is in order and, subsequent to the Department paying the grant, the county council are in turn notified that it has been paid.  Then the county council are in the business of paying their part.  There is duplication and triplication of administrative effort. It is one particular area in respect of which we are interested in getting some kind of proper decentralisation.</P>
      <P>Without going into the business of decentralising separate Departments of State, already within each of these county councils there is a great deal of administrative work that be can be carried out at a local level much more efficiently than under the present structure. If this section is necessary legally to allow that to happen, I welcome it and I would urge the Minister to arrange practically a total delegation of administration of housing grants to the county councils.</P>

      <P>Everybody welcomed this section on Second Stage.  It gives encouragement to co-operative and voluntary associations but I should have thought that the Minister would have spelled out a little more his own sentiment that he would like to see much <Col N="1498" /> more active involvement by such voluntary groups in this sphere of house-building. Is the level of grants to remain as it has been?  Is the Minister satisfied that the amount of moneys which have been given are adequate to encourage such bodies to be more active in future? Should we not consider increasing the grants available?  What was the amount of grants given in 1978?  This Bill gives the Minister an opportunity to spell out exactly what he has in mind as regards further encouragement for these associations.</P>

      <P>The National Association of Building Co-operatives are the umbrella organisation for other co-operatives.  A grant of £6,000 or two-thirds of the cost, whichever is the lesser, was paid to the central organisation for administrative and general expenses. There are other sections in this Bill which provide specifically for grants for co-operatives.  I am very keen on the promotion of co-operatives and my Department will continue to do everything possible to assist co-operatives.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I raised with the Minister a question in relation to section 3 which deals with grants for expenses of certain bodies.  A rural housing organisation in County Clare and in certain western counties was promoted by Father Harry Bohan. The object of that organisation was to promote the co-operative building of houses in rural towns and villages.  It has been very successful in that task.  Will that rural housing organisation qualify for assistance under this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Pursuant to the Minister's reply about the £6,000 which was paid to the umbrella authority, as it were, the voluntary associations, the Minister said other sections of this Bill provide financial assistance for the co-operatives and voluntary associations. Perhaps I should know what those sections are, and what financial assistance is given to individual associations and co-operatives.  Perhaps the Minister would spell out exactly what it is.  A £6,000 grant to the umbrella group appears to be inadequate for any expansion of the services we might want that umbrella group to undertake in future.</P>
      <P>One of the great defects in local authority housing has been the length of time it takes local authorities to get schemes completed and finalised.  In future we will have to look for a greater effort by voluntary and co-operative associations to provide the greater number of houses that will be required.  Greater financial assistance than hitherto should be given to the individual associations and co-operatives for the work they are engaged in to encourage them to do more and to get new associations formed which could do this most important work.  Perhaps the Minister would spell out briefly what assistance is given under this Bill to individual associations, other than the umbrella group, and whether it is his intention to expand these financial assistance measures.</P>

      <P>Sections 4 and 5 cover grants to co-operatives as well as to individuals.  The real power is in sections 12 and 45 of the 1966 Housing Act, where provision is made for an element of subsidy to co-operatives for building and also for the provision of <Col N="1500" /> sites.  Between 1972 and 1978, very little was done to improve the position of the co-operative movement as regards the building of houses.  I am glad we are now taking positive steps to assist co-operatives and to provide as much assistance as possible for them.  As I indicated already, I will be making a further statement on the matter shortly.</P>

I accept that the Minister will be making a statement shortly, perhaps to announce further incentives to these groups.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (2) (e)&mdash;and this is one of the conditions precedent to a grant&mdash;reads:</P>
      <P>...a requirement that the person to whom the grant is paid or the spouse of such person, either separately or with each other, has not previously purchased or built for his or their own occupation another house,</P>
      <P>This is the small print that was obscured by the magic figure of £1,000.  It was a new provision that a person had to be buying a house for the first time.  Many people who applied for the £1,000 grant found themselves ruled out because of this small print which is now embodied in paragraph (e).  I can see reasons for it but I wonder, as drafted, will it be unduly restrictive.  I have in mind a situation where a widow remarries and her second husband applies for a grant to buy a house.  It is ascertained that her first husband had purchased a house and, because of the present trend towards putting houses into joint names, technically she would have been a purchaser with her first husband.  If so, the second marriage would be ruled out from obtaining a grant by this paragraph.</P>

      <P>I should like paragraphs (a) and (f) defined.  Under section 4 (1) (a) the Minister can make regulations in regard to the amount of a grant.  There is no doubt that the level of the grant proportionate to the cost of building a new house has suffered a serious reduction from the value it held compared with the cost of building a house ten or 15 years ago.  I believe there is a case for indexing in regard to grants <i>vis-á-vis</i> the cost of houses.  In the past year, for instance, the cost of new houses has increased by 25 to 30 per cent.  While the £1,000 grant seemed of considerable assistance in 1977, now, only two years later, it does not represent the same favourable proportion of the cost of providing a new house.  The Minister should consider introducing an indexing system whereby grants would be increased to cover the real cost of houses, as the prices of houses go up from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to subsection (2) (f), the Minister has indicated that he has not considered introducing a means test in regard to the allocation of grants for new houses.  It seems that under paragraph (f) he is taking the authority to introduce such a means test and to introduce requirements in regard to the financial circumstances of any further applicant.  I do not know if that paragraph should be in this Bill.  I see no reason for it at present. Unless there is an ulterior motive behind its insertion in this section of the Bill, I would prefer if it were not there at all.  It will only introduce an element of suspicion on the part of any new house builders that their means can be taken <Col N="1503" /> into account in assessing the £1,000 grant.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Bill the Minister may make regulations covering a number of matters relating to the payment of new house grants.  These regulations can cover quite a number of items, including the matter mentioned by Senator Cooney, and can also cover a means test if it is considered necessary under any future scheme.  For instance, there could be a number of changes in the grant structure and it may be necessary to bring in a means test.  Provision can be made for the test without legislation. Section 4 is an enabling section and changes will be made by regulation.</P>

      <P>If section 4 relates to the payment of the £1,000 new house grant, can the Minister clarify the position of the houses owned or occupied by tenants of SFADCo?  These houses are a unique development.  They were built by SFADCo.  The present group of tenants were given the impression during the course of the last general election that they would qualify for the £1,000 grant if they were to buy out these houses. They decided to pursue that incentive and they found that when they sought to purchase the houses they were refused the grant.  It is a unique situation and I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that these people will be granted that facility.</P>

If I understand Senator Howard's description of the Shannon scheme correctly, I think I have some experience of a similar situation in which a builder built a house and leased it to a tenant for a period of 12 months, following which the tenant entered into a purchase agreement to buy the house and was refused the £1,000 new house grant because the house was not regarded as new to him as a purchaser.

      <P>That seems to be a red herring.  Let us leave the Shannon scheme out of it altogether and talk about any circumstance in which a tenant of a new house buys out the property.  I know of one case where a person got a tenancy in a new house from the builder because he was not able to arrange his mortgage finance for some months.  He put £1,000 into a building society for six months, at the end of which period he was able to get his loan sanctioned, but when he went to buy the house from the builder he was denied the £1,000 new house grant.  It occurred to me when Senator Howard was on his feet that this was the type of problem being created in Shannon.  I do not see what the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy have to do with it if under this legislation they are just not entitled to the £1,000 new house grant.  I do not quite understand what the paragraph dealing with occupation means and perhaps the Minister could enlighten me.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that the problem here was that the house was not new to the purchaser, he had been a tenant and he was now buying the house but it was not new to him.  In relation to the client that I mentioned, the problem with the Department of the Environment was that the house was not new to him as a purchaser.  I cannot see how this problem will be overcome by the occupation paragraph.  The Minister suggests that under paragraph (d) it will be possible for the tenants of houses in Shannon or elsewhere, if they buy out the houses, to avail of the £1,000 new house grant.  Will those houses be new at that stage if that was the problem in relation to the other example I gave?</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister that I have not at all missed the point.  In relation to the matter raised by Senator Cooney, the Minister said he would deal with it sympathetically.  I suggest that the Minister is in no position to deal with it sympathetically because it is not a matter for the Minister.  Nowhere under this section is there provision for the situation that Senator Cooney outlines. Nowhere do I see discretion given to the Minister.  It is about that I complained.  It is good that the Minister should be able to consider unusual cases sympathetically, <Col N="1508" /> but my point is that he does not have the power to do it.  Perhaps I should not have spoken specifically in relation to the Shannon scheme because I am not familiar with it, but the more I have heard Senator Howard describe the scheme the more it becomes clear to me that the problem is that these are not new houses and therefore do not qualify for the new house grant.  Nowhere in any of the paragraphs in that section, even under paragraph (d), the occupation of the house, do I see the Minister having the discretion to deem a house that is two or three years old a new house, simply because it was occupied by the tenant who is now buying it.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if under this section it is possible for an individual to get a grant for rewiring a house.  I recently had a case of a widow with three children who was told by the ESB that her electricity system was faulty, that she would have to have it rewired and that it would cost something in the region of £400 or £500. She applied to the Department for a grant and was told there was no such grant available.  She then got in touch with the ESB and she was likewise told they did not have any grants.  Given that there are grants for new windows and doors and for house extensions, perhaps the Minister would consider giving grants for rewiring of houses having regard to the safety aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that such a grant can be paid provided it is part of reconstruction work.  If a house requires complete rewiring, usually it is <Col N="1509" /> necessary to do more to the house than completely rewire it.  It has reached the stage where other reconstruction and improvement works are necessary in the house.  An application for rewiring can be considered and paid in conjunction with the normal scheme of reconstruction for the house such as new doors, new windows, roof repairs and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept that but in the case I referred to nothing else was required. The house is only 15 to 20 years old and is in fairly good condition.  The owners had applied for grants for windows and so on in the past few years and because of that it is not possible now to have a separate grant for the rewiring of the house.  In this particular case, and I am sure there are many more cases like lit, rewiring is absolutely essential for the safety of the individual.  The person in question is a widow and £400 or £500 is a substantial amount of money to have to pay for electrical repairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the powers that the Minister is taking under section 5 to enable him to give grants for improvement of houses would cover the case raised by Senator Harney?  Improvement works are defined in the definition section as anything which is reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering the house more suitable for human habitation.  Rewiring would certainly appear to come within that definition and if it does the Minister would be empowered to give grants under section 5 which would cover a case of rewiring.</P>

It could be covered by regulations under section 5 of the Bill.  The position at the moment is that the Government are paying about £30 million a year in respect of reconstruction and improvement works on houses as compared with £5 million a couple of years ago.  This is a matter which will be kept very much in mind when the regulations are made.</P>

There are very few people who are going to contemplate an overall or even partial rewiring of their house unless there is a very good reason for them to do so.  After all, they are not contributing anything in that rewiring to the ornamental or decorative appearance of the house.  When they feel pressurised to undertake such a task they do it on the grounds of security and safety for their own habitation.  The Minister has provided in his existing regulations regarding improvement grants that the expenditure must be in excess of £100 and I think he should include a provision regarding rewiring operations as long as the costs are in excess of £100.</P>

      <P>I have a query on this section.  This is the section that provides for the local authority making a loan and provides for the securing of that loan.  Subsection (2) paragraph (d) envisages a situation where the borrower has already mortgaged his interest and it provides for the securing of the local authority loan by an instrument of further charge in repayment of the loan. The earlier subsections distinguish between an instrument vesting the ownership of the house in the housing authority which is commonly called a mortgage.  That type of instrument relates to property that comes under the Registry of Deeds because paragraph (b) envisages the charging of a house where the property is registered under the Registration of Title Act, generally rural property.  Paragraph (d) deals with a situation where there is a mortgage in existence and provides for a second mortgage.  However, where there is a first Land Registry charge it does not seem to me to deal with the question of how a second Land Registry charge is to be secured.  It uses the words: &ldquo;where ownership is already vested in the person&rdquo; but under the Land Registry regime ownership does not vest in a mortgagee.  A mortgagee obtains a charge against the lands and the folio. There is no change of ownership.  The ownership is charged.  There does not seem to be provision for charging the second mortgage where the title is registered in the Land Registry.</P>

What sort of instrument does the Minister envisage will be required to ensure that the local authority can proceed in a court to recover their loan?  I know that there is provision in subsection (6) for a local authority to sue by way of simple contract debt for the arrears of a loan but such proceedings will normally refer to the mortgage or the instrument of charge.  In this case where no mortgage or instrument of charge is required the proceedings will have to refer to some sort of document or instrument setting out the loan.

      <P>I gather from the provision in section 9 that it is not common at the moment for local authorities to provide subsidised sites.  In Thurles the local authority own a fairly substantial tract of land from which they have been selling subsidised sites for some time. Does the Minister intend to encourage this type of development all over the country?  It is a very good idea and something to be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a great absence of rent on all houses which commenced on <Col N="1513" /> consultation between the Minister's Department and local authorities in relation to legislation being brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister.  I refer specifically to a case affected by the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1978, where local authority tenants were given the right to acquire the fee simple in their properties as were private individuals. I predicted at that time that that legislation would cause enormous legal difficulties.  My statement at that time is becoming a reality.  For example, in relation to about 40 of these subsidised sites in Thurles, there is presently great difficulty over the manner of transfer of the sites from the local authority to the purchasers.  Many people have commenced building their houses on these sites and they presently fear that they may not be able to get title for quite a long time yet as a result of which they will suffer a great financial burden because of the exorbitant rates of interest that have to be paid on bridging finance.  I made inquiries about this both from the urban and the county council and the reason for this is because there was no consultation between the local authority and the Department before that legislation was passed.  It is only now when the local authority solicitors got their hands on the 1978 Landlord and Tenant Act that these problems have come to light.</P>
    <P>Enormous dangers are being created for people in relation to the financial burden caused by bridging finance.  It also seems that the policy of local authorities will vary from area to area and that the policy of the Department is at odds with the policy of the local authorities.  In south Tipperary, in relation to these subsidised sites, where the question of restriction on sale for a number of years has arisen in the past, they have had to abandon that policy because of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1978.  In north Tipperary they are wondering what they can do about it. The local authority do not want people to engage in speculation in relation to subsidised sites, but on the other hand they are faced with the difficulty that building societies will not lend money where there is a restriction of 25 years <Col N="1514" /> on the transfer of sites.  If the Minister proposes to embark upon the schemes which seem to be suggested by section 9, will he have full consultations beforehand with local authorities so as to avoid the type of mess we have at present?</P>

      <P>My Department have been in consultation since 1966 with local authorities regarding matters such as those raised by Senator Molony.  My Department consulted with a number of local authorities before the landlord and tenant legislation was drafted in 1978.  I hope that as many local authorities as possible will provide as many private subsidised sites as possible to enable persons in need of housing to build on them either on a personal or on a co-operative basis.  I know that in some towns there are legal and title problems but this is not covered under section 9. Most of the points raised by Senator Molony are not covered under section 9 of this Bill.  There are some financial problems as well but the principal problems relate to title.</P>

      <P>I do not follow what the Minister means by title problems.  There are title problems of the Government's making because they introduced legislation without sufficient consultations with local authorities.  If the Minister is not aware of the difficulties in relation to the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent) Act, 1978, I can assure him that both Thurles Urban District Council and the North Tipperary County Council have had to seek senior counsel's opinion and advice on how they can effect transfers in accordance with the law and still protect their interests in the properties. Perhaps that difficulty could have been prevented if there had been some consultations beforehand.</P>

      <P>The local authorities had consultations with the Department who had consultations with the Department of Justice before the drafting of the Landlord and Tenant Bill.  Ground rent was abolished in respect of all new tenancies created from a certain date and, as far as I know, there is no ground <Col N="1515" /> or after a particular date.</P>

      <P>The problem does not actually arise in relation to ground rents. I know that was the intention of the Bill, but it had other consequences that were not anticipated at the time.  The precise problem being experienced at the moment in Thurles is that there are sites which people are anxious to buy.  Some people have entered into contracts to buy them from the local authority.  The difficulty is that the local authority are anxious to ensure that there is no property speculation in relation to these subsidised sites.  In order to avoid that they need to put a restriction on the sale or transfer of those sites to anybody for a period of 25 years except with the consent of the local authority.  That has been the practice.  I do not want to get involved because there are many legalities and technical points in this.  I know they can no longer, practically speaking, look for that restriction.  The problem created is that they will cease to deal in subsidised sites if speculation occurs.  I would like to know in relation to section 9 whether the Minister envisages that there should be restrictions on the ability of people to sell these sites after the local authority have subsidised their purchase.</P>

The eligibility guidelines are that subsidised sites should be allocated only to tenants or subtenants of local authority dwellings who intend to leave the dwellings, persons on the authority's approved waiting list for rehousing, persons proposing to build houses for their own occupation who, with effect from 27 <Col N="1517" /> May 1977, are in the category eligible for local authority house purchase loans, and co-operative housing groups in which a reasonable proportion of the members qualify under paragraph (c) which I have already read out.</P>

Their problem is that they own these sites and feel they have been codded into selling sites worth £4,000 for £1,000.  As soon as they transfer one of these sites to any person, under existing legislation that person would be able to sell the site on the open market and gain a profit of 300 per cent or 400 per cent.</P>

The answer, I believe, is to give the local authority the right when they sell a subsidised site to somebody to put a restriction on the purchaser's right to resell that property without the consent of the local authority.  This would ensure that, if he sells, at least it will be to somebody who would get a subsidised site from the local authority.  It would also ensure that there is no profiteering in relation to this.  Have no doubt about it, there is to be profiteering.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) provides for the subsidy arrangements which applied during the period from 1 April 1973 to 31 December 1976 and together with subsection (7), which provides that the section will be deemed to have come into operation on 1 April 1973, validates the payment of subsidy during that period on the basis of the arrangements then applying.  Paragraph (a)  provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, in respect of the period commencing on the 1st day of April, 1973, and ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, a subsidy of such amount as he may determine towards the expenditure incurred by a housing authority in respect of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  moneys borrowed by the authority for the provision of a house for letting in respect of which a grant under section 15 of the Principal Act has not been paid, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the maintenance, management and improvement of such a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 of the Principal Act which is being repealed enables the Minister to pay a grant to a person, including a housing authority, for the provision of a <Col N="1520" /> house.  Grants were paid under that section in respect of certain houses which were provided for sale by a housing authority.  Grants were not paid, however, in respect of houses provided by a housing authority for letting.  A subsidy was available in respect of houses under section 44 of the 1966 Act.  The expression &ldquo;the provision by a housing authority of a house in respect of which a grant under section 15 of the Principal Act&rdquo; is used in this paragraph and in section 44 of the 1966 Act to distinguish between houses provided for sale and houses provided for letting.  Whereas section 44 of the 1966 Act enables subsidies to be paid in relation to the annual loan charges incurred by a housing authority in respect of money borrowed for the provision of houses for letting this paragraph would provide a basis for the subsidy arrangements which applied between the 1 April 1973 and 31 December 1976 and which was based on the deficit on a local authority's housing revenue account.  These latter arrangements took account not only of the annual loan charges incurred but also the current income and other expenditure in relation to local authority rented houses, that is, rent and maintenance and management costs together with a proportion of the proceeds of sales of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The deficit on local authority housing revenue accounts was being transferred to the Exchequer on a phased basis over the period 1 April 1973 to 31 December 1976.  In the financial year 1973-1974 the Exchequer generally recouped 25 per cent of the local authority housing deficit to local authorities, 66½ per cent in 1974, 75 per cent in 1975 and 87½ per cent in 1976.  Recoupment of the housing deficit in 1975-76 was, however, subject to limitations on certain categories of expenditure such as maintenance and management expenditure.  In 1977 and subsequent years the subsidies payable to housing authorities in relation to houses provided for letting relate to the annual loan charges only.  Paragraph (e) provides that &ldquo;a subsidy under this subsection shall be subject to such conditions if any as the Minister may specify and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing&rdquo;.  The conditions may <Col N="1521" /> include conditions relating to rent, purchase of the house concerned, standards of construction, contributions from the housing authority concerned towards the expenditure involved and expenditure on the maintenance, management and improvement of the house concerned.  The purpose of this paragraph is to enable conditions to be attached to the payment of subsidies under paragraph (e) in relation to the matters specified.  If the subsidies paid during the period from 1 April 1973 to 31 December 1976 had been paid under section 44, conditions in relation to most of the above matters could have been contained in regulations under section 44 (4).  The statutory basis for subsidy payments made during that period, however, is provided by section 23 and in order to ensure the validity of the conditions attached to the payment of such subsidy paragraph (e) specifically provides that the subsidy payments shall be subjected to such conditions, if any, as the Minister may specify.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a point in regard to the section.  It is about the low rise mortgage scheme which has been a very good and welcome addition to the financing of housing.  I will not say anything about increasing or asking the Minister to increase the loan amounts or even increasing the income limit because we have already covered that ground on Second Stage.  There are just two aspects of existing regulations in regard to the low rise mortgage scheme to which I want to refer.  One is the case of a potential tenant of a local authority house.  He has to be 12 months on the waiting list. This could well be reduced by the Minister to, say, half that time without unduly affecting the amount of moneys which are available under this low rise mortgage scheme and the number of applicants we would have for its facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is in regard to childless couples.  There may well be an anomaly here because, as I see it, the low rise mortgage scheme can apply to existing tenants who themselves may be childless and yet, under the regulations, a potential tenant of a local authority <Col N="1523" /> house who is childless is disqualified from seeking the facilities of the low rise mortgage scheme.  There is an anomaly here which could be corrected by removing this &ldquo;childless&rdquo; restriction completely. Apart from any anomaly there may be in the administrative sense, I think it is socially undesirable that people should be penalised to this extent who are willing to build their own houses and thereby save local authority houses for people less able to find the balance of moneys to provide houses for themselves.  I would ask the Minister to consider eliminating this qualification about having one child to qualify for the low rise mortgage scheme since it does not seem to apply to an existing tenant of a house who can get a local authority house even though he has no children.</P>

I can give no commitment at this moment as to what extent it will be altered.  Neither can I give any firm commitment as to when it will be altered.  I have great sympathy with the categories mentioned by Senator Markey.  As my Minister mentioned in the Dáil, when changes are being made we will treat sympathetically childless couples and those who probably may be entitled to priority on social and professional grounds.  I can give no firm commitment as to when this will be done. Definitely, when the changes are being made we will bear the categories mentioned by the Senator very much in mind.</P>

      <P>The interest subsidies for certain types of loans by building societies which are guaranteed by the local authorities raise the question of the need for a general subsidy towards all building society loans, particularly at a time of exceedingly high interest.  There are precedents from some years ago, in the time of the Minister's predecessor, when interest subsidies were paid to cushion the impact on young married couples of high interest rates.  At present many people are being seriously prejudiced by virtue of the high interest rates which building societies and other lending agencies have to charge.  The Minister, in order to try to keep down the inflationary spiral and reduce the pressure on people to seek increases in income to compensate for their increase in repayments, should come in at a very strategic point in the economy and subsidise building society repayments during times of high interest.  It would have a great dampening effect on demands on the economy and would help keep the inflationary spiral under control.</P>

      <P>The interest subsidies mentioned by Senator Cooney do not come within the ambit of section 12. Such interest subsidies were discontinued in 1976.  Since 22 June last the associated banks increased their interest rates from 1½ per cent to 3½ per cent. The lowest rates offered to depositors with up to £5,000 went up from 8½ per cent to 10 per cent.  The rate of deposits between £5,000 and £25,000 went up from 9½ per cent to 12 per cent.  The rate on deposits over £25,000 went up from 10 per cent to 13½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present investment rate offered by building societies is 9 per cent. Traditionally, building society rates have always been higher than bank rates, at least for amounts up to £5,000.  The reason for this has been to enable building societies to compete effectively in attracting new funds and retaining existing <Col N="1525" /> deposits.  The rate offered by societies to investors dictates the mortgage rate level.  Any attempt to hold down the mortgage rate artificially while at the same time raising the investment rate would have to be subsidised from some outside source.  The cost of such a subsidy has been calculated to be of the order of £6 million to £7 million annually for every 1 per cent by which the mortgage rate was subsidised.  To increase the investment rate by 1 per cent to have the ½ percentage differential, which operated at the low level of deposit up to recently, would therefore require an annual subsidy of the order of £9 million to £11 million.  There is no way by which such large amounts could be provided from central funds without reallocation of the overall amounts available for housing purposes.  This would undoubtedly require a reduction in the provision for the building of houses for those at present in need of rehousing, particularly if we were to have the subsidisation of those already adequately housed.</P>

      <P>I must express some sense of reservation about the discretion which is now given to housing authorities either to seek or not to seek a report from the medical officer in regard to priority in lettings.  Can the Minister tell us what indication he has received from local authorities that they wish to <Col N="1527" /> have such a discretion given them? From any discussions I have had with officials of local authorities, it would appear that most of them are going to continue under the old system whereby they almost automatically seek medical opinion in regard to any application for tenancy allocation.  They feel safer in doing so.  After all, they obtain this service from the respective health boards on an agency basis.  Since they are paying the health boards an agency fee for this service and other services, most of the local authorities would wish to continue under this system.  It would give them a greater feeling of having covered every aspect of a person's application when they receive a report from the medical officer.  I am not entirely satisfied that this discretion will work to the best satisfaction.  It will lead to certain anomalies arising in regard to overall allocation.  Some applicants will have a medical report on their files, and other will not, arising simply from a discretion exercised by a local authority official, who may for a number of reasons have decided in individual cases not to seek medical opinion or, on the basis of inadequate information, may have either sought a medical opinion or may not have.  In the overall context it would be better to have a uniform system, either to have medical reports in all cases or not to have them at all.  The existing system where local authorities must have regard to medical opinions in regard to allocation of tenancies is far preferable to this amendment whereby a discretion is given to the local authority official either to seek or not to seek such medical opinion.</P>

      <P>The position is that this section was amended to a significant extent by the Dáil.  The proposals as set out in the Bill before the House were widely welcomed by a number of local authorities.  We must bear in mind the fact that the decision is one for elected members.  As I understand it, the problems as regards getting in reports quickly on applications for rehousing and for the fixing of a housing priority list were not as acute in urban areas and in county borough corporation districts <Col N="1528" /> as they were in rural areas.  In many rural areas the county council, urban district councils and town commissioners depended to a great extent on the staffs of the health boards, particularly the medical officers in charge of the community health services.  Those staffs were very busy and housing work on behalf of housing authorities was not considered to be very high on their priority list. Most of their work was in relation to health matters.  That is why it was decided to amend section 60 of the Principal Act and give the necessary options to the councils.</P>

      <P>I should like to enter an objection to section 17.  It is another attack on the autonomy of local authorities.  The Minister proposes in section 17 to take power to tell a local authority to sell particular houses under section 90 of the Principal Act which authorises local authorities to sell their houses to the sitting tenants or to any other person in certain circumstances but it leaves it to the discretion of the local authority whether the stock of houses is to be sold or not.  Section 17 gives the Minister power to tell a local authority, if he so wishes, to sell a house or not to sell a house of a particular class.  This is another example of interference with the autonomy and powers of local authorities which has got a tremendous impetus with the total abolition of rates and the replacement of that type of financing by the type devised by the Government.  In effect, the Government can now direct local authorities what to do and what not to do.  This is an example of interference by central Government with local government; local government is becoming a misnomer and a branch of central Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority, the body familiar with the conditions in its own area that would have to come to be considered in deciding whether or not to effect sales, is <Col N="1529" /> the best body to make a decision as to whether public housing should be sold or not.  It is a drastic step for the Minister to propose to take power to tell a local authority what to do or what not to do in this sensitive area which is peculiarly local.  I should like to know from the Minister why he feels it is necessary to take this power.</P>

      <P>I should like to subscribe to the sentiments expressed by Senator Cooney on this section.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, I see no good reason why this section should be introduced.  Housing authorities, and their tenants, are close in the assessment of the development of purchase schemes. Heretofore, it was always the housing authorities who were the pioneers and sought the sanction from the Department for vesting schemes.  In the final analysis, it is left to the tenant whether or not he avails of a purchase scheme. Under the existing scheme which is quite satisfactory, each two years or so, according to inflation, new purchase schemes were initiated and the option was left entirely to the tenant whether he availed of the scheme or not.  This is new phraseology on a direction from the Department to a housing authority to sell particular houses and it could well be deemed as a direction to the tenants to buy houses.  This is not the situation and I see no good reason for this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a precautionary measure.  Tenants should be facilitated and those who want to purchase their houses should be allowed to do so in normal circumstances.  There is always the danger that a local authority, for some reason or another, may decide that they would not have a purchase scheme for a number of years hence.  In some other countries housing authorities have adopted a policy recently of not selling their houses to tenants who were anxious to purchase them.  It is also important that the Minister should be in a position to direct housing authorities not to sell purpose-built houses such as dwellings for elderly people. It is important that this type of dwellings should not be lost to the national stock.  At present local authorities have <Col N="1530" /> discretion as to the sale of any of their houses.</P>

      <P>The section is giving power to Big Brother, the Department, to interfere with the activities of a particular local authority.  The Minister has stated that tenants should be facilitated in buying their houses; tenants should be allowed buy their houses and that local authorities could decide that there would not be any sale of houses.  He said that those were the reasons why he should take this power but what is the point of having a local authority if they cannot make those decisions within their own domain?  Local authorities, for good and proper reasons, might decide that there should not be a purchase scheme of local authority houses in a particular area or street to a particular type of tenant. Their discretion should be allowed remain unfettered by any threat from Big Brother in the Custom House telling them what to do.</P>

I suspect that some local authorities might not be anxious at the moment to sell some of their houses because of the reasons I gave earlier under section 9. Local authorities are in a great position to judge whether or not certain tenants should be able to buy houses and whether or not certain schemes should be made available for purchase by tenants. Local authorities, and the Department, are at odds in certain respects on <Col N="1531" /> matters of policy and generally speaking there is a very poor level of communication and consultation between local authorities and the Department. That is to be regretted.  I regret to see this section putting a further wedge between the local authorities and the principal housing authority, the Department. This is a matter of policy and the Minister has clearly made up his mind on this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 13, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) The Minister shall make a decision on an application for a certificate under paragraph (a) of this subsection and notify his decision to the applicant within 21 days of the receipt by him of the application and if he refuses the application he shall specify, in the notice of refusal, particulars of his reasons for such refusal and should the Minister fail to make a decision on the application within the said period of 21 days the application shall be deemed to have been granted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 has caused quite an amount of controversy.  It is the section that provides for a new regime in relation to certificates of reasonable value.  It provides for their granting and their application. It provides for regulations as to what information has to be given when they are applied for and, most significantly of all, it takes power to <Col N="1533" /> prohibit the making of loans within certain financial bands unless the borrower has a certificate of reasonable value.  It provides also for failure to comply with the section henceforth to be a criminal offence attracting serious sanctions.  It is a get-tough section with builders.  Indeed one can sympathise with the Minister's desire to ensure that house purchasers get good value.  At the same time we want to make sure that we do not devise a regime that would be counterproductive in terms of dampening down the activities of builders to a serious degree.  I would hope the Minister would reassure me at some stage that this section does not contain within itself some sort of a hidden economic power to control the level of building in the country at any particular time.  It might be a useful tactical exercise for the Department of Economic Planning and Development to influence the level of building at a particular time in the overall economic strategy.  It would be a very nice, political way to be able to do it through the medium of the Department of the Environment and the non-issue, or the slow issue, or the issue with heavy conditions of certificates of reasonable value.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to assure me that such considerations will never be a part of his thinking when it comes to considering the issue, non-issue or conditional issue of certificates of reasonable value; that the only considerations he will take into account in coming to his decision will be those applicable entirely to the net question of reasonable value, the cost of the building and the standards being applied in the building.</P>
    <P>It is important that the public get good value.  I sympathise with the Minister's wish to ensure through this mechanism that they will get good value, that these certificates will have to be applied for in great detail and that builders costings, so far as it is open to any third party to get behind the small print of a builders' costings, be examined to see that they are good value.  At the same time we must be fair both to the builder and his customer.  The customer could be prejudiced by failure to grant a certificate of reasonable value, prejudiced in that he could feel aggrieved with regard <Col N="1534" /> to not getting his loan or grant.  It could be very important for many members of the public, the people whom this section sets out to protect, that the builder would get a certificate of reasonable value.</P>
    <P>Consequently this new section has to walk a fairly delicate dividing line between the conflicting interests in this whole scene.  One of the ways in which justice can be ensured is by providing for an appeal mechanism in a situation where a certificate is refused, the appeal mechanism provided being that the person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  The mechanism provided to ensure fair play for the builder, so to speak, is contained in subsection (5) where there is provision for appeals to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 does two things.  It provides that where the Minister receives an application he must rule on it within 21 days and, in giving his decision on it, he must also give his reasons for his decision.  In other words, if he refuses it, he must state within 21 days that it is being refused and give his reasons for the refusal.  Amendment No. 2, which is related, seeks to compel the Minister to give reasons for his decisions; it does not specify a time limit.  In effect what these two amendments require is (a) that the Minister gives his decision within 21 days and (b) if he refuses a certificate, that he gives reasons for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that there be a time limit placed on the Minister, that he gives his decision within 21 days.  He is taking power under this section to make regulations calling for all sorts of documentation.  If his regulations are complied with, as they will have to be, there will be full and ample information available on the application for the certificate to enable a decision be given within three weeks.  Presumably there will be an expertise within the Department, there already from experience of dealing with these certificates at present, able to assess an application coming in <Col N="1535" /> with detailed information within three weeks.  It is important from the point of view of the builder that he would not be delayed in his operation, important from the point of view of the house purchaser, whose uncertainty is going to be terminated, who will know that he will get his loan and/or his grant and important for the lending agencies that they will know that there is not going to be undue delay in granting these certificates.  It would be an indication of the Minister's bona fides that there is no hidden economic reasons behind this section if he would accept an amendment that he had to grant it within 21 days.</P>
    <P>It is important also that the Minister would give his reasons in his decision because the builder is entitled, when he is refused a certificate, to know precisely why.  Natural justice requires that if a person is going to be prejudiced, or is going to have his position so seriously altered as to be refused a certificate of reasonable value, that he be given the reasons for so doing.  There are ample cases&mdash;the most notorious recent one being that of former Commissioner Edmund Garvey&mdash;in which the courts laid down the principle that natural justice required that where a person's circumstances are going to be altered to his detriment, or indeed altered, he is entitled to be given the reasons therefor.  In this case the Minister has no obligation to give reasons for doing such a serious thing as refusing a certificate of reasonable value.  He merely says: &ldquo;If I refuse you, you can appeal to the Circuit Court&rdquo;.  In addition to natural justice, a second reason why the Minister should give reasons is to try to ensure that the issues that go before the court are specific.  At present if a person appeals against a refusal, he lodges an appeal in the Circuit Court.  But he does not know what he is appealing against; he does not know the case he will have to meet.</P>
    <P>This is unsatisfactory from the point of view of court proceedings.  It is part and parcel of our court proceedings that the issues before they come to court are set out on paper in advance so that <Col N="1536" /> the court and the parties know what is to be litigated upon.  In this case there is no way in which that can happen.  The Minister refuses a certificate and the builder appeals.  What does the builder say?  He is the moving party.  He goes to court and says, &ldquo;I appeal against the Minister's refusal&rdquo;.  What will the court decide as between the Minister and the builder unless there are issues before the court?  Will the court then hear the Minister respond, &ldquo;We refuse the builder's application for the following reasons&rdquo;?  How will the builder get professional advice there and then so that he can instruct his counsel?  How can the court make an assessment on these matters without a full trial before it?  Natural justice requires the Minister to give reasons so that a person can know why he is being prejudiced, and satisfactory court procedure also requires that the Minister would give reasons.  It is for these reasons that I tabled these two amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Cooney has said and I urge the Minister to accept the amendments put forward. My view on section 18, which is the real bite in the Bill, is that it is not really a matter for the Minister.  In relation to the issue of the CRVs the Minister will find himself acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity and function.  It is a little against the trend of legislation, particularly of the last Government, who established the office of the DPP who was independent of and apart from the Government.  An Bord Pleanála, who are closely allied to this area, seem to be independent of and apart from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that the builder has the right to appeal in relation to a refusal of an issue of a CRV, but do the public have the right of appeal where the Minister grants a CRV to a person who, perhaps, ought not be granted one?  I am not suggesting that the Minister or any member of the Government would act in an improper way.  In an area like this, it is not a matter of Government attitude. Criteria can be laid down as to the standards a house must have, the area in which houses must be built and so on, and an independent body could be established <Col N="1537" /> to set up and adjudicate on these matters which affect people's livelihood, matters in respect of which people have certain natural rights.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney is correct when he says that a person will be denied access to principles of natural justice if he is expected to go to court to appeal against a decision not knowing the reason for the decision.  Perhaps, in some manner in the regulations laid down, that can be overcome, but that is wrong.  The procedure should be laid down here.</P>
    <P>The reason I suggest that an independent body should have the right to decide on these matters is on the basis of an Adjournment debate in the Dáil a few weeks ago where a Member was concerned about the non-issue of CRVs.  I do not know the facts behind that case, but a Minister has great power in that area and it is important that justice is not merely done but is seen to be done. This is one area where it may be abused&mdash;I am not suggesting by the Minister or any member of his Government. It is an area that could easily have been put in the hands of an independent body.  I am not entitled to make such an amendment because it would change the entire meaning and sense of the section, but I support the amendments proposed by Senator Cooney and I urge the Minister to accept them.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy with the amendments, despite the fact that I am on this side of the House.  In fact, I have grave reservations about the whole CRV operation.  At the same time, I see the positive side and I realise, from conversations with the Minister and other people concerned, that it is an attempt to speed up the process of getting reasonable value for a house.  If a larger body were involved, as was suggested by Senator Molony, it might slow it down even more.</P>

      <P>Independent means that An Bord Pleanála introduce all kinds of delays.  That is why I have sympathy with the amendment.  The notion of the Department dealing with it, but having a time limit on it, makes sense to <Col N="1538" /> me.  If they will deal with it with alacrity let them do it; if they do not do it within a certain period of time, let the CRV be deemed to be granted at the requested level.</P>
      <P>I would be worried about interfering with the market mechanism in relation to the price, protecting the people against the Department in relation to the price they would agree, because eventually the price will reach its market level.  If things do not improve we might see some difficulties in relation to the price of houses and the number of houses built.  I am all for speeding matters up and I have some sympathy with the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1, which is identical to one tabled but not accepted in the Dáil, is designed to help builders who are applying for CRVs by ensuring that they get decisions inside three weeks, and that if they are refused CRVs, particulars of the reasons are stated.  Although I, too, am favourably disposed towards both these objectives, I am not convinced that the acceptance of the amendment would, in the long run, be desirable as far as the builder is concerned.</P>
      <P>In the first place, I will give my reasons for being opposed to the idea of a statutory time limit.  Time-wise, a satisfactory standard of service has been provided to date and this is partly due to the absence of rigid time limits and the consequent flexibility which the present system allows.  In the first six months of this year 1,338 decisions were issued and the average time taken for a decision was only 13 days.  The number of cases taking more than a month is very small, about one in 20 according to a recent check, and these would usually involve some abnormal aspects which might necessitate a site inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if one were to accept the idea of a time limit, it would have to run from the date of receipt of all necessary information, not from the date of application, since applications are frequently incomplete. The nature and extent of information required may very from one case to another depending on the amount of detail needed to justify the price, any abnormal factors affecting the price and so <Col N="1539" /> on.  At present, many of the requests for further information and clarification are made on the telephone or during interviews where it is easier to explain what is involved and quicker than making formal written requests, as the amendment would require.  For example, during the recent postal difficulties, the informal approach was of benefit to builders.</P>
    <P>A time limit like 21 days might, in exceptional circumstances, be impossible to meet with resultant granting of CRVs by default&mdash;which I am sure the proposers of the amendment would not welcome.  I am talking about a short-term situation which might arise following a decision to extend the CRV system with a resulting increase in the volume of applications.  Here also we have to be realistic and recognise that it is extremely difficult to recruit the professional staff needed.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that the Minister is answerable to both Houses of the Oireachtas for the administration of the controls and for any undue delays that might occur.  On balance I suggest that in practice the imposition of a statutory time limit would not improve on the present standard of service.</P>
    <P>The second part of this amendment would oblige the Minister to give details of reasons for refusing CRVs.  At present, the only reason given is the obvious one: that the price exceeds the amount appearing to the Minister to represent reasonable value.  I am aware that many builders feel that they should be given particulars of the reasons but I am afraid it is not as easy as it may seem at first sight.  Here I might mention that the Coalition Government resisted similar requests for the same good reasons.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (3) (d) and section 18 (4) deal with the question of excessive site costs.  It could be argued that the remaining elements of the cost should be treated as one unit.  This would not permit one to give a specific reason, such as &ldquo;overheads are too high&rdquo;, or &ldquo;roofing costs were too dear&rdquo; because in the final analysis the cost of the various elements is irrelevant so long as the total price is reasonable.  It often happens that a <Col N="1540" /> builder has paid over the odds for some element, but because of economy of building and management of operations succeeds in getting a CRV.  Indeed, the information given by builders is often so inadequate or the price breakdown is so different from the Department's approach to the calculation of reasonable value that it is not possible to pinpoint accurately which elements are making the price higher than what appears to be reasonable.  A builder's actual costs plus overheads and profit need not necessarily represent reasonable value.  Other factors such as efficiency, good buying practices and so forth are also relevant.</P>
    <P>A further point is that to go into detail about reasons for rejection would be tantamount to publication of my Department's criteria for the assessment of reasonable value so that builders would know my Department's figure for reasonable value before they ever apply. This would, in effect, put my Department in the position of fixing prices, which would not be a desirable situation especially since the majority of prices applied are lower than would be approved by reference to these criteria and the net effect might well be to push up these prices.</P>
    <P>To impose a statutory requirement about particulars of reasons would mean that my Department would in every case have to look for much more detailed information from the builder than he has to submit at present or even than he may have at his disposal, even though such information may not be necessary to enable a CRV to be granted as is the case in the vast majority of applications at the moment.  The provision of such information would add to builders' expenses, impose additional discipline on their operations, and delay the whole process.  I do not think it would improve the position as far as the vast majority of builders are concerned.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest that the need for an amendment of this nature is not as great as previously, in view of the additional safeguard being proposed in subsection (5) namely, the granting of a right of appeal to the Circuit Court against the refusal of a CRV.  I should also mention <Col N="1541" /> in this context that the detailed basis of the calculation of reasonable value is at present being reviewed with the involvement of a prominent quantity surveyor nominated on a confidential basis by the Irish House Builders' Association.  I trust that this explains why I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, however, I should like to repeat the Minister's promise to the Dáil that, in the context of forthcoming discussions with representatives of the house builders, he would consider the possibility of indicating to applicants for CRVs in a broad and less formal way which particular element appears to be making prices unreasonable.  I stress again that in the vast majority of cases being examined at present it is not possible to say why the price should not be reasonable because of the lack of information from the applicant, so that these discussions will only be relevant in cases where sufficient information is available. Some Senators raised the question about Circuit Court procedures for dealing with appeals and Senator Brugha raised one aspect of this on Second Stage which I promised to reply to on this Stage.</P>
    <P>The CRV appeals are a new function of the Circuit Court.  There are no established procedures or rules of court for the handling of the appeals.  When the Bill becomes law it will be a matter for the Circuit Court rules committee to draw up rules of court if it considers such rules to be necessary.  These rules would, if drawn up, regulate such matters as the form the appeal should take, submission of observations by the Minister, time limits and so forth.  If there are no rules it will be a matter for the court to decide on procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points in the Minister's reply to the amendment.  I should like to compliment him on his reply.  Any person who can find the worth that he found in the postal dispute must certainly be complimented.  It is an ill wind that does not blow some good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what the Minister has said in relation to a period of 13 days to issue a certificate of reasonable value.  The whole system of certificates of reasonable value has more or less collapsed. <Col N="1542" /> The only way one can judge this is to judge what percentage of houses built in the country are now built with a certificate of reasonable value going with them.  I am sure the Minister accepts that the number has shrunk very appreciably in the last few years.  If this section as it stands becomes law a greater percentage of houses built will be required to have a certificate of reasonable value.  It is likely, because of that, that delays will become far greater.</P>
    <P>The regulations in relation to certificates of reasonable value are a good deal more complex than they were in the past.  It follows that it will take a longer time for officials to consider them.  If the Minister is able to tell us that he will increase the staff of that particular section in his Department sufficiently to deal with the new influx of applications, perhaps that might get over it.  I would not be satisfied even with that.  It is an area in which we are dealing with people's livelihoods and they are entitled to a response within three weeks.</P>
    <P>It seems also it is against the trend, for example, in our planning legislation.  If a person does not get his planning permission decision within two months or reasons why not, he will automatically get the permission.  I know of people who have applied and who have received queries from the planning authority within the two months period.  It is solely to keep open the issue whether or not they are getting planning permission. This is a most unsatisfactory system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reasons the Minister gave for refusing to give reasons to people who are refused certificates of reasonable value, I find it very hard to accept the logic of what he says.  I do not think it is that bad an idea that builders should know of the criteria that the Department use in deciding whether to grant or refuse the certificates of reasonable value.  Certainly, when the appeal system in the Circuit Court emerges, it is inevitable that builders will know of the criteria used.  I cannot imagine how the Minister envisages this court system will operate.  At the moment it is not intended to give any reasons.  Is it proposed to give evidence at all to the court?  Will the Department inspectors go into the court and <Col N="1543" /> say: &ldquo;We cannot discuss our criteria here because we would be letting the builders know how we judge their applications&rdquo;? I honestly believe that when the Circuit Court rules committee get together and look at this their minds will boggle at the difficulties they will be faced with by way of procedures. Presumably, all that will be involved is the notice of appeal, the matter will go on to the Circuit Court, the judge will have nothing to look at beforehand to assess what the case is about and he will have no idea what issues are there.  The Minister says that the builder is not going to know about them.  Therefore, the builder will go into court, he will move the case and his counsel will stand before the court and say: &ldquo;My Lord, we were refused a certificate of reasonable value&rdquo;.  At that stage he will sit down and the judge will turn to the Department's counsel and say: &ldquo;What happens now?  Where do we go from here?&rdquo;  It seems to me that the whole system is a little bit convoluted and requires a good deal more thought before it is implemented.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the Senators on the opposite side must have come to the conclusion by now that the Minister is not prepared to concede the principle in the two amendments.

      <P>I am not speaking for the amendments which I do not think have much hope of being accepted by the Minister.  It seems to me that underlying all of this is the desire on the <Col N="1544" /> part of the administration which is represented by the Minister to try to ensure that the price level be kept as low as possible.  That is the principle on which this whole thing is based.  I have doubts about the correctness of the position being taken up by the Minister where he will not explain the reasons for refusing a certificate of reasonable value though I concede that in section 5 he has gone some of the way to meet the case by agreeing to a 21-day period in which to reply.  In his reply he also satisfied me that there may be a way out of this subsequently in relation to setting out some of the criteria.  In view of the fact that it is in the public interest that the Minister does not wish to disclose the reasons for rejection, I want to put to him the question that I put to him before.  That is, what exactly is the case going to be before the Circuit Court?  The Minister in replying to that gave an answer but one which did not answer the question.  I think he said that the court would have to set out some rules of its own.  It seems to me that some formula will have to be found which, without giving away the secrets the Minister wants to keep to himself in the public interest, will cover this area.  I cannot see how one is going to withhold from the Circuit Court the necessary information setting out the grounds for refusal.  So I see this as merely a means of postponing for the time being the decision in regard to what the Minister intends doing.  While I support the section, because I believe it is in the best interests of the public, I think the points being put by the opposite side about refusal to give reasons is one that needs to be examined, at least at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I am concerned, too, about the question of criteria.  I am glad to know, and this should be emphasised and be made as public as possible, that the Department intend to consult with an unnamed qualified professional quantity surveyor agreed with the builders' association.  I did know about it but I do not think it was as widely appreciated by those concerned as it ought to be.  I am always concerned when a matter like this, which is a professional matter, has to do with the profession of <Col N="1545" /> quantity surveying, finds its way into administrative procedures in civil service departments.  I should hope that those who look at this and make judgments based on movable criteria or unknown criteria or unknown standards of measurement would be well qualified to do that.  I am just a bit concerned about that and that is why I have reservations about the whole CRV method.  I am also concerned about the courts being brought in constantly.  Everything that is going on in this country at the moment seems to end up being resolved by lawyers.  It goes outside the profession of engineering; it goes outside the profession of medicine; it goes outside the profession of legislators and is something about which I am quite concerned. I should not be talking about it on the amendment but I am entitled to my concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I know about the CRV system as it operates at the moment is that everywhere I go I get complaints.  In the constituency where I am operating, places like Griffith Court or Phillipsburgh <Col N="1546" /> Avenue, I am inundated with people's problems and I cannot help thinking that there cannot be smoke without some fire.  I hope that the system will work.  I can see that there are improvements in it; I can see the spirit behind the Minister's intention and the intention of the departmental officials, but I am afraid they might be tying themselves down and making life more difficult for themselves in the future.  It is certainly making life more difficult for the builders.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Cooney that section 4 (2) (e) would preclude the payment of grants in certain hardship cases involving <Col N="1548" /> divorce or separation I should like to say that, while we are aware of such cases and intend to take as sympathetic a view as possible in dealing with applications from such persons, it is not possible to amend paragraph (e) to make specific provision for them without weakening it considerably.  Since it is widely accepted that grants should not be available to people purchasing houses for the second or third time, we do not want to see this provision weakened. Should I at any stage consider that a provision on the lines of paragraph (e) should not be included in the regulations, I may omit this requirement from the regulations.  This is an enabling provision only.  I should add, however, that at present the general concept of giving preference to first time occupiers is sound and a change of policy is not contemplated.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Cooney on subsection (2) (d), this subsection caters for cases of unregistered land only which covers the majority of mortgages in the Dublin area.  In such cases ownership is vested in the mortgagee, subject to an equity of redemption.</P>
      <P>In the case of registered land where there is an existing Land Registry charge on the land, the housing authority loan may be secured under subsections (a), (b) or (c).  This is the position and I hope it answers the Senator's question.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister does not hold out much hope for the hardship case we gave as an example when debating section 4 (2) (e). The Minister's reason in essence is that to deal with the hardship case he would be weakening the defence he has built in against persons other than first-time purchasers benefiting from the grant. This is another example of a case where the individual goes to the wall in order to maintain the herd rule.  It is a pity that the Minister could not devise a system which would admit a discretion to him on behalf of the State to ease hardship on an individual citizen.  We are all agreed that the type of case I mentioned is one that should get consideration and it is wrong that the answer should be, &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot do anything; we <Col N="1549" /> might lower the barriers&rdquo;.  It is not beyond the wit of the Minister to devise a system whereby he could use a discretion and give a discretion to deal with these hardship cases.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other point he raised&mdash;the question of the second mortgage where the property is registered in the Land Registry&mdash;I take the point that section 8 (2) (b) permits a second charge where there is a second loan.</P>

      <P>The number of houses being built was raised on Second Stage and I said I would mention it again on this Stage.  The position is that in February, 1976, the NESC carried out an independent assessment of housing needs and concluded that 21,000 to 25,000 houses a year would be required up to 1986 to meet accumulated needs and prospective needs arising principally from the fact that our population has been expanding in recent years at a rate which is about the fifth fastest amongst OECD countries.  Nevertheless, no authoritative source has established that we need to build more than 25,000 houses a year.  In fact, house completions last year, at 25,444, represented an increase of almost 900 relative to 1977. Completions in 1979 should exceed 25,500.  Our White Paper of January 1979 indicated that 23,000 to 27,000 houses a year would be provided up to 1980.  There is no point in building 30,000 houses this year and 20,000 houses next year.  We must continue to avoid peaks and valleys in the housing sector and minimise problems caused by shortages of certain skills.  We must also distinguish between fluctuations in long-term demand and medium-term housing needs.  Last year, building societies, for example, advanced £148 million.  If the <Col N="1550" /> societies continued to attract funds at the rate experienced during the period December 1978 to May 1979 total advances could have exceeded £250 million this year.  My Department informed the societies in May last that such an increase in advance would be excessive and would have an inflationary effect on house prices.  For their part, there are signs that the societies have moderated their rate of increase in loan approvals and payments since then.</P>
      <P>As a general rule the broad aims of the building societies are compatible with the Government's national housing programme.  In 1979 the need to reconcile the society's policies with the national housing programme was apparent. In the normal course this problem rarely arises.  In any event, it should not normally be necessary to invoke section 20 for the purpose of ensuring a clearance to certain features of housing policy.  We would much prefer to have policies determined and agreed along with following a full and frank exchange of views.</P>
      <P>We were in the situation in 1978 where price increases were excessive and a limited number of societies were simply not prepared to operate certain controls, even on an experimental basis.  It behoves the Government to take corrective legal action which is now embodied in sections 18 and 20 of the Bill.  When it is considered that for every one per cent increase in new house prices there is a loss of £4 million which could be applied to the creation of jobs, the position is seen in its true perspective.  Essentially, the Government cannot abdicate their responsibilities in this area now or in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the debate on the Bill is brought to a close, I should like to make a brief general comment.  The Bill was initiated on 1 May 1979.  I hoped that the Dáil Second Reading of the Bill would be taken before the end of May but this was not possible due mainly to the prolonged debate on the Family Planning Bill and the Finance Bill.  The Dáil Second Reading of the Housing Bill commenced on 27 June and concluded on 17 July.  During that period the debate lasted some 30 hours.  It is fair to say that Opposition Deputies generally <Col N="1551" /> accepted the fact that the Minister went a long way towards meeting proposals for amendments.  Twenty-two amendments were made to the Bill on Committee Stage while 19 amendments were made on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Seanad, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking Senators for their support for the Bill.  It seems that Senators should not belittle their contributions to the formulation of housing policy.  In particular, the three-hour debate in the Seanad on 2 February on the Private Members' Motion on house prices established the view that there was widespread political support for some form of house price control. On 8 July I listened carefully to the Second Stage debate which lasted about six hours.  While I was not convinced that there were grounds for amending the Bill as passed by Dáil Eireann, the debate was useful and interesting.  The Dáil did not adjourn until that day. Despite the fact that the Bill has not been amended in the Seanad, the views expressed by Senators on Second Stage and Committee Stage will be taken into account in framing regulations under the Bill.  We are also fortunate that the Cathaoirleach took a liberal view on Second Stage in allowing Senators to debate very important facets of housing policy, even aspects I would consider to be outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The principal features of the Government's housing policy have been set out in their election manifesto of May 1977, the White Papers of January 1978 and January 1977, the Green Paper of June 1978, the Minister's Estimate speech of 9 March 1978 and the Minister's contribution to specific aspects of policy raised during the course of the Dáil debates on the Bill.  During these debates the Minister dealt very fully with the question of the views of the Irish Building Societies' Association and of the Construction Industry Federation on the Bill.  This Bill will have far-reaching implications.  It provides a modern, flexible, statutory framework for new house and house improvement grants, improvement loans, the local authority <Col N="1552" /> housing subsidy system, site subsidies and the low-rise mortgage system.  These provisions can, for example, be applied to designated areas and varied in a simple manner without recourse to further legislation.  The Bill also contains a framework for a form of house price control which may be applied, modified or dismantled as occasion demands.  The Bill was urgent because there was no good reason why there should be any unreasonable legal impediment to the implementation of sound housing policies.  We now have the opportunity of focusing increasing attention on the Government's basic aim in housing, which is to ensure that as far as resources of the economy permit every private household has a house of good standard located in an acceptable environment at a price or rent they can afford.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister and the Department in implementing the provisions of this Bill will use discretion as economic affairs unfold.  I will continue to keep a close eye on the situation and to raise questions periodically with the Minister about the implementation of various parts of the Bill.  Nobody has come up with a revision of the required level of housing and this needs to be revised.  In particular, I am concerned about using a global figure like 25,000 or 24,000 houses when we know that in the worst region of the country&mdash;the inner city of Dublin&mdash;we have not kept up with demand.  In fact, we have fallen very far behind.  If we use global figures, we must be careful to break them down for the various regions in the country and ask whether we have met demands in those areas.  In one very important area we have not met them.</P>

      <Col N="1553" /> Section 1 agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose section 2, a levy on milk and slaughtered or exported animals.  For a number of reasons we are very much opposed to this levy system now being imposed on farmers.  The main reason for opposing it is that a big percentage of farmers have already cleared the disease from their herds and are now being asked under this section to pay a levy to finance eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis from the herds of other farmers who did not make the effort in the initial stages to get rid of the diseases.  We feel very strongly that this is unfair and unjust and, I fear, unconstitutional.  People who made the effort over the years to eradicate disease should be congratulated on doing so because they realised the effects of these diseases not alone on the cattle industry but on the human being as well.</P>
      <P>The advice given over the years by the agricultural advisers and the veterinary section of the Department of Agriculture was given to all farmers, not just a section of farmers.  That advice should have been accepted by all but according to the figures being produced, that was not so. A section of farmers ignored the advice given.  They are getting away with it because those who took advice given to them and who rid their herds of those diseases are now being levied so that others will get rid of disease.  It is my opinion that those people who made no effort in the past will make very little effort in the future unless there is legislation to bind them to getting rid of disease.  The levy then will have no effect on these people, but it will have an effect on the people who have already paid for the eradication of disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know more about the dairying industry than the meat industry but the rate of levy&mdash;0.5p per gallon of milk and £3 per animal slaughtered or <Col N="1554" /> animal exported&mdash;is very substantial.  It is substantial this year because it is my belief&mdash;and I am certain of this because I am involved in the industry&mdash;that farmers will make no profit whatsoever out of milk.  I am sure the same is true of people who are feeding cattle to produce beef.  There will be no profits for farmers this year for the simple reason that a number of levies have been imposed on them over the last 12 months.  The co-responsibility levy is 0.327p a gallon.  The Bord Bainne levy, which we all support, is 1 per cent.  The Agricultural Institute levy is .05p.  The agricultural produce duty, which is the one that we hear so much about, is 2 per cent.  This levy has been opposed violently by all the farming organisations.  The milk levy is 0.2 per cent and there is the bovine disease levy of 0.5p.  All those taken into consideration would add 2½p on farmers' costs, without any increase to the farmers for their produce, especially for milk production.  We have heard of the cost of living and the national inflation of 14 and 15 per cent.  This also has an effect on the agricultural sector and financial people have informed me that it is going to cost the farmer up to 3p a gallon.  By the introduction of all the levies farmers will receive much less for their milk this year and in future years.  Is this the time to impose levies?  We need farmers to produce more.  The inspectorate attached to the Department of Agriculture are advising managers in the dairy industry to encourage farmers to produce more but the Minister of that Department is coming in here imposing a levy on farmers through this Bill.  There is a contradiction there, where you have one section of the Department of Agriculture advising that farmers should be encouraged to produce more milk and then you have another section of the Department who, by introducing the levy system, are discouraging farmers.  It is my honest opinion that if this section were put to the farming organisations and their members, irrespective of their political affiliation, their unanimous decision would be that the section is wrong.  There is not one member of any farming organisation who would agree with the Minister today that this levy should be imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>No, of course they do not. They want a fair distribution of that income tax.  The levy is wrong because it is not a fair levy.  It is coming at the wrong time when we should be encouraging farmers to produce more.  The investment in the dairy industry over the past number of years, especially the past two or three years, has been enormous.  New milk drying plants have been erected and machinery to deal with cheese has been introduced in the creamery industry in the past year or two which cost millions of pounds and which must be paid by the farmers.  If we are to have a situation where farmers because of the levy reduce the supply of milk to the creameries then that in itself will create a further levy because the manpower will still have to be employed to help process the milk.  There will be no reduction in that as far as I know.  We will try in the dairy industry not to have any unemployment because of this legislation but if we have to keep the people employed then there is going to be extra cost on the reduced amount of milk. That is natural.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a bad Bill.  The aim of removing bovine diseases is right and we must all do our bit to help.  The danger is that farmers will get out of milk completely. I am deeply involved.  I am a member of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association, even president of that association.  I meet creamery managers every second week.  They know the cost of production and the effect this and other levies will have on milk production and they are worried that production will be reduced substantially. They are trying to encourage farmers to stay in milk but it is difficult. Hundreds of farmers have come to the creameries for that famous form that will compensate them for getting out of milk.  The only reason is that there is no profit in milk.  It is a seven-day a week job.  A member of any union would be compensated for working the hours put in by farmers each week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Whitaker said last <Col N="1556" /> week that a lot of money was wasted over the years on the eradication of diseases. Comment was made to me by farmers since that statement appeared in the papers&mdash;I do not like mentioning this&mdash;as to who was the financial adviser to the Government at that time.  I would like to say this.  Let us do our bit for the farmers of Ireland, not alone for the farmers of Ireland but for all sections of the people.  Agriculture provides employment in related industries and because of that everybody will be affected by this legislation, and especially by this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally this side of the House is opposed to the section.  This section has nothing to do with animal disease.  It is just another measure designed to improve the finances of the Government at the expense of the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how this section fits into a Bill which is supposed to contribute towards the elimination of disease.  It is just another indication of how far this Government are prepared to go by every means they can devise further to impose a heavy burden of taxation on an industry without any regard whatever to the effect it will have on the performance of that industry or the ability of the individuals engaged in it to contribute by way of taxation.  The milk levy appears innocent enough, at ½p on the gallon of milk, but considered from another point of view it is oppressive.  A case came to my notice recently of the son who came home from an agricultural college but did not intend to go back to the land. Anybody can see why.  This man projected for me what yield his mother, a widow, could expect from her milk cows at the end of the year.  On the basis of the last six months he projected that his mother would have an income of around £20 a week from 11 cows.  Looking at the provisions in this section and assuming that that farm produced 11 calves which would be sold for export, considering the charges against the milk and against the exported calf that person's income would be reduced by 70 per cent in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the performance of a <Col N="1557" /> similar farm last year, we can take it that the widow has already had her income reduced by ten per cent in real terms. Even if she increased milk yields and improved the performance of the herd, and the farm, she would still, in real terms have taken in this year a drop of ten per cent in her income.  Under the provisions in this section she has to take a further 7 per cent drop in her income.  The provision in this section in unjust and unfair. The results of the last farm management survey by the Agricultural Institute showed that 40 out of every 100 farms in Connacht and Ulster had an income of less than £20 a week in 1977.  We can assume that the incomes of 40 out of every 100 farmers in that region are being reduced by 5 to 7 per cent by the provisions in this section.  This is a most unjust and severe penalty to impose when we consider that the vast majority of people in that under-developed region had no disease problem for many years and paid the price of eradication many years ago.  They suffered closures of their herds for a number of years, and the loss of milk production in cases where brucellosis was a problem, but the vast majority of them now have clear herds.</P>
    <P>This section has nothing to do with animal disease.  It is purely a measure designed to get more money for the Government from a section of the community which could not be considered capable of paying it.  I am not speaking for the very big dairy farmers who perhaps could bear that levy.  What other section of the community could be expected to bear, as a result of the negotiations entered into by the Minister in Brussels this year in real terms a drop in their income, and also to increase production by something like 15 per cent just to remain as well off as they were last year?  What other section of the community would accept that package from the Government?  They will not get away with it.  The provision in this section are absolutely disgraceful and are particularly dishonest in view of the fact that they are included in a Bill which is supposed to relate to animal disease.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister enjoys the job he is doing here in the Seanad today. The Minister will not seek to justify <Col N="1558" /> this even to the hard hit farmers in his constituency who will be forced to pay this levy.  For a slaughtered animal £3 per head is a bad enough burden to bear. It is bad enough, at the level of the butcher, who will perhaps pass it on to the consumer but in the factory or in the mart the farmers in most cases will end up paying.</P>
    <P>This is particularly hard on the small dairy farmers, who have depended in the past on the export market.  While it has not always been good for the economy we might be glad to see the time again when we would have an export market available for calves.  It is likely to happen at any time that we will need an export market to keep the price of calves at a reasonable level in the spring of almost any year.  That £3 is a further three per cent levy against a calf being exported, and it is a penal tax on an industry that is finding it very difficult at the present time.  While we in this House cannot amend this section we can at least oppose it, and I certainly will do everything to prevent the Minister from passing it by voting against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely oppose this Bill.  As Senator McCartin stated, this Bill is designed not so much to eradicate disease as to get extra finance into the Exchequer by a back door method.  Much was made of Senator Whitaker's statement that what happened to the disease eradication programme was a national scandal having regard to the amount of money that was involved in that scheme over the years.  But let no man point the finger at the farming community.  I never yet met a farmer, either a big or a small one, who was delighted to have disease in his herd, because he always came out a loser. This Bill so far as disease eradication is concerned has not one point in its favour to suggest that we are any nearer to a better eradication scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-farmers would want to bear in mind also that in itself a ½p per gallon will not break the backs of the dairy farmers but taken in conjunction with what has happened to farmers' taxation in the last six or seven months this is the seventh round of taxation.  The Government are making a dartboard out of the <Col N="1559" /> farming population and this is just an extra dart into their hearts.  Before the year is over they will have their hearts well pierced, because this is the only place left from which to raise money.</P>
    <P>In relation to the £3 per animal either slaughtered or exported live, the Minister of State is very much aware than many of the store cattle producers in the west have a good market for their cattle in Northern Ireland, a trade which develops from now until the end of the year.  On the night of each sale, as the lorries cross the Border into the North, this £3 becomes payable.  However, before an animal gets to the mart the vet must be paid for the new 30-day test, which costs from £5 to £8, the mart fees which could be £2 or £3 must be paid, transportation of the animal to the mart must be paid for and on top of all that the farmers must pay on that animal the two per cent commodity tax.  A £400 animal from County Galway or Mayo crossing the Border next week will have cost the farmer generally a small producer, between £20 and £22 per head in tax.  About £22 on £350 or £400 is some tax.  That came in seven darts.</P>
    <P>On the introduction of the 30-day test I said that we had seen the beginning of the scheme to get farmers to pay for the entire eradication scheme.  In direct answer to what the Minister was quoted as saying in the newspapers last week, I should like to say that this Bill will do nothing but penalise farmers who have already been hit by the disease.</P>
    <P>As Senator Butler said, there is growing concern in the dairying sector that the producers are going to be taxed out of existence, particularly when one considers that the Minister spent many man hours in Brussels at price fixing meetings earlier this year to ensure that the co-responsibility levy would be lowered or eliminated.  Not alone did that not happen, but the Minister came back and decided to put more taxation on the very farmers for whom he was trying to get the reductions.  From the point of view of EEC Ministers, that does not look like a very sincere effort.</P>
    <P>Taken in isolation this Bill might not <Col N="1560" /> seem as bad as it is.  If I thought the eradication disease programme would be speeded up by the introduction of this Bill, I would be in agreement with it.  The basic structures are there all the time for the disease eradication programme. Nobody will deny that farmers are entitled to pay their share to get rid of the disease.  I can assure the House that there are many thousands of farmers who have been penalised almost out of existence because of animal disease.</P>
    <P>Was the Minister reported correctly in one of last week's newspapers?  He is reported to have said that there was a lot of fooling around with the eradication scheme.  He made some reference to the years the Coalition Government were in office.  We have been trying for 20 or 25 years to eradicate diseases.  This did not all happen two or three years ago.  This is an on-going disease.</P>
    <P>This Bill, taken in the context of what has happened as regards farmer taxation in the past five or six months, is another step on the road to ensuring that farmers lose all the benefits they had grown accustomed to, and to which they were entitled. I should like to put on record that it is important for every man, woman and child that TB and brucellosis be eradicated from the national herd.  Three out of every five persons in employment are employed either in agriculture or in industries related to agriculture.  The minute there is the slightest trace of a recession in agriculture&mdash;as is well known from the 1974-1975 period&mdash; everybody suffers.  That is something Senator Whitaker knows very well.  A bland statement to the effect that farmers were getting away with a certain amount of leeway and not paying their fair share is not correct.  In the context of all the rounds of taxation that have hit the farming community, this is a particular bodyblow.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will be sorry, because our growth rate in agriculture is almost static.  From an investment point of view, the banks and the ACC are not happy about large investments and farmers are loathe to invest. This is not good criteria.  It is not good encouragement for young farmers to increase production.  Farmers will say <Col N="1561" /> that from the record of this Government all they can see for themselves for the future is taxation, as a result of which they will not be able to make ends meet. The Minister of State should know what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a disaster.  This section is a disaster for everybody, irrespective of whether he is a farmer or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the eradication of bovine diseases will benefit all the community, both producer and consumer alike, I must express the concern that is felt by housewives that they will have to bear the brunt of the cost in the form of increased prices for meat and dairy products.  This concern may very well be unfounded and may be due to ignorance.  For example, the recent increase in the price of meat may very well be due to the long harsh winter and the shortage of grass in the spring, but the housewife does not know that. She blames it on the 2 per cent levy. When one considers the statements by the various victuallers associations at the time the levy was imposed that they would not act as tax gatherers for the Government, who can blame her?</P>
      <P>I see this as a problem of lack of communication. It has resulted in a situation whereby the producer feels that he is not getting his fair share of the selling price. The housewife feels that the price she pays for food goes in some way to subsidise the farmer.  It is very difficult for the housewife to understand our support of the common agricultural policy of the EEC when she has to put up with such anomalies as butter mountains and milk lakes and when she considers the price she has to pay for butter here.</P>
      <P>I see this as a blockage in communications. I hope that the recently appointed Director of Consumer Affairs will see it as part of his brief to deal with this blockage so that the farmers and the housewife can understand and be aware of each other's problems.</P>
      <P>With regard to this particular levy, I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that he will see to it that it is not only a charge upon, but is paid for, by the farmer and that it will not be passed on to the housewives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the protest against this section. In the Preamble to the Bill it states that it is an Act to provide for the purpose of facilitating the eradication, or the prevention of the spread, of bovine disease. I cannot see how imposing a levy like this is going to facilitate that purpose.</P>
      <P>What exactly does a levy do?  If it were to act as a deterrent in some sense, or as an incentive for the farming community to be more careful about herds and milk control, one could see some justification for a levy of this kind.  It does not seem to fall under those criteria. It seems to be there to gather funds to meet the Department's costs in eradicating bovine disease.  That may be all right from the Department's point of view, but there are many areas&mdash;for instance, housing&mdash;where there can be a wastage of money and abuses of a system.  If we are to start thinking that the solution to all these problems is merely to impose a levy on certain categories of our community and give others the job of tax gatherers, we are not facing up to the task before us in a responsible or realistic way.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy is rightly afraid that somewhere along the line the consumer will have to pay for the imposition of this levy&mdash;0.5p on a gallon of milk and £3 per head of cattle.  It may not seem unduly large, but when it is aggregated it may well be that the consumer will have to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present time is completely inopportune for the imposition of a levy of this type.  The agricultural community have probably seen the days of wine and roses within the EEC go for good&mdash;I would certainly hope not&mdash;to the extent that they have enjoyed the benefits of the common agricultural policy in recent years.  They do not seem to be in a position to benefit, in the years ahead, to the same extent and therefore to come along with a levy like this and impose it upon them to correct something which has been prevalent in herds&mdash;very many farmers have seen their herds put down not once but twice or three times&mdash;is not going to instil confidence in the farming community for the future.  I protest against this levy.  It seems to be an extension <Col N="1563" /> of what this Government are doing. They seem to have adopted the old motto: if it moves at all, tax it.</P>

      <P>I think we will all agree that the eradication of animal disease is desirable and that the community at large will benefit.  I will have to disagree with Senators Connaughton and McCartin. I did not hear Senator Butler but I gather that he also does not approve of the fact that the farming community have to pay for the eradication of this disease.  For too long the Exchequer, and particularly the over-burdened taxpayer, have had to write off the bills for the farming community.  For too long many schemes of this nature have been subsidised and paid for by taxpayers who have to pay for so many other services. It is right and proper that the agricultural sector, and particularly the farming community, should shoulder this burden.  I cannot agree with Senator McCartin that they are so badly off. Perhaps some of them are badly off but by and large they are well able to afford to pay for these schemes.  Generally speaking, it is the farming community that will reap the benefit of having this disease eradicated and it is only right that they should pay the cost.  We have a small tax base in this country.  I wonder how we are supposed to pay for the scheme when the farming community are not to pay for it and if they seriously want disease eradicated.  I would like to know what alternative methods they would propose to pay for the high cost of this scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution consistent with a point I made on Second Stage but which has relevance here.  The point that Senator Harney is making is well made.  There is general agreement that there is an objective here, the elimination of bovine disease which stands as something which must be achieved in the interests of the farming community and also the whole community.  There is no dispute on that point.  We are talking about a means of financing this stride to eliminate disease. We get back to fundamentals in this issue, <Col N="1564" /> exactly where the money will come from.  There is a great deal to be said in favour, where it is applicable, of identifying the use of money which is raised with a particular objective.  That is something that is not always achievable in the broad mass of revenue raising but is certainly achievable on this occasion and it is a particular advantage that arises.  In addition to that, there is the question of equity.  Whereas the success of the elimination of bovine disease is of fundamental importance to the whole economy, it is immediately and directly of importance to the farming industry and the farmers.  It is not unreasonable that in something as clear-cut as this, something as identifiable as this, that a contribution should be made directly from the industry which will immediately benefit from it.  While the Opposition points of view are in a sense predictable, nevertheless I am still to some extent surprised by the absence of suggestions of any alternative.  The money has to be raised; if it does not come in this way it must fall on the broad mass of taxpayers; it must come to a great extent from the PAYE sector.  Is that precisely what the Opposition are offering us?</P>

      <P>Let us deal with the points we are debating here and let us deal with the points made by the Opposition. We must be clear.  If the money is not raised through a levy as indicated in the Bill it must be raised from general taxation.  We should hear from the Opposition precisely how they suggest that the money be raised if they are proposing&mdash;and it seems clear that there is no alternative&mdash;that it should fall on the general body of taxpayers and particularly on PAYE taxpayers.  This is a very fundamental issue.  The Opposition have made their opposition clear but they have not indicated any alternatives. This is just blind opposition.  The proposals are reasonable&mdash;to raise money from within agriculture specifically for the benefit of agriculture in the first case and undoubtedly, as is accepted, for the benefit of the whole <Col N="1565" /> economy beyond that point.  But there is a fundamental issue here.  There is an advantage of being able to identify the objective of raising the revenue with the benefit and that is something which is well worthwhile in itself, but there is also the question of equity.  I believe that it is far more reasonable to raise the levy in the particular way indicated in the Bill rather than have it fall on the shoulders of the taxpayers which would include to a great measure the PAYE taxpayers.</P>

      <P>If farmers are not encouraged to produce more there will be more unemployment.  Any levy put on any section of people is a discouragement and this levy is a discouragement on farmers to produce more; it is an encouragement to farmers to produce less. If farmers produce less then there will be greater unemployment.  Who pays for that unemployment except this State?  Is it not better to have people employed even though they may be subsidised to some extent by the State?  Thousands of people are already subsidised in employment&mdash;why not farmers?  It is recognised that they are the backbone of this country.  We can see this if we look at the figures for agricultural output and costs and income for 1977 and look at the exports.  The value of live cattle exports alone was £130 million.  That is money coming into this State.  The value of beef, fresh, chilled and frozen&mdash;factory beef that is giving employment&mdash;is £300.5 million; beef preparations and canned beef, £1.6 million; cattle hides, £13.6 million&mdash;all giving employment; milk and cream, fresh and dried, £55.1 million; creamery butter, £38.3 million, and so on.  I could go on to animal feedstuffs and pigs £3.3 million, but the total value of those agricultural exports is in the region of £720 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what agriculture is doing for this country, getting the money in so that it can be distributed throughout the country.  That is what the farmer is doing. That is the compensation the farmer is giving to the people.  He is also creating the industry.  There is no doubt that the farmer is playing his part and must be compensated for it.  He must not be downtrodden by legislation or penalised for production and effort.  That <Col N="1566" /> is what I am against.  These are people who made the effort to clear their herds of the diseases and they are now being penalised.  What encouragement is that to any section of the community to make an effort?  None.</P>

      <P>As a farmer, I will be affected by this levy.  It is only natural that farmers, or any other section of the community, will grumble if a levy is imposed on them.  I do not believe that the farmers are very worried about this levy. Maybe the three Senators on the opposite side are worried.  Senator Connaughton, when speaking on Second Stage, mentioned all the levies the farmers have to pay, including the levy they have to pay at the mart.  Surely he does not expect the Government to pay the levy for the people who are selling their cattle at the mart?  He spoke a lot about the 2 per cent levy which has been imposed.  He conveniently forgot to mention the 12 per cent levy that was about to be imposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Remember, if we do not get rid of bovine TB within the next year or two, we will not have that money because our cattle will not be exported.  Then we would have farmers available for unemployment assistance. People say that if this levy is imposed it will reduce production of milk and other dairy products.  That is nonsense.  That will not affect milk or anything of that kind.  We have heard a lot of talk from the three Senators on the other side about this but, if they were serious about it, why did they not put down an amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The core of Senator Donnelly's argument seemed to be that since farmers benefit most immediately and directly from the elimination of bovine diseases, they should be asked to pay for it.  We cannot pursue that argument too far because we see many other spheres where it does not stand up.  For instance, who benefits most immediately and directly from the provision of local authority housing but local authority tenants?  Yet, by no stretch of the imagination, can it be said that local authority tenants are being asked to pay for the provision of local authority housing. We may forget that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the elimination of bovine diseases simply a question of money, which is what seems to be envisaged in the Bill? There must be many other aspects in it other than just the provision of money for the elimination of the disease.  Is it properly supervised?  How adequately has it been supervised in the past?  Have there been abuses or some wastage of public money in the past?  That is what we would be tackling and concentrating on to eliminate in the future.  I do not believe that the imposition of a levy can be seen as a means towards which bovine diseases will be eliminated.  The nature of agricultural production is of national concern and of such immense value to us that it must be faced up to nationally rather that just being pitted at the farmers' level, that they must pay the <Col N="1568" /> cost of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand the attitude of the Opposition Senators in their approach to this measure.  On the one hand, they say they are all in favour of the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis from our national herd.  On the other hand, they are totally opposed to any measure to provide money for that scheme. Senators must realise that if we are to eradicate this dreadful disease that everybody is so concerned with from our national herd, it must be paid for.  If they are not in favour of the levy which is being proposed in this measure, they should stand up and say that the Government should put it in as an ordinary tax measure and have it paid by the PAYE sector.  I do not think they have the right to oppose the measure without saying where the money is to come from.  The money being asked for in this section amounts to only about 1 per cent of the price the farmer gets from milk.  This year the Exchequer is providing £22 million for the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis.  The measure being introduced provides about £10 million towards that scheme.</P>
      <P>We realise that a lot of lip service has been paid to the eradication of these two diseases over the past 25 years. Farmers, cattle dealers, vets, Department officials and successive Ministers have been blamed over those years.  For the first time ever, the present Government are coming to grips with this problem.  The determination of the Minister, Deputy Gibbons, is acknowledged, and he has shown that he is prepared to make a concerted effort on the eradication of these two diseases, unpopular though the measures imposed may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of criticism from the Opposition of the 30-day test and the disaster that will befall the farmers because of the introduction of that measure.  By and large the farmers, over the past number of months since this measure was introduced, have accepted the problems and troubles it imposed on them because they realised it is in their <Col N="1569" /> own interests that this disease would be eradicated.  It is certainly in the interests, not alone of the farmers but of the whole country, that we come to grips with this problem immediately.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler mentioned the figure of £720 million which we have got from exports of agricultural produce.  If Senator Butler reflects on the situation that would arise if our EEC partners refused to accept our cattle or our dairy produce because we had a high incidence of disease, imagine the loss it would be to the farmers and to the country.  That is what we have to concern ourselves with at this time.  The dangers to the country are too great.  The farming community will accept this measure because they realise that time is running out on them unless we come to grips immediately with this problem of disease eradication.  That should be the main concern of everybody.  While Opposition Senators may be making political points on this, they too realise, as well as everybody else, that time is running out on us and that we must make an effort to get rid of this disease.  If we do not get the money under a levy of this kind, we have to get it some other way, but so far the Senators who have spoken have not suggested any other way.</P>
    <P>I realise that levies or taxes are not popular measures but the money has to be found.  The eradication of disease is a very expensive business and if we do not get the money this way we will have to go back to the Exchequer and ask the PAYE sector to pay for it.  I do not think that measure would be acceptable either. There would be an outcry from other Senators&mdash;maybe not those involved in the agricultural sector&mdash;who would be more concerned with the welfare of the PAYE workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister emphasised the percentage of the price of milk which is being collected, but the average farmer does not care what the percentage of the price of milk is, it is the percentage of his or her profit that counts in the end.  This can be as high as 8 per cent of the profit of a person who is actually earning less than £20 per week and must live on it.  There is a gross misconception as to what this levy <Col N="1570" /> is all about.  This section is purely designed to collect money.  There are no guarantees that the money so collected will be spent on animal disease, that the level of activity is going to be increased by 50 per cent or that this levy will cease to be collected when the money is no longer required.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is not fair or reasonable to suggest that every industry should pay for whatever taxation is involved directly in servicing their own industry. That does not make sense at all.  We now find ourselves with a serious animal disease problem that affects the potential and performance of the industry on which the Irish economy depends.  We now find that the average person engaged in that industry is not in a position to earn a labourer's wage.  We know from the figures of the farm modernisation scheme that less than 5 per cent of one-third of the top half of the farmers have not succeeded in being classified as development farmers or as being able to earn a comparable income for the region in which they live.  There is no lack of proof for the fact that farmers are not learning the sort of living that is available in industry generally in any region here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Governments in the past, faced with this situation, recognised that only through assistance from outside the industry could disease be eradicated.  I agree that the money was not spent well but I would not propose to lay all the blame on any one section of the community, the vets, the Department or the farmers.  The farmers were not all to blame and there was a time when it paid to have reactors.  That was due to the carelessness of the Department of Agriculture at that time in designing and supervising a scheme which would operate in the interest of eliminating disease and at the same time give farmers a fair compensation.  At times money was squandered uselessly and aimlessly and testing was not carried out as it should have been.  However, the farmers were not to blame for that.  If one looks at the whole structure of the agricultural sector one will see the fantastic problems that any Government had to encounter when they set about dealing with the hundreds and thousands of farmers in <Col N="1571" /> the different areas.  These farmers had different problems, were different people and of a different age structure.  It was a massive problem which could only be solved by getting assistance from outside through the Marshal Plan, originally and later through taxation.</P>
    <P>We forget that we have already transferred this year a large portion of the burden of eliminating disease or eradicating it by the introduction of the 30-day test, and by compelling farmers to pay for it.  Now we go further and transfer another section of that burden. It is worse than that because there is no guarantee that this money will be applied directly to eradicating the disease or any guarantee that this tax will cease when the disease is eradicated or when the cost of the scheme drops below £10 million. This is a bare, bald measure of taxation designed to take more money from an industry that cannot afford it and from people who are not earning the minimum wage necessary to give themselves and their families a living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify a point.  I did not suggest that all revenue for the benefit of a particular industry should be related to that industry.  I enlarged on a point I was making on Second Stage when I stated that revenue is essentially concerned with redistribution of income and, as such, it is obviously not possible to raise it from a particular source and exclusively spend it on that source.  It is concerned essentially with the redistribution of income. We have a sensitive problem generally in the whole area of revenue raising and legitimate requests and demands for equity.  One of the great problems I find is that it is such a complicated problem, with so much money to be raised through such a mass of legislation, that it is very difficult for the ordinary taxpayer to understand or comprehend in any meaningful way exactly how the money is raised or spent.  That complicates the issue and adds to the difficulty in working out an equitable system.  In the exceptional cases where it <Col N="1572" /> is possible to identify a cost with a benefit, that opportunity should be taken.  That is what I was saying about this issue in principle.</P>
      <P>Senator Butler felt this could lead to a reduction in production.  In principle, that shows a clear grasp on the part of the Opposition of the approach by Fianna Fáil to taxation.  By bringing reason and a sense of fair play to the taxation system we restored confidence, but where it is possible to identify a cost with a benefit that opportunity should be taken.  This is a contribution towards the total cost of the eradication of the disease. The Senator might just as well say that the ordinary worker who pays PRSI could say that if he did not have to pay that he would have an inducement to work harder, as a result of which he would earn more and would pay more through PAYE.  None of those points can be applied in the absolute; there is a case for commonsense, a case for judgment. The ordinary worker makes that contribution every week towards his own medical care, his own pension or whatever way it is possible to benefit from it.</P>
      <P>If the issue was seen in perspective the Opposition would find that the farming community are far more rational and fair-minded in this than they are giving them credit for.  The key point in this section is that at no stage have the Opposition come up with any alternative or suggestion other than the implied solution that it should fall on the shoulders of the PAYE taxpayers.  It would be interesting to learn if that is official Opposition's policy on that matter.  Does that represent the Fine Gael solution to this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know where the 2 per cent levy will go.  It is estimated that £50 million extra will be collected from farmers for distribution by the State.  In itself that constitutes an extra burden on the agricultural sector which was never there before.  It is a levy which, in my opinion, is an incorrect way of introducing any form of taxation. Levies are not fair and have never been <Col N="1573" /> fair.  If there is a reduction&mdash;and I am almost certain there will be a reduction&mdash;because of the demand by the farmers to allow them to get out of milk, there will be a reduction in milk production leading to further unemployment. Who will pay the people who will be unemployed but the State?  It will constitute further taxation on the PAYE earner.  So we are saying that that should not be allowed happen but rather we should encourage farmers to increase production.</P>
      <P>By increasing production one is increasing employment and taking more people off the dole, particularly in rural Ireland, because if that type of attitude spreads throughout rural Ireland&mdash;if people feel that they can get money for doing nothing, and that is what the dole is&mdash;then more people will opt for that. We do not want that, we want people employed and the only way to have people employed in rural Ireland is to increase agricultural production.  That is one of the main areas in which employment can be increased and that is accepted by everybody.</P>
      <P>So why impose a levy system, which I have opposed, to help reduce production? The farmers have said that unless they can make a fair profit&mdash;and they are entitled to a fair profit&mdash;then they will have to do something else.  Our farmers have been downgraded for too long.  It is only since our entry into the EEC that farmers have gained financially in any way.  Now that we are in the EEC and they are financially sound, why walk on them?  This Bill will do just that.  The attitude appears to be: you have the money now and we must take it off you; we are not going to give you any opportunity to reinvest that money. The cry from the PAYE sector is for a fair taxation system for the farmers&mdash;that is what they are looking for&mdash;but the levy system is not a fair taxation on anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why&mdash;I have asked this question several times but received no answer&mdash; must those who made the effort to get rid of the disease and clear their herds now be penalised by this Bill, to help those who made no effort whatsoever, those who probably helped to spread the <Col N="1574" /> disease?  Why must the people who made the effort now pay the penalty?  I cannot understand it and I am very disappointed with the answers I have been given here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of subject that can be argued from any side, the answer depending on one's attitude and the amount of politics one wants to play with this subject.  On Sunday last I listened to &ldquo;Country Call&rdquo; on Radio Éireann for about three-quarters of an hour while I travelled in my car.  The programme should have been described as the Fine Gael or the Coalition-sponsored programme because it was nothing short of sheer organised and blatant propaganda.  This Bill has been the subject of a fair amount of discussion, perhaps rightly so.  Certainly nobody has been restricted in his comments or prevented from putting forward alternatives.  The 2 per cent levy is resented by the sector best able to pay it.  One could cite many different examples of what the 2 per cent means.  As Senator Butler rightly says: who will pay the £50 million?  That is a good question because who will continue to pay the hundreds of millions that have been poured down the drain?  We are reaching the stage in life in Ireland, in every facet of business, when people are saying: &ldquo;I am no longer going to carry the other fellow on my shoulders.  I am no longer going to carry sloppy administration and bad farming techniques.&rdquo;  This is the outcry of the mass of the people, the people who are being taxed.  The people who are contributing are saying it is about time the farming section got organised and paid their full share.  Part of the propaganda campaign on the programme that I listened to on Sunday last was that Paddy Lane, the farming leader, said that the Irish farmer now had to pay four different levies.  It is better that he know what he is paying for.  I would prefer the parish priest who stands up on a Sunday and says: &ldquo;You have to contribute so much for tarmacadaming the car park and so much for extra toilets,&rdquo; and names the areas on which he is going to spend the money rather than the fellow who keeps one throwing into the <Col N="1575" /> bucket all the time and not indicating where it might be going.  Certainly there have been serious abuses and had not the Government taken some positive action there would have been no end to this tunnel, certainly not one that any reasonable person could foresee.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I feel this action and legislation was very necessary.  Those who preach that it will be a hardship on the farmers are fighting a losing battle. Most farmers and most people are reasonably intelligent and can see that it is a very small levy.  To my mind the levy is being imposed on those people who would be inclined to abuse the system and cause the spread of the disease making them more aware of the seriousness of the situation.  Certainly, while I do not want to be my neighbour's keeper, I will be aware of the abuses that are taking place on the farm quite close to me.  The Bill intends to do that, to make all of us more aware of how much the spread of this disease will cost the country.  It is proper that there should be a levy.  My colleague, Senator McCartin, says it should not be imposed and he is looking for a guarantee that it might be withdrawn.  I would say that whatever its chance of being withdrawn when the disease has been eradicated if it is imposed by way of a taxation system where it cannot be identified its chances of withdrawal are much less.  I am glad that it can be seen clearly that this money is going to the eradication of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the steps being taken are necessary, that legislation is necessary and that it constitutes a positive contribution to what has been a serious burden on the whole of our capital development.  All of us want to see more money devoted to creating jobs for those who are unemployed, to the development of roads and houses.  All of our national development in recent years has been impeded by money being continually thrown down the drain. Had this Bill not been introduced the Government would have failed miserably <Col N="1576" /> in checking what is known to everybody to be a scandal and a waste of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the budget was finally announced it transpired that the agricultural grant was removed from farm valuations over £40; there was a drastic reduction the more the multiplier was increased, and so on.  Then we had the introduction of the 2 per cent levy.  I thought that was the alternative about which everybody is talking and that that was how farmers were going to be penalised for everything in agriculture in 1979.  We are in absolute opposition because we will be back again after the summer recess to another type of legislation earmarked for something else.  It brings us back to the question of taxation structure of which there is none at the moment.  Any administration that would go back looking for money to the same industry six or seven times in as many months could not have a structured taxation policy.  Senator Donnelly is concerned for the alternative.  We had believed that the alternative amount of finance had been drawn from the farmers of Ireland through the budget.  It seems that we have a budget every month and God knows where it will finish.  There is no money left in the kitty to do anything because it was spent on all types of hopes that did not materialise.  The only way the Government can get it now is through this indiscriminate type of taxation.  It is indiscriminate because it takes no account at all of the ability of the farmer in question to pay.  PAYE people want a discussion on the merits or demerits of the various types of taxation.  We know that they are very hard pressed, but at least they know what they have to pay at the beginning of the year.  There is not a farmer in Ireland who could have foreseen that he would have been hit by so many codes of taxation in five or six months.  That is what the problem is about.</P>

      <P>I would like clarification on this section.  In relation to a farmer supplying liquid milk to customers in the type of town that we are all familiar with and in the event of an outbreak of disease in his herd coming to the notice of the Department of Agriculture they will notify all of his customers of this fact.  If that is the case, what is the point in this, even if the Department are not satisfied on medical grounds that there is any good reason why a scare should be created among customers or why the question should be raised at all?</P>

      <P>I would like to follow Senator McCartin's point and to refer to sections 7 and 9.  I am not very happy with these sections.  I do not really understand them properly.  Does it mean that in the case of an infected cow in a herd that that milk cannot be supplied to the creamery or the bottling plant? There is no clear indication in sections 7 and 9 that this is so.  I imagine that is what is meant.  If that is the case, then the creamery and the milk bottling plant are notified that such and such an animal belonging to such and such a supplier has brucellosis or TB and that milk should not be supplied to a bottling plant or a creamery.  That is no guarantee that that milk will not be supplied. The only guarantee probably is that the creamery might see on the day following the notice that the supplier is down so many gallons of milk.  That is no indication to the creamery that that is the milk of the infected herd.  I would just like clarification so that I can go back and tell the people I work with what the situation is.</P>

      <P>This section provides for notification of a purchaser of milk and the herd owner when there is a disease in a particular herd from which the purchaser is receiving milk.  It relates to the proposed reduction in price which can be applied under section 8 to milk supplied from a herd infected with TB or brucellosis.  These sections will only come into effect on a date to be fixed by ministerial order.  Under this section where an inspector of the Department, who will be a veterinary inspector in this case, believes that a milk herd is infected, then he will give an infection notice to the herd owner and to the person who buys the milk from that herd.  That notice becomes effective seven days after the date of the notice. That is the way it operates.</P>

This man has earned his living through supplying milk on a regular basis to those families for the past 30 years and perhaps his family before him.  Suddenly by receiving a notice from the Department of Agriculture one morning, every one of those customers buys his milk from some other place.  I do not think it makes sense.  The only thing that will do is close down that farmer overnight, create a situation where he will lose the <Col N="1581" /> livelihood on which he and his family have depended for years and create stress and worry.  It will probably send each and every one of those families rushing off to a doctor to see if they or any of their children are going to die as a result of some poisonous milk or dangerous food that they have consumed.

Is it something that is being done purely for the purpose of penalising farmers and scaring the day lights out of every farmer in the country?  I know farmers who have made every effort and suddenly there is an inconclusive detection of TB or brucellosis and perhaps after a second test, after 60 days, that possibility may be completely eliminated.  I understand there are different sorts of TB that the Department test for.  It might be one or the other and it might involve no risks at all.  Is this being done on medical grounds?  Is this purely a decision taken on the grounds of safeguarding the health of possible users of milk from diseased herds?  Is that the reason for writing in this section?</P>

      <P>Take the case of one or two animals in a herd affected by bovine TB or brucellosis.  They are isolated, thereby leaving the rest of the herd unaffected. The creamery are notified that the herd is affected by bovine TB or brucellosis.  That means that the total herd is regarded as being affected, whereas one or two animals only, perhaps, would be affected and isolated and the rest of the milk would be unaffected. Why should the creameries be notified to the effect that all the milk is affected by bovine TB or brucellosis?</P>

      <P>This creates a situation in which that trade could evaporate overnight with the resulting disastrous financial consequences for the suppliers and perhaps without a trace of evidence to anybody that there was any risk to the people using this milk.  I am not satisfied that the Minister knows why that section is there, whether it is on the grounds of a desire to eliminate the disease, and if it is, it is totally irresponsible that after so many years we should suddenly put the livelihood of so many farmers at risk.  We all know how health-conscious people have become.  The slightest rumour is enough to upset an entire market.  An irresponsible headline in a paper can do it and certainly a <Col N="1583" /> notice served on consumers by the Department of Agriculture will be enough to prevent those people from ever reverting to doing business with the farmer concerned again.  This has not been sufficiently thought out.  If it had, the Minister would have before him the figures and the number of people involved, the numbers of farmers involved and the number of housewives who actually buy such milk.  Before any decision was taken the Minister for Health should have been consulted and all that should have been gone into.  I think it is just another section added as more of the padding around what is essentially a measure of taxation and a few other things which have nothing to do with the eradication of disease thrown in for good measure to give the title of the Bill some authenticity.</P>

      <P>This is a disgraceful reaction to the section.  It is a serious implication. I dealt with it here when Senator McCartin was abroad.  I spoke about a particular incident in a county whereby a whole day school could have been affected and where children had to be withdrawn from a school.  One of these children is now retarded and will be retarded for life as a result of drinking infected milk.  I am disappointed that the three Senators are of the same opinion regarding notification of infection.</P>

      <P>I am sure none of the Senators would wish his home to be supplied with milk from an infected herd. There are humanitarian grounds to be considered.  The health of the people must be the first consideration, not the capital involvement.  I do not mind how many farmers will be at a loss as a result of being notified.  If a farmer has disease in his herd, brucellosis especially, it is highly dangerous.  Bovine TB is a different matter because one can eat the flesh of an animal that is a carrier of the disease but will not contact the disease. Where the animal has brucellosis, the milk is infected and the people that are <Col N="1584" /> partaking of that milk should be so notified.  The veterinary people should alert the appropriate people when disease is present.  This section should not be opposed as it protects public health.</P>

If notification is sent to the creamery that a herd is affected by disease and if there are only one or two animals affected which could be the case and those are isolated, then the creamery is notified that the herd is affected by the disease. Is the Minister's advice to the creamery that the remainder of that milk should not be taken?  If that is the case, the total milk produced by the herd should not be taken even though isolation of the infected animals has taken place.</P>

      <P>I want to make it very clear, too, that we are not in opposition to the section.  Anything that has to do with the health of the population is as much a concern of ours as it is of anybody else's, including Senator O'Toole.  Regarding the figure that I quote of 30 per cent of unpasteurised milk being consumed by the population at large, I find it difficult to understand why suddenly we have this legislation when so much milk in its raw state is being consumed throughout the country. Is it to ensure that pasteurisation takes place at the point where all people who consume milk will be drinking pasteurised milk?  That is the type of thing I am talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to explain this as best I can but, apparently, I am not getting through to the Senators or perhaps they are more concerned with the financial implications of somebody whose herd is affected than with the welfare of the people who are consuming <Col N="1585" /> milk that is affected by brucellosis.  We have heard a lot in the debate, both on Second Stage and during the present Stage of the dangers to humans of brucellosis.  It is something that we all must guard against and people are entitled to know if they are purchasing milk from a herd that is infected with the disease.  The position is that, whether one or two animals are infected, the creamery or whoever is buying the milk from that herdowner will be notified. That does not necessarily mean that the herd owner is barred from sending his milk to the creamery.  He can continue to send his milk to the creamery but at that stage the differential applies.  That is the answer to the problem.  It does not bar him from sending milk to the creamery but he has to accept the differential and notification has to be sent to the creamery that Mr. X's herd is infected with brucellosis.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the price differential.  I am totally opposed to it on the basis that there are so many factors that influence the spread of this disease.  If a farmer has both diseases in his herd the compensation rates do not compensate him for the <Col N="1586" /> replacement value of the animals concerned. He will now be further penalised. I am amazed that we are not told what the differential is likely to be.  Will it be a ½p per gallon, 1p per gallon, 3p per gallon? This is more tax.  The producer is being heavily penalised again.</P>
      <P>What is behind the Minister's thinking on this?  What does he hope to achieve by further penalising farmers who have the diseases in their herd?  On the basis of the salvage values in the factories and the Government subsidy payable for reactors, by the time he has those animals replaced he will certainly be out of pocket in a big way.  I cannot understand the mentality behind this.  The milk can be used.  What is the reasoning behind this price differential?  Why is a sum not mentioned?  This will certainly cause more hardship.  We are not sure whether it will be 1p, 2p or 3p per gallon, or a lot more.  I would ask the Minister for the background to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise again that the provisions in this section are purely of an enabling nature.  As I said, there is no fixed intention in my mind at this stage as to when these provisions might be availed of, or when availed of, what the appropriate amount of the differential might be.  An amendment was submitted by Deputy Bruton in the other House that the differential should be 1p per gallon.  That was defeated.  There will, of course, be consultations between the various interests, the farming leaders and the cooperative societies, before anything is done.  It is very necessary that those people should be consulted.  We know that many creameries are operating a price differential on a voluntary basis for various reasons.  There is nothing new really in this principle of a price differential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who is an innocent victim of disease is always mentioned and, indeed, it is true that there are such people but, in the normal course, there are chronic cases where no real effort is made to get rid of disease.  These people must be made to realise that they have to make that effort.  It is in order to encourage them to make that effort that this differential <Col N="1587" /> will apply.  It will not affect the man whose herd is cleared.  It will affect those people who are not prepared to make any genuine effort to get rid of disease. It will be applied on a voluntary basis after consultation with the cooperative societies and the farming leaders.</P>

      <P>It is a little unfair for the Minister to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas with a provision in a Bill the limits of which are not possible for us to understand, and to ask us to facilitate him in having the Bill passed. He should at least have given us examples of the sort of circumstances in which he envisages the provisions of this section being used.  He said it is an extension of the powers of the Minister under the Act.  We realise that, but we would like to have some indication of the circumstances in which the Minister considers it will be necessary to use this section. That is only fair.  If an explanation of that cannot be given to us, it is a little unfair to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the Minister to say, &ldquo;I will not explain it, but if it is necessary to do anything more about it I will consult with farming organisations&rdquo;.  We are competent to decide on what is and is not necessary from a legislative point of view.  It is a bit of a slight on us to say, &ldquo;Give me the powers and I will not use them without consultations&rdquo;.  If the Minister is to consult anybody, Senators are entitled to be consulted, and are entitled to know what he proposes to do and exactly why.

The money so collected will be put at the disposal of the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Exchequer to be spent in such a manner as the Minister may direct.  This levy has nothing to do at all with animal disease.  The money will be collected for the benefit of the Exchequer for use in the budget.

However, the levy will continue to be channelled into the Department of Finance.  Some Senators pointed out that certain parts of agriculture should be financed by agriculture.  One would normally assume that what came from agriculture should be used for agriculture.  The wording of the section would lead me to believe that the money could be used for anything, that it is entirely at the discretion of the Minister for Finance.  We could find that the money was not being used for the purpose for which it was intended.</P>

Receipts and expenditure, that is levy receipts and the total or gross amount spent on disease each year, will be shown in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture each year.  The relationship between the two will be there in black and white for everyone to see.  Receipts and the use made of them must always be fully accounted for just as if they were in a separate fund.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I was approached by a number of people in the dairy industry about section 4.  The work of the executive staff in the industry has been increased because of all the levies, the quality tests, quality bonuses and so on. <Col N="1590" /> The 28-day period provided for in the section should be extended by at least two or three days to give more time to the staff of the dairy industry to furnish true and correct returns to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already extended the period from 14 days to 28 days to comply with computer requirements and I understand from discussions we have had with the people involved that 28 days is adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I was also approached by the same people who approached the Minister and they are looking for an extension of two or three days.  If the returns are not furnished within 28 days, I am sure the Department will allow a few extra days.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House if it might be possible for us to adjourn to a specific date? We have had the experience that when we adjourn <i>sine die</i> it means the Seanad is lost until well into November.  I think it would be desirable, if possible, to adjourn to a sitting day as the Dáil does and then meet on that day.</P>
