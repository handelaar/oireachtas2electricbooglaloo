      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1979,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 24 May, 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, defines the investments in which trustees may invest trust funds unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.  Equally, the trust deed may confer wider powers of investment but many trusts and analogous funds are restricted to the investments authorised under the Act.  The Minister for Finance may vary the authorised investments by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introducing the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order (No. 2), 1977, in the House, the intention was expressed of keeping the list of authorised trustee investments under active review and of proposing further changes as the <Col N="410" /> need arose.  As part of this process, the draft order which I am now laying before the House would add three non-Associated Banks and one building society to the list of trustee authorised investments.</P>
    <P>Following consultation between my Department and the Central Bank I have accepted the banks' recommendation that the three non-Associated Banks named in the draft order, be included in the list of authorised trustee investments. The addition of these banks will result in the trustee list including a total of 28 licensed banks comprising all the major domestic and foreign banks in the State. This increase will improve the range of investment opportunities open to trustees.</P>
    <P>Building societies were added for the first time to the list of authorised trustee investments in the 1977 order.  I have decided on this occasion to add one further building society to that list.  I am satisfied that this building society meets the criteria to be observed by building societies in qualifying for trustee status and that it is suitable for inclusion in the trustee list.  This society joins the five buildings societies already with trustee status, which represent the vast bulk of the resources of the building society movement and which have a sound record.  The inclusion of building societies as trustee authorised investments also emphasises the important function played by these institutions in helping finance the community's housing needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make to vary the list of investments: a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the President of the Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish Unit.  All the statutory requirements in this regard have been complied with.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the additions now proposed to the trustee list are secure and suitable for the investment of trust <Col N="411" /> funds. I, therefore, commend the motion for approval of the House.</P>

      <P>We have no objection to this order being made.  Indeed we would be very brave people to contest the judgment of the very eminent people just named by the Minister of State.  I have no doubt that the care that goes into expanding the list of authorised trust investments is of an extremely high standard and that any such body recommended for such investment is well suited to be used by an investor. I am sure, too, that it follows from that, that the monitoring of the status of these bodies that are recipients of investments by trustees after they come on the list is also done in the same careful way as the investigation before they come on the list. I am sure the Minister of State can assure us on that.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House are no doubt already aware of the circumstances in which this Bill comes to be introduced, but it is right nevertheless that I should make a reference to those circumstances, if only for the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided on 19 January 1978 to remove from the office of Commissioner of the Garda Síochána the then holder of that office, Mr. Edmund P. Garvey, and on 20 January 1978 they decided to appoint Deputy Commissioner Patrick McLaughlin to succeed him.  Mr. Garvey subsequently took legal proceedings which resulted in, amongst other things, a finding by the Supreme Court that the removal from office was null and void. This, of course, meant that Mr. Garvey was still legally Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and, since the law provides for only one Commissioner, it <Col N="412" /> followed that Mr. Patrick McLaughlin did not hold that office or rank.</P>
    <P>The judgments given in the Supreme Court make it clear that the right of the Government to remove a Commissioner from office is not questioned and that the Government were free, if for adequate reason they considered it necessary, to make a new decision removing Mr. Garvey from office, provided certain procedures were adopted.</P>
    <P>The Government were satisfied that Mr. Garvey should not be allowed to remain in office but considered it right, as they did in January 1978, to give him the option of resigning.  He availed himself of that option.  In saying this, I should like to make it clear, as I did in the other House, that I am aware that he is reported in a newspaper as having said that he &ldquo;retired&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;resigned&rdquo;. As far as I am concerned, nothing hinges on any distinction that might be thought to exist between those two terms&mdash;the position is that the solicitors acting for him used the word &ldquo;resign&rdquo; in the relevant letter to me and he himself used the word &ldquo;retire&rdquo;.  He has qualified for, and has been formally awarded, maximum pension and maximum gratuity.</P>
    <P>His resignation was expressed to be with effect from, and was accepted as from 14 May and Mr. McLaughlin has been formally reappointed as Commissioner from the following day, namely 15 May.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a need to validate actions of Mr. McLaughlin during the period of 16 months or so when he was carrying out the functions of Commissioner but when, as it now transpires, he did not hold the office.  There is also a need to validate acts done by some others.</P>
    <P>I intend to refer, in a few moments, to various kinds of acts or actions that would or might need validation.  I believe that what I will be mentioning will in fact be, for practical purposes, a comprehensive list, but I cannot commit myself to a claim that it is comprehensive because, in the nature of things, it would be virtually impossible to be sure.</P>
    <P>It might be suggested that this means that the House is being asked to validate something without an assurance that it <Col N="413" /> has available to it complete details of what it is, or may be, validating by passing this Bill.  I would like to make two points in reply.</P>
    <P>The first point I would make is that I believe that everything that could reasonably be thought to be of possible interest to the House will in fact have been mentioned and I can assure the House that that is certainly my intention.</P>
    <P>The second point is the more important one and it is this.  There is no question in this Bill of the House being asked to give, directly or indirectly, any element of support to the Government's decision in relation to Mr. Garvey or to any aspect of that decision.  The passing of the Bill would not be, and could not be interpreted as being, an endorsement of the Government's decisions or actions. Furthermore&mdash;and this is the essential issue&mdash;the passing of the Bill would not be something done for the benefit of the Government, or for my benefit as Minister for Justice.  The House is being asked to approve of the Bill on one basis only, and that is that it ought to be enacted in the public interest and so that the interests of the community as a whole will not suffer.</P>
    <P>To put that another way, the arguments for validation are independent of the merits of what occurred in relation to the former Commissioner.  He, for his part, is pursuing his claim in the High Court, as he is entitled to do.  However, given that he has his right to pursue any claim he wishes to make, and that the Bill does not seek to interfere in any way with that right, there is no valid reason why the community should have to suffer through consequential defects in other areas. More specifically, there is no valid reason why a consequential defect in, for instance, the assignment of a superintendent to a particular district should be allowed to affect the legal effectiveness of the ordinary discharge by that superintendent, or by the gardaí under his direction, of the duties that they carry out for the protection of the public.</P>
    <P>I submit, therefore, that while no doubt the House would wish to be as fully informed as possible of what problems could arise in the absence of validation, <Col N="414" /> the approach to the solution of those problems should not be on the basis of validating specific actions but should be on the basis that the validation should be as comprehensive as possible and subject only to the constitutional rights of anybody who might be adversely affected by a validation.</P>
    <P>It could be suggested that it is possible that there is some person&mdash;I say &ldquo;person&rdquo; but of course it could be suggested that there may be more than one&mdash;who at present stands convicted of a crime and who, without this Bill, could have that conviction set aside, and that this Bill will take away that opportunity from him.  To that I should like to say, first, that neither I nor anybody else can say if a situation exists where, because of what has occurred, some conviction or convictions could in the absence of this Bill be set aside: nobody, not even a judge, could say that because only a court properly convened and adjudicating on the issue could give an authoritative decision.  Secondly, nobody can say whether, in the event that such a situation existed, this Bill would alter it.  It appears clear that whether it would or not depends&mdash;and certainly may depend &mdash;on whether such an alteration would conflict with a constitutional right, and only a court could decide that.  However, the point I put to the House is this.  If in the course of day-to-day administration of justice a person who has been found guilty by the ordinary procedures of law must be allowed to escape the consequences of his convictions because of something that has nothing even remotely to do with the strength of the evidence against him, that is a situation that we as a community must accept under the law as it stands.  To say we must accept it if we have to is, in a way, to state the obvious; but it is one thing to accept what we cannot change, but an entirely different thing for the Oireachtas to go out of its way to make exceptions that it need not make, exceptions that would suggest that there was some merit in the case that such a convicted person would be making to a court.  In short, if in fact there is a loophole and if in fact this Bill can close it&mdash;and there are two &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;&mdash;then I submit that the Bill ought to close it in the interests of justice, because <Col N="415" /> the community and not only the individual have a major stake in the administration of justice.  That is the basis on which I submit the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I will state frankly to the House that, for making this argument and referring to unmeritorious defences, I have been accused elsewhere of trying to pass judgment on particular cases.  I deny this flatly. We are speaking of people who have been found guilty, not by this House or by me or by the Garda Síochána but by the courts.  The House by passing this Bill, is simply saying that, as far as it is concerned, a person found guilty of crime on evidence that satisfied the court beyond reasonable doubt, evidence the accuracy of which is not being challenged, should not escape the consequences simply and solely because Mr. Patrick McLaughlin's appointment as Commissioner was invalid.  If there are people who really believe that the Oireachtas should make an exception from this Bill specifically to enable that to happen, all I can say is that I believe that that view is wholly unjustified and that it does not take account of the rights of the public.  The people concerned, I repeat, have been shown to be guilty.  If they were to evade the consequences it would be on grounds wholly unrelated to the evidence of their guilt.  I do not think I need labour the point further.</P>
    <P>One of the most important functions in respect of which validation is necessary concerns the appointment of new members to the force.  Every new member has to be appointed by the Commissioner&mdash;the precise terminology is &ldquo;appointed and enrolled&rdquo;&mdash;and it is, therefore, necessary to have validated all the appointments of new members during the period in question.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner is also responsible for promotions up to the rank of inspector, and it is necessary to have those promotions validated.  Appointments to the rank of superintendent and higher ranks are a matter for the Government and, accordingly, the question of validating those appointments does not arise except for one particular appointment to which I shall refer later.  I should, perhaps, elaborate just a little on <Col N="416" /> this question of promotion to superintendent or higher ranks because questions were raised in the other House about alleged changes in promotion panels used in connection with promotions to superintendent or chief superintendent. May I, therefore, say that I am not dealing here, any more than I did in the other House, with that issue?  The establishment of panels is an administrative arrangement to assist the Government and has no statutory basis.  Any question about their operation is, therefore, irrelevant to this Bill.  I just want to say, for the record, that if, on another occasion, it becomes necessary or appropriate to discuss that particular issue, and if I am not inhibited by requirements of confidentiality or the like, I shall be quite willing to comment on the matter in question&mdash;but, as I have said, not on this Bill.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of appointments, may I invite the attention of the House to an important distinction that is implicit in the terms of the Bill?  That is that, while both the appointment of new members and the promotions to sergeant and inspector rank will be validated, the Bill, in so far as Mr. McLaughlin himself is concerned, validates only his actions, not his original appointment.  This explains why the Bill contains a reference to his pay and conditions of service in respect of the 16-month period but does not do so in respect of the new members or newly-promoted sergeants or inspectors whose appointment or promotion, as the case may be, is in question.  Once those appointments and promotions are validated, the entitlement of the members concerned to the appropriate salary and conditions of service follows as a matter of course. Mr. McLaughlin will not, however, be appointed retrospectively as Commissioner and, in the absence of a special provision, he could in certain circumstances suffer some diminution of pension rights.  The reference to his pay is probably unnecessary but it is included as a precautionary measure and also because it would seem inappropriate to include a reference to conditions of service without including a reference to pay.</P>
    <P>What I have referred to up to now concerns the validity of appointments <Col N="417" /> within the force.  There could also be some consequential matters.  The first one I propose to mention arises from the fact that the Commissioner may, under section 3 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, give a written authorisation to a named superintendent to exercise certain functions that are primarily vested by that Act in chief superintendents.  In practice, the only function of significance in this context is the extension from a maximum of 24 hours to a maximum of 48 hours of the period during which a person may be detained under section 30 of the 1939 Act.  It has been the practice to grant such authorisations to superintendents attached to Border districts and to superintendents attached to divisional headquarters.  I said in the other House&mdash;I am sure I need not emphasise that I state it as an opinion, not as a fact&mdash;that there is no injustice to anybody in the retrospective validation of those authorisations since they are authorisations that would have been granted, in accordance with well-established practice, irrespective of who was Commissioner, and the invalidity of Mr. McLaughlin's original appointment has no material relevance to the decisions taken by the relevant superintendents.</P>
    <P>It might, perhaps, be inferred that, in referring to extensions from 24 to 48 hours of the period of detention of certain arrested persons, I am suggesting that statements made by persons during that period can now be seen to have been invalidly taken and to have been inadmissible in evidence and that, therefore, any conviction based on such an admission is invalid and that I am proposing to validate it.  Let me therefore make it clear that I intend no such implications. Once a statement is voluntary, its exclusion, even if it has been taken irregularly, is a matter of judicial discretion and the courts have used that discretion to distinguish between irregularities that they thought were deliberate or due to negligence on the one hand and, on the other hand, ones that were inadvertent.  They have admitted statements taken in the latter circumstances. I have, therefore, no reason whatsoever to think that the validity of <Col N="418" /> any such convictions is in any way at issue. What I think may be at issue is the detention itself as distinct from the statement, but there again any irregularity was clearly involuntary and, on the merits, ought to be validated if possible.</P>
    <P>In theory, there could have been similar situations in relation to the prohibition under the 1939 Act of certain types of public meetings but this did not arise in practice.</P>
    <P>The authorisations I have been referring to are formally given by the Commissioner to certain superintendents under specific statutory authority.  There are other situations in which there is no question of a specific statutory authorisation of a particular superintendent but in which, nevertheless, there could be room for argument arising from the fact that the assignment of a superintendent to his district took place during the period we are referring to. There are various provisions in statutes or in the Rules of Court or other statutory instruments whereby applications or notices of one kind or another are to be given to the superintendent of the district in which the person making the relevant application or giving the relevant notice lives or has a premises. The superintendent, in certain cases, has power to grant or refuse certain permits, certificates or the like, or to object in court to the granting or renewal of certain certificates or licences.</P>
    <P>Although the assignment of a superintendent to a particular district is an administrative matter and is not referred to in statutes or statutory regulations, and although I think it could be cogently argued that a superintendent who takes up duty in charge of a district is, by that very fact, the superintendent for that district, it is clear that somebody wishing to challenge a superintendent's decision might argue that the assignment flows from, or involves, the exercise of the commissioner's general statutory function of directing and controlling the force.  Consequently, if only to avoid sterile argument, those matters have to be covered also.</P>
    <P>Reverting for a moment to functions exercised by the Commissioner, as distinct from persons deriving authority from him, I would mention also by-laws <Col N="419" /> or rules which he is authorised to make under the Road Traffic Acts.  I am informed that one set of traffic by-laws was made in the period in question relating to taxi stands in Dublin and one set of local and temporary rules relating to parking restrictions at Knock, County Mayo. If the taxi by-laws were invalid, the previously existing by-laws would still be in force since they would not have been validly repealed.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to refer in any detail to disciplinary decisions by Mr. McLaughlin as these are internal Garda matters and anybody who might feel aggrieved will be able to decide for himself what action if any he should take.  As far as I am concerned, I believe that the correct decision for the Oireachtas to make is what I outlined at the beginning of my speech, that is to say, validate if and in so far as it is possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as the House will have noticed, refers to things done by Mr. McLaughlin or by any other person.  The expression &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; is, of course, limited by the context in which it appears&mdash;the validity conferred by the section can have no application otherwise than to acts which were invalid by reason of the fact that Mr. McLaughlin's appointment was not effectual. As the House is aware, the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;, under the standard rules of interpretation, includes a body of persons and, in the present context, it includes the Government in that the Government, in January 1978, appointed a new Deputy Commissioner when, as it then appeared, Mr. McLaughlin had become Commissioner.  Under the relevant statutory instrument, there was provision for only two Deputy Commissioners so it appears that the new appointment needs to be validated.</P>
    <P>Another example of what is covered by &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; is a local authority putting up road signs&mdash;their functions in that respect are, by law, exercised subject to the consent of the Commissioner.  The expression &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; is also intended to cover, if necessary, acts done in the course of their duty by those people I have already mentioned, namely those admitted to the <Col N="420" /> force during the last 16 months, those who were promoted to the rank of sergeant or inspector in that period or those of chief superintendent or superintendent rank who were assigned to their division or district during that period.  Naturally, only a small number of the official actions of any of those persons could come into question in any event, since most of their work does not consist of the exercise of statutory powers that might be open to be challenged in the present context.  Moreover, in so far as such acts may need to be covered, it seems likely that they would be covered by the validation being accorded to Mr. McLaughlin's acts, on the basis that, once his acts were validated, everything that flows from them is automatically validated.  There might, however, be room for some argument about that, so it seems safer and simpler to rely on the direct validation that the Bill proposes to give to them as things done by &ldquo;any other person&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in the text which I think may call for explanation, namely the words in brackets at the beginning of subsection (1) of section 1, referring to the satisfying of any condition precedent to the exercise or performance of a power or duty. This is included because a number of functions of the Commissioner may be exercised only on the basis that he is satisfied as to some factor or that he is of a certain opinion or that it appears to him that a particular situation exists.  For example, he must be satisfied that an applicant for admission to the force is of good character or that an applicant for a taxi licence is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence.  Although the satisfying of conditions of that kind naturally involves his considering the matter and reaching an opinion or conclusion and in that sense involves his doing something, there appeared to be some possibility of argument as to whether the phrase &ldquo;everything done&rdquo; would by itself clearly cover it and for that reason it was thought prudent to include those words that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have given what I think are the main examples of matters needing validation, though the House will appreciate that, in the nature of things, the list does not <Col N="421" /> purport to be a complete one. I would like to make it clear, however, that although I referred earlier on to possible issues arising in criminal proceedings instituted during the period in question, this does not mean that I am suggesting that that is a matter of much practical significance.  In fact I do not think, nor do the Garda authorities think, that it is likely to arise in relation to the conduct of criminal proceedings except in the sense that, in some cases, which I hope and believe would be a very small number, a question might be raised about, for instance, the authority to arrest. The reason I say that I am not aware that the issue would arise otherwise is that legal proceedings in the more serious cases are brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions and even in a number of less serious cases the DPP may also be the prosecutor. In those cases where a member of the force brings a prosecution himself, he is not, as a matter of law, acting on behalf of the Commissioner nor is it the Commissioner who, in practice, gives directions as to whether such proceedings should be brought.</P>
    <P>The member is, therefore, not in any way acting as agent of the Commissioner. I suppose there might be some few cases where a person was convicted of assaulting a garda, or something of that kind, and where a point could be raised that it was one of the young recruits whose induction may have been invalid.  Any such case is one which, as far as I am concerned, is wholly without merit and if the convicted person&mdash;if there be any such&mdash;believes he can evade the consequences, he will have to do so on his own initiative.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that, in asking the House to approve of this Bill, I am not in any way asking it to endorse any aspects of the decisions of the Government in relation to the former Commissioner.  Those decisions are not at issue and I could not undertake to go into any detail about them, not just because they are irrelevant to the argument for validation but, more important, because certain important related issues are before the High Court and, in accordance with long established practice, we <Col N="422" /> ought to avoid issues that are <i>sub judice</i>. In brief, if I were to embark on any discussion of the merits, I would be open to be accused of attempting to conduct a trial on an issue that is already before the High Court.  This is an area in which I cannot say, with any confidence, precisely what aspects are likely to be in question in the High Court but, since there is a claim for damages, I have to assume that any aspect of the entire circumstances preceding or relating to the Government decision of January 1978 could become relevant to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I did, however, give to the other House some factual statements, which are not intended to be in any sense an argument justifying any decision or action of the Government.  The Government, needless to say, believe that they were, in fact, justified, but all I intend to do here, in the remarks I now propose to make, is to correct an impression that in the legal proceedings taken against them the Government had decided that they had no case to make except to rely on the strict letter of the law and that on that issue they lost, but this is not the position.</P>
    <P>As long ago as 31 January 1978, the Taoiseach publicly stated&mdash;his statement was made in the other House&mdash;that the Government lost confidence in Mr. Garvey as Commissioner. Mr. Garvey took a legal action in the High Court.  Counsel on both sides agreed that, instead of embarking on possibly protracted litigation in the High Court on issues that might prove irrelevant, it would be in the interests of all parties to get an initial authoritative ruling on what both sides agreed was a preliminary issue, namely whether the Government had, as a matter of fact, unqualified authority to dismiss a Commissioner without notice and without giving reasons.  To ascertain this, three specific, agreed questions were put to the High Court and, on appeal, to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In the event, the Supreme Court not only answered the questions, but decided the substantive issue as well.  It is perfectly clear that, had they answered the preliminary questions in the only other way open to them, they would <Col N="423" /> likewise, in that instance, directly or by necessary implications, have dealt with the substantive action also.  Since counsel on both sides had agreed that the issue being determined was a preliminary issue, it is clear that, somewhere along the line, there was some misunderstanding.  What is perhaps more immediately relevant here is that the Supreme Court interpreted the legal pleadings made on behalf of the Government as tantamount to an admission of allegations made in Mr. Garvey's statement of claim.</P>
    <P>In the context of the particular case before the court, the Government are, of course, bound by the decision of the Supreme Court, that is to say, bound to accept that the particular pleading must be construed in that way.  I must, however, make it clear that it had not been intended to be read in that way and that, read in that way, it does not correspond with the facts, because the Government do not at all concede that the assertions in the statement of claim present a true picture.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on that issue&mdash;in other words, I am not here making any claim whatsoever regarding the merits of the case that I, on behalf of the Government, will be making on an appropriate occasion.  I simply say, as I said in the other House, that I have a case to make and that I intend to make it when the time comes.  That is only another way of saying what I said in the other House, namely that there was a background to what occurred but whether that background did, or did not, justify what occurred is a matter on which I am making no claim and producing no evidence at this stage. I think it essential to refer to it, however, if only because I did so in the other House and because it led to certain comments that are relevant in this House.</P>
    <P>Amongst the things suggested in the other House was that there was no background until I became Minister for Justice and when, by way of interjection, I denied that, I was immediately accused of attacking my predecessor.  As my predecessor is a Member of this House, I think it right to make my position clear. As far as I am concerned, my statement <Col N="424" /> that there was a background means nothing more than that I have a case to make which I intend to make if, as and when the need arises.  It is not a claim of justification.  That there was a background is a matter of fact, not opinion and is, of itself, a non-contentious fact.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it is a matter of fact, provable by documentation that part of that background extended backwards to my predecessor's time, and his colleagues in the other House were wrong in asserting otherwise.  I am passing no judgment on anything done, or not done, by my predecessor in that respect, any more than I am making any defence for anything done, or not done, by myself. These things will have to await another day.  What I said was said on a factual basis, in reply to allegations that were untrue.  My predecessor, Senator Cooney, may have forgotten what it is I am referring to when I say that certain aspects of the background extended back to his time.  I am, of course, prepared to facilitate him by showing him, privately, certain papers.  He will, I am sure, be aware that I would be willing to do that anyway and the only reason I say it here publicly is to ensure that no Member of this House would think that I am taking an unfair advantage.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, I repeat that I do not intend anything that I have said to be, in any way whatsoever, an evaluation of anything done, or not done, by the Government or myself, and likewise I do not intend anything I have said to be a commentary on anything done, or not done, by my predecessor. The time for evaluation will come on a later occasion and is not now.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the Bill is put forward to meet a need that clearly has arisen and on that basis I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should say that there is certainly a situation existing that requires the quick passage of this legislation and as far as the Members from the Fine Gael side of this House are concerned, the Minister may take it that the Bill has our full support. I can also safely say that this is most unusual legislation that the House has been <Col N="425" /> presented with in this term.  Indeed, for people who have been in the House longer, and for people who will remain in the House beyond this term, I dare say that you will wait many a long day before you will see legislation like this again.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to this matter that we must consider; first of all, the Bill itself, its content, which is very short, and its purpose, which is very simple. I can say that we are now satisfied with the content of the Bill, particularly since the Minister introduced in the Dáil a new subsection to section 1.  That should get over any difficulties which might have presented themselves.  I might also say that the Minister mentioned, in his address to this House, that he did not wish to deny anybody a meritorious defence.  I accept that completely and I also accept the necessity for the legislation.</P>
      <P>There is one thing I would ask and that is that the areas of responsibility of any commissioner of the Garda are wide-ranging and quite enormous and I feel that there is every possibility that, at some stage in the future, problems may present themselves because of this situation. I would recommend that the commissioner and his staff spare no effort to go back through all the acts committed by them and see whether any of them need to be re-ordered, or redone.  It is highly desirable that we do not have a great number of people raising this new possible defence in court cases.  I read the Dáil debate and sympathised with the view that perhaps a schedule of acts committed by the commissioner should have been included in this Bill.  I appreciate that his areas of responsibility are so wide-ranging that that would have been very difficult.  I recommend that everything he has done be examined over a period of time and anything that needs to be put right, even if it is in doubt, should be put right as soon as possible.  This is all I want to say about the nature of the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect to it; that is the background.  When I refer to the background, I do not refer to the background in inverted commas that the Minister has referred to here and in the Dáil.  I refer to the general background <Col N="426" /> that gave rise to this legislation.  The first thing we must say, and put it on the mat as clearly as it can be put, is that this legislation was not caused by a decision of the Supreme Court.  This legislation was caused by a decision that, we understand, the Government took in January of 1978 and all the difficulties we have had flowed directly from that.</P>
    <P>I come to some other points that have been made by the Minister in relation to the Supreme Court.  He used the expression in the Dáil&mdash;I am glad that he did not use it here&mdash;that perhaps the Government were hard done by by the Supreme Court.  I am sure that is not what the Minister meant to convey. There are matters to which I will be returning in relation to the legal advice which the Minister received, the misunderstandings that took place in regard to the nature of pleadings in the court procedure, the misunderstandings that took place in regard to the question of whether a preliminary point on a substantive issue was put to the Supreme Court or the High Court the first day, and the misunderstanding, or the bad advice that the Government received in January, 1978&mdash;presumably from the Attorney General's Office&mdash;as to whether or not they were entitled to dismiss Mr. Garvey in the manner in which they did.  All in all, it seems indeed that the Minister was very hard done by&mdash;that is, if we are to accept his claim, by implication at least, that it was not the Government who were wrong at any stage, but his legal advisers.  It seems that there are sufficient legal advisers in the Government for them to be more alive to certain facts over which the Minister now asks us to shed tears for him.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, in the course of his address to this House, and again in the Dáil, made reference to the fact that the background is irrelevant so far as this Bill is concerned.  In his own speech today he says, &ldquo;In asking the House to approve of this Bill, I am not in any way asking it to endorse any aspects of the decisions of the Government in relation to the former Commissioner&rdquo;.  That is fine, I accept that, but he goes on to say &ldquo;Those decisions are not at issue and I could not undertake to go into any detail <Col N="427" /> about them, not just because they are irrelevant to the argument for validation but, more important, because certain important related issues are before the High Court and, in accordance with long established practice, we ought to avoid issues that are <i>sub judice</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are two points there.  The first one is that the background is not relevant to this.  On Committee Stage of a Bill like this, it may not be relevant to discuss the necessity for the Bill, but I do not accept that argument in relation to Second Stage.  We have a right, not only a right but a duty and responsibility, to consider the background to this; why it became necessary.  We are talking here about the removal of a public servant of nearly 40 years' standing and whether or not the Government had the right to remove him as they did; whether they were entitled to or not; whether, being entitled, they did it in the right way or not, are all matters which must be considered by this House.  It is not only that we have a right, we have a responsibility to the people who have elected us, to discuss this matter and know the background to it.  I know the Minister has said there will be another day.  Unfortunately, in this House there will not be another day.  There will be in the Dáil. But even given that, it is still important that we consider the background to the case.</P>
    <P>One thing that has not emerged from all of this débâcle is an admission from the Government that they were wrong. At every stage they said they were right, they were hard done by in the Supreme Court.  They were hard done by because they got bad legal advice, they say.  They were not wrong and they have not said that it will not happen again.  I will come to the Government's attitude to public servants in other particular respects later, but it is important that we take that matter as it stands.  It is relevant, it must be considered and we have a responsibility to consider it.  As to whether or not we should not consider the matter in the House because by convention we do not discuss matters which are regarded as <i>sub judice,</i> again I think that the Minister has&mdash;I do not say intentionally, but certainly by implication&mdash;misled <Col N="428" /> the House in this respect.  The truth is that to recite the facts or the background to a case is not in any way to offend the convention of this House or to offend the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  The idea behind the principle of not discussing matters which are <i>sub judice</i> is that you risk offending the dignity of the court and may be found to be in contempt of court when you comment to such an extent that you try to influence the court.  Reciting the background to the case is no offence to that principle.</P>
    <P>The Minister is somebody whom I like and have some respect for, but I regret to say that the Minister is using this as a guise to avoid telling us the real background to this case.  I believe the background is very simple, that we all know it already, and that none of us will be taken by surprise when we hear at a future stage that there was a background to it that none of us knew about.  The fact is that we all know the background. The Minister is using this <i>sub judice</i> rule now to avoid facing up to the responsibility, in dealing with this Bill, of giving us the full background to it.</P>
    <P>What do we know about this Bill, or about the background?  We know, first of all, that for a long time before Mr. Garvey was removed from office&mdash;indeed going back even before the last general election campaign started&mdash;from any of us who knew gardaí, that Mr. Garvey was going to be removed from office if the Fianna Fáil Party assumed office.  I accept what the Minister says, in the Dáil and here, that he did not tell that to anybody.  He may not have expressly said so; he may not have even impliedly said so himself, but someone somewhere maybe did not say it, but a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.</P>
    <P>The indications were there, and members of the Garda Síochána knew about it and Fianna Fáil canvassers knew about it.  I can understand if it was an isolated remark that was made by somebody who in the course of the heat of a general election campaign might make a comment like that, but it was far too widespread and well known and too widely rumoured for there not to be some truth behind it.  As I say, I do not blame the Minister for that.  I believe <Col N="429" /> that, in some way, the Government, or their representatives, were used by the Garda Representative Body.  I believe that they complained and they may have had cause for complaint, I do not know, but I do know that someone somewhere said it in sufficient time for every guard who was canvassed in this country to be told when they had their complaints about Mr. Garvey that if Fianna Fáil got back into office, Mr. Garvey would go. That is a fact and nobody can deny it.</P>
    <P>In relation to events, subsequent to Fianna Fáil taking office, we know from public utterances, some from the Minister, some from the Taoiseach, that there was a background, that there were questions asked, that matters were put between the Minister and Mr. Garvey. We know, also, that the Minister met with Mr. Garvey apparently two hours before he was sacked and was invited to resign.  We know that Mr. Garvey declined the invitation and we know that he was removed from office two hours later.  We do not know how much he was told before then.  We know that the Minister, or the Taoiseach more importantly, has said that Mr. Garvey should have known that he was going to be sacked, should have known that he was going to be asked to resign.  What we do not know is that he did know.</P>
    <P>That is an important matter, and it is particularly important in view of the fact that on 31 January last, the Taoiseach was asked in the Dáil by Deputy FitzGerald as to the questions of natural justice that arose in this matter.  Did Mr. Garvey know?  Was it true that he was given two hours' notice?  What is the position about this?  The Taoiseach did not say that he either got, or he did not get, two hours' notice.  What he did say is that Mr. Garvey must have been aware for some time.  One would think that the Taoiseach, in a matter as important as this, could have come out unequivocally in the Dáil and said, &ldquo;Mr. Garvey knew,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr. Garvey did not know&rdquo;, so far as the Government were concerned.  Mr. Garvey should have known, and must have known, because everybody in the country knew.  That, in so far as it goes, is fine, but I would like to know whether Mr. Garvey was told before that, whether he had any notice of <Col N="430" /> it.  We have this extraordinary situation about the pleadings in the High Court, that the Minister, Deputy Collins, accepts that the pleadings were there.  He, unfortunately, regrets that their replying pleadings did not represent the intention of the Government and that the Government were hard done by.  We will come to that in a minute.  We do know that no one in Government has said that Mr. Garvey got anything other than two hours' notice.</P>
    <P>We know, as well, that there was no question of misconduct on Mr. Garvey's part.  The Taoiseach said that himself. They were going to grant him his pension rights.  He would not have been entitled to his pension rights if there were misconduct, so we know there was no misconduct.  We know that the Taoiseach, or the Government, lost confidence in him; we do not know why.  We know, from Mr. Garvey's statement of claim again, that at some stage before the day that Mr. Garvey was asked to resign, the Minister met with Mr. Garvey and told Mr. Garvey that there were certain complaints from the Garda Representative Body, not from the Government.  Mr. Garvey was asked for his comments and he commented and was told that there would be an inquiry, or there might be an inquiry.  We know, so far as Mr. Garvey is concerned, that there was not an inquiry.  We know that Mr. Garvey was not invited to this inquiry if it took place.  We know that Mr. Garvey was not given an opportunity to defend himself.  After that, what do we know?  We know that between June 1977, when this Government assumed office, and January, 1978, when Mr. Garvey was removed from office, that the speculation about Mr. Garvey's tenure in office continued and was commented on and it was widely rumoured that he might not last.  We know that went on to such an extent that <i>The Irish Times,</i> in its editorial on 8 September 1977, made comment on the fact.  I would like to read this into the record of the House and to ask the Minister some questions arising from it. On that day <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil...have already set off with that well-known manoeuvre&mdash;<Col N="431" /> weaseling.  In &ldquo;non-attributable&rdquo; conversations they have recently, for example, tried to get newspapers to do for one of their Ministers what that Minister should do for himself either by direct action or by persuasion.</P>
    <P>A public servant is involved; a simple order or request from Minister to public servant is in question.  The Minister concerned could, of course, make a speech about it.  But he hopes that the newspapers will do his devious work for him.</P>
    <P>There was no response from the Government Information Services in the days afterwards to <i>The Irish Times</i> about that.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, on any occasion about that time, in fact from June 1977 to 8 September 1977, did he, or anyone in his Department, or anyone in his Government, or associated with it, or any agent of his Department or Government, get in touch with, or speak with, any political correspondent, or any newspaper man, in relation to this and suggest to him that he should publish something in relation to Mr. Garvey, or these public servants, in the newspapers?  Does the Minister regard <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial as totally unfounded? If it is, it would be scurrilous and should have received some response from the Government.  I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate&mdash;if he does not have immediate knowledge of it himself&mdash;whether he would look into the matter and let this House or the Dáil know, at some stage in the future, whether there is any background of truth to what was suggested by <i>The Irish Times</i> on 8 September 1977.</P>
    <P>I turn now to matters on which I would not normally spend any great deal of time in regard to legislation like this, or, indeed, any law case, that is, the question of the procedures that continued in the High Court and in the Supreme Court and the pleadings of which the Minister has spoken.  I am obliged to spend time on it because, as I have already said, the Minister has devoted a considerable amount of his address to this House, and in the Dáil, to the question of the procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> First of all, for the benefit of those people who are not conversant with the nature of legal pleadings, I explain in a very simple, quick way, how they work. Pleadings are documents in which the issues in a case are set forth in a simple and clear fashion.  There can be cases which are highly complex and difficult and cases which are simple, but, in all cases, the lawyers involved are obliged to file documents which crystallise the issues between the parties.  Even in the most complex action it is amazing how simple the pleadings can be.  A simple statement as to what the issue is can be set forth.  For example, if I complain that Senator McDonald's dog bit me and I go to sue him, I would set forth in my statement of claim that Senator McDonald's dog bit me.  I should also say that I suffered personal injuries as a result. Senator McDonald in reply to that, in his defence, is obliged to respond directly to the issues that I have raised in my statement of claim.  He would be obliged to respond, if he said that his dog did not bite me, to my statement of claim by saying that his dog did not bite Senator Molony's leg and Senator Molony did not suffer any injuries.  If he fails to say that the dog did not bite me, Senator McDonald is taken, automatically, as having admitted the fact that the dog bit me.  Senator McDonald may have the view that the dog bit me but that I did not suffer any injuries&mdash;that I went home and cut my leg with a knife.  If he takes that view, he simply says in his defence &ldquo;David Molony did not suffer the injuries he complained of.&rdquo;  The court then takes it that Senator McDonald's dog bit David Molony's leg and David Molony suffered no personal injuries and that is the issue to be decided by the court.</P>
    <P>In this case, as in every other case, when you fail to deny an allegation set out in a statement of claim, any tupenny-halfpenny law student will tell you that it is automatically admitted. Mr. Garvey, in his statement of claim, set our some background to the case. There are certain things he set out quite specifically and simply.  One of them is that he met the Minister on this occasion; that the Minister related to him complaints, or allegations, or whatever <Col N="433" /> came from the Garda Representative Body; that Mr. Collins indicated that there be an inquiry.  Mr. Garvey went on to complain specifically, in his statement of claim, that he was not given notice of his dismissal.  He did, of course, say that he was dismissed; that he was not given notice except for those two hours; that he was not given reasons for his dismissal and not given an opportunity to defend himself, and that, because of all these things, he was denied the rights of natural justice and fundamental rights that should have been his.  The simple fact and truth is that when the Government set about filing their defence, they did not deny any of that.  They simply said they were entitled to dismiss Mr. Garvey.  It leaves me in a state of utter disbelief that the Minister, or certainly his legal advisers, or any member of this Government with any legal experience, could not have understood the consequences of filing such a defence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come into this House today and he has blamed the legal advisers&mdash;he has not blamed them directly; he said there was a misunderstanding, that it was not intended that the Supreme Court should interpret things in that way.  He said in the Dáil on 30 May:</P>
    <P>As I have said, the court found that the defence pleadings did not constitute a sufficient denial of the various assertions made in the plaintiff's statement of claim and, consequently, that the defence pleadings must be construed as an acceptance of them.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say:</P>
    <P>To say that particular pleadings must be construed in a particular way, is not to say that such a construction corresponds with the intentions of the Government or of counsel who drafted the pleadings on the Government's behalf.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the suggestion being that they were hard done by; that there is a story behind all this; that through fumbling&mdash;and I say fumbling, because anybody with any legal experience would know that if you do not deny something in a defence case, the indirect <Col N="434" /> allegation stated in the claim is automatically admitted&mdash;the Government's case was not put properly.  The truth is that the allegation could not be denied; the truth is that Mr. Garvey got no notice, that he was not given reasons for his dismissal, and that he was not given an opportunity to defend himself. They draw this veil across the issue here&mdash;that the Supreme Court did not understand; that it is a mistake, that they did not mean to say that at all; it was something else they meant, but the Supreme Court could not see it.  That is nonsense.  It was without justification and I will wait with interest to see what background could have been put in a legal form in the defence.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that he will not, in any way, breach a convention of this House, or offend the principle of not discussing matters which are <i>sub judice</i>. He can answer the three questions: Was Mr. Garvey given reasonable notice? Not, did he hear the rumours that he was going to be sacked, but was he given notice by the people responsible for his removal from office?  Was he given reasons for the dismissal?  Finally, was he given an opportunity to defend himself?</P>
    <P>Those are the issues that are before this House today.  They are the issues before the High Court and the Supreme Court and issues that were ignored by the Government&mdash;they say by a mistake or some misunderstanding, but the fact is that they were ignored.  Another incredible point made is that it was a preliminary point that went to the High Court and subsequently was appealed to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil that Mr. Garvey's advisers came to the Government's advisers and said to them that there was a preliminary point here and asked if they could go to the High Court on it because that would determine the issue.  What that was going to determine I do not know, but the Minister said if Mr. Garvey lost in the courts there and then that he could not have another bite of the cherry.  But the Minister implied here&mdash;and I believe his senior counsel said after the Supreme Court hearing&mdash; that if Mr. Garvey lost he could not go further, but if the Government <Col N="435" /> lost they could have another bite of the cherry.  It is like tossing a coin&mdash;harps I win and tails you lose.</P>
    <P>What was put to the Supreme Court was very simple.  Mr. Garvey set out in his statement of claim his complaints. which I have outlined already.  The Government in their defence said they were entitled to dismiss Mr. Garvey. That was the basic issue, apart from the damages aspect which has yet to be dealt with, and there was no other issue. The Minister had other things to say but for some extraordinary reason he did not say them and the Supreme Court, counsel and everybody else misinterpreted what the Government intended to say.  That issue was put to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister can come into the House today and say that was a preliminary point.  Certainly the case was being dealt with in a preliminary fashion in that once the pleadings were closed it emerged that the issue was very simple and straightforward. When the Government said nothing about the defence it became quite clear that there was only one issue involved.  They had not denied a word in the defence about not giving notice, reason or an opportunity to Mr. Garvey to defend himself.  The issue was dealt with in a preliminary fashion more quickly than the ordinary case would be dealt with.  It went before the High Court and the Government lost.  In my humble submission they had to lose.  It went before the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court confirmed the view of the High Court.  What other matter could have been discussed by the High Court or Supreme Court apart from the issue of damages?  The substantive issue was clear.  It was dealt with in a preliminary fashion but it was no preliminary point to a case like that.  The simple truth is that once the Supreme Court and the High Court made their decision in the matter there was nothing else to be discussed and that was the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for the way the Government are handling this Bill; I believe he is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.  He has a <Col N="436" /> situation on his hands that must be rectified. We approve of the necessity to do that and we support this measure for that reason.  This Government, extraordinarily enough, have been accused of suffering from inertia, as suffering from procrastination and as being a Government unable and unwilling to govern.  Of all the criticisms they have received over the past two years that is the most outstanding one.  In the instances of removing from office public servants in whom they either do not have confidence or do not like, they have been a whopping success. They have been decisive, they have been on the ball and they have been quick.  We do not have to look too far. We had a quick retirement in the past few weeks of the man responsible for energy in the Department of industry, Commerce and Energy.  We had the Examiner of Restrictive Practices leaving in hurried circumstances.  Before that there was Mr. Garvey and many other examples could be cited.</P>
    <P>The truth is that this Government are terribly anxious to keep power about themselves.  Separation of powers does not come into this particular argument.  I ask the Minister to give this House an undertaking that this will not happen again, that in future if they choose to dismiss people such as Mr. Garvey, or any people in similar positions, they will be given notice of it, will be given an opportunity to defend themselves and will be given reasons for their dismissal.  It is unbelievable that in this day and age someone could say to the lowest servant in the land, whether he works in business or a private house, &ldquo;You are dismissed&rdquo;, or, worse still, give him two hours to get out.</P>
    <P>The truth is, I believe that Mr. Garvey was unpopular with the Garda Síochána.  He was said to have been a hard disciplinarian; he may have been.  I believe this Government, by a nod or a wink, conveyed to members of the Garda Síochána that he would be put out of office if they assumed power.  I believe that when they were elected they looked for means to get rid of him and could not find them easily, I believe they found that Mr. Garvey was not going to co-operate with them in dismissing him. I also believe that on that January morning <Col N="437" /> they decided to throw him out, just to ditch him.</P>
    <P>At that time the glitter of Fianna Fáil was still strong.  They were doing everything.  I remember at that time people in my own party in my county telling me, &ldquo;You will never get them out.  They will never shift.  Look at what they did&rdquo;. The Minister smiles, he is entitled to, but the smile is on the other side of his face now after the recent elections.  There was a time, and the Minister recalls it, when everybody thought Fianna Fáil were absolutely and utterly almighty.  They did not advert to the fact that we were down well in the bank and that the money would be paid back at one stage or another.  But at that time the glitter was strong and the Government had incredible popularity.  On the crest of the wave, at the height of that great feeling of power, they decided they could ditch Mr. Garvey and get away with it.  I think that is what they did, but the day they did that they started to decline.  A couple of days after Mr. Garvey was dismissed I met people who had no concern or conception about Mr. Garvey but they felt that an injustice had been done and were unhappy with the performance of the Government.  It was the first issue I remember that concerned people.  The reason for that was that behind it all, Irish people have a great sense of fair play.  That is something which the Government did not have on that occasion. I hope this is something which will never occur again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>For our part I can tell the House that this is a thundering mess which needs clearing up and this legislation, especially in the amended form, which endeavours to do that, although there is no certain guarantee that it will do so, will not be opposed or obstructed by us.  I am not qualified to speak on the legal aspects and I am less inclined to endeavour to do so after the last speaker.  I am fairly sparse with words of praise but Senator Molony's speech was extraordinarily good.  If I am not here to hear it in person, I will rapidly go to the records to see what the Minister is able to make of it, because there seemed to be a large number of unanswerable damning points in that admirable speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> I want, therefore, to look at the matter in a totally different way, more from a layman's point of view.  It would be an interesting exercise to work out what this piece of mixed stupidity, incompetence and vindictiveness has cost this country. I was interested to see that the Minister's 24 page speech tried to explain and validate this little Bill, Even if the payment comes from taxes or out of the public purse in the end, if you put together the cost of every day in the courts, every day the police have to check back to try to sort out what might go astray, what mistakes were made, what do we have to validate, what do we have to clean up afterwards, the days in the Oireachtas&mdash;this Parliament is expensive though certainly not a luxury, but we ought to be doing more serious things than spending time validating this mixture of vindictiveness and incompetence&mdash;if you put it all together, would it be the Minister's £1 million mistake or would it be more than that?  I do not know.  It is taking a very large amount of public money and public time in the Oireachtas, the courts, the Government, who ought, God knows, be directing their minds to other matters, the public service, the offices of the Attorney General and so on.</P>
    <P>I want to add my voice to Senator Molony's in regard to the election campaign. I wish that I could recall names and places, but an election campaign is a sort of whirlwind and it is impossible for me now, two years later, to be precise.  I certainly encountered from members of the Garda the statement that they were told by Fianna Fáil canvassers that if Fianna Fáil got back, Garvey was for the chop, or Garvey was for the high jump, or such phrase.  I add my voice to the record, in a very formal way, in a formal place, that any of us, from any party, could produce dozens and hundreds of people with the same experience. That was the currency of the discussion of the Garda Commissioner during the election campaign.  In other words, it was a promise made to buy some votes.</P>
    <P>Most of the promises made to buy votes have been broken and dishonoured. Many members of the Government are still so stupid that they <Col N="439" /> do not know that they have been broken and dishonoured and they go on mouthing them in a hollow way.  If they were more <i>au fait</i> with the present facts of the economy that they purport to be controlling, they would know that the promises have been broken.  Here is one that was not broken, a pity it was not.  It would have shown a certain magnanimity and sense of honour if they had not carried out the promise they made to get garda votes.</P>
    <P>I must assume, since I was aware of that promise from election time, that when the Minister entered office an effort was made to carry it out in a way that would not produce these repercussions, this extraordinary amount of public effort and public money being thrown down the drain.  From June to 19 January 1978 when the Government decided on the action they would take there was a little more than half a year for them to find a way to do this decently, and legally, if it were possible. We are not talking about the heady days of victory within weeks of a new Government coming to office, we are talking about them having half a year to look at it.  I am convinced by what Senator Molony said about the record of events which we both believe happened, that there was no notice, that there were no reasons given, that there was no opportunity for defence and that there was a matter of two hours to get out.</P>
    <P>I want to tease that out, quite apart from one Department or one human being, as a matter of Government attitude to all of the persons employed by them. One of the more wryly humorous promises in the election manifesto was to improve staff relations in the Post Office. If someone wants a laugh I recomment him to find the relevant part of the 1977 Fianna Fáil election manifesto.</P>
    <P>Here was the decision of a Government, apparently, not just one petulant Minister, to do something that in equity no employer would do to any employee, regardless of his length of service or status.  Anyone who belonged to the category of human being should not be treated in such a way.  I say this not as a <Col N="440" /> lawyer but as a human being.  It is a violation of the norms of behaviour between persons to do that, to throw a man out without notice, or reasons or opportunity for a defence and with a very short time involved.  It shows an attitude that echoes through all the relations with those persons who are employed in the public service.  If you can do that to one person, what is different about doing it to other persons in any way that is possible, legal or illegal, if you can get away with it?  It seems to be symptomatic of a quite exraordinary sort of savagery, ruthlessness and indifference to the norms of human behaviour.</P>
    <P>Then we have this interesting thing. Government's contain lawyers in many cases.  I often envy lawyers the great advantage they have politically.  I doubt that any Government in this State ever did not have a fair number of lawyers, and they have a large amount of legal advice.  In the face of that something was done which did not stand up.  Here I offer the Minister the thought, which must have occurred to him.  Ministers are responsible for the things they do, and more importantly for the things their servants do.  If someone behaves grossly incompetently, he is to be reprimanded and punished.  It is not given to anybody to fail in carrying out his work in a very gross, negligent or incompetent way.</P>
    <P>I have heard of the early resignations and failure to renew an appointment where it would have been normal, of public servants, two of them known to me.  They were admirable people, but I have not heard of any reprimand or dismissal in regard to those who gave legal advice to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I conclude that it is the Minister who must carry the responsibility. Either he demonstrates a failure on the part of those who advise him, or he accepts the responsibility himself.  It seems that in this lengthy speech he is doing neither.  He is not identifying any fault or mistake, but he is saying &ldquo;we were ill done by&rdquo; as he said in the Dáil. If we had one gross piece of incompetence in the manner of the dismissal, with no one identified or reprimanded or asked to resign for that, then when it came to the High Court and then <Col N="441" /> the Supreme Court, if I understand the last part of the Minister's circulated text he is saying that there was another gross piece of incompetence.  This is a very closely written speech&mdash;I think I see the hand of a lawyer in the drafting of this speech.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>What is perhaps more immediately relevant here is that the Supreme Court interpreted the legal pleadings made on behalf of the Government as tantamount to an admission of allegetions made in Mr. Garvey's statement of claim....  I must, however, make it clear that it had not been intended to be read in that way.</P>
    <P>That was another thundering error, two in a few months.  I did not hear of anybody being reprimanded or retired or not having his appointment renewed on the head of that.  The Minister must take responsibility for that too.  The errors are piling up.</P>
    <P>This is appalling staff relations, it is appalling behaviour in human terms, it is appalling incompetence, but through this speech my impression is that the Minister says many times in different words, &ldquo;there is a background&rdquo;, &ldquo;I do have a case&rdquo;, &ldquo;there will be another day and it will all come out.  Then you will see that, notwithstanding these two lots of bad advice, bad luck and incompetence on somebody's part, it was not really the Government's fault and what we did was right and valid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He says that so many times that I begin to think it is a bit hollow.  If it was only said once, or twice at most, it would be more convincing.  The reiteration of that gives me serious doubts, but we will know when the Minister's evidence is given in court.  If the Minister's case is not in the opinion of the court, a valid one, I think that, with the tradition of public responsibility in this country, the stage will be reached where it will be very hard to see the Minister continuing. He has not identified the persons, if they exist, who misled him and the Government and who are the sources of these very serious and exceedingly costly mistakes. If there were such persons, and if their background is seen to be inadequate, <Col N="442" /> and if the Minister's case, when finally perhaps at second shot he gets it right and tells the court what he wishes to have them told and that is adjudicated upon, and if it is seen to be trivial, if it is seen that there was not notice, or reasons given, or the opportunity for defence, I think the principle of people carrying responsibilities for the messes made in their names is such that the Minister, in equity and in honour, ought to offer his resignation.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Molony that this Bill should be passed quickly and that care should be taken by the Commissioner that it covers everything that has been done.  As a layman I cannot quite agree with everything Senator Molony said.  First, he made a false statement.  He said it was well known during the election campaign in 1977 that the Commissioner was going to be sacked.  It may have got as far as Tipperary but it was not well known in Cork.  I certainly knew nothing about it, nor did I hear any canvasser in the Cork area say it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molony illustrated how the law should be.  As a layman I cannot quite see that it is absolutely obligatory on Senator McDonald to say that a dog either bit or did not bite Senator Molony and that, therefore, Senator Molony did or did not receive personal injuries.  What would the situation be if Senator McDonald felt in law that he was not responsible for what his dog does?  What would be the answer in that case?  As a layman, I do not know but as a layman I feel that he has the right to say so and not definitely state whether the dog bit the Senator or that Senator Molony was injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a lot of superlatives used with reference to the Minister.  In recent months we had superlatives used, especially in the other House, in relation to <Col N="443" /> other things.  For weeks we heard about a fuel crisis and the word hammered so hard everywhere that it created petrol queues, hoarding and everything else. That was the result of the use of superlatives.  Yet the situation has changed and is under control.  I do not agree with people using superlatives when they are speaking on assumptions of what they think; what they know is a different matter.  Senator Molony said what he thought happened.  I do not consider a person in our position speaking publicly, should speak on serious situations such as this on what we think.</P>
    <P>Again as a layman I feel we have got to think about the decision of the Supreme Court which I suppose is now very definitely with us.  A Commissioner, like the head of an army, is in full charge of a big body of men, with the right to order them and instruct them what to do.  The apparent position now is, if I am correct, that even if, we say, the head of the army instructs his army to take action which would be contrary to the good of the country, you have to give him the time to prepare a defence in the case of accusation.  That appears to be the decision of the Supreme Court.  If there was a <i>coup d'etat</i> in this country would we have to sit down and give right?</P>

      <P>I was going to apologise for being a lay person; I was beginning to get a distinct impression that the world is divided into lawyers and non-lawyers and that somehow lawyers are better than non-lawyers but I do not believe that for a moment.  In this case, the issues are quite simple and should be understood by any child in the street.  I want to emphasise the fact that I am speaking as an independent politician.  I find it horrifying that political party members should be talking about the position of the Garda Commissioner being bandied about in an election campaign. That reflects no credit on politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ground has been covered exhaustively in this matter, both inside and outside this House.  I fully accept that this Bill, as it comes to us now, is legally <Col N="444" /> watertight and will fulfil the purpose for which it is brought before us.  It is obviously not the kind of Bill the Minister would expect one to stand up and welcome, and it is certainly not one which the Government enjoyed putting before us.  At the same time, certain things must be said.  No matter what way you look at it, this is an extraordinarily serious matter when it appeared that a Minister for Justice may have broken the law.  No matter what sophisticated legal niceties are used to describe the Supreme Court's judgment that was what they were saying.  Since it is such an extremely serious matter, we must find out how it came about so that such an occurrence could never happen again and we must see how such a thing could be avoided.  That is why we have to find out the whys and wherefores of this whole business, and why I believe it is right for Senators to be alarmed when they are put off by talk of it being <i>sub judice</i>.  We have to safeguard people in the future, and future Ministers and public servants.</P>
    <P>Various scenarios could have happened which are the root cause of this Bill.  In the dismissal of Mr. Garvey there is a possibility that the Minister crossed his fingers and took a gamble, hoping it would come off.  I cannot imagine that that was the case, because I hope that kind of behaviour is outside the realm of possibility in a matter like this.  It is, however, one of a range of choices which one must examine.</P>
    <P>There is another possibility which I would equally deprecate, and I am sure it could not have happened either.  The Minister could have lost his temper and rushed at this blindly and, perhaps, stopped to think when it was too late.  I am not acquainted with the temperament of the Minister but I can only hope that that kind of display went out with the last display of temper during the terms of the Coalition regarding the Presidency.  This country has had enough of displays of that kind of temper, and I am sure the Taoiseach would not tolerate that sort of a matter again.  I hope we can discount that as a possibility.</P>
    <P>There is a third thing that might have happened and perhaps a decision might <Col N="445" /> have been taken by the Minister after he and his Government had calmly and coolly considered the advice given to them by the people they considered best fitted to give them that advice.  I would hope that that is the way Ministers and Governments take decisions.  Unfortunately if that was the case then, as has been mentioned before, colossal mistakes were made in an area of extreme importance to the country.  We cannot, as Senator Keating would seem to have implied, blame advisers and expect heads to roll.  It is a Government's business to get the right advisers and, having listened to different kinds of advice, to make the right decisions. However, one is left with the fact that this third senario must be the only one that is possible and the one which has left us unravelling, by passing this Bill, a situation which it gave rise to.  If this third version is he correct one, then it is the most alarming.  However, we must know what is the correct version.  I believe it has gone on too long with promises of being told sometime, in another place, at another time when the opportunity is right when it is not <i>sub judice</i>.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this Bill which we must consider.  We have also to remind ourselves of the extreme importance of the job of Garda Commissioner because it is a job which vitally affects the stability of the State, the stability of Government and the stability of the democracy in which we live.  That has not been mentioned here by previous speakers.  I am not here to score points off anybody but we must remember that the position of Garda Commissioner is the supreme post in a body on which this State depends for stability.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which we must look at here is putting right and legalising retrospectively people's actions, the actions of the new Commissioner over certain periods of time.  In doing this we are able to bail the Minister and the State out of a sticky situation.  But in doing that we are engaged in papering over some extremely bad cracks which the Oireachtas should not have to do.  I say this because the Dáil and the Seanad <Col N="446" /> have, over very many years, passed a great deal of legislation to protect people's employment against a myriad of injustices relating to conditions, to their pay and to dismissals.  Many injustices affecting women in particular have come to light in the last few years.  Any Government can stand up and say to employers: &ldquo;You must treat your employees decently and fairly and abide by the rules, and these are the rules&rdquo; but now we are setting an example to the country of regularising our own sins retrospectively, breaking our own laws, and in fact breaking the laws of simple justice.  That is a serious element about which we should remind ourselves when we are discussing this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was, obviously, a serious mistake fundamentally and the Government have been seriously embarrassed.  I very much hope that the standards pertaining in the Departments which advise the Minister on these things will be examined and that steps will be taken in whatever areas are necessary to prevent such a very undignified and damaging parade of events happening again.</P>
    <P>The dismissal may have been found to be invalid because of various technicalities of procedure which may be understood and appreciated by legal brains and by some politicians.  The general public, however, only read in their paper that politicians are making yet another unholy mess of things and at a very high level.  It seems to me that a very serious aspect of this is how it appears to the ordinary person and it is an aspect about which none of us can be happy.  I hope that this will be the last such Bill which I will ever see in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a sad piece of legislation in so far as it marks another brick in the monstrous edifice of incompetence that this Government are building as their memorial.  It is sad too in that it is the sordid climax to what is a sordid background in so far as the former Commissioner, Mr. Garvey, is concerned.  We must all be worried by the apparent level of incompetence that this whole episode has revealed.  It was incompetence culminating in a finding <Col N="447" /> by the highest court in the land against the Government, the body charged with the protection of all the citizens and with the vindication of our national constitutional rights.  That the Government have been found to deny to an important servant of the State his fundamental rights and are found to be acting contrary to the principles of natural justice is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>One must presume that the Government, when denying Mr. Garvey the right to natural justice to which as a citizen he is entitled, must have been aware that there was a long list of judicial precedents setting out very clearly and explicitly the principle that no man can be dismissed without being given reasonable notice and without being given an opportunity to make his case.  There are numerous precedents in law for that proposition.  Yet the Government chose to ignore that legal position and only asserted, in reply to Mr. Garvey's claim, that they were entitled to do as they had done, that is, dismiss him on two hours' notice and without giving reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the question of whether the Government deliberately ignored the legal position with regard to the rights of the person supposed to be dismissed or were unaware of it.  I find it inconceivable that the Government and the Minister, with the legal knowledge within the Cabinet and with the legal knowledge available to the Minister from official sources, could have been unaware of the legal position.  Certainly, to echo a point made by Senator Keating, if the legal advisers were unaware of what I submit is a very clear and well known legal position we should have heard by now that steps were taken to deal with the personnel responsible for giving such erroneous advice to the Minister and the Government.  I consider the position to be so basically clear that I find it inconceivable that the legal position was not adverted to in the discussions leading up to this purported dismissal. If I am right in that, we then have to consider what was the tactic used by the Minister in effecting this dismissal.  If he knew the legal consequences of dismissing a person without notice and without <Col N="448" /> an opportunity to defend himself and yet chose to ignore those consequences, it seems to me that the Government at that stage were deliberately avoiding the situation where they would give notice of adequate length to the person concerned and give that person an adequate opportunity to defend himself and give him the points on which he would have to defend himself.  It seems to me that the Government decided that that course was not going to be adopted by them, that they did not want to tell Mr. Garvey why he was being dismissed, they did not want to give him an opportunity to defend himself.  It is not as if this dismissal came out of the blue.  We have the Taoiseach's own word for that in the Dáil when on the 31 January 1978 at column 4 he said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Garvey must have been aware for some time that the Government were concerned about the manner in which the general direction and control of the Garda Síochána were being exercised by him.</P>
    <P>That was in January 1978 and of course it raises the question of how long Mr. Garvey should have been aware, why he should have been aware and in what circumstances was his attention drawn to the fact that the Government were concerned about the manner in which the general direction and control of the Garda Síochána were being exercised and when he was first informed that there was concern.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is, as the Minister said, a background, and normally if one is going to sack somebody because of that background, that background should fall to be debated with the person concerned, and publicly if necessary, so that justice can be done and be seen to be done.  In fact we know from the pleadings in the case as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the 27 April 1978 that Mr. Garvey referred in his statement of claim to a meeting he had with the Minister on 15 December at which the Minister read out a number of complaints concerning him and which he, the Minister, stated that he had received from the executive of the representative body for the Garda and from some of <Col N="449" /> the executive of the representing body for sergeants.</P>
    <P>The statement of claim, according to the report in <i>The Irish Times</i>, goes on to say that Mr. Garvey stated that in reply to these complaints he wanted them in writing so that he could study them and answer them.  The Minister told him that there might be a sworn inquiry into these allegations and Mr. Garvey expressed his willingness to participate in any inquiry. The statement of claim then went on to tell us that a written statement of complaints was then sent to Mr. Garvey on 15 December, the same date as the interview.  On 20 December when he had not replied the Minister notified him that he wanted the reply that evening or early next morning.  Mr. Garvey apparently sent a reply on 21 December and he gave notice by telephone that he would expand verbally on his answers if required to do so.  Apparently he was required to do so, because on the following day he was summoned to the Department of Justice and gave full replies, according to his statement of claim, refuting the allegations made against him.  There we have what I presume the Minister refers to when he uses the word &ldquo;background&rdquo;, and we would have there, too, I presume the issues that the Taoiseach referred to when he said that Mr. Garvey must have been aware for some time that the Government were concerned.</P>
    <P>What puzzles me is that if the Minister was confident that his background justified the dismissal of the head of the national police force, the Minister did not proceed to dismiss him relying on this background and letting the matter be answered by Mr. Garvey, and then if they so wanted afterwards litigate the fairness or otherwise of the decision come to on the investigation of that background.  It puzzles me that that is not the way this matter was dealt with. Instead after partially and confidentially raising these matters and investigating them the Minister chose to ignore the background and instead opted for an extraordinary legal stance.  A couple of weeks afterwards he called in Mr. Garvey and told him that he wanted his resignation within two hours and that if it was not forthcoming he would be <Col N="450" /> sacked.  When it was not forthcoming Mr. Garvey was sacked.  Then the extraordinary defence to the claim by Mr. Garvey, ignoring a whole mass of legal precedents, was that the Government were entitled to do what they did.</P>
    <P>I will put forward the theory that in the Minister's actions in December mentioned in the statement of claim and in the oblique reference to the Taoiseach on the 31 January there was a certain amount of brinkmanship being practised by the Minister against Mr. Garvey.  I have no doubt that Mr. Garvey was as well aware as every other member of his force of the belief that he was to be chopped on the change of Government. It was not a very pleasant climate for the head of the national police force to have to live in and discharge his duties in.  But apparently no effort was made to clarify the issues until 15 December, six months after the change of Government, when these allegations were put to Mr. Garvey.  The tension was allowed to build up and then in late December these allegations were made; they were not pursued and then suddenly, out of the blue, in January the man was tempted with his pension and his gratuity to go quietly.  Most people in that situation would have reminded themselves of their age and the fact that they had only so long to do and asked themselves why they should get into a hassle and into all this controversy, publicity and so on; most people would at that stage have probably allowed themselves to be pushed over the brink and agreed to anything for a quiet life; they would have resigned, and taken their pension and gratuity.</P>
    <P>Mr. Garvey did not go and from what I knew of him from dealing with him it was entirely in his character to stand up and fight.  That was the nature of the man; he is a tough cop.  The Minister made a mistake in thinking that he was going to push him with two hours' notice and the gamble then went wrong for the Minister.  He did not give any reasons because presumably the reasons he would have given would have been those that were notified in the previous December and which were answered but were not pursued even though the Minister said there might be a sworn inquiry <Col N="451" /> according to the statement of claim.  Yet that was not pursued.  The Minister's gamble went astray and he was now in the position that he had to plead that the Government's action was justified by virtue of the wording of the 1925 Act and ignore the mass of legal decisions found since the 1925 Act and particularly under the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil Debates of 31 January when the matter was raised we see the extraordinary situation where the Taoiseach&mdash;in the aftermath of the scene where this man had been fired on two hours' notice and fired after six or seven months of, as <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial stated, weaseling against him and fired in a climate where the Government were making it plain that they had no confidence in him and that there was a &ldquo;background&rdquo;, savoury or unsavoury, stated that the Government had decided that Mr. Garvey would be given his gratuity and his pension.  In addition he was offered a further dangler of £3,250 by way of <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  I find that an extraordinary stance for the Government to take in the aftermath of their action of the previous week.  Having been offered the opportunity to resign and refused it Mr. Garvey was then fired and when one is fired from the public service in that situation one loses all that one is entitled to.  But yet here is the Taoiseach a week afterwards dangling pension, gratuity and an ex-gratia £3,250.  I must say when I read that, I could not help thinking that the Government were trying to bribe Mr. Garvey to end the proceedings there and then.</P>
    <P>That is why I say this whole business is a sordid climax to a whole sordid background.  The law then ensued and we had the Government's defence to the claim, pleading that they were absolutely entitled to do what they did.  In the circumstances of the whole scenario the Government had no choice but to make that plea and they had no choice but to admit in their defence, as the Supreme Court found, that no notice was given and no opportunity was given to the plaintiff to make a case.  The defence accordingly had to rely on the fragile legal ground of the 1925 Act and in doing so <Col N="452" /> had to ignore a whole mass of legal decisions which the Supreme Court, in due course, pointed out and found&mdash;as they were coerced by the legal position to find&mdash;in favour of Mr. Garvey.</P>
    <P>I do not know the position.  This is a theory.  But the alternative to it is to condemn the Minister and his advisers for an appalling degree of incompetence in not knowing the law.  I would accept the theory that Mr. Garvey had to go because of pressure on the Minister from various sources but that the reasons behind these pressures were not strong enough to stand up to public scrutiny or, in so far as they were tried out on 15 December, were rebutted by the then Commissioner so as to cast doubt over their validity.  Consequently, that line of country was not the line towards the desired end, the removal of the Commissioner. It was a gamble taken on a sudden chop, to look for his resignation and hope to get it in two hours rather than face the controversy of legal action and the apparent disgrace of summary dismissal from one of the highest offices in the land.</P>
    <P>Whatever the result the whole episode is sordid and sad.  We now have this extraordinary legislation.  Senator Molony said the like of it was not here in this term.  I do not think the like of it has been introduced in either Houses of the Oireachtas since the State was set up. We are being asked here to validate the consequences of a most extraordinary piece of administrative, and possibly legal, bungling.  Maybe the scenario I have painted is without foundation; maybe it was decided that the way to sack this man was to use the dismissal and to rely on the 1925 Act and that there was no motivation or background behind it.  Whatever the reasons, it was a total piece of bungling and we have no choice but to pass this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are legal consequences of that bungling&mdash;the 12 months of invalid actions by Mr. McLaughlin.  I have great sympathy for Mr. McLaughlin in the awful position he was left in.  He is an officer that, I know and one of whom I have formed a high opinion both personally and professionally.  It was a terrible situation for him, through no fault <Col N="453" /> of his own, to find himself in.  He was acting invalidly for upwards of one year.</P>
    <P>We are now trying to cure all of those invalid actions.  Here we are entering into a totally unknown legal scene.  No one has any idea what legal consequences are going to arise over the next years arising out of that particular piece of bungling.  Nobody can be sure that this Act will be effective to validate all the consequences of the invalid actions of Mr. McLaughlin's time.  That is an appalling legal mess for a well-ordered civilised State to find itself in.</P>
    <P>It was said by the Minister in the Dáil that no injustice has been done to anybody by virtue of the actions of Mr. McLaughlin and that any person who might have something done to him did not have anything done to him that was different from what would have been done to him if Mr. McLaughlin had been validly appointed.  That is a point of view.  But it is a defective point of view because, living as we do under the rule of law and consenting to the citizens of our State because we know there is an objective set of criteria to determine our relations with each other and with the State, we are entitled to know that these are solid and unchanging.</P>
    <P>A person, is only guilty when he is guilty in fact and guilty in law, the law as of the time when he is found guilty.  If the legal rules are changed accidentally, by reason of the negligence as in this case, then a person is not found guilty in fact and in law.  He may be guilty in fact and we then have to decide for ourselves if we are going to make him retrospectively guilty in law as well.  If so, are we then doing him justice in accordance with the theoretical precept of justice that it involves an unchanging rule of law, a set of objective standards?  That is the only way in which there can be certainty and objectivity about them.  The alternative implication in the Minister's suggestion that no injustice has been done is that some person, perhaps a member of the executive or a member of the bureaucracy, judicial or legal or lay, could at some stage come along and subjectively change the rule and then say it was a mistake and that he did not do it.  That is not good enough and inevitably there will be litigation teasing <Col N="454" /> out these considerations.  We are opening up legal paths the like of which no one ever contemplated would ever face any citizen in the country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this whole business is sad.  It is a piece of monumental bungling with regard to a person who did not deserve this type of treatment from this State.  Mr. Garvey's record as a dedicated and energetic public servant, generous in his time to his job is second to none.  I found him to be a dedicated police officer who was keen to have a high level of efficiency, to have a force that would give to the people of the country, its paymasters, full value for the high bills that have to be met for that force.  I know that there were elements within that force who disagreed with him.  They might have found his blunt choice of phrase and his blunt manner of speaking unacceptable in this age of euphemism.  I know that there were elements who did so find and who complained.  I recall when these complaints were being made and not just privately to me but were orchestrated through the public press with a general climate of dissatisfaction being created, in an effort to deal with them.  I recall devising a system of review and Mr. Garvey, even though the system of review could theoretically be seen to impinge on his authority, loyally, albeit reluctantly, agreed to it, without attempting to cause dissension among his peers with regard to it and certainly without running to the press leaking his dissatisfaction.  There was total loyalty by him with regard to what I, the then Minister, wanted him to do.</P>
    <P>That new review was welcomed by the representative bodies for the gardai and sergeants.  I recall an editorial in the <i>Garda Review</i> of May 1977, welcoming the establishment of these new review procedures, indicating that the new regime was under way and expressing satisfaction with what had been contrived. That was the position in May 1977.  The election then came and the aftermath of the election.  I have to say with regret that I have to confirm what has been alleged in this House and the other House as to what was the popular widespread belief among the public and among the members of the force and <Col N="455" /> their families with regard to what was going to happen to Mr. Garvey.  Certainly that belief and the atmosphere that built up after the change of Government indicated that changes were on the way. Changes unfortunately did come&mdash;sordid changes&mdash;which were totally undeserved by a man who gave nothing but loyalty and dedication to the service of this country from the time he first entered that service 40 odd years ago.  It was disgraceful and reprehensible.</P>
    <P>I must concede that any government must have confidence in the head of the national police force.  There can be no gainsaying that proposition.  If a government lose confidence in the head of the national police force, I submit that they have a duty to show that their loss of confidence is <i>bona fide</i>, that it is free from all political considerations and from all improper pressures.  They must also show that in coming to that stage the Government have taken into account and given due credit for the other side of the coin.  If a Government lose confidence then they are entitled to move. This is where we get back to what happened in this case.  The Government, instead of indicating clearly and honestly why they had lost confidence in the Commissioner and given him an opportunity to make his case, decided to chop him ruthlessly with two hours' notice&mdash;ruthlessly, and as it subsequently turned out invalidly and illegally, with the unprecedented legal consequences of this pathetic piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating referred to the possible financial implications of this piece of bungling.  I do not know whether his guess was far out or what was the position. Apart from the financial consequences, the consequences of this in terms of distraction of the Minister's energy and attention and distraction of the energy and attention of the gardai from dealing with the crime problems that we are facing are very serious and very large indeed.  Would not the Minister be better advised and service his office better if he was able without distractions like this to give his full attention to the urgent problems of combating the awful wave of bank robberies that we are experiencing?  Why have so few <Col N="456" /> of them been detected?  What is happening to the proceeds?  Who is spending it? Is there no intelligence whatever coming to the national police force to try to help to solve these problems?</P>
    <P>We had the sinister development where the dwelling house of a Member of the Oireachtas was invaded by masked and armed men who issued threats because of something he had said and was entitled to say as a public representative.  These are sinister developments.  How much better it would be for the Minister to be able to give his undivided attention, without these sordid distractions, to dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>This is an unprecedented situation. This Bill represents the public admission of a monstrous bungle.  I do not know, nobody knows, we can only speculate and I have speculated here today as to how the bungle arose and who was responsible for it.  Was it the consequence of mistaken political tactics or of ill-judged legal advice?  Nobody knows. One thing is clear.  The responsibility for it lies fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister for Justice as a member of the executive responsible.  I was Minister for Justice and I know that great pressures can and do come into that office and a Minister may have to carry the can for events initiated from outside or over which he has no control whatever.  I had to carry that can and my head was called for.  My resignation was called for in connection with events which I could not possibly have foreseen, events which were initiated from without, but in this particular instance this massive bungle has been initiated by the Minister and was carried through, if that is not a misuse of English, by the Minister himself.  It seems very clear that if the responsibility of an executive for his actions is to be faced up to, the Minister has no option but to acknowledge the serious dimension of the mistake made in this case.  He has no option but to acknowledge the unforeseen legal consequences which have been caused by this bungle.  He has no option but to recognise these matters by resigning his office.  If he did that, he would undo much of the sordid character that surrounds this whole episode and people <Col N="457" /> might forget that what we have been engaged in was nothing but a squalid witch-hunt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Members of the House for their comments on the Bill.  I am glad to note that their co-operation is forthcoming in having the Bill dealt with as speedily as possible.  I will deal briefly with some of the matters raised by Senator Molony.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by the Senator to the effect that, as far as possible, things done during the relevant 16-month period should be looked at and, where necessary, redone as it were, so as to avoid any argument in the future.  I would like to assure the Senator that this kind of action has already been taken in certain instances.  As regards the removal of Mr. Garvey, I want to make it quite clear that all I am saying is that I am in the position of a litigant in the High Court.  If I were to proceed, as the Senator suggests, to recite the facts of the background I would obviously be open to the charge that I was engaged in a highly selective presentation of the facts, choosing what suited me and omitting what did not.  I would be open to the charge, as I said in my opening speech, of engaging in an attempt to conduct a trial here on the very issues that are likely to be relevant in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the two-hour notice, the Senator referred to remarks made by me in the Dáil during the course of the discussion. I was quite specific in the Dáil in making it clear that I was not making any claim to have ever mentioned either resignation or dismissal to Mr. Garvey on any previous occasion and reference to this can be found in column 1715 of the Official Report of 30 May, 1979.  I cannot go into any further detail.  It would be quite wrong of me to proceed in this House in present circumstances to make statements purporting to establish that the Government acted reasonably.  I do not intend to comment on the Senator's statements on the technical matters of legal pleadings except to say as a matter of fact that the Government pleadings did&mdash;and I repeat the word &ldquo;did&rdquo;&mdash;contain a denial of the allegations but the Supreme Court <Col N="458" /> did not regard the denial as sufficient because, as I understand it, it was a general denial and the Supreme Court considered a general denial insufficient. The Senator's statement that the issue had been reduced to the preliminary issue because there was no substantive issue is, in fact, wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought the Senator said.  I am not in any way holding myself out as a competent person to analyse the finer points of the legal action at this stage.  The Senator asked for an assurance that the Government will not act like this again.  That must be likened to asking a person if he had stopped beating his wife.  He has conducted his own trial to his own satisfaction here.  So be it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reserve my defence for another day.  Senator Keating repeats, as do other Senators, the allegation about an election promise that was made.  I have explicitly denied in the Dáil that I made any such promise or indeed, if you wish, any such threat or that I had any knowledge of it.  Seemingly that is not acceptable but I say that is so.  If Senator Keating, Senator Cooney or any other Senator, Deputy or candidate during that campaign came across a case where such allegations were made, why then did we not during the course of that campaign hear the then Minister for Justice, Senator Cooney, or the then Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, openly talk on such matters? They did not because it never happened, and they know it to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keating goes on to imply that I sought ways and means to carry out this promise that was alleged to have been made without consequences which the Government would not want.  Let me say to Senator Keating that he would be acting more prudently from the point of view of his own reputation as a reasonable person if he reserved judgment or reserved comment until he heard the other side.  He has not heard <Col N="459" /> the other side.  The Senator knows quite well that I am inhibited by the High Court proceedings from saying anything at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony suggested that this House would have no opportunity at a later stage to consider any aspect of the merits.  I would respectfully suggest to the Senator that this House has ways and means of discussing anything it wants to discuss in due course when the legal proceedings have been disposed of. If I had any influence in this House, which I have not, I would not have any objection to the House discussing it at that stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comments of Senator Hussey, the Senator says that this House must find out what happened. I say, fair enough to that.  That is a matter for the House but when the Senator says that the House must find out now I can only say that, for the reasons I have already given in detail, I cannot assist this House to find out now. I believe that the facts may come out in full in the High Court.  I am not saying that they will because I do not know what course the action will take. However, as long as the action is there I cannot agree to make statements in my own defence.  Indeed, after the High Court action is finished and if the facts are not apparent, I will certainly be open to be questioned in the Dáil but I would not presume to advise the Senators as to how they might go about finding out what is the position.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney suggested that the Government must have known what was the law.  He went on to deduce that what happened must have been due to an unwillingness to set out the basis of complaint and to engage in a proper assessment of the reply.  Of course, the difficulty about replying to that kind of analysis is that it is based on a combination of facts and, with respect to the Senator, some assumptions.  If I were to challenge some of the assumptions now I would, in fact, be doing the very thing I have explained that I cannot do because I would be defending myself on issues that are, or certainly are liable to be, the very issues to be assessed by the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> May I say this much, that I do not think it takes from what I have said up to now about not going into the merits that the question never arose as far as I was concerned of offering Mr. Garvey a pension as a bait to encourage him to resign?  Perhaps that was uncalled for but I will forgive the Senator.  I will forgive him for a lot of things today because I have to.  It is not the case, as the Senator seems to think, that a person would normally lose all his rights to pensions and so on on being removed from office in the Garda Siochána.  A member of the force might or might not, depending on circumstances.  The details are all spelled out in the Garda Pensions Orders but I am sure the Senator has not had a chance to look at them for some time now.  As for the rest of the Senator's comments, they are, I would say, on his own admission&mdash;and it is his admission&mdash;speculation. I would say in reply that the suggestion or the speculation is that from the time I took office I was determined to get rid of the Commissioner and used the very first available excuse for doing so.  I cannot foresee future developments, but in the nature of things I think it is likely that there will be some further analysis either in the High Court or elsewhere within a matter of months.  I do not know how many months that might be, but I believe that whatever number of months might have to elapse between now and then the Senator will certainly know enough of the facts by then to know that whatever view he may have on other aspects of my activities he will not repeat the suggestion that I acted in the way he now thinks I may have done.</P>
    <P>I note that the Senator has called on me to resign.  It is nothing new.  I think it is Item 77 on the Order Paper in the Dáil, or was the last time I looked at the motion of no confidence in me which has been tabled by his party.  As I said in the other House, I will more than welcome that motion of no confidence in me.  I will welcome it as an opportunity to state my case and to state it in full, because I believe that obligation is on me.  I believe the public must and will know and as far as I am concerned they will definitely know the full facts when I get that opportunity.</P>

      <P>There is one matter which I raised and I think the Minister has overlooked it.  I think it is one he would be anxious to reply to.

That is putting it very clearly.  I have asked nobody.  I know nothing of it.  I was not involved in any way and let me say that if I was at all times to take issue with matters raised in the editorials of any papers well then the Senator, I am sure, would be one of the first to really take me to task for interfering with the rights of the journalists who put these newspapers together.</P>

      <P>The number of such cases, I think, must be comparatively few, but in support of the point I was making earlier that justice must be justice both in fact and in law, will the Miniser consider, through the Attorney General if he be the appropriate person, drawing the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions to the fact that the Government is concerned to ensure that no citizen will have suffered an injustice at the hands of the State by reason of the invalid actions of Mr. McLaughlin and that the State is anxious to restore that citizen by adequate compensation or whatever is necessary?</P>

All I can say to the Minister from the point of view of a person in prison, notwithstanding the increased sophistication of prisoners and the aids available to them is, &ldquo;Thank you very much for nothing or for very little&rdquo;.  The State has an obligation to go further than merely to say that if the question arises go to court with it. When the State has been responsible for that person's legal situation the State should have an obligation to take an initiative. That is all I am asking the Minister to do, in order to demonstrate publicly the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government and their anxiety to undo and rectify the mistake that has been made here and to ensure that no citizen has been unjustly done by.  All I ask the Minister is that he should take the initiative, as the person peculiarly in a position to do so, having the resources to do so, rather than saying that an unfortunate prisoner in Mountjoy, or wherever he might be, can do it if he wants to.

      <P>That Seanad Éireann considers that the proposed civil legal aid scheme should be introduced by legislation setting out clear policy lines and protecting the rights of citizens; that an attempt to implement such a scheme by administrative action would deprive the Houses of the Oireachtas of their proper jurisdiction in the matter and would prevent the legislative establishment of an independent board, of proper community law centres with local management committees and of a panel of barristers and solicitors to ensure the adequate provision of legal services throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad has two motions before it on the subject of civil legal aid.  I would like to begin by saying that I am grateful to <Col N="465" /> Senator Molony and to the Fine Gael group for allowing the motion in my name and in that of Senator Keating to be debated and then provide that the other motion will be moved formally. The other motion calls for the implementation of a scheme of civil legal aid, based on the recommendations of the Pringle Committee.  Our motion is a more recent one and was tabled in direct and urgent response to the Government's press release of 2 May last, on the subject of the proposal for a civil legal aid scheme.  This press release is relatively brief and it would be proper for me to read its terms, because we fixed the opportunity to debate the terms of this Government proposal to seek clarification from the Minister of State on its terms and to make some critical comments on the scheme, as it is outlined in this press release.  The press release is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government have approved the features of the civil legal aid scheme which is to be introduced by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The scheme is based generally on the comprehensive (as distinct from the interim) scheme outlined in the report of the Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice (the Pringle Committee).  This means that it will not be confined to the three categories of legal cases set out in the interim scheme, that is family law, landlord and tenant and consumer protection cases, nor will it be confined to the lower income group envisaged in that scheme.</P>
    <P>The upper limit of eligibility will be £2,500 of disposable income instead of the figure £2,000 set out in the Pringle Report for their comprehensive scheme.  (Disposable income is gross income from all sources less certain allowances and deductions such as income tax, mortgage repayments, rents etc.)</P>
    <P>The contributions to be paid by assisted parties to the costs will be as recommended by the Pringle Committee for the comprehensive scheme. These are payable out of income and capital.  For legal <i>advice</i> cases the minimum contribution will be £1.  At <Col N="466" /> the minimum disposable income level (i.e. up to £10 per week) the income contribution towards legal <i>aid</i> will be £10 and higher contributions will be graduated by reference to the level of disposable income.</P>
    <P>While the scheme will not be confined to the three categories mentioned it is not intended that legal aid will be available for every possible application: as is the case in other countries, some types of cases where legal aid is considered unnecessary or unjustified would be excluded.  Examples of these would be applications to tribunals, defamation, breach of promise, insurance-covered cases, arbitration under the Landlord and Tenants Acts, licensing matters, planning appeals, debt collections and civil bills for sums below a limit to be specified.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be administered by a Board and legal aid and advice services under it are to be provided by salaried lawyers employed in centres for the purpose.  The Board, which will be independent in the discharge of its functions, will consist of a Chairman and eight members and will have the final responsibility in determining individual applications for legal aid, both as regards means and legal merit.  The discharge of this responsibility may involve hearing appeals against refusals of legal aid by centres or by members or officers of the Board.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government is that the scheme should be in operation as soon as possible, but in any event by the end of the year.  The scheme will be introduced initially on an administrative basis, that is without specific legislation, and the Minister proposes to enter at once into discussions with the legal profession on the implementation of specific aspects of it.</P>
    <P>My first point in relation to that press release is that it refers to the fact that the scheme will be introduced as an administrative one and that there will not be any specific legislation.  The Minister of State, in a radio interview following that press release, stated that the <Col N="467" /> Government wished to have the flexibility of an administrative scheme and that it was not envisaged that there would be legislation, probably for a number of years.  This raises an extremely serious issue.  It is hard to believe that the Government would envisage introducing any type of comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid without grounding legislation.  I believe that this raises constitutional issues.  It seems to be an attempt by the Government to bypass the Oireachtas.  How can an independent legal aid board be set up without legislation?  How can criteria for the right to legal aid and availability of legal aid be set out without legislation? This is the first, very important point, and I would hope that the Minister of State will give us some indication of Government thinking in this regard.  It is the Oireachtas which is given the legislative power under the Constitution, and it should surely be the Houses of the Oireachtas which set out the type of structure which was envisaged in the Pringle Committee, which, in fact, appendixed to its proposals the heads of the legal aid Bill.  In other words, the Pringle Committee, saw it as a necessary prerequisite to the introduction of civil legal aid and that there would be legislation.</P>
    <P>I will deal with this point more fully in reply when I have heard the Minister of State give an explanation of why the Government should see fit to seek to introduce the scheme by administrative arrangement, with all the dangers and difficulties of that, in that it cannot establish any independent board; it cannot give a right, as such, to legal aid and it may be dependent on the availability of Government funds in the future.  It is easy to abolish an administrative scheme; it is easy to totally underfund it, so that it does not work, and therefore there are all those dangers in that approach. That is my first fundamental criticism of the Government's proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>The second criticism I would make is of any attempt to describe the scheme, as outlined in the press release which I have read, as being a basic implementation of the recommendations of the <Col N="468" /> Pringle Committee.  That is claimed in that statement and yet, on examination, what the Government proposals do is leave out all the better aspects of the Pringle scheme and, instead, refer in very sketchy outline to a scheme which is very far removed either from the interim or the full proposals of the Pringle Committee.  I would agree with the analysis made of the Government's proposals and the comparison made between the Government proposals and the recommendations of the Pringle Committee, which are contained in a discussion paper issued by the Coolock Community Law Centre entitled &ldquo;Law Centres and Legal Aid&rdquo;.  In page 40 of this discussion paper they refer to the claim made by the Government that the proposed scheme would be &ldquo;based generally&rdquo; on the comprehensive scheme of the Pringle Report.  It says:</P>
    <P>The claim that the proposed scheme is &ldquo;based generally&rdquo; on the comprehensive scheme in the Pringle Report simply does not stand up to examination, if we compare the two.</P>

    <P>In fact, the proposed scheme has rejected all the more imaginative aspects of the Pringle Report recommendations. We do not consider that the scheme can meet the need for legal services to be available nationally, and involves a purely cosmetic exercise designed to give only the appearance of a national comprehensive legal aid scheme without actually delivering same.</P>
    <P>That comparison between the main proposals of the Pringle Report and the very different approach of the Government scheme shows that far from being an implementation of the main proposals in the Pringle Report it is a most unacceptable watering down, an introduction <Col N="469" /> of an administrative scheme to establish 15 legal assistance centres and to effect the employment of 30 lawyers.  That is not a comprehensive system of civil legal aid.  That is not to have begun to understand what community law centres are all about.  This is the next major weakness in the Government's proposals &mdash;a total failure to understand what is meant by a community law centre, which forms an essential component of the Pringle recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Pringle recommendations were for a minimum of six community law centres to start with and that this was to develop as a network in the community. There was also to be the panel system, which has been rejected by the Government. The major problem that we are left with is that 15 legal assistance centres do not begin to provide a genuine system of civil legal aid and advice throughout the country.  If one looks at the situation in Dublin one would have to have seven or eight of those centres located in parts of Dublin and its suburbs and outer regions, leaving, at the most, about seven centres to be located in large towns or cities around the country.  That is not providing a system of civil legal aid; that is not providing access to legal services for people.  It is certainly not clear from that press release that there must be countrywide access to legal services. There must be a network of community law centres and a panel system, to ensure that there are no gaps, that there are not people who are too far distant from the centres to be able to have access to their services.  What the Government are doing is very much a limited, urban-based provision of State lawyers providing services.  It is very far removed from the general criteria and standards which the Pringle Report had identified and which must form an essential part of any scheme.</P>
    <P>In looking at the question of the provision of legal advice we must examine what we mean by a community law centre.  We have to ask a number of questions.  What should be the basic aims behind a community law centre? What work should the centre involve itself in?  How do we envisage law <Col N="470" /> centres being established?  Who should be involved in both the planning and the running of the centres?  These are fundamental questions, none of which is relevant in the same way to the legal assistance centres which the Government seem to be envisaging, where you employ two lawyers who are paid for out of moneys provided by the State and they are located in this centre.  That is not a community law centre.  They have not begun to understand what a community law centre is.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about community law centres we have to look at the various aspects of work of a centre. These would be broken down into at least five different categories of work. First of all, there would be the case work of the community law centre.  It seems that the Government's scheme would envisage a legal assistance centre purely devoted to case work, where you would have lawyers employed and paid for by the State taking on a load of case work under the terms set out, in sketchy fashion, in the Government's press release.  Case work is only one aspect of the work of a community law centre. Secondly, there would have to be the resources service to existing community organisations&mdash;the resource that a community law centre would be to tenants' associations, women's organisations, local community associations, the resource of knowing the rights of the people in that area, being able to seek advice on particular problems which are prevalent in that area, particular housing problems, or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>The third aspect of the work would be to help to organise self-help and community organisations within the area&mdash;a positive involvement by the community law centre in helping the people in that area to help themselves.  I am thinking of a group of deserted wives in an area who can be encouraged by a community law centre to be involved to a considerable extent in self-help, in learning together and in meeting their own particular legal and social needs.</P>
    <P>A fourth very important aspect of a community law centre is the educational aspect, the extent to which it is involved in educating people as to their rights, <Col N="471" /> educating people as to what is meant by legal aid, educating people as to the way in which law can help them; there are so many people in this country, particularly in areas where their needs are greatest, who fear the law and who fear lawyers; who do not see the law as being helpful to them and who see it as an alien body associated with the Garda, associated with courts which intimidate and frighten them.  A very substantial role of a community law centre is this educational role.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the need for a community law centre to be actively involved in research and in campaigning for law reform, based on the practical experience of the community law centre.  If one were envisaging community law centres in this sense, as a component in a system of civil legal aid, we require legislation establishing, first of all, the legal aid board which would be the central board and which would set down the standards for these community law centres.  The staffing of a community law centre is an essential feature of it.  The experience in other countries and the recommendations made would make it clear that a community law centre should have a minimum staff component and that that minimum staffing would include two solicitors, at least, a community law officer, or a community worker&mdash;whatever one wants to call the co-ordinator with the local community&mdash;and an administrator. That would be a minimum staff of four people at that level, and obviously also secretarial assistance.  The Government, in its proposals, referred to the fact that the centres would be staffed by two solicitors.  There is a very narrow approach to the provision of the case load aspect of a centre.  The equally important other roles of a community law centre in relation to its local community do not seem to have been understood or comprehended; the minimum staffing which would be envisaged would be at least four people and the legal aid board should be laying down this as a minimum standard.</P>
    <P>Apart from the staffing requirement, there would also have to be the provision of a budget through annual grants to <Col N="472" /> these community law centres to allow them to develop the research and educational aspects of their work, which is so important.  This dimension of research and education is totally absent from the Government proposals and does not feature in the proposed scheme, I would like to place a great deal of emphasis on that.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the one full-time community law centre which we have here in the Republic, which is Coolock Community Law Centre.  It is very important to learn from the practical experience of a full-time community law centre and to see it as a model, not to be viewed uncritically&mdash;we can view it critically&mdash;but also to be seen as a practical model from which we should build.  It is interesting to see the priorities which the Coolock Community Law Centre has established already.  One of these is a very strong priority in its educational aspect of relating to the local community; in establishing a local management committee which is heavily involved in the management of the centre.</P>
    <P>We can learn a lot from the practical experience of this full-time community law centre which is operating in the State, the Coolock Law Centre.  It is interesting to see the emphasis placed by that law centre on the educational and research aspects that I had referred to. This is an aspect which is not contained in the outline of the Government's proposals.  It does not seem to form part of the legal assistance centres which the Government propose to establish and, therefore, I am placing a lot of emphasis on it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that in its time in existence the Coolock Law Centre has published a number of different kinds of discussion papers, research papers, surveys and so on.  I listed those that I have in my own possession&mdash;they may not even be comprehensive, but these are the ones I have in my own files&mdash;because I find their work extremely useful and very informative.  They published a barring order survey&mdash;surveying the number of barring orders obtained&mdash;the problems, the degree to which the Garda Síochána can be called upon to assist where a barring order has been <Col N="473" /> breached, and so on.  They published a report on the whole area of maintenance of deserted wives and the problems for deserted wives of trying to choose between deserted wife's allowance or a social welfare supplementary allowance, depending on circumstances.  They published the discussion, from which I have already quoted, on law centres and legal aid, a guide to employment rights, a leaflet on social welfare allowances, and a further explanatory leaflet on criminal compensation tribunals&mdash;another area people do not know about.  They found a number of their clients were unaware of their rights and decided they ought to have this explanatory leaflet.  They also publish a newsletter which comes out every three months or so, and I understand that No. 7 of this newsletter will be coming out in the very near future.</P>
    <P>They have established a working local management committee which consists of representatives of the local tenants' association, community groups, women's organisations and so on.  They are in a position to make a very lively and committed contribution.  I understand that the Coolock Law Centre have formed themselves into a company limited by guarantee, that the local management committee form a central part of that company and will continue to form an integral part of the work of the community law centre, of their accountability, and of their whole impact and role in the local community.  These are all very important values and are essential values for a community law centre.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that every community law centre should approach it in precisely the way in which the Coolock Law Centre have established themselves. They had very considerable difficulties. For example, they sought to have a second solicitor for a very considerable time because they are working at the moment in what would be regarded as a substandard way.  They have only one solicitor working in the law centre.  Yet, their case load for 1978 is phenomenal. The new cases taken on totalled 510. Court appearances made by this one solicitor totalled 217, and appointments made during 1978 for the Coolock Law <Col N="474" /> Centre totalled 1,115.  What solicitor in private practice would tolerate that kind of workload?  It is not good for a law centre to be reliant on one single solicitor to do the case work.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Coolock Law Centre have not had an ideal situation.  They have been fighting for a second solicitor to bring them up to what is regarded as the minimum staffing of a community law centre-to have two solicitors.  They have had to fight a battle for the salary of the community law agent, and are now able to plan for next year because of a special grant from the Department of Health.  I understand the grant of £5,000 made under the general auspices of the Department of Health has begun to come through and this will secure the salary of the community law worker until next March.</P>
    <P>They are still in very difficult negotiations about their premises.  The present premises are totally inadequate.  There are no toilet facilities.  What solicitor in private practice would put up with that? There is a lively proposal, as the Minister knows, for a different section of the Northside Shopping Centre.  I have the correspondence here but I do not think it is appropriate at this stage to quote from it, unless the Minister makes some reference to the question of the premises of the Coolock Law Centre, and in reply I might meet some of the points he makes.  It appeared the Department of Justice were going to take a lease and make it available for the Coolock Law Centre, but they have declined to do this.  It appears FLAC were given money, but they were not authorised to acquire the premises and pass them on to the Coolock Law Centre.</P>
    <P>We have one full-time community law centre and they have had problems in relation to getting a proper complement of staff, getting their two solicitors; getting the salary of the community law officer and they had to beg and eventually throw themselves on the mercy of the Minister for Health who seemed to be able to find some money for them and they had to enter into very difficult negotiations about premises.  Here we have the Government saying they are going to establish 15 legal advice <Col N="475" /> centres, not community law centres but legal assistance centres, around the country, staffed by two solicitors.  I believe their credibility would be a good deal better if the attitude towards the existing full-time community law centre stood up to examination and was not, as it appears to be, one of constant survival attempts by those who are staffing the Coolock Community Law Centre, a failure to appreciate the very valuable work they are doing, the enormously important impact they have made in their local community and the very strong feelings of the people living in that area who, for the first time, are getting legal advice, who are benefiting from the research, who have an accountability by the law centre to them and to the representatives of their organisations, who are prepared to come out in the street and demonstrate in favour of their community law centre.  It is this kind of development that we want as the basis for the approach of establishing centres.</P>
    <P>We do not want legal assistance centres merely staffed by lawyers paid by the State to provide legal advice.  That is not enough.  We want a network of community law centres.  We also want a panel system.  We must have a panel system if we are to have a countrywide system of civil legal aid and if we are not to discriminate against those in rural areas, or those in small towns where there is not a legal assistance centre. These are essential points I would like the Minister to deal with when he makes his contribution.</P>
    <P>We also must hear a great deal more about the reasons given in the Government's press release for the exclusion of certain categories of cases. There are some exclusions which are very hard to understand, for example, the exclusion of tribunals.  The casework that FLAC has encountered and the casework of the Coolock Community Law Centre show that very important areas are social welfare appeals, employment appeal tribunals, and planning appeals.  Local tenants' associations or local community groups may wish to institute a planning appeal but may not be able to do so unless they can get the advice of their local <Col N="476" /> community law centre.  These exclusions seem to bear no relation to the reality of the problem.</P>
    <P>Other exclusions are hard to understand&mdash;the exclusion of civil bills falling below a certain limit.  What is the merit in that?  It may be a small amount, but to somebody who is not able to afford a private lawyer it may be essential, for example, either to defend an ESB claim or to defend a debt which a widow finds herself liable to pay arising out of the death of her husband and the administration of the estate.  The amount may not be big, but why should that person not be able to get the advice? Why should the criterion not be one of merit?  If there is no merit in the claim, the person should not be entitled to civil legal aid and advice, but why have an artificial low cut-off in this way?</P>
    <P>The eligibility criteria will have to be examined much more fully.  To begin with, it would be important for Members to ascertain what the precise provisions of the eligibility criteria would be.  For example, in talking about the upper limit of eligibility being £2,500 of disposable income, what is the position, for example of a married woman?  How would her income be assessed?  If a person has nominally a disposable income, but does not have £10 to put down for the legal aid, but needs a barring order or a maintenance order, how will that person be able to get over what appears to be a barrier to getting advice?  Before responding on that, it would be better to wait and give the Minister of State an opportunity to clarify the eligibility limits and that aspect of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I will summarise the major criticisms, and they are very basic criticisms, of the scheme as we see it at the moment.  First, the suggestion that the scheme would be introduced without legislation is unacceptable. Second, the absence of a panel system is not a comprehensive civil legal aid scheme.  It is a limited proposal to establish a number of legal assistance centres in areas of density of population and does not cater on a nationwide basis for equality of access to justice, access to the courts, and access to a remedy. Third, these legal assistance centres are not community law centres in any sense <Col N="477" /> of the word, and therefore, are not an implementation of the Pringle recommendations. We need to think again of what we mean by community law centres and to base the whole approach on the need for community law centres which have this whole aspect of research and education in relation to the local management committees.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the Government scheme to local management committees. This vital relationship between a community law centre and the indigenous population of the area seems to be totally omitted from the Government scheme.  There are the omissions of certain categories of cases which bear no real relation to the type of case load which a solicitor of this sort would have and to the kind of problems which would arise.  If there are to be exclusions they should be dealt with by the Legal Aid Board.  That is the body which determines the types of cases for which there should be availability of legal aid, if we are not going to have it as an availability across the board which of course, would be my preference.  I am grateful to Senator Molony for allowing me to move this motion, and I now make way for him because he kindly offered to second it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me pleasure to second the motion tabled by Senator Robinson.  I should perhaps explain that Motion No. 16, in my name and that of Senator Cooney called on the Government to introduce as a matter of urgency a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid and advice as outlined by the Pringle Committee in their report, and has been on the Order Paper for over a year.  With the announcement some weeks ago of the new system, it became dated.  For that reason I was quite happy to let Senator Robinson introduce Motion No. 22.  There is not any need for me to go into all the arguments.  Senator Robinson has given a very good outline of the case in favour of the comprehensive scheme proposed by the Pringle Committee.  One of the difficulties we have today is that we do not really know how the scheme, as already proposed by the Government, is going to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> I agree fully with what Senator Robinson said about the manner in which the Government chose to in troduce the scheme.  I do not think it is good enough that they say &ldquo;we are going to introduce a scheme by an administrative laneway and it will be controlled by an independent force&rdquo;. Senator Robinson pointed out the difficulty about how people might be appointed to that board.  The Government are in very real difficulties here.  I would prefer it in many ways if the Minister had started this debate, contrary to the convention and manners of the House, by explaining precisely what the Government had in mind.  Unfortunately I am going to be caught for time.  I do not think I will be able to wait to hear what the Minister of State has to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will forward the Senator a copy of my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look forward with interest to reading the Seanad Report on the subject.  I was astonished to read some newspaper reports after the Government issued their press release some weeks ago in which they said that the new scheme appeared to be an improvement on the comprehensive scheme as proposed by the Pringle Committee. No doubt the Minister will call on those words of praise for the scheme, but time will show that those words were written prematurely and in an over hasty fashion, and when the scheme as we think we know it, is introduced, it will be seen to be grossly and utterly inadequate.</P>
      <P>The first thing to point out, as Senator Robinson did, is that there is undoubtedly not just a problem so far as legal aid is concerned, but there is a social problem so far as many people are concerned in dealing with the law and lawyers.  If we are talking about legal aid in the sense that we want to provide everybody with access to justice, we must approach this in a completely different fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of 15 centres throughout Ireland is not going to provide access to justice for somebody living, for example, in Tipperary.  There will not be one of these law centres or <Col N="479" /> advice centres in Tipperary.  This means that somebody from Tipperary who wants to consult one of these legal aid solicitors would have to travel to Cork, Dublin or Limerick, to get advice.  The simple truth is that it is most difficult for those people most in need, to travel.  The scheme, as envisaged, would be counterproductive in this sense.</P>
    <P>Problems will arise in relation to a marriage, a matter of labour law, or in relation to any number of matters, and unless a person can gain access to advice easily, it is certain that he or she will not do it at the start.  He or she will wait until the case has advanced, perhaps to a position where the marriage has irretrievably broken down perhaps to the position where, in a civil action, the parties are so entrenched that it is difficult to affect a reasonable and quick settlement. In doing that, we are creating problems for the centres that will exist presumably by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>We must go back to the basic point, and Pringle saw this.  They said if you want to provide access to justice, to provide a comprehensive legal system, you must do two things.  You must first ensure that throughout the State offices are established where people can go to get legal aid and advice.  In the report they considered the question of how this might be done and whether it was possible to introduce community law centres throughout the country.  At chapter 4, paragraph 2, they write:</P>
    <P>At present legal services in the State are provided almost exclusively by private practitioners.  It seems clear that the provision of a comprehensive nationwide legal aid and advice service must involve the private practitioner. There are obvious advantages in using the established system of providing legal aid services for the purposes of the Legal Aid and Advice Scheme.  There is an existing network of legal practices which effectively covers the country, and it would offer the widest choice of source from which to obtain legal aid and advice. However, because of the fact that a legal aid and advice service can sometimes be provided more effectively <Col N="480" /> in underprivileged and densely populated areas by other means, in particularly by full-time legal aid centres, we consider that the provision of this service should not be the sole responsibility of private practitioners.  On the other hand, we consider that a service provided exclusively by legal aid centres would be impracticable outside a few of the larger centres of population.</P>
    <P>That is the case.  I do not believe there is anything one can gainsay or take from that argument.</P>
    <P>If you are talking about providing a comprehensive system, a real system, in which people can gain access to justice, you must provide a nationwide system. Fifteen law centres, whether they are community or legal aid or advice or whatever type centres, scattered around the country here and there will not provide that service.  It is something like the Landlord and Tenant Bill that promised to abolish ground rents; it will be another month before we see the results of that.  It is paying lip service to it, it is saying: &ldquo;we have a system of legal aid, and therefore we need not bother our consciences about it any more&rdquo;.  You may have a system but you are not providing a system whereby the people can gain access to justice.  I believe that is the only criterion by which one can judge the effectiveness of the proposed system.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson dealt fairly extensively with the necessity to provide community law centres as opposed to legal aid and advice centres.  This is very important. Le us consider not only the experience of the Coolock Community Law Centre but the experience of FLAC.  They were originally set up to bring pressure to bear on the Government to introduce a comprehensive system, to provide some form of interim service and also&mdash;and this is the point that is important&mdash;to advise on areas of law requiring reform.  The experience of the students in the free legal advice centres has caused massive changes not only in the way they now operate the free legal advice centres in the advent and development of the Coolock Community Law Centre, but in some other <Col N="481" /> areas.  I believe they have had a very substantial impact on the reforms that have taken place in our family laws.  I believe, for example, that they have been major contributors to the new solicitor's course, which I know has been criticised, but which so far as its content is concerned, is far more socially concerned and socially aware than any law course or law curricula has ever been.</P>
    <P>The other point to be considered, and again Senator Robinson touched on this, is the question of helping people to help themselves.  I know, from my own experience in FLAC, that many people assisted in one case could understand and help themselves in the future, for example, in the whole question of family law related cases.  Students found it extremely difficult to deal with them at the beginning because their courses did not have any content related to family law, except in so far as property and succession rights were concerned.  But having had a year's or two years' experience part-time in FLAC, they were not only able to deal with matters themselves, but were literally able to advise professional solicitors who attended to assist at the centres as to how those matters might be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but community law centres, properly set up, would make the job of solicitors within those centres easier.  I believe people who are not qualified solicitors could help in cases and help resolve them.  I believe also, as Senator Robinson said, that the people requiring legal aid would learn to help themselves in certain type cases that are common in the distressed areas of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I regret that the proposed law centres will not be community law centres as was envisaged by the Pringle Report.  I accept the Government's position that it is difficult to introduce a system but they appear to have put their heads in the sand and to have chosen to ignore the experience of other countries.  They should have taken the advice given in the Pringle Report.  That was not the advice of people who just sat around a table and discussed the matter amongst themselves.  They sought knowledge of experience in other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> It is clear that the best law centre is the community law centre.  It is also clear that the best way of providing people in cities and densely populated urban areas, in particular, is through community law centres.  On page 88 of the Pringle Report, there is reference to a report of J.A. Green and E.S. Green, &ldquo;The Legal profession and the process of Social Change: Legal services in England and the United States&rdquo;, in which they report:</P>
    <P>In a neighbourhood law office, the full-time staff lawyer is given the opportunity to develop an expertise at handling problems unique to the poor. He is likely to develop, if he does not already have, a sympathy for the legal difficulties and personal ambitions of poor people.  His consequent political interest is a manifestation of the same kind of identity that the corporate lawyer obtains from social intercourse with executive clientele.  A lawyer does not see himself as one who represents just any person with any problem; he often sees himself as an advocate for, and in this sense, representative of the group that his practice serves.</P>
    <P>That is the greatest case that can be made for community law centres.  If we have advice centres that simply pump out legal advice to somebody who is given the licence of the Government to call to one of these centres, we are not servicing the people in the manner in which we think we are by providing a legal aid system.  If the purpose of it is to enable people to have access to justice, we are not going about this in the right way.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a problem in establishing a great number of these centres but I see no reason why, even on the basis proposed by the Government, the 15 centres now envisaged could not be staffed with additional staff and be given the resources to act as community law centres rather than as legal aid advice centres.  I believe if that were done it would be to the betterment, not only of giving people access to justice, but to the more efficient running of a legal aid system itself.  After that it is <Col N="483" /> most important that private practitioners are used throughout the country on a panel basis.  Any solicitor who is prepared to volunteer his services for this should be put on that panel and it should be used.  There may be areas where solicitors are not inclined to go on the panel but I believe that if the system were properly run they would go on the panel.  They did not go on the criminal legal aid panel to start with because it was not properly run.  Since the beginning of this year changes have been brought about that have literally drawn solicitors from towns, and in some instances counties, that were not on it because it is now a system that can be operated at no extra cost to the Exchequer. Therefore, if we provide a panel system that can run along with the community law centres that have been proposed by the Pringle Report we will go some way to solving the problem.</P>
    <P>I am in this difficulty that I do not know how this is going to work; I do not know how it is going to be set up.  I doubt very much that an independent board to administer it can be established without some form of legislation.  I would regret that it could happen without some form of legislation. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on this.</P>
    <P>I would like to say in a general way that I regret it has taken us so long to come this far.  This is a matter which cannot be laid solely at the door of the Government.  It goes back through successive governments who overlooked dealing with this problem, shelved it, delayed it and so on.  I would regret it if this Government were to feel that by providing the service they now propose to provide, they are going to solve the problem.  It will be a matter of considerable regret, because as I understand it two things are going to happen: this scheme will be introduced, inadequate as it is, and at that stage the grant to the free legal advice centres would be suspended.  If that happens there will be a worse service in this city for people in need of legal aid and advice than there is at the moment.  It is a pity that that should be the case.  If the intention is to work this through administrative channels, <Col N="484" /> to establish it and see how it works and to keep it flexible so that it can be changed this way or that way I would ask the Minister, while such experimentation goes on at least not to throw away the free legal advice centres as they presently stand.  If their grant is withdrawn, it is almost inevitable that they will close down.  With the administrative load that those centres have on their backs at the moment they could not possibly continue to operate without being grant-aided.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind and I look forward with interest to see what his exposition of this new scheme will be because it is very hard to talk about something when one does not really know exactly what one is talking about.</P>

      <P>The function of legal aid surely is to ensure that the law is administered fully and without discrimination. The provision of legal aid does not mean the provision of an open sesame to justice.  It means the provision of equal access to the legal system.  I know that in saying that I am taking a much narrower view of the function of legal aid than the previous speaker did.  But equality of access to any social legislation is a fundamental right whether it is access to education or to health and social welfare services or, in this case, access to the law.</P>
      <P>In the area of social legislation legal aid has become, to quote the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Finaly, not only a desirable social objective but a necessity.  No one would wish to argue or disagree with that.</P>
      <P>The first difficulty that I see in the successful operation of a legal aid scheme is to make the law acceptable in areas of social deprivation where the attitude that the law is neither relevant nor acceptable is common.  This problem of alienation is the subject of comment in the report of the Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice which notes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underprivileged often see the law as an instrument of oppression rather than a statement of rights.  One law for the rich and one for the poor is <Col N="485" /> an attitude which will persist as long as there is discrimination in the administration of the law.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty that I see is that legal aid without reform of the law, particularly reform of certain aspects of family law, would not in itself benefit many poor people who have legal problems in this area.  The high rate of marital breakdowns is a problem which needs attention urgently, and not merely in the legal sense.  For many women in this situation the law is the last resort. Legal aid, therefore, is ineffective as a social service unless it is backed up by a comprehensive system of other social services such as information, advice and counselling.</P>
    <P>After all a marriage does not break down overnight.  One does not wake up one morning and look at one's husband and decide that one cannot live with him any longer.  It takes quite a period for this to happen, just the same as a husband does not become a wife-beater overnight.  We should look at this in the broader social sense rather than in the narrow legal sense.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Robinson in asking the Minister if he would elaborate on the situation in which a married woman would be assessed for legal aid if, for example, her husband has an adverse interest in her having access to the courts. If their joint income is over the limit of eligibility, is she entitled to be considered for free legal aid?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision as it was set out in their press release to set up law centres to administer the scheme.  It would not be fitting to talk about any law centre without acknowledging the pioneer work that has been done by FLAC in this field.  I feel sure that the experience of this voluntary organisation of dedicated young people will be of enormous benefit in the organisation and the running of the proposed legal aid centres.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice also recommended that any such centres should employ one professional social worker and that lawyers on the staff should be <Col N="486" /> trained in welfare legislation.  I am not competent to comment on legal training but I would welcome an assurance from those Members of the House who may know if our law schools are providing such training.</P>
    <P>One of the most useful functions of the proposed legal aid centres would be in identifying hidden need and providing the necessary feedback to the Law Reform Commission.  I would expect that they would see this as part of their function to do this.</P>
    <P>While I note what the Government have said about areas to be excluded from the proposed scheme, I feel that in this area of unmet need we might well in the future find ourselves in a similar situation to the present British one where it has been found that industrial tribunals have created a whole new field of highly technical law where usually employers were legally represented while claimants were not and it was found necessary to extend legal aid to include proceedings in the new employment appeal tribunal established under the Employment Protection Act, 1975.</P>
    <P>The final difficulty that one sees in implementing an efficient and satisfactory scheme is the cost.  Here we might usefully look at the British experience.  In the 25 years or so since legal aid was introduced in Britain in the 1950s, its progress has been described as disappointing. The 25th Legal Aid Annual Report of 1974 and 1975 notes that schemes have been hamstrung by financial stringency and are now fast being emasculated by inflation.  There is urgent requirement to restructure the financial basis for the schemes as the legal rights of many people are continuing to go by default.  The percentage in Britain of married couples with children who qualified on income grounds for legal aid has fallen from 64 per cent of the population in 1954 to 25 per cent in 1974.</P>
    <P>A study published in 1975 called &ldquo;Legal Services in Birmingham&rdquo; and published by the Institute of Judicial Administration makes the point when it concludes that the last seven years have seen the development in the United Kingdom of a major movement to meet the needs of the deprived which involves <Col N="487" /> lawyers, administrators, social workers and community workers and that unless government funds are released soon to realise some of the objectives of that movement it will dissolve in disillusionment. I would hope that we would try to avoid a similar experience.</P>
    <P>The need, therefore, is for a speedy, efficient and essentially a flexible system. This can be best provided for in the scheme which has been outlined by the Government.  Legislation at this stage would mean delay in implementing what we are all agreed is an urgent social necessity and would restrict unnecessarily the development of the scheme and impair its flexibility and flexibility is a most necessary ingredient in a legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in welcoming the Government's decision to introduce the legal aid scheme in the manner which they have indicated.  I think the proposals are broad and generous and I hope the scheme will have the success it merits.</P>

      <P>The Pringle Committee made a recommendation as far back as December 1977.  It was a bit disturbing that we did not learn of the Government's attitude to it until the press release of May of this year.  Nevertheless, it is encouraging that at least there was some indication in the press release by the Government as to where they stand on the matter.  It is also a bit disturbing to think that in such an area, despite the fact that there was great stress and great difficulty amongst people who needed legal aid, it would take so long to introduce a comprehensive civil legal aid system.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that, through the various submissions, the tone of this debate and of other areas of dialogue, including the Pringle Report, there is no question but that a case has been made for introducting civil legal aid.  It is a question now of whether or not to accept a particular type of scheme.  It is crucial that the type of scheme we set up will be beneficial.</P>
      <P>Other Senators have addressed themselves to some inadequacies in that area so I am not going to develop that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> But from reading the press statement it seems that what we are really getting is an administrative situation.  I do not know if that is what the Pringle Report is all about.  I know that some people who have studied the report, including the ICTU, consider that the minimum needed to extend the availability of legal services are the recommendations in the Pringle Report. Any diminution of that would indicate, to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at least, that the whole question of dealing with the implementation of a comprehensive civil legal aid and advice scheme is not being tackled correctly.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the point that has been raised by other Senators and by the press statement.  What is really happening is that there is going to be an administrative system rather than a more professional approach with proper bodies and adequate means of communication and professional lawyers available and ready when the most deserving cases came before them.</P>
    <P>The Pringle Report does satisfy a section of the population but it cannot satisfy many of our problems because of the cost factor.  I know that there was mention of a disposable income limit in the press statement but I am not quite clear about it because it is merely a press statement.  I am not too sure whether a medical card holder or people in receipt of certain social welfare benefits are covered by the Pringle Report or whether the Government have looked at this side of it.  Social welfare recipients may also have legal problems that they need to solve and may not have any disposable income, so it is not clear to me what their position is.  Perhaps the Minister might cover that point.  It could be an oversight on my part but it does not seem to come across very clearly.</P>
    <P>The statement, to some extent, has dealt with the test for financial eligibility but I am not so sure whether I fully understand what the position would be with regard to certain contributions, and so on, towards the service.  That brings me back to the medical card holders. Could they meet the requirements set out in the Government's statement?  If they can, in what way?  If they cannot how can we call the scheme comprehensive? <Col N="489" /> On the other hand, the question of the contribution that people in this area would have to make should be made clear.  I do not think such people should be asked for a contribution but if they are asked to pay some contribution it should not be done in such a way as to deter people receiving certain types of social welfare from using the scheme.</P>
    <P>I made my notes before I read the press statement and one of the questions I was about to ask was should we not be dealing with a level of disposable income? In fairness, the press statement answers that question to some extent.  I am not quite clear whether there is something that would satisfy the social welfare recipients or whether there is some graduation where people might be a little better off in other areas of social welfare.</P>
    <P>The question of £15 worth of advice in the report was an amusing one.  In Britain when they first introduced this in 1974 the amount was £25 worth of advice. It was called the English green scheme.  Even that was found to be inadequate after a full test.  It is amusing to see, in this day and age, people with serious legal difficulties and who have no money, being deterred from pursuing their legal rights by being offered £15 worth of advice.  I know this £15 is not meant to carry them through all situations but what is it meant to do?  Is the idea to try to get the best deal one can for that £15?  Even though one has a case in law should anything go wrong does one have to shoulder any costs over and above the £15?</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of community law centres I agree that they should be established on a wholetime basis.  One of the concerns is will they really be community law centres?  Will they be located geographically so that they will not lose the community content? Community situations can only be dealt with if one is in a position to study the entire area and if the people can communicate in a community spirit and address themselves to such areas.  If they are not set out in that way, the whole idea of community law centres is nullified to a great extent.</P>
    <P>Having read the report I felt the people <Col N="490" /> in the local community should be given a substantial amount of responsibility. This seems to be the kind of development we have in the country. Communities are growing up all over the place.  People want to become democratised to run their own affairs.  I do not think it was intended in the Pringle Report, but do the Government intend to give the running of these centres to suitable people in the community?</P>
    <P>I am not in agreement with the idea of an interim scheme.  Even though they were given certain terms of reference, I believe they dealt with it reluctantly.  The Pringle Committee, as requested in its terms of reference, outlined an interim scheme for civil legal aid and advice. Although the committee dealt with an interim scheme it is clear from its report that it did so reluctantly.  The committee's reluctance can be seen in paragraph 262 which states:</P>
    <P>We are nevertheless inclined from the beginning to agree with those who said that it was impossible to establish legal aid priorities by reference to category of case.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 271 states:</P>
    <P>As we do not consider that any particular category of case is more deserving of inclusion in a comprehensive legal aid scheme than any other, we do not consider that it would be desirable even as an interim measure to confine legal aid to any particular case categories.</P>
    <P>It seems that the restrictive nature of the interim scheme as outlined in the Pringle report would not answer the demands that exist for legal aid and assistance.  It seems also that the introduction of an interim scheme would create unnecessary distress and confusion for those who may not have been eligible under the terms of the report.  Whether that is altered by Government interference or not I do not know.</P>
    <P>I, as a trade unionist dealing with a lot of problems of this nature, would not be in favour of the introduction of an interim scheme and would always be agitating for the introduction of a comprehensive <Col N="491" /> civil legal aid and advice scheme.  I see that as a matter of urgency.  All we have to do is to sit in any of our own advice centres which are not strictly dealing with the questions of law to see the type of problems that come up there and how the people are deterred from actually pursuing their legal rights because of all the impediments that are put in their way, by and large, as a result of financial restrictions. It seems to me that the statement of the Government does not accept the idea of a fully comprehensive civil legal and advice scheme.  We are at a stage where that can no longer be denied to the people. I certainly would be an advocate of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Government on the intended introduction of a civil legal aid system, limited though it may be.  At long last we have actually got something.  Governments have come and gone during the very long and weary struggle to arrive even at this point but we have arrived.  It seems a long time since 1974 when the Pringle Committee was established.  Of course the real congratulations are due to people like Josie Airey and to the hundreds of young people who devoted their free days and nights to helping the casualties of society and the poor of our cities who found themselves face to face with the law and unable to avail of it.  They found themselves facing the fundamental defect of our legal system, which was the absence of a comprehensive state system of free legal aid and advice.  This system that we are talking about now does not seem to meet that criterion of being a comprehensive state system of free legal aid and advice.  It is, however, a beginning. Senators on this side of the House have indicated that they see it as no more than a beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that the young people of FLAC and the young solicitors and barristers who helped them showed an amazing degree of social commitment which is inspiring. They are torch bearers in a society which often automatically condemns young people and, in particular, young <Col N="492" /> university students.  It condemns them often as being parasitical and layabouts. It must have seemed to those young people over the years and to the clients that they helped for so long that politicians were in fact the layabouts and the parasites for failing to see well-established and well-documented need, and continuing to fail until international pressure joined domestic pressure and finally got a beginning.  A group who played some part in arriving at this point was the AIM group who worked so hard over the years to help so many women in family situations and marital breakdown situations.  They were never in any doubt about the importance and the urgency of introducing a civil legal aid system.  As late as the autumn last year they welcomed the very considerable advances that have been made in family law but stated that such improvements without free access to the law were &ldquo;like offering a fortnight's holiday in the Bahamas without the air fare&rdquo;.  It is an amusing simile but unfortunately it is difficult to agree with it because the present intricacies and inadequacies of family law in Ireland do not resemble any kind of a balmy paradise.  Even though the State now apparently intends to offer some part of the air fare to some of the people, the destination remains very unattractive.</P>
    <P>The contention that the legal system is very intricate and also very inadequate is borne out by several reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure among a multitude of other reports and statements.  It is quite obvious that radical reforms are needed in the court system and a critical look taken at the whole system.  This introduction of civil legal aid, limited as it is, will obviously add to the already overburdened court system.  It seems that it is going to be absolutely necessary to take a major look at the whole system of the operation of our courts.  Otherwise, I am told, the thing may grind to a halt or at least operate so badly that it would amount to having a totally inadequate legal system. It would be useless to most people.</P>
    <P>An aspect of this scheme that I would like to mention is that it has often been supposed that a possibility exists for a <Col N="493" /> real flood of marital breakdown cases to erupt once a nationwide system of civil legal aid and advice comes into being.  I believe that this is a real possibility and that, in fact, we may find ourselves having to face the problem which we have continued to sweep under the carpet, and that is the problem of the constitutional ban on divorce.  Already we know that the largest single number of cases dealt with by the free legal advice centres have been those involving marital breakdown and have been those brought to them by women.  Women bring 90 per cent of the marital cases presently before the courts, and women, of course, are those who should be among the main beneficiaries of a civil legal aid system.  I would like to add my query to the other Senators who have asked what exactly is the position of a married woman who wishes to benefit from this system but whose husband's disposable income is above that limit.  As you know it is a moot point.  What are her rights, if any, to his income?  I think that is something that will have to be clarified quite quickly.</P>
    <P>To get back to the area of what this new system may reveal and may bring to our attention, women, as it is becoming obvious, are less and less willing to remain in unhappy or violent marriage situations.  I do not believe that marital breakdowns are on the increase; I just believe that we are seeing the reality now as we never saw the reality before.  We have a situation where the Catholic Church is giving what it considers some relief in some cases but the State has even been unable to discuss the problem and we have irregularities, the traditional blind eye being turned to the problem and the fervent hope apparently that if we do nothing the problem may go away.</P>
    <P>I believe that this area of family law will be brought very much to the fore if we get a decent system of legal aid in this country.  I hope that the short and inadequate press release which we saw in the newspapers represents only a beginning, but I would say that I would doubly welcome any system of civil legal aid if a side effect of that system was the beginning of a debate on the whole attitude <Col N="494" /> of this country towards the marriage situation and towards the constitutional ban on divorce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

      <P>Equality before the law is in theory a bed-rock principle of western democracy, and our particular Irish version of that, the Irish cliche, is &ldquo;cherishing all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.  The gap between lip service and reality is a vast one.  We might adopt Rousseau's maxim and say &ldquo;men are equal before the law&rdquo; and yet everywhere we find that men are unequally treated before the law.  Such reluctant concessions as have been forthcoming or are now forthcoming from our Government in these matters are forced from them only by the persistent planner or zealous reform groups.  Like other Senators here I would like to give praise to the free legal aid people whose pioneering activities have compelled us, belatedly, to realise the needs of the citizens they have served so well over these last years.  Legal aid in civil cases is but an entrance step in a process which will be complete only with the radical overhaul of our whole legal code and its recasting in favour of all the people, and not simply in the interests of the privileged, property owning and knowledgeable few.  I do not shrink from the proposition that law reform at the end of the day will be nothing less than law revolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pringle Report and the proposed Government scheme are both in agreement that there is a need for civil legal aid and advice.  The questions is, and Pringle is not entirely conclusive about this, what are the various dimensions of the need, how can we define the need, how can we best answer the need?  To my mind the advice aspect is no less important, in that people need in the first place to be educated to an awareness of their rights.  &ldquo;Know your wrongs&rdquo; was Daniel O'Connell's constant injunction to his followers.  There is a tendency in certain high quarters to frown on the agitator.  They regard him as a nuisance at best or malcontent or subversive at worst.  In the context of the turbulence of the last ten years, in the context of security imperatives, that tendency to regard the civil rights agitator as a <Col N="495" /> nuisance is perhaps understandable, but could it be that those who benefit by the legal <i>status quo</i> have the more fundamental fear that the citizens discovery of their legal rights may ultimately have far-reaching legal and social consequences? In short, it is the fear that the sleeping giant may awaken.</P>
    <P>The advice aspect of legal aid is essentially an educational process.  Pringle recognises the need for people to be informed: information about enlightenment and liberation from that timidity, that mixture of intimidation and awe which the law in its pseudomajesty evokes from the poor and ignorant.  One of the factors that stand between the humble citizen and the pursuit of justice is the mystique with which the law continues to surround itself&mdash;the archaic rituals in our courts, the flummery of wig and gown, the esoteric jargon of legal practitioners.  It is to be hoped that the educational process to be carried out by community law centres will include the inculcation of a healthy irreverence for the quasi-ecclesiastical ambience of our courts of justice.  At any rate, the raising of the level of the citizens' awareness of their rights must be a prime objective of law reform and a vital task for community legal centres if they are indeed to serve the community in any real sense.</P>
    <P>The whole point of law reform it seems to me if the equality of citizens before the law is to be promoted is to extend to the poor and ignorant what the rich and sophisticated have always enjoyed. <i>Inter alia</i>, this includes ready and confident access to professional legal advice and expertise in matters of social as well as of individual concern.  If, for example, a threat arises to the amenities of what the auctioneers call &ldquo;a desirable residential area&rdquo;, if, to be specific, a rubbish dump or a highway development were proposed for the Rochestown Road in Cork, an eventuality the unlikelihood of which is in itself highly significant, concerted community action would be facilitated by money, education and the self-assurance of a well-to-do class.  In all probability such a fortunate community would include residents <Col N="496" /> who belong to the legal profession. If, on the other hand, a similar hazard were to face the denizens of a working class area, or more precisely, a workless class area, like Churchfield in Cork City's north side, an area already greatly disadvantaged by geographical segregation, then the response would be sadly different.  The likelihood is that there would be no response from a financially and educationally deprived area, from people who are accustomed to see the law as irrelevant if not as a hostile force in their lives.  But the contrast is even greater when the problems are individual rather than corporate.  The poor and ignorant tend to have far more problems of broken marriages, desertion, child custody, and are infinitely more bewildered by them and are incapable of dealing with them than are the rich.</P>
    <P>Nothwithstanding the curious minority report in Pringle, there is a consensus among all those at all concerned with social justice that the need for civil legal aid is incontrovertible.  Legal aid and advice is not a luxury commodity like continental holidays or a yacht in Crosshaven.  As much as health care or social welfare, it is what the State is morally obliged to provide for its poorer and weaker citizens.  Like all public services it will cost money, probably a great deal of money.  My colleagues in the legal field tell me that the £2 million per annum envisaged by Pringle for the comprehensive scheme was at the time of its publication even an unrealistically low estimate.</P>
    <P>Despite the application of merit assessments there will undoubtedly be an increase in litigation and, to say the least, the legal profession will not be any the poorer by the introduction of the scheme.  Yet there is no cheap way of doing the thing properly, and at least solicitors will have to show results and the merits of bringing or defending a case will have to be established.  If despite all safeguards and precautions abuses do occur, it is better to tolerate frivolity and abuse rather than ignore and suppress grievances.  It is infinitely more preferable that there should be marginal abuse rather than that the socially, financially and educationally <Col N="497" /> unprivileged should continue to see the law and justice as alien and hostile concepts and the protective barricade with which the rich defend their privileges.</P>
    <P>The legal profession itself, of course, should keep a sharp eye out for those of its members whose object would be to cash in on the scheme, and the profession should discipline them accordingly. More generally, any scheme of free legal aid and advice will place great demands on the existing legal system, which will have to make an adequate response.  If the operation of the scheme shows up the inadequacies of the existing system, so much the better in the long run.  Incidentally, is it not a paradox that the Law Society should be proposing to restrict entry to the profession at this time when, as Pringle points out, the scheme will certainly necessitate an increase in the supply of young solicitors and indeed when the scheme may be at risk because, as Pringle says of the non-availability of solicitors?</P>
    <P>It is good to see the Pringle Report recommending a choice of solicitors and counsel.  Without the right of access to the profession, the unprivileged citizen would find the community law centres in themselves inadequate to his needs.  Only the right of access, only the right of choice, will properly protect the dignity and independence of the citizen and the confidentiality of the proceedings.  The one thing that must be avoided, as Pringle is quick to suggest, is any suggestion of a legal counterpart of the old degrading dispensary doctor system. Besides, the private legal practitioner who participates in the scheme but whose main income comes from other areas in his practice is less likely to be under pressure than the solicitors of the community law centres when it comes to actions which could be potentially embarrassing to governments, actions, for example, showing up constitutional defects.</P>
    <P>As other Senators have indicated, the bulletin issued by the Government Information Services on 2 May was disappointing in its brevity.  One is not clear to what extent the Pringle recommendations are to be incorporated in the scheme.  Apparently actions for defamation <Col N="498" /> of character are to be excluded from the scheme, although Pringle rightly points out that a poor man's good name is as important as that of the rich man. Press reports, for example, <i>The Irish Times</i> on the day after the Minister's statement, gave more details, though yet it is not clear how far these are taken direct from the Pringle Report.  The Government handout, for example, does not mention community law centres at all, though <i>The Irish Times</i> state that there are to be 15 throughout the State. Pringle specifically suggests two in Dublin, one each in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Certainly anyone who knows Cork City and its social topography will agree that a more realistic suggestion would be two centres on the north side and one on the south side.</P>
    <P>Pringle is admittedly sound in its emphasis on the importance of the location of the centres.  They should be in central, easily accessible places and there should be maximum contact and communication between the staff and local residents.  Pringle is open to the suggestion that centres might extend organically out of successful existing social community associations.  Unless there is real inter-action with the local community, unless solicitors work in cooperation with social workers and people from other related disciplines, and unless the proposed centres are situated <i>in medias res</i>, the danger is that they will defeat the whole purpose of the scheme by being seen as impersonal, out-of-town solicitors' offices, a sort of law shop or legal supermarket.  Again it is essential that the centres should operate outside conventional nine to five office hours.  A real involvement in community needs on the part of the staff suggests that the community has to have access to the centres in the evening.  Apart from the fact that many workers will have difficulty in coming to the centres during the day, the presence of solicitors in the centres at evening hours would demonstrate the real interest of the profession and so help to counteract that psychological block which Pringle notes on the part of the socially underprivileged towards the whole process of law.  Properly worked on a team basis there is no reason to suppose that this <Col N="499" /> after-hours involvement would be unduly inconvenient or expensive.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is in the evenings that the centres could best carry out one of their vital tasks&mdash;Pringle speaks of the importance of programmes of education on legal rights.  Here one envisages a regular programme of lectures on the citizen and his legal rights.  The motion before the House is properly concerned that the proposed scheme is to be by way of administrative action initially and is not to be the subject of legislation.  This is all the more remarkable in that Pringle itself assumes that legislation is the natural way to bring in the scheme and even suggests the heads of a legal aid Bill as an appendix.  A spokesperson for the free legal aid people welcoming the Government statement expressed the hope that the scheme would be put on a firm legislative basis with all possible haste.</P>
    <P>One cannot conclude without complimenting the Pringle Committee on an exhaustive, sensible and humane document, lucid, even stylish in presentation, and massively free from that impenetrable jargon which all professions, and particularly the law, tend to use as a prop to their mystique.  Once again, all credit to the FLAC people and those other publicly-spirited citizens who have tried to bring nearer the day when all citizens will have equality before the law and equal access to the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the various contributions made on this very important subject and I am grateful to Senator Robinson and Senator Molony for their contributions, however critical.  That is what democracy is all about.  I am glad, too, that other Senators saw fit to contribute on this very important subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal generally with the motion before the House and then deal specifically with the various contributions made by the Senators.  I think I should begin where Senator John Murphy left off by, like him, paying tribute to the Pringle Committee and expressing my appreciation of the excellent work done by it.  The committee was <Col N="500" /> under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Pringle.  It was set up in June of 1974 to advise on the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice on civil matters.</P>
    <P>It is proper for the record of the Oireachtas that we should have on that record the names of the members of the committee in addition to the Chairman, Mr. Justice Pringle.  The other members of the committee, to whom we are most grateful and appreciative, were Mr. Thomas G. Crotty, County Registrar, Kilkenny; Mr. Brian M. Gallagher, solicitor and former chairman of FLAC; the Honourable Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton; Mr. James J. Ivers, Director General of the Incorporated Law Society; Mr. Eunan McCarron, solicitor; Mr. T. Browne, representing the Department of Social Welfare; Mr. C.K. McGrath, representing the Department of Finance; Mr. J.C. McMahon, representing the Department of the Public Service and Mr. Pearse Rayel, representing the Department of Justice. They are the men who have contributed so much, representing the broad spectrum of the legal profession in addition to people who have a special expertise from the Government Departments named.</P>
    <P>The task assigned to the committee was a very difficult and onerous one. That is evidenced by the fact that the committee itself, including its subcommittees, held more than 100 meetings.  This was a wonderful piece of work by these men, giving their time on a voluntary basis.  In December 1977 the committee submitted their report, which was long and detailed, to the Minister for Justice and, in fairness to both the Minister and his Department, no time was lost in having it examined with a view to submitting proposals to the Government on the matter.  The Government published their proposals on 2 May for the introduction by the Minister for Justice of a scheme of legal aid and advice based generally on the comprehensive scheme outlined by the Pringle Committee.  The aim of the Government as announced on 2 May remains the same, to have this scheme introduced by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> Tributes were paid to FLAC.  I publicly paid tribute to FLAC in the media, and once more we should do that. I should like to be associated with the tributes paid to that organisation.  I do not think we can underestimate or in any way under-value the contribution made to the community by young people with a social conscience be they young solicitors, young barristers or whatever other discipline they may have been involved in.  Their contribution to the community through that estimable organisation cannot be denied.  No praise is high enough for them.</P>
    <P>The motion in the names of Senator Cooney and Senator Molony was, I understand, on the Order Paper before the recent Government announcement about the introduction of a civil legal aid and advice scheme.  However, in the light of the Government announcement, this particular motion, as I see it, has been overtaken by events.  I propose to concentrate for the most part, therefore, on the motion proposed by Senator Robinson and seconded by Senator Molony.  Before I make any specific comments on either motion I think I should say by way of general comment on both that there may appear to be a slight contradiction between the two motions. One motion calls for the introduction of civil legal aid, &ldquo;as a matter of urgency&rdquo;.  The Government's appreciation of the urgency of the matter was one of the reasons for their decision to introduce the scheme on an administrative basis.  However, the other motion calls for the introduction of the scheme on a statutory basis.  It is a legislative basis which is not compatible with the idea of introducing something quickly.  With respect we say this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain that in my speech.  I think I will have convinced the Senator by the end of my contribution that an administrative scheme will give us the opportunity to introduce the scheme quickly and to see how it works. This is in no way to suggest that the scheme will not be enshrined in legislation. What we want to do is to introduce <Col N="502" /> this scheme administratively to give us the opportunity to introduce it quickly. The Senator is as long in Oireachtas Éireann as myself and she knows how slow the legislative process can be; in addition to the availability of the Oireachtas there is also the question of the introduction of the scheme in a legislative form, the introduction of regulations under the scheme and so on. This takes time.  I have only got to point to the British scheme, a copy of which I have here, <i>The Legal Aid Handbook for 1976</i>.  That is a considerable tome.  That is the sort of scheme we would have to introduce legislatively.  I hesitate to say that that scheme could be introduced by the end of the year: in fact, I doubt very much if it could be introduced by the end of 1980.  That is the problem with which we are confronted.  That is basically the reason&mdash;and I would ask the Senators to accept that&mdash;we are introducing the scheme on an administrative basis in the first instance.  By doing this it will give us the opportunity to see how the scheme works and as it develops over a period of two or three years to change the scheme rather than have to come back to both Houses of the Oireachtas to look for amendments to existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other reasons for the introduction of the scheme on an administrative basis.  It could be reasonably inferred from the terms of the motion by Senator Robinson and Senator Keating that the decision to introduce the scheme on an administrative basis was intended somehow to deny citizens rights which would be secured if the scheme was introduced on a statutory or legislative basis.  I do not suggest that this implication was intended but simply that that inference could be reasonably drawn. There is no basis for it whatever.  The Government announcement of 2 May made it quite clear that the intention is that the scheme should be introduced initially on an administrative basis.  It is not the intention that it should always remain on an administrative basis and there is no question, therefore, of trying to deny rights which could be secured by statute.  I believe the citizens' rights will be secured very securely and firmly by this administrative scheme.  However, if the Senator feels that that does not <Col N="503" /> measure up, then I can assure her and others who question the introduction of the scheme on an administrative basis that in time it will be enshrined in legislation. They will see then that these rights are secured.</P>
    <P>Apart from the need to get the scheme into operation as quickly as possible the case for beginning, and I stress beginning, with an administrative scheme is clear.  This is a new social service and I am sure it will be generally conceded that it is essential in introducing any such service to adopt a flexible approach; in other words, to begin with a set of rules which can be quickly and easily altered if, in the light of experience, it appears that alteration is needed.  It would be unwise to attempt to put the scheme on a statutory basis from the beginning because it is not possible to say how a scheme based on the idea of centres staffed by salaried lawyers will work in practice.  In my view it is better to begin with a framework which will be fully responsive to the practical demands of such a system than to impose a statutory framework from the outset based on assumptions which may be invalid.  The design of legislation should, if possible, be left to a later stage when some experience has been gained in the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>What we are asking is, for God's sake and for the sake of those people on whose behalf this scheme is being introduced to give it a chance on an administrative basis.  Give it a chance.  Let us see how it works.  We have been without a scheme for many years.  Is two or three more years to have this scheme on an administrative basis too much to ask?</P>
    <P>All the Government are asking is, give us two or three years to see how the scheme operates on an administrative basis, then we will have a look at the possibility of having it put into legislative form.  I do not think that is an unreasonable request.  Those people who are critical because it is not being put into legislation immediately might ponder on that point.  Of course, criticise the introduction of the scheme on an administrative basis.  That is what <Col N="504" /> democracy is all about, but be fair and just about it.  Apart from the need to get the scheme into operation as quickly as possible the case for beginning, and I stress beginning, with this administrative scheme is quite clear.  I do not want to enter into an area of acrimony if I can avoid it.  If I am looking for a fair trial for the scheme then I have to be fair to those people who criticise it.</P>
    <P>The terms of the motion by Senators Robinson and Keating imply that the Government's decision to introduce the scheme on an administrative basis is motivated by a desire to avoid discussion on this issue.  There is no reason why the Government would wish to avoid discussion on this particular matter; the Government itself, in its manifesto, mentioned it.  The Government is now giving the Seanad an opportunity to discuss it.  There has been a wide ranging discussion since the Pringle Committee reported in December 1977. People from organisations throughout the community, in one way or another, have put their point of view forward since that time; we are discussing it now in the Seanad.  It was discussed quite considerably on television and on the radio.  There is no attempt to stifle discussion or debate on this particular subject.</P>
    <P>The decision to commit substantial public resources, which are scarce, towards civil legal aid was not an easy one, and one which necessarily involved a very careful assessment of various options. The Government has now decided to introduce a comprehensive scheme and there is no need to avoid discussion. Both the Minister and myself have had discussions about the scheme with a number of interested organisations.  In the space of three days, I met 14 separate organisations, on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  That is an ascertainable fact; it is on record.  In addition, the Minister met organisations.  There was a wide ranging discussion with these groups on points of view which, whilst we listened to them, were not necessarily acceptable to us; we were not afraid to meet and discuss the matter with these organisations.  To be fair to these organisations, subsequent to the announcement <Col N="505" /> by the Government on the scheme on 2 May, there was a general air of acceptance by them of the Government scheme, with very little criticism.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Government's election manifesto.  The Government has gone well beyond its manifesto commitment which was&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Legal aid will be extended to civil cases where this is necessary; as a first step it will be introduced in the area of family law,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The scheme will not be confined to family law cases, nor will it be confined to three categories of cases recommended by the Pringle Committee for the purposes of an interim scheme, which we are talking about here.  These were family law, landlord and tenant, and consumer protection cases.</P>
    <P>The scheme, is based on recommendations in the Pringle Report for a comprehensive scheme.  There are certain modifications, we admit.  For example, although legal aid will be available for practically all types of cases, the Government have decided that there should be certain exclusions.  It would be an unjustifiably wide interpretation of the term &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; in the legal aid context to hold that the scheme should allow for no exclusions whatsoever. Exclusions are common to legal aid schemes applying in other countries which do not have the same limitations of resources as we have.  The British scheme, which has been described by the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee on legal aid as &ldquo;comprehensive by international standards&rdquo;, contains quite a few exclusions.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that certain case categories should be excluded, on the ground that the expenditure of public money on such cases could not be justified because the availability of legal aid could encourage litigation unnecessarily.  Examples are defamation proceedings and breach of promise actions.  Other cases are to be excluded on the basis that legal aid is considered unneccessary&mdash;examples being what the Pringle Committee would <Col N="506" /> describe as &ldquo;insurance-covered&rdquo; cases and cases being heard by tribunals. What I have in mind here are mainly running-down actions, were a defendant is insured and the plaintiff with reasonably good prospects of success has no difficulty in securing the services of a private practitioner, in the anticipation that costs, eventually, will be met by the insurance company.  There could, of course, be cases where an eligible person would fail to secure the services of a private practitioner, even if he or she had a good case, and even if the injury done appeared to be one which was insured against.  A person in that rare situation could apply for legal aid under this scheme.  This is a very equitable scheme. It is motivated by a will to give the people justice.</P>
    <P>In the context of exclusion, the decision which attracted most attention is the decision that legal aid should not extend to tribunal proceedings.  The reasons for excluding tribunals is simply that legal aid is considered to be unnecessary, because, broadly speaking, the procedures already outlined in the various statutes under which these tribunals have been established have been drawn up so as to render it unnecessary for persons appearing before them to have legal representation. Tribunals are intended to provide simplified and inexpensive procedures, and it is the policy to enable persons to conduct their business before such tribunals without the expense of legal representation.  It would clearly be anomalous if the State, having provided for arbitration systems, designed to avoid the need for representation found itself paying lawyers to appear before them under a State scheme of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to three specific matters, on which I would now like to comment briefly&mdash;the establishment of an independent board, of community law centres with local management committees, and the involvement of private practitioners in the provision of legal services under the scheme.  These were matters that were touched on by the various contributors to this debate.  These three aspects received a fair measure of <Col N="507" /> criticism, constructive criticism, motivated no doubt by a sincere desire to present the best possible scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government announcement on 2 May indicated that it was decided that the proposed scheme should be administered by an independent board, as recommended by the Pringle Committee. This is subject to the modification that it would be a nine member board rather than a 15 member board.  It is my belief that the smaller board would give greater administrative efficiency; a 15 member board would be too unwieldy. The smaller board would expedite the business of the board, and cut out the waffle.  A nine member board should be given a chance.  If it does not succeed, or breaks down for lack of members, then let us create a 15 member board, or a 25 member board.  It is a hopeless solution to any problem to set up boards with large numbers on them; it makes for inefficiency, for slowness in work, for cloudy thinking and for all the other outlets that people find necessary to prove their inaction, rather than their action.  A smaller board will make for activity and action.</P>
    <P>The independence of the board was queried.  I would like to say, on behalf of the Government, that the board will be independent; it will be independent of any outside or inside interference whatever.  Of course, the Government will be nominating the members to the board from, no doubt, a panel of people who will be put forward by various interested organisations.  I would envisage, without certainty, that the Government would select names from the panels submitted by organisations which have an interest in free legal aid in civil matters. That is the way it should be done and will be done.  It is the proper and correct way.</P>
    <P>There is no intention, to quote the motion in the name of Senators Robinson and Keating, &ldquo;to prevent the legislative establishment of an independent board&rdquo;. Perhaps what is meant here is that it is not possible, for technical reasons, to set up an independent board without legislation. The question of whether the board can be set up administratively or not has <Col N="508" /> been examined.  I accept Senator Robinson's opening remarks in that regard.  I assure her that the matter is being examined, and examined in depth, in the context of drawing up a detailed scheme.  If it becomes clear that there are technical difficulties which cannot be overcome then, obviously, the question of setting up the board on a legislative basis will be considered and, of course, there will be more delay.  If legislation is necessary, who is to say that the scheme will be introduced by the end of the year?</P>
    <P>My original proposition was that a scheme introduced on an administrative basis could be introduced immediately, or certainly by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not say that.  I am saying that the possibility of setting up the board without legislation is being examined.  If it requires legislation to set up the board then legislation will be introduced but with legislation, more delay.  I might point to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which was set up and is working well; it was set up without introducing legislation.  It was introduced, as the Senator well knows, under a non-statutory scheme and is certainly independent in the discharge of its functions. The establishment of a board on a statutory basis would be a much less complex matter than the introduction of a whole scheme on this basis, but would involve delay which should, if at all possible, be avoided.  The intention is that the board will be independent in the exercise of its functions, independent on the same lines as An Bord Pleanála, which is generally accepted by the community to be a board of the highest integrity, <Col N="509" /> in the context of its untouchability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>And which was established by statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Which was one of the boards established by statute. Statutory or non-statutory, that does not deny us the right to have the title of independence. With regard to the establishment of centres again it is clear, from the Government's statement, that the intention is that services under the scheme will be provided by salaried lawyers employed in centres.  The essential commitment is to establish centres.  There are different types of centres.  There seems to be no reason at this stage for asking for a particular type of centre, as appears to be suggested by the motion, to the exclusion of all others.  How can we be sure that the particular type of centre suggested will be the most suitable one for this country?  Even if it were suitable in one area, would it automatically suit in another?</P>
      <P>This returns to my point that it would be unwise to impose any rigid legal aid model at this stage, on the basis of preconceptions which may be invalid. The concept of community involvement is not excluded but it must be allowed to stand the test of practical comparison with other approaches.  As Senator Murphy said, in parts of Cork free legal aid centres are being set up in the local community and, by virtue of their establishment, spreading their influence out into the community and becoming involved, in that way, in community affairs. You will not find a legal aid centre set up by the Government remaining in isolation from the community; it will become a living, vibrant part of the community. I have no doubt about that.  We are too small a nation to live in isolation from one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to say that if a community centre, or a law centre, is set up in a small community, in no time residents' associations, local religious organisations and voluntary organisations of one sort or another will get to hear about it and will spread the gospel. <Col N="510" /> They will say that it is either a good community centre or a bad community centre.  They will say that it is either a centre staffed by competent people that you should go to for legal advice or it is not.  That is the way the word spreads and that is how a community centre will get its reputation, in a very short time indeed, whether it be in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Dublin, Waterford, in the Midlands or in parts of the west.</P>
    <P>The major difference between what is recommended by the Pringle Committee and what has been decided upon by the Government is that the Pringle Committee envisage that private practitioners would be involved in the provision of services under the scheme from the beginning.  The Government have decided to opt for a system based on centres and have done so for sound reasons.  First, it is satisfied that the need for legal services will be adequately met by having centres located in the larger cities and towns throughout the country, staffed by salaried lawyers who if necessary would travel to other areas on a regular basis to provide the services to those who need them.  It is a well-known practice that solicitors in a rural market town have outlying offices in the smaller villages which they visit on a weekly or monthly basis.  That I am sure, is the way this system will work.  All we ask is to give it a chance; let us see how it develops.  If it is not developing properly then this is the right place to bring it back to and let us discuss it again.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the question of maintaining a reasonable measure of control over the cost of the service.  The introduction of private practitioners would involve the preparation of a much more detailed and complex scheme, the complexity arising, primarily, from the need to control expenditure in the interests of the taxpayer.  This, needless to mention, would delay the introduction of the scheme.  Caution in regard to control of the cost under the scheme is supported by our experience of the criminal legal aid scheme.  To cater adequately for this caution in the civil scheme would, even if this were acceptable on wider consideration, involve unacceptable delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> There would also be the question of negotiating the level of fees to be paid to lawyers.  The Pringle Committee recommended that taxed costs should be paid in legal aid cases, less a percentage to be negotiated.  It is significant that the two solicitors on the Pringle Committee and the Law Society representative dissented from the recommendation that there should be a reduction.  This suggests, to my mind, that negotiation could take some time.  Some private practitioners would make the point that they have a valuable contribution to make, which is not disputed; of course, private practitioners would have a valuable contribution to make.  Some, no doubt, would advance other reasons why they should participate in the scheme from the beginning. In general, there is no need for undue concern that the views of private practitioners will be unknown.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has already had discussions and proposes to have further discussion with the professional bodies on the introduction of a scheme and will certainly be fully aware of private practitioners' views.  In that regard I understand the Minister will be having further discussions with the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council of Ireland.  I know that these men are responsible people and will look on this scheme with favour, will give it the opportunity of being introduced and will work it in a responsible fashion, as a proper attitude to social justice.  I make that point because I believe that the Minister will be successful in his talks with these and other bodies.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Government's concern is to provide, at the taxpayer's expense, people of limited income with a practical means of access to justice, where there is genuine need.  The needs of the legal profession, it must be agreed, must be secondary to the need of the people on whose behalf this scheme will operate.</P>
    <P>The point may be made that the modifications proposed to the Pringle recommendation, even if they are all reasonable, still amount, in one way or another, to a reduction of the scope of the comprehensive scheme envisaged by <Col N="512" /> the Pringle Committee, this is simply not true.  The Government have decided to go beyond the comprehensive scheme recommended by the Pringle Committee in one very important aspect.  That is as regards the means test to be applied.  The Committee recommended that all persons whose annual disposable income does not exceed £2,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What the Government propose to do, therefore, is to introduce a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid and advice as quickly as possible for those in need of it.  There is no question of attempting to deny Parliament the opportunity of debating the matter.  The motion before this House has provided an opportunity for debate and both Houses will have a full opportunity of further discussion when the scheme is being introduced on a statutory basis.  It is the intention that this discussion should take place when experience has been gained of the operation of an administrative scheme.  At that stage, everybody will have a clearer idea as to what is really needed.  A statutory scheme at this stage would frustrate the idea of doing something quickly for those in need and should, if possible, be avoided.  The administrative scheme should be given a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are my general observations on the notes prepared for me before the <Col N="513" /> debate, in anticipation of the criticism which might arise during it.  If I may return to specific items mentioned by Senator Robinson, the most important item was the position of the married woman, where she is seeking, for example, a barring order against her husband. Where the woman is taking proceedings against her husband, his income will not be taken into account in assessing hers. For example, if the woman has no income whatever and the husband has an income, her income would in the circumstances be nil and she would certainly come within the scheme.  I would like to assure those people who are worried and concerned about the matters raised by the Senators that, in fact, they would be very well covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Coolock centre was raised by Senator Robinson, and properly so; I would like to pay tribute to the work done by the Coolock centre in its area.  It is certainly a community centre.  I would probably be acting less than humbly if I did not say that I was partly responsible for the £5,000 which the Minister for Health provided very quickly to the centre on request, and having met with the Coolock people on a number of occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>How about their other requests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Their other requests are being dealt with by the able staff of the Department of Justice.  Senator Robinson raised the matter of bad accommodation, no toilets and so on.  The Minister is prepared to provide the necessary funds to FLAC to enable them to obtain better premises.  Senator Robinson did not mention that FLAC have indicated that as soon as the State scheme is in operation they proposed to cease their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of the centres was raised by Senator Robinson.  The centres themselves, again as part of the general evolution of the centres, will not be dealing exclusively with court cases.  They will be dealing with civil legal advice in addition to civil legal aid.  I would imagine that quite a large percentage of the <Col N="514" /> cases dealt with by the centre will be in an advisory capacity and will not necessitate court appearances.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte, quite properly, was concerned about the attitude of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and their attitude to the proposed scheme to be introduced by the Government and he was also concerned about social welfare recipients and so on.  Social welfare recipients come well within the scheme; I can assure him of that.  Value for money was my original point.  If, for example, a person has no money, there would not be any hardship perpetrated on him or her on that account.  If the legal aid cost £10 or £15 that person is entitled to the full process of the law, to the Supreme Court of this land.  That is value for money in any person's language and that is the type of scheme it is intended to be.  I think the scheme will operate to aid the less well-off sections of the community, the lower income group.  It is a matter of a social fact, and an ascertainable sociological fact, as Senator Murphy has said, that a large percentage of people needing legal aid are of the lower income group, and this is a tragedy of this society of ours.  Maybe it is that we hear more about them than the better off in the context of matters related to family problems.  The centres will provide people with legal advice and each centre will not be confined to two lawyers, as Senator Robinson suggested. Each centre will have whatever number of lawyers is justified by the workload. This is part of the proper flexibility of the scheme.  Educational functions have been mentioned by Senator Robinson.  It would be unwise to impose any rigid rules in that regard on the advice centre.</P>
    <P>The advice centre should be allowed to develop within the community.  I am quite certain, given the Irish experience, that the local community will see the centre as a focal point, in the context of its legal framework.  They will seek legal aid and advice, legal education, all the other relevant matters which are part of and peripheral to a legal aid centre.  I believe it will become a real community centre in the real meaning of the word, as proposed by Senator Robinson.  I can see that welcome evolution in time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> The question of the opening times of the centres was raised.  Here again, this independent board would decide on the opening times and I would make the point to the board that will be constituted that the legal aid centres would remain open late into the evening to give people who are at work, or involved in housework or whatever, the opportunity to go along after their main chores of the day have been completed and take advantage of their entitlement.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony mentioned the exclusion of private practitioners.  I have already dealt with that in my speech. The matter of 15 centres being established was raised by Senator Molony. These 15 centres are only the beginning; when it becomes necessary to increase the number of centres&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Where will the 15 be located?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to the independent board's assessment of the need for location of the various centres, there will probably be four or five in the city and county of Dublin, one or two in Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick and the balance in the midlands and the west, giving us a complement of 15 or thereabouts.  If the 15 are found to be inadequate, having regard to the flexibility of the administrative aspect of the system, these 15 will be added to as required.</P>
      <P>Senator Molony raised the question of people living in remote areas.  These people can be catered for under the same system as rural solicitors operate at the moment.  The truth is that, as I have already stated, rural solicitors have suboffices spread throughout their areas of practice.  That is the way this system should be seen to work, will be seen to work and will work.  Solicitors will travel from the legal aid and advice centres to areas where they are required.  This is a feature of legal aid schemes in Scandinavian countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cassidy made the point that legal aid was ineffective unless backed up by law reform.  As she is aware, the Law Reform Commission was set up for this very purpose.  As she would equally be <Col N="516" /> aware, law reform is not a function of the legal aid scheme.  However, it comes within the general area of law reform and I take her point and it is noted.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte raised the question of contributions.  I have dealt with that. People who have medical cards, or people coming under the social welfare scheme, whether they be in assistance or in benefit, having regard to the disposable income will almost certainly come within the ambit of this scheme.  I believe that to be the greatest feature of this scheme.  Senator Hussey made the point that the accessibility of the scheme to those most in need, to those who can least afford access to the law is all important. I agree that sometimes people who are uneducated in matters of law are intimidated by the idea of looking for legal advice and going through the rather frightening process of the courts. Most of us are intimidated by courtrooms, by wigs and gowns and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte expressed concern that these centres be spread as widely as possible having regard to the needs of the population in the various districts. Senator Hussey, in her pithy but very reasonable contribution, made the point that AIM and other organisations in their own way are responsible for law reform on the family front.  This is a matter of fact.  They were to the van in relation to the calling for free legal aid and advice in a scheme to be operated by the Government.  That organisation, and other organisations, have also taken part of the general call for this type of scheme.</P>
    <P>I make one more appeal to the Senators.  I would ask them not to put this motion to the vote.  Give the scheme a chance; let us see how it works, and if the scheme falls down, does not operate, or in some way collapses, then the Government must take responsibility and answer to both Houses in relation to its inoperability.  Once more I ask Senators to give us the opportunity to introduce what I believe to be a historic milestone in law reform in this country.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the five Members who contributed to <Col N="517" /> this debate&mdash;Senator Molony who seconded the motion, Senator Cassidy&mdash;hers was the solitary but very interesting and worthwhile contribution from the other side of the House&mdash;Senators Jack Harte, Gemma Hussey and Murphy.  We all spoke before we knew the Minister's contribution, and I am sure the Senators will forgive me if I spend most of my 15 minutes responding to what the Minister said and to his contribution to the debate.</P>
      <P>I too would like to keep the temperature even and not in any way to be seeking confrontation or making unduly critical comments.  I realise the Minister came into the House for a debate and I am grateful for the opportunity the House has had of discussing this proposed scheme for a system of civil legal aid.  Despite the length at which the Minister spoke and the fact that he came with a prepared script, we are not really very enlightened.  The Minister assures us that the Government are anxious to introduce the scheme at the earliest possible moment, but we have no idea of when that is likely to be. He begs us not to require&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appealed to us not to press for the need for a legislative basis for civil legal aid because of the possibility that time would elapse, but so much time has elapsed.  It is 18 months since the Minister and his Government got the recommendations of the Pringle Committee. Those recommendations were the basis of four years' work.  The Committee was established in May 1974.  The Minister paid tribute to the work of Mr. Justice Pringle and his Committee and I join with him in paying tribute.  The report did a great deal of homework and appendixed the heads of a legal aid Bill. Eighteen months ago the Minister for Justice had this information.  The Government have been very slow to respond to that information, and I have to agree with Senator Hussey that part of the pressure is the fact that Ireland is before the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  It was at that Court of Human Rights that the representative of the Government made a commitment to introduce a scheme before the end of the year.  We have this very sketchy undertaking that the Government will introduce it on an administrative footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the fact that, of course, the legal aid board which will be established will be independent, but we can use the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  I know the Minister means, and I assume that this would be without question, that the Government are not going to interfere in the workings of the legal aid board.  But how is a legal aid board going to be independent when it has no independent status, when its members have no security of tenure, when it has no statutory criteria on which to work?  It makes all the difference to a body like that if it has a legislative basis.  The kind of legislation needed, and we need it after a full debate in the Dáil and Seanad, is legislation which would establish this body called presumably the Legal Aid Board, to carry out the intent, to establish the criteria for access to legal aid, and the criteria for the establishment of community law centres and other centres.  I would agree with the Minister here.  By all means let us have flexibility.  Let the legislation spell out that flexibility.  At the moment <Col N="519" /> we have only an indication that the Government are prepared to have an administrative scheme.  What does that mean?  How is this House going to have any role to play in the criteria of operation of that scheme?  An administrative scheme does not require any involvement of the Dáil or Seanad.  It cannot establish an independent board in the legal sense of the term.  The only breakthrough I have seen in this entire debate is the possibility referred to by the Minister&mdash;and I do not want to misquote him on this&mdash;that there may be technical reasons.  I believe there are technical reasons and they may require legislation.  I sincerely hope it requires legislation.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the other points the Minister made.  I agree entirely that we should not have any delay.  Let us get this done as quickly as possible.  As I understand it, the Dáil is about to adjourn on Friday week&mdash;the end of this month. I would like to know until when?</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give an estimate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government really want to hasten the introduction, do we have to have an adjournment from June until the middle of October? This is facing reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an unjust&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the relevant point.  The Minister cannot throw up his hands and say: if you want legislation this is necessarily going to delay the matter.  It is not necessarily going to delay it.  We had the Garda Síochána Bill here earlier this afternoon, necessitated by a particular problem.  That was <Col N="520" /> brought in quickly.  It is very complex and I am sure people worked late night after night to work out a particular formula to meet all the problems that arose. We have had other Bills.  We had the Whiddy Island Tribunal Bill because there was a felt need of the urgency.  We could have a Civil Legal Aid Bill without any problem at all.  It could go through this House with a useful contribution as to the criteria for the establishment of an independent legal aid board, for the involvement of the profession in a panel system, and for the establishment of the type of centres that are necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the Minister is persuasive when talking about the sense of urgency that the Government have. How can they have a sense of urgency when they sat on this for 18 months? How can they use the excuse that they do not want to have legislation because it would mean further delay?  This shows an internal weakness in the Government's capacity to bring forward legislation and order their business.  There is nothing inherent in this that would require further delay.  It is a question of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we only establish an administrative scheme, and if a board is established under this scheme to administer it, we may not clarify the basic standards of the scheme which I and a number of other Senators referred to.  We want to give clear legislative guidelines about the way in which we need to identify the unmet needs in our society and the way in which we provide for those needs through a proper perception of community law centres.  When the Minister was making his contribution, he seemed to slip easily from one term to another, from the use of the word &ldquo;advice centre&rdquo; to &ldquo;community law centre&rdquo; and to say he felt the &ldquo;advice centre&rdquo; would evolve into a &ldquo;community law centre&rdquo;.  The Pringle Report separated very clearly and distinctly community law centres and the role and work of a community law centre from advice centres, which would be the provision of either part-time or full-time advice by a number of solicitors operating in a centre.  That is a very narrow perception of the provision of civil legal aid.  It is an out-dated <Col N="521" /> perception of it for countries that have experience of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>For the reasons that were identified by a number of Senators, including Senator Molony, Senator Cassidy and others, there is a very important educational aspect.  There are the attitudes of people; the fears, the lack of perception of people of how law can help them, and the reluctance to go to professional people who have a particular approach of merely representing in a narrow legal sense.  When we talk about a community law centre, we have to talk about quite a different matter from a legal advice centre.  We have to be talking about a community law centre which not only has a minimum of two full-time solicitors, but also has the community law officer, an administrator, and a strong local management committee. The stronger the local management committee, the better and more relevant the impact of that community law centre in its area.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is enough for the Minister to say that he feels sure the centres envisaged by the Government will evolve into community law centres. Why do we not start with an understanding of the values and standards of community law centres?  I am not saying that every centre has to be to a particular model and that no other possibility exists.  I agree that there is a very real value in flexibility.  We have to have a learning process.  Once again we can learn from the experience of FLAC.  I join with the other Senators who paid tribute to the immense work done by FLAC, to the breakthrough that has occurred in the example they have given us of the extent of the need that exists at present.  I do not think the Incorporated Law Society, from their recent paper when assessing the need for future solicitors, have any perception of the real needs for legal services in our community. They used the phrase that the probability is that legal needs are being met under our present system.</P>
    <P>FLAC has identified the extent of the unmet legal needs.  Senator Murphy referred to the broader social and even political impact of community law centres in raising consciousness in an <Col N="522" /> area of allowing for better education, better sense of the kind of group actions, or group research into law reform related to a particular area that could occur.</P>
    <P>Another theme a number of Senators mentioned was the fact that any movement towards the provision of legal aid must necessarily also stimulate a need for greater law reform.  I was sorry when the Minister, referring to this aspect of law reform, seemed to turn again to the role of the Law Reform Commission and say that since that body existed, that was sufficient.  The responsibility for law reform rests fairly and squarely with the Government.  They may seek advice and refer matters to the Law Reform Commission, but they have the major responsibility in this area and are not showing the kind of zeal for reform in the area of family law they tried to refer to in the early months of Government, as having been highlighted in their Manifesto.  We have not seen the reform of family law or the reform of children's rights in this international year of the child.  We saw the Government dodge an opportunity of reforming the Constitution and thereby confining it to the narrow issue of adoption.</P>

      <P>What I am saying is that the Government failed to seize an opportunity there for the kind of reform of our Constitution that would be necessary in order to protect and safeguard the rights of children in our society and have a better balance in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of having a debate of this sort and the opportunity of hearing the views of Senators and of the Minister is to try to get specific information, to have it on the record and to inform ourselves <Col N="523" /> more fully.  I do not think the Minister has given us a great deal of new information, perhaps he does not have it to give. Perhaps it is very early yet in the Government's own consideration.  We now face a long summer break.  It would be helpful if we knew when it might be possible to have more specific proposals from the Government and when this scheme might be in operation.  Perhaps we will have more news on the international front before we have any further commitment from the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to end by thanking the Leader of the House for ensuring that these two motions were taken and for providing the time to debate them today.
