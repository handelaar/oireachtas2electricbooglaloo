    <Title>Gaming and Lotteries Bill, 1979: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Departments of Tourism and Transport and Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Minister of State at the Departments of Tourism and Transport and Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Departments of Tourism and Transport and Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> Section 1 (a) of the Bill provides, in effect, that gaming by means of a slot-machine is &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; within the meaning of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is to close off a loophole in the Acts which arises following a recent Supreme Court decision.  The effect of that decision is that the type of slot-machine which delivers prizes direct to the person who operates it successfully, that is the kind which is popularly known as the &ldquo;one-armed bandit&rdquo;, may be operated without restriction anywhere, with the sole proviso that, in <Col N="602" /> common with all other kinds of gaming, as defined in the Acts, such machines may not be operated in premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor.  The intention of the Oireachtas, when the Principal Act, that is the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, was being amended in 1970, was that such machines should be subject to very strict control but the Supreme Court has now decided that they were not subject to such control. Before I go on to explain the sequence of events which led to the Supreme Court decision, I should like to draw attention to the fact that other forms of slot-machines, that is those that do not deliver when successfully operated a prize direct to the player, are subject to strict controls and have been since 1956. Thus the machines which traditionally have been regarded as being potentially most socially harmful are at present virtually free from controls while those considered less harmful are subject to restrictions.</P>
    <P>The history of the relevant provision in the Acts is briefly as follows.  Section 10 of the 1956 Act outlawed the &ldquo;one-armed bandit&rdquo; completely.  Section 4 of that Act defines certain forms of gaming as &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; but other sections of the Act permit &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; in certain very restricted circumstances. One of the kinds of gaming defined as &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; in section 4 is &ldquo;gaming by means of any slot-machine not prohibited by section 10&rdquo;.  What is defined as &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; may be carried on in an amusement hall or funfair licensed as such under the Acts, subject, however, to certain strict limitations on the stake and the prize money and on the age of those who may take part.</P>
    <P>In 1968 the Supreme Court declared that even those slot-machines which did not deliver prizes direct to the winner were subject to the total prohibition in section 10.  The Government decided to introduce legislation to restore the position to what it had been thought to be up to the Supreme Court decision.  This was done but the Bill was amended during its passage through the Dáil.  The Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1970 repealed section 10 <i>in toto.</i>  The position was then thought to be that all slot-machines <Col N="603" /> whose operation came within the definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; in the 1956 Act were subject to the controls on &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; provided in that Act.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court, as I have said, has now declared that that is not the case.  The basis for the decision is as follows. A reference to the repealed section 10 of the 1956 Act in section 4 of that Act was not repealed by the 1970 Act and the court concluded from that fact that section 4 did not apply to those machines which were formerly prohibited by section 10.  In consequence, the position now is that their operation does not come within the definition of &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; in section 4.  The parliamentary draftsman was fully satisfied in 1970 that there was no need to repeal the reference to the repealed section 10 and he believed that those machines which had been subject to the prohibition in that section would for the future be caught by section 4. That view was not accepted by the Supreme Court, though it was by the High Court judge who considered the case before it was appealed.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in section 1 (a), proposes to restore the position to what it was thought to have been up to the recent Supreme Court decision.  The proposed deletions from sections 37 and 42 of the 1956 Act, in section 1 (b), of the Bill are purely drafting ones and cannot affect the sense of those sections.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are demands from various quarters for far-reaching changes in the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.  Some people are in favour of more restrictions and some are in favour of some &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo;.  This is a very complex and delicate area, however, and pressures on the Department have not so far permitted the kind of analysis that would be appropriate before any important proposals for change are formulated. In Britain, where there has been a special permanent Gaming Board for many years, a very long and highly technical report, running to over 500 pages of print, was made in July 1978 by a Royal Commission.</P>
    <P>The unrestricted operation of slot-machines could have very unfortunate <Col N="604" /> consequences, not only in that it would pander in a very positive way to the gambling instinct but because it is a development that could attract the attention of very dubious if not downright criminal elements.</P>
    <P>Representations have been received from the Amusement Caterers Association of Ireland asking that legislation on the lines of this Bill be enacted.  That is not to say that they, and others, have not both now and in the past advocated further changes.  For the reasons I have already mentioned it is not the intention at this stage at any rate to propose any further changes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill which as the Minister said, is necessitated by an interpretation given by the Supreme Court to the existing Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  It is appropriate that while our best gamblers are at Cheltenham racing festival that legislation like this should be brought before the Oireachtas.  I say that in jest, of course, because anybody who travels around the country or any parts of the city will have seen the tremendous growth in the number of one-armed bandits. They not are only confined to the amusement centres they were originally designed to be confined to but appear in public houses, quite illegally, in hotel lobbies and in many places where young people gather.  I have no doubt that the existence of one-armed bandits in uncontrolled or unrestricted circumstances or areas is certainly not something to be welcomed.  I am glad that the Minister has brought this Bill before the Oireachtas quickly because this is something that has been out of hand now for a few years.  It is difficult I know for the authorities to enforce this but if the law does not enable the authorities to enforce it there is no hope of any enforcement at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to a few months ago the law was there but again, unfortunately, there were indications that there must have been some difficulties in enforcing it because these one-armed bandits certainly were in public houses, illegally, and I know that in some towns licensees <Col N="605" /> have been asked to remove them.  There are other areas where it appears that the law was not being enforced.  These are very dangerous machines because they attract young people into publichouses which, inevitably, gives them the opportunity to start drinking.  That is something we have to watch very carefully.  I know the Bill is only concerned with gaming and lotteries but we also have to consider the advisability of having pool tables in publichouses.  I know many people like to avail of facilities like that while enjoying the refreshment provided but it is noticeable that many young people during the normal lunch hour from school tend to go into publichouses and lounges to play pool, billiards or these slot machines. That is something that needs to be looked at very urgently.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Government Departments are generally under a lot of pressure to make changes in laws that come up as a matter of urgency from time to time and this is an example of that. However, this should be used as an opportunity to highlight some of the problems that exist and to set the Minister's mind in the direction of trying to deal more comprehensively with the problems that arise day by day with slot machines and gaming generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a point about gaming.  It has always been a matter of great surprise to me that while we accept that we should have betting shops around our towns and cities and bookmakers at race meetings we do not accept that if a person strikes a bet and, following this has a disagreement with a bookmaker, that the courts will come to the aid of the person to assist him in proving his case.  Whilst the law says a betting contract is valid it is not on the other hand an enforceable contract. There have been a few cases about it&mdash;I have not seen one going through the courts for a number of years now&mdash;and it is wrong that we should have an ambivalent attitude to this.  We either say that betting on horses or dogs is legal and it happens, and if it happens we should be consistent and say that if there is a disagreement between a bookmaker and a member of the public, a punter, <Col N="606" /> the courts should be available for those people to sort out their differences.</P>
    <P>I know some bookmakers&mdash;there are not many&mdash;who will use the law as it stands to avoid their obligations.  Our attitude has been too vague in this regard and I know the feeling is that if one makes betting contracts enforceable one is seen, in a way, to be encouraging betting and gambling.  I do not think that is the case.  Millions of pounds are being gambled annually and maybe we should consider the advisability of that.  I do not see anything wrong with gambling provided it is properly controlled but the people who gamble, whether they be bookmakers or punters are entitled to avail of the courts when a disagreement arises.  I welcome this Bill and we on this side of the House support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill also.  I am delighted it has come before the House because for a long time I have been concerned about this matter.  I brought it to the notice of the vintners' association when we met them.  There was no doubt in my mind having met them that they are against these one-armed bandits in publichouses.  At that time a report was circulated to superintendents throughout the country stating that these machines were illegal and they were removed.  However, within one week they were back again and have been in operation since.  I hope the Minister has blocked that loophole and that there will be no doubt about where these machines can be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a lot of hardship in homes because of these machines.  I have seen social welfare money lost by old age pensioners, social welfare disability allowances lost by wives of people who were out ill.  I saw a person coming from Bord na Móna with £100 and after losing it all having to get the loan of £10 to get home.  There is no chance of getting back money from these machines because it is estimated that only 20 per cent of the money that goes into them comes back.  The fact that people saw their way to go to the Supreme Court&mdash;that costs money&mdash;to establish that these machines were legal is a clear indication that the people who had them <Col N="607" /> were robbing others.  They were putting their hands into the pockets of good customers and yet were very pleased with themselves, called themselves respectable, good churchgoers and so on.  They looked at systematic robbery of their customers outside the counter and did not have any qualms of conscience about doing so.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that fortunes were changing hands and the money usually came from the poorer sections.  The vintners association were prepared to help in getting rid of these machines. There is another type of machine that is almost the same as a gaming machine, the pool table, and I would like to see some restriction introduced in relation to it.  In post-primary schools, where children have no playgrounds, they go up the streets of towns during lunchtime and play these pool tables.  Some children are given up to 50p to buy lunch but never buy it; they spend it on pool tables.  There is 100 per cent profit on them because none of it comes back. Any decent person at a pool table will clear it in five minutes.  I would like to see something done to control pool tables, especially during school hours. When the Minister comes to review the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, he might remember that something should be done about pool tables.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was listening to the Minister's speech, and the speeches of Senators Molony and McAuliffe, I could not help thinking of the great truth in the old sean-fhocal, &ldquo;Súil le breith a chailleann an cearrbhach.&rdquo; The Minister said much the same in his speech.  He stated:</P>
      <P>The unrestricted operation of slot-machines could have very unfortunate consequences, not only in that it would pander in a very positive way to the gambling instinct but because it is a development that could attract the attention of very dubious if not downright criminal elements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as much as a professional educator as a Senator, it is my view that one of the greatest menaces in present-day <Col N="608" /> civilisation is this promotion of gambling through various means. Whoever thought of this weapon, so well named the one-armed bandit, certainly knew how to attract the youth towards the vice of gambling.  Of all the vices I know of, smoking, drinking, gambling and so on, I consider that gambling is easily the worst.  I am sure very few Senators will fail to recall the number of broken homes, broken marriages and broken families they have come across in the course of their duties as a result of the vice of gambling.  Once a gambler gets this disease nothing will stop him. He will bet on anything he can put a bet on in an uncontrolled way.  We should differentiate between the various types of gambling.  It is quite reasonable for a person to put a bet on a race, a horse race, a dog race or a boat race, but when one is dealing with a mechanical device it should be apparent that one does not stand a chance.  The great evil about it is that a youngster is attracted to these places and now and again he sees somebody winning and he will spend his pocket money, his lunch money and his bus fares hoping to win.  The time will come when he will want more money to spend on these machines and he will be driven to getting money by stealing, or otherwise in an illegal way.  This one-armed bandit is one of the great curses of the present day.  Youth are attracted to these things.  Furthermore, if these one-armed bandits take up their abode in publichouses and so on, there is the double risk of youngsters being attracted to drink as well as to gambling.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court was mentioned. We hear a great deal about the Supreme Court and their decisions nowadays and the Minister told us that the intention here was to close a loophole in the Act which arises following a recent decision of that court.  I hope this Bill will close that loophole because loopholes are very dangerous.  One cannot help but notice that lots of loopholes are coming to light now as a result of Supreme Court decisions. I hope the Bill will close the loophole and I wish it a speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Can the Minister give an indication because <Col N="609" /> of the need for comprehensive legislation on the whole question of gaming and lotteries if this is being considered?  A difficult area is the case of lotteries run by clergy.  They must raise funds and so on but in their lotteries they may be in breach of the law because they have to announce that the car offered as a prize is a secondhand one even though it might be new.  This is a difficult situation for them and for other charitable organisations who must raise money in this way.  Is it on the cards that only licensed places for gaming and lotteries will get slot machines?  Some years ago if one put an old penny in a slot machine one could win 10/-, 120/1, but now the abuse has crept in where one uses 2p to win 50p, reducing the odds to 25/1.  This is discriminating against the punter.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has anything in the pipeline in respect of these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Bill but I should like additional information on certain aspects.  The Minister said that what is defined as unlawful gaming may be carried on in an amusement hall or funfair licensed for such under the Acts and that they should be subject to certain strict limitations in regard to stake and prize money and the age of those who may take part.  I can see no reason why, if these mechanical Al Capones are wrong in one respect they should be right in another.  I fail to see why there should be any question of them being operated anywhere.  When one examines the situation one sees that they are no less than bank robbers of another type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These machines could be described as pay-as-you-spend machines and this situation has increased the gambling instinct. I wonder how serious governments have been down the years in relation to this type of activity.  Is it all right for under age people to gamble if they are supporting the Tote?  Under age people go to race and dog tracks and support the Tote but the law does not intervene. That is a serious situation. Where there is an age factor and gambling is involved we should have a strict line and be serious about it.  We see children of every age joining in the <Col N="610" /> queues at betting shops to put their money on horses.  The Minister should see to it that where this situation is developing serious thought is given to ensure that age limit restrictions are applied whether in betting shops, publichouses, at the Tote or in relation to the sale of cigarettes.  We must be serious about fully implementing the law.</P>
    <P>I, like many people, feel that this legislation is overdue but, nevertheless, we must ensure that when the Bill becomes law it is applied with a vengeance.  As the Minister mentioned, it could attract, as it has, the attention of dubious or downright criminal elements. This is a gangster-type operation and everybody knows that.  There may well be some people on the outer perimeter who want to instal them in amusement arcades because the law indicates that it is respectable to do so but if it is wrong to instal them in one place it is wrong to instal them in any place because the same circumstances, problems and temptations exist.  For that reason the Bill does not go far enough to outlaw completely this type of machine to ensure that we can eliminate from the so-called amusement centres these one-armed bandits for good.  If we are going to allow their installation in piecemeal this Bill is not measuring up to the situation as I, and others in society, would like to see it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider the implementation of the law in relation to under-age gambling and ensure that people who are not supposed to gamble, whether it is going to benefit the State or some State institutions, whether it is Bord na gCon or Bord na gCapall, should be subjected to the law.  It is farcical to bring in a Bill of this nature that indicates the development of a gambling instinct without taking the appropriate measures to ensure that we apply the law elsewhere, particularly to State controlled institutions.  I hope the time will come when we will have complete abandonment of this; if it is wrong in one sense it is wrong in every sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for clarification on roughly the <Col N="611" /> same matters raised by Senator Dowling. The House would be interested to know what precisely is the age limit, where it applies and if it is equal across the board for all forms of gambling.  The second matter is the question of place.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Dowling on this because a totally draconian move would be unsatisfactory.  Obviously, it is perfectly wrong that slot machines should be installed in publichouses or that they should trip one up in shops and elsewhere throughout the environment.  I defend their use in places like seaside resorts because most of us have memories of little funfairs by the seaside which are made up of a number of comparatively innocent amusements and which involve the one-armed bandit.  I do not think a great deal of harm was done there because it was seasonal and transitory. It was not calculated to form habits.  In a way it was vaguely educational because most of us, as children, when we tried the one-armed bandits by the seaside realised that we were being had.  I would see that as pretty innocent.  At seaside resorts the one-armed bandit was harmless enough and contributed a certain amount to the sense of festivity and the kind of festive recklessness which is part of any holiday.</P>
      <P>I doubt whether they should exist in funhalls around cities because a lot of poor children might spend their time in them and develop, as Senator Dowling said, gambling habits.  These places often become resorts for criminal elements and so on.  I would like the Minister to explain fairly clearly&mdash;it is difficult to be quite clear from his speech&mdash;what the new position will be.  I take it that there will be strict control, that only places licensed will be allowed to use them, that these places will be funfairs and entertainment houses, that they will be banned from licensed premises and so forth. I would like that clarified further. Perhaps the Minister would make a general statement as to what the age limit is and whether the age limit for gambling is the same for the Tote as for the funfair.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for introducing it even at this late stage.  I agree with the opinions expressed by Senators and I do not wish to repeat what has already been said.  I agree with Senator Dowling that it seems strange that what is wrong in one place, say in a licensed premises, is right or legal elsewhere.  That is strange reasoning.  I agree that some restriction or control should be exercised on pool tables.  They are a recent invention and they are becoming a danger particularly to young people.  They attract them and give them a passport into licensed premises which they would not otherwise be frequenting.  I agree fully, as one who was a teacher, that schoolchildren, while they are waiting for a bus to take them home or at lunchtime do not engage in beneficial exercise or entertainment such as playing games but go directly to where a pool table is available to play pool.  That is deplorable and is giving these children an opportunity to develop bad habits.  It is having a demoralising effect on those young people and that is regrettable.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister will deal with the points raised. I wish the Bill every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the welcome given to this Bill.  It is necessary to control the unrestricted use, as is the position at present, of these machines.  I realise that I will, perhaps, be repeating what other Senators have said but nevertheless, it is desirable to re-emphasise the dangers that exist in the present situation where machines are available in publichouses and in public <Col N="613" /> places.  In relation to publichouses there is the danger, if these machines are there, of bringing young people into a drinking environment.  It is necessary to take steps to eliminate that risk.  I have been associated with the publicans' organisation, the vintners' federation, and they have publicly stated that they are opposed to the presence of these machines on licensed premises.  That is, of course, in accordance with the law as it now stands. There is a very real danger of children and teenagers gambling away what pocket money they have on these machines and, having lost all, there is a real risk that they may attempt to replace that lost mmney by stealing or resorting to other means.  There is also the danger that the use of these machines by young people will have the effect of sowing the seeds of a gambling instinct at a very early age.</P>
      <P>I accept that the title of one-armed bandit is a very appropriate one in relation to these machines.  Until about three years ago, I did not realise that the pay-out from these machines could be as low as 20 per cent.  An operator approached me and suggested that I might instal one of these in my premises.  He said that the reward would be that we would have 80 per cent of the intake to share between us.  That brought home to me very clearly the correctness of the title of the one-armed bandit.  Where these machines are permitted to be used, in licensed amusement halls and so on, they should be subject to the tightest possible controls in relation to the pay-out from them and in relation to the age of the people who use them.  I fully support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and agree with the majority of the Senators who spoke, particularly Senator Martin, who summed it up well when he talked about the slot machines and one-armed bandits which are available at seaside resorts. They are associated with having fun in summer time and are part of the summer season.  As politicians we cannot attack gambling because in a sense we are gamblers in that we put ourselves before the people and it would be very ironic if we were to attack gambling.  A compulsive politician is every bit as <Col N="614" /> dangerous as a compulsive gambler to himself and his family.  Indeed, some of us may end up that way.  It is very dangerous to have these gambling machines in licensed premises where young people gather.  The loophole that was there is now being closed off.  I would like the Minister to look at other loopholes that may exist.  I understand that, following a court decision, televisions are now allowed in bookie shops.  I would like to know what the Bill intends to do in regard to this.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dowling said, the age factor is very important.  I would like to see the age limit enforced because the law is being flouted at the moment as regards the operation of these machines.  I welcome the Bill and am glad that this restriction is there.</P>
      <P>The position of pool tables is different from that of gambling machines.  One is not expecting any return on a pool table. It is no different from billiards, snooker or other games that are played in different leisure centres.  I stress, however, that where these are in licensed premises one is attracting young people to these places and starting them drinking at a very young age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In joining with the general welcome given to the Bill I would make two points.  The control of the licence for gambling of this nature should provide an opportunity for its restriction to areas&mdash;perhaps along the lines suggested by Senator Martin&mdash; where their influence for bad is limited. The circumstances in which one-armed bandits and that type of machine are used is important.  Their use in certain traditional areas, such as certain seaside resorts or funfairs, can be less harmful than their restricted use in certain other areas where the public are not sufficiently familiar with their presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The references made to the way in which they introduce young people to gambling highlight a problem of real injustice. We have a tremendous responsibility to protect our young people in this area.  The injustice arises in two ways.  First, people are introduced at too early an age to gambling and the compulsion of gambling which may lead to severe problems in later life.  That is the <Col N="615" /> greatest form of injustice which this type of gambling can inflict.  Secondly, there is, as Senator Howard said, the immediate injustice of placing too much temptation in the way of young or immature people and cleaning them out there and then on the spot.  That is a serious injustice.  Apart from that, it can put them under pressures which they are not able to withstand and can lead to other problems and conflict with the law in other ways.  Everybody is agreed on those areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest two points for consideration.  If they are to continue to exist there is a case to be made for their restriction to defined areas.  It is important that the whole concept of the one-armed bandit be confined as far as possible to the area of amusement and removed from the area of gambling.  It would be helpful if there was a very definite limit on the value of the coins which could be gambled.  The use of 2p, 5p and other coins should be eliminated. The evil effects which are inherent in the system would be reduced if there was a limit of 1p on any bet that could be made through the slot machine.  The mechanics of the machine are such that it works at a very fast rate.</P>
    <P>One of the basic characteristics of gambling is the compulsive element and everybody, no matter how well balanced he may be, having lost what might appear to be a small bet will feel the immediate compulsion to try to retrieve his loss.  If the rate at which the machines played was reduced, if there was only a ten second delay before the machine could be operated again that might be sufficient for people to reconsider their compulsive decision and terminate matters at that point.  It would reduce the length of time they could be effectively played.  One answer could be to instal additional machines but the general problems of space and crowding do not give rise to that as a solution.</P>

      <P>This has been an interesting debate in the sense that it shows what an important part for good or evil gambling plays in this country. The views which have been expressed indicate a wide range of views as to whether gambling should be permitted in <Col N="616" /> certain circumstances or whether it should be much more restricted.  As a Legislature we have an ambivalent approach to gambling, lotteries and so on. On the one hand, we tend to be very restrictive in some respects and, on the other hand, we have permitted and encouraged the sweepstakes to operate. This situation needs some kind of rationalisation.  Consequently, if we have not got a committee working on this question, on the lines of the one which the Minister told us has been set up in the UK, we should have some kind of review of our approach to the question of lotteries, gaming and gambling generally, so that we could attempt to rationalise our views and discuss the philosophy of this matter.  We could then bring in whatever laws would be necessary and which should be at least consistent with one another.</P>
      <P>A number of references were made to compulsive gamblers and I should like to mention the best definition I have heard. I saw in a cartoon recently a picture of a very worried looking punter going into a race meeting and saying to himself: &ldquo;Please God I will break even today, I need the money&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill also. As Senator Donnelly stated, one-armed bandits should be outlawed completely but that cannot be done because we have them in places of amusement at seaside resorts and at carnivals.  If they were restricted to that use, it would be fine, particularly if the stake was limited to 2p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I watched a programme on television some time ago in which compulsive gamblers on those machines were interviewed. Women, in particular, would gamble their household budget money for the week and their children's allowances. I should like to see the restricted use of these machines in places such as in O'Connell Street.  It is frightening to see the number of young people congregating in amusement centres, particularly at night.  It reminds one of Las Vegas between the hours of 9 p.m. and 11 p.m.  Those amusement places, particularly in the inner city, seem to attract very undesirable elements.  The O'Connell Street traders came out strongly a <Col N="617" /> few months ago against planning permission being obtained for amusement centres and the type of people which they were attracting.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe referred, in passing, to pool tables.  I witnessed young children, particularly those in post-primary schools&mdash;even in suburban Dublin&mdash;during school hours and during lunch breaks, playing pool, not alone in public houses but also in some cafés. There should be some control regarding the use of pool tables during school hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Departments of Tourism and Transport and Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> I should like to thank Senators for their very useful and constructive remarks with regard to this legislation.  It is quite obvious that a major review at some future date will be necessary to cover the whole Gaming and Lotteries Acts.  This Bill is very brief; it is only intended to close a loophole which was created by a Supreme Court decision.  I am delighted that the House has given it a favourable Second Reading.  I have no doubt that we all realise what the consequences would be if this step had not been taken quickly.  I have been informed that, in the past few months, hundreds, if not thousands, of these machines have entered the country in various forms. They are not only in licensed premises but also in grocery shops and so on.</P>
      <P>Senator Molony remarked on the enforcement of the law.  I can assure Senators that the Minister for Justice has issued directions to ensure that the law will be fully enforced when this Bill goes through the House.  Even without this Bill gaming machines are illegal in publichouses.  This Bill will make them illegal in grocery shops and other places except in particular places which are granted licences for the purpose.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that they should be restricted to various streets or parts of the country.  It will be realised that part of the Act must be adopted by the local authorities before licences may be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were also made to pool <Col N="618" /> tables.  My information is that pool tables, as such, are not within the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.  As we know, they do not give any reward to people who play them.  As a number of Senators have referred to the matter, perhaps at some future date it is something which can be taken into consideration in the context of an overall review of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.</P>
    <P>A very complicated and sensitive Bill would be needed to cover all aspects of gambling.  I am not a gambling man but I must admit that I like to have an occasional flutter on a horse.  The case has been made by Senator Martin and others that it would be difficult to restrict this type of gambling in certain arcades such as these which operate in Salthill, Bray and so on, in the summer time.  We will have to take this into consideration.  It is a business which has been established and licences have been granted for the past 20 or 30 years.  When legislation is being reviewed these matters will have to be taken into consideration.  I have seen places in Dublin on which I thought certain restrictions should have been placed.  Evidently when local authority permission was granted or was sought in these areas, the justice saw fit to grant a licence.  Local authorities and local communities can play a very vital part.  I know of objections which were made recently to various types of businesses by a local community.  If this type of application is being made in a district, they can be as forceful as any law in ensuring that the local authorities do not adopt the Act for the area.</P>
    <P>Senators Martin and Dowling asked about the age limit.  The age limit for this type of gambling is 16 years of age.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> Yes, but I am informed that <Col N="619" /> that is the situation.  The age limit is 16 years in these gambling arcades.  These machines cannot be operated in isolation. One cannot open an arcade with one-armed bandits and nothing else: they must be complemented with other forms of entertainment other than gaming. From what I have seen around the country I doubt very much if the age of 16 is observed in many seaside resorts with which I am familiar.  These matters must be looked at in the context of a full review of the Gaming Acts.  To bring in legislation to prohibit practices which have been carried on in certain places over the past number of years, certainly would be a very delicate operation.  In England a commission sat for a considerable length of time and produced a 500-page document to cover this whole field of gambling.</P>
      <P>The restrictions and limitations on various aspects dealing with the Tote in racing do not come within the framework of this Bill.  This is covered by the 1931 Betting Act, which is a matter for the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>As I have stated, these machines have been operating for about 23 years.  When the whole situation is being reviewed the suggestion made by Senator Dowling and others that they should be completely prohibited must be considered.  This would be a very serious decision to take, especially in relation to established practices within proper legalised amusement arcades passed in areas where the Act has been adopted by the local authorities.  To that extent the Minister for Justice will have seriously to consider such suggestions before taking such a drastic step.  I am in full agreement with the Minister and the House that action must be taken to ensure that gambling machines are not available, <i>ad lib</i> in publichouses, in grocery shops and in other unlicensed places.  This Bill is to have this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Supreme Court judgment was delivered only on 19 January last but during the time that elapsed some people availed of the loophole in the Act.  I have no doubt that many people operating these machines <Col N="620" /> throughout the country realised that a case was appealed to the Supreme Court and was awaiting judgement.  They may have operated these machines over the past two years; a considerable number of them are operating throughout the country.  However, the Minister for Justice gave directions in regard to the enforcement of the law and there were a considerable number of prosecutions in 1977-78, especially where licensed premises were concerned.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the Bill.  The Bill is urgently needed in order to ensure that further violations will not take place.  I would thank the Members if the Seanad could give me all Stages of the Bill today, if possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 is such a recent enactment that I am sure I need not go into any great detail regarding its various provisions. While Senators will no doubt recall the debate we had in this House prior to the Act's passage into law, a few brief words on the Act might, however, be useful at this stage.</P>
      <P>Section 2 applies the provisions of the Act to any merger or take-over where the gross assets of each of the enterprises involved exceeds £1¼ million or where the turnover of each exceeds £2½ million.  Any such proposed merger or take-over must, under section 5, be notified to the Minister.  The proposed merger is then either approved or referred for investigation to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  In the latter case, the Minister may, having considered the examiner's report and if he thinks that the exigencies of the common good so warrant either clear the proposal or prohibit it either absolutely or except on conditions specified.</P>
      <P>Senators may recall that a good deal of the discussion on the Act on its passage through the Houses centred on section 2 (5).  That subsection allows the Minister, where he thinks that the exigencies of the common good so warrant, to declare by order that the Act applies to mergers of a particular class, despite the fact that the enterprises involved in a merger of that class may be below the qualifying assets or turnover &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; specified in section 2 (1). Because of the implications which this section had for the general scope of the legislation, the use by the Minister of his powers under the subsection was discussed at some length.  The main instance mentioned where an order might well be made was the newspaper sector.  The Minister agreed at that time that this would probably be one of the first areas which would be looked at under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad will no doubt be aware of developments in the newspapers sector over the past number of years which saw a significant change in ownership, <Col N="623" /> mainly of provincial newspapers.  These changes have increased the trend towards a high level of concentration in the newspaper sector to the extent that well over 50 per cent of the total market for newspapers is accounted for by two newspaper groups.</P>
    <P>Further increases in this level of concentration will, and I am sure the Seanad will agree, be a matter of concern for all. The press has vested in it the very responsible task of informing the public of news and this function together with comment on current affairs constitutes a major influence in moulding public opinion. It is desirable therefore that the dispersal of views and opinions on matters of public importance should be in the hands of as many persons as possible to ensure that the public receives sufficient informed comment to allow of the proper formulation of public opinion. Conversely, it is most undesirable that this public expression of opinion be vested in a small group of persons with the attendant potential for abusing the responsible position of the press.</P>
    <P>It was for these reasons that the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order was made on 25 January.  As I have said earlier, the effect of the Order is to apply the controls of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act to mergers and so on involving at least one enterprise involved in the printing and publication of newspapers irrespective of the turnover or assets of the enterprises concerned.  The Seanad will appreciate therefore that all proposed mergers in this area will not be automatically prohibited but rather will they be submitted to the tests of the Act.  It may well be, accordingly, that some proposed mergers will be approved depending, of course, on the circumstances of the individual cases.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Seanad will agree that it was right to make this order and that it will support the motion proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unhappy about this order.  I accept what the Minister said as to the desirability of <Col N="624" /> controlling, or indeed preventing the further development of the trend, to which she referred, with regard to the level of concentration in the newspaper sector.  A desirable order to prevent that trend which would not be as far ranging as this order is or purports to be could have been made.  I have very much more than a doubt that the order is not valid and I will not oppose any attempt to correct the invalidity.  The subsection of the Act under which the order is made provides for a procedure whereby the Act should apply, notwithstanding the size, to a proposed merger or take-over of a particular class.  The exceptional nature of this has been indicated by the Minister, in so far as it requires the notification procedures of the Act to apply, irrespective of the size of the enterprise involved.</P>
      <P>This order does not affect a particular class, it affects particular classes.  It is not a legal quibble and it is not a draftsman's error that would make it possible to call in aid the Interpretation Act to convert the singular into the plural.  This order affects the two distinct enterprises of printers and publishers. The only thing which unites these two enterprises, which could arguably constitute them one class, is that the printers must be printers of newspapers or publishers of newspapers.  If the section is read in this fashion, the subsection of that section could render nugatory the entire provisions with regard to the appropriate size for notification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the mere fact of printing or publishing a newspaper, which is exceedingly widely defined in the order, is to engage in an activity entitling both different activities to be treated as of the same class, then arguably the order could provide that the carriers, the distributors and the suppliers to newspapers would all constitute one class, united by the single fact that they carried, distributed or supplied to, newspapers. This is very unlikely to be successfully argued and it is most undesirable that it should be, because it is most undesirable that the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act should apply to all sorts of transactions irrespective of their sizes.  If I am correct, the order <Col N="625" /> does not matter and it would hereafter be held to be invalid, but assuming it is valid the order is excessive in what the affected enterprises are prevented from doing.  The printers cannot merge with or take-over the publishers or be taken over by the publishers, and likewise the publishers cannot merge with or be taken over by the printers.  Much more important than that, the printers of newspapers cannot take over any other enterprises, whether involved in the business of newspapers or not, and the publishers of newspapers cannot take over or be merged with any other enterprise, irrespective of the size of the printers of the newspapers.  If we are thinking of Independent Newspapers, <i>The Irish Press,</i> the Irish Press Group or <i>The Irish Times</i> this would be rather a lot of talk but it is not so, because of the definition of a newspaper.</P>
    <P>A newspaper is defined in the order as any periodical, and that has been judicially defined as a work that comes out from time to time and is miscellaneous in its articles.  The printing of any periodical that comes out from time to time whether daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually or even occasionally, constitutes an enterprise which means that the printer cannot, irrespective of his size, or the size of what he is contemplating doing, merge or be taken over without notification to the Minister and without all the procedures of approval being followed.  We have three evening papers, four daily papers, three Sunday papers and, according to my information, 48 provincial newspapers.  All of these are affected.  Periodicals intended for circulation to members of a particular trade, profession, or occupation only are excluded from the order.</P>
    <P>Clearly the printers or the publishers of periodicals like <i>Hibernia, Magil, Business and Finance, Irish Business, The Irish Tatler and Sketch, The Irish Bystander, Social and Personal, Image, Liberty and Our Boys</i>, which may represent a very small segment of their activities are put in a position where they cannot be taken over, they cannot merge and cannot go into a joint venture in any form of activity which would involve them in more than 30 per cent of the <Col N="626" /> voting right shares in that joint venture, without being obliged to notify the Minister.  This is going much further than is required to achieve the purpose which the Minister wishes to achieve.  It is unfortunate that this should be done because it is quite unnecessary.  What it is desirable to achieve is to prevent the take-over of newspapers, the take-over of the publisher of newspaper and the take-over of the printers of newspapers, but not newspapers as extensively defined as they are here.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom the Fair Trading Act, 1973, went about this in a much better way.  I recognise the difficulties which face the Minister in this area.  In the UK part 5 of the Fair Trading Act does not apply the assets test or the turnover test to newspapers: it applies instead, a circulation test.  I can see that may not be quite apt for what the Minister has in mind here, and what public policy has in mind to look after. The range of circulation, according to the information I have, of provincial papers stretches from about 4,500 copies to more than ten times that.  It would be very hard to do as the UK did and say that this affects a take-over by a newspaper with a circulation of 600,000 and provides a clearance only in the case of a take-over, that it affects only the take-over by a newspaper with a circulation of 600,000, or a newspaper with a circulation in excess of 25,000.  Here the take-over that is affected is the take-over by a newspaper of anything, the take-over of a publisher of a periodical, which is so defined as to be much more extensive than the like definition in the UK.  In the UK they are simply defined as daily, Sunday, and local newspapers.  Concievably here, in certain instances periodicals would include studies, religious newspapers, and religious comment. I know that the Minister does not intend that any of these things should be affected.  The law that should emanate from this House should never go further than it is required to go for the purposes of curbing the mischief it has in mind to curb.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the Minister consider what I have said and the making of a different type of order, or if the <Col N="627" /> Minister wants to take in printers, orders.  The definition of periodical in particular is unhappy and excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator FitzGerald for his remarks and for notifying the Department of his intention to raise this argument here today.  It gave us the opportunity to go back to the Attorney General to ensure that the order which has been made since 25 January is in fact valid and enforceable. None of us wants to see a situation develop where the control of public opinion, the expression of public opinion and views through the national media, mainly through the newspaper industry should fall into the hands of a very few people.  We are all genuinely concerned that because the newspaper industry has a very responsible function, to inform the public, as wide as possible a variety of outlets for the public and free expression of opinion must be preserved. Neither Senator FitzGerald nor anyone else on either side of the House would argue against that case.</P>
      <P>However, I will refer to certain aspects of the argument that Senator FitzGerald made.  The order, as we know, is being made under section 2 (5) of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act which provides that the Minister may by order declare that the Act shall apply to a proposed merger or take-over of a particular class specified in the order.  The proposed order in Article 2 which Senator FitzGerald mentioned, after &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; defines the class of merger or take-over by reference to five separate criteria, (a) one enterprise which at least is engaged in either printing, publishing, or printing and publishing of a newspaper. Senator FitzGerald argued that Article 2 involves different classes and cited printing as a separate class, publishing as a separate class and printing and publishing as a separate class.  On these grounds the Senator says that the proposed order is <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what is perfectly clear from section 2 (5) of the Act is that the <Col N="628" /> Minister is not concerned with classifying industries or commercial activities but, in fact, is solely concerned with classifying mergers or take-overs. Therefore, it is entirely a matter for the Minister to define the class for the purpose of the application of the Act, and he has so defined this class of mergers or take-overs by reference to the five criteria contained in the definition of the class in Article 2.  The Act itself contains no definition of a class and, in fact, on consulting the Shorter Oxford Dictionary one finds that the definition of class is &ldquo;a number of individuals, persons or things possessing common attributes and grouped together under a class name, a kind, a sort, a division&rdquo;. Of all the possible mergers or take-overs in the newspaper industry, the Minister proposes to define a class to which this Act applies by Article 2. Therefore, it is not only my opinion but, indeed, the opinion of the Attorney General, that there is no question of the proposed order being <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald raised the question of the scope of the order being too wide and, as he rightly said, the British Act does not go quite as far.  It was considered best to cast the net wider.  I have often said in this House before that it is better to cast the net wide and catch a lot on the basis that the ones that do not come under the Act will be thrown back and, therefore, that mergers and take-overs which are considered by the Minister to be beneficial, and which must go ahead for various reasons, should be allowed to go ahead. Therefore, this order is not anti-merger. We want this to be known and, indeed, I think Senator FitzGerald would agree. It is to help desirable mergers to be cleared immediately and quickly so as to avoid undue hardship to the people involved in the industry, or the various business interests involved.  Of course, it is very important that those mergers or take-overs which may be undesirable for various reasons&mdash;and we all know the various reasons why they may be undesirable&mdash;must be subjected to the greatest scrutiny.  It is important because of the very important and responsible role the newspapers have to play that <Col N="629" /> they should be subjected to this scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points the Senator raised.  I should like to thank him for his comments.  He has always been very cooperative and helpful in this House and I know that, in raising the point about the definition of class by the Minister, his intention was to be helpful, and I thank him for that.</P>

      <P>Could I be permitted to say one other thing and to thank the Minister for what she said? Reverting to the point of validity, it would be desirable in the interests of the administration of the Act if the attention of the Attorney General was drawn to the fact that every subsection of that section refers to enterprises, and that the paragraph which is excluded in subsection (5) specifies the size of the enterprises.  It may require rather fuller consideration than I gave the Attorney General a chance of giving it.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of Committee Stage of this Bill, it would be as well if I indicated that there are six amendments&mdash;amendment Nos. 1, 4, 26, 28, 39 and 40&mdash;standing in the name of Senator Harte which are out of order as they are not relevant to the provisions of the Bill as read a Second Time.  The Senator has been notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 12 and 13, to insert:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;place&rsquo; in Part II of the Principal Act includes the actual place, location or site where the employee is employed (or normally commences work) unless otherwise specified in a written contract of employment if, but only if, a change in the place of employment <Col N="630" /> would be significantly to the disadvantage of the employee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this amendment we are concerned about the place of employment.  Section 7 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1976, creates unreasonable hardship. It creates great difficulties for people in the building trade, building workers in particular. As I explained on Second Stage, building workers are invited to apply for a job on a site and thereafter the employer tends to treat every site and every location in the State as being the actual place of employment.  This imposes a hardship on building workers. There was a problem in the High Court decision because nobody could interpret the meaning of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment as proposed by Senator Harte could be that a redundancy situation could be created where there was no real redundancy at all.  Some employments, because of their nature, involve movement from one location to another and, of course, if we were to discourage such movement it could have very serious consequences for the employments concerned. It could, in turn, affect the country's capacity economically. Mobility is essential in many employments. For example, the building industry is one, as has been mentioned by Senators.  There are the ESB, engineering firms, and so on, who would, of necessity, have to move from location to location at given times.  The effect of the amendment, I fear, would be to hinder such mobility in the cases where it is now specifically an accepted condition of employment.  Briefly that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to quote from a lecture given by Mr. Gleeson, who was a long-serving chairman of the tribunal.  Referring to a redundancy situation being created when the employer has ceased or intends to cease to carry on the business in the place where the employee was so employed he said that the literal application of these words is properly applied only where the employee had a fixed place of employment and does not apply where the nature of the employment is essentially itinerant; for instance, a dai' <Col N="631" /> domestic servant who is employed specifically to work in a private house in Ballsbridge, a gardener employed to work in a nursery in Cabinteely, or a farm labourer employed on a farm in Rush does not expect to be moved to Cork.  I would also be afraid that in the situation as envisaged by the Senator, many difficulties could be created and that, in effect, a person could become redundant with the same company or the same firm on many occasions during the course of the same employment in the normal way.  These are the dangers I see in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is correct to say many difficulties have been experienced by the tribunal.  Senator Harte mentioned that there had been a case before the High Court.  It is true that the interpretation of &ldquo;place&rdquo; came before the High Court in 1974 on an appeal from a decision of the Appeals Tribunal by a number of building workers who had appealed unsuccessfully to the tribunal for redundancy.  That appeal was decided by the High Court on technical grounds not related to the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo;.  The High Court indicated that it would favour a wider interpretation of &ldquo;place&rdquo; than the four walls of a building site. While the case was not decided on the meaning of &ldquo;place&rdquo;, opinions expressed in the judgement are considered to have provided guidelines for the tribunal in deciding that issue.  It is felt that the question of interpretation should continue to be left in the tribunal's hands in the light of these guidelines and I certainly would recommend that course to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The &lsquo;requisite period&rsquo; of continuous employment specified in the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;78 weeks&rsquo; for &lsquo;104 weeks&rsquo; in sections 7 (5), 17 (1) and 17 (2) of that Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has an obligation to relate the scope of the Redundancy Payments Act to the current customs and practices in employment to ensure that workers are not deprived of the generality of benefits.  The period known as the requisite period, that is, the two-year qualifying period, prevents many people from getting the benefits of the Act.  In this case, it not only applies to building workers but also to workers in other occupations, such as contract work, task work and so on, to be completed at a given time.  This work is often finished within the two-year period.  By and large many of them finish around the 78th week, or within a year-and-a-half.  People in those circumstances are caught in an awkward situation and they do not get the benefits.  This is why we put down this amendment.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about the nature of the work.  This is different.  This is a question of the actual length of time spent working with the same employer on a continuous basis.  We are dealing with the qualifying period.  What we are really looking for is a reduction in the 104 weeks to 78 weeks.  This would be more appropriate and it would take in many of these people.  The number of workers who would benefit would be fairly substantial if the Minister agreed to the amendment.  If not, I should like to hear if he would be prepared to review it in a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. It was pointed out adequately in the Second Stage debate that the experience has been that quite a number of people are excluded from the benefits of the redundancy payments scheme for a number of reasons.  One is their length of service.  Unfortunately there are casual jobs, intermittent jobs, in which people <Col N="633" /> cannot have the requisite two years' service. One of the great defects of the redundancy payments scheme since its implementation ten or 12 years ago, has been that individual cases suffer most.  A person who has worked in casual employment all his life is likely to be laid off more regularly than other people. Due to the nature of his work, casual, seasonal or intermittent work, he can rarely qualify for redundancy payments, either for the lump sum or the weekly payments.  This amendment is well worth looking at and I should like to hear the Minister's observations on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the amendment proposed by Senator Harte is to reduce the qualification period from two years to one-and-a-half years.  In the Dáil debate we had an amendment proposing to reduce it to 52 weeks.  The difference between two years and one-and-a-half years is not great, but I should point out a number of things. First, it is felt generally that two years is a reasonable period for qualification.  We are always inclined to compare our legislation with that of the UK.  The qualification period is two years in the UK, with one very basic difference from ours.  In the UK the two years must be reckonable service.  Here it is much more liberal.  In addition to being reckonable service in the UK it commences only from the age of 18 years.  Our Acts are much more liberal because we are talking about two years' continuous service and such service counts from the age of 16 years.  In theory, an employee with only a few days' reckonable service could qualify for a lump sum here.  Even though he was sick or laid off, the continuity of his service is not affected.</P>
      <P>In the UK the situation is much more rigid and much stricter.  It is two years' reckonable service.  When this Act was originally introduced in 1967, the period was four years.  It is half that now.  I am satisfied that two years is a reasonable period and I would ask the Seanad to accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The following paragraph is hereby inserted in section 7 (2) of the Principal Act (as amended by the Act of 1971):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(d) the fact that the employer has decided that the work for which the employee has been employed (or had been doing before his dismissal) shall henceforth be done by a person who has a degree of capability, competence or qualifications (specified by the employer) which the dismissed employee did not have&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here we are talking about the scope of the Bill and the legal profession.  When a Bill is enacted many legal advisers try to exploit its weaknesses and public authorities exploit them also.  As I said on Second Stage the Department of Education punched a hole in section 7 of the 1967 Act by making a teacher redundant in such a way that he did not qualify for or was deprived of compensation. As people who represent workers, we have to guard against managements who decide to make a class of worker redundant.  We must have something written into the Bill to ensure that those workers will be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained what happend in the Limerick Health Authority in 1969 <Col N="635" /> when they were dealing with midwives. They changed the name of the grade and they changed the degree of the qualifications of one worker.  The Department recognised the implications of that decision and section 4 of the 1971 Act was made retrospective, and that is fair play by the Department.  However, the abuses are there and even in the Department of Education they have managed to make an unqualified teacher redundant without redundancy compensation.  He is a worker and I am concerned about the protection of the workers.  I should like to know can anything be done about that and I should like this amendment to be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises from a controversial tribunal decision in a case where an untrained teacher was replaced by a trained teacher.  The Act provides that, where it is necessary that work be done in a different manner in which the employee is not sufficiently qualified or trained, a redundancy situation does exist.  The tribunal held at that time that, in the case of an untrained teacher being replaced by a trained teacher, a redundancy situation did not exist.  I believe the Act is well worded and that it should not be tampered with because of this isolated case.  Obviously it was the only case during the period of operation of the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, I believe in a similar situation the tribunal might decide differently in the future.  As it is worded the amendment could also lead to abuses of the scheme by people claiming redundancy because workers were replaced by more capable workers.  What is the degree of competence or what is the degree of capability?  Acceptance of this amendment, particularly in view of the fact that it relates to a controversial decision, could lead to more abuses.  In a future case the tribunal might decide quite differently in similar circumstances.  I am convinced this was an isolated case and, <Col N="636" /> having considered it when the case was made to me originally, I felt it did not justify amending the section.  Amending the section could lead to more difficulties and problems.  We would be legislating for a particular case of the past.  Senator Harte will agree it was an isolated experience in the tribunal's decision.  In the future if the tribunal were deciding on a case in similar circumstances the decision could be quite different.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure about the question of a worker being replaced by a more competent person.  The Act is clear on that.  If you are replaced by a more competent person, he takes on additional work and you become redundant and legitimately entitled to compensation. That did not happen in this case.  I have listened to the Minister's explanation and I should like to test what the House thinks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="637" /> AMOUNT OF LUMP SUM</P>
    <P>1. The amount of the lump sum shall be equivalent to the aggregate of the following&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the product of one-half of the employee's normal weekly remuneration and the number of years of continuous employment, with the employer in whose employment he was on the date of dismissal, or by whom he was employed when he gave notice of intention to claim under section 12; between the date on which the employee attained the age of sixteen years and the date on which he attained the age of twenty-one years, and</P>
    <P>(b) the product of the employee's normal weekly remuneration and the number of years of continuous employment, with the employer in whose employment he was on the date of dismissal, or by whom he was employed when he gave notice of intention to claim under section 12, after the employee had attained the age of twenty-one years, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a sum equivalent to the employee's normal weekly remuneration.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the proposal to increase the lump sum between the age of 21 and 41 years to a week's pay for every year of service, as is the case in Northern Ireland.  We hope the amendment will be accepted.  What motivates us is not only the question of Northern Ireland but also the fact that there has been very slow movement on the method of calculating the lump sum.  With the exception of this Bill, nothing has really happened except for the extra week's pay granted in the 1971 Act.  Although it is young legislation, it is not all that young.  There is room at this stage to make this amendment and bring us up to the level of the payments in Northern Ireland between the ages of 21 and 41 years.  There is no use in saying people do not negotiate higher payments outside. They do on the side, but that has nothing to do with the lump sum redundancy payment.  When firms are insolvent people get into a great deal of trouble. It is all right for people who are involved <Col N="638" /> in good firms or good companies which are well run and are financially sound, but when workers are involved with an insolvent firm they are in a bad position and sometimes they have to fight their case very bitterly.  There has to be universal application, even if it were only to satisfy the employee who works for a firm which becomes insolvent. Redundancies are here to stay; they are a feature of life.  We will probably have notification of 9,000 or 10,000 redundancies within the next nine or ten months.  The workers affected are entitled to the best possible benefits.  I submit that it would not be beyond the powers of the Government, or burst the purse strings, to give effect to this amendment and pay that extra week before the ages of 21 and 41.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what we feel the lump sum is for.  Under the old scheme it was regarded as compensation for the service and the rights which a person has built up in a job before he became redundant.  Some firms are in a position to give an <i>ex gratia</i> payment on top of the lump sum.  That is well and good for redundant employees of such well-positioned companies.  The redundant people who are not in such a favourable position, however, have to depend on the State lump sum.  We find, from the Minister's explanatory memorandum, that the maximum lump sum under the new scheme would be £3,700.  It boils down to whether we determine that as being adequate enough compensation for the rights which a person has built up in a job over a long period of years.  Due to the fact that <i>ex gratia</i> payments are not obligatory or compulsory in any respect, the State could, perhaps, pay a bigger share in this compensatory factor in redundancy.  I would support Senator Harte's amendment in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point that I raised earlier with Senator Harte, concerning the commitment at the end of 12 months to examine the method of calculating the lump sums.  I believe that we are taking a substantial step forward in doubling the present ceiling from £2,500 to £5,000 from April.  That gives <Col N="639" /> us a maximum lump sum between now and 1 April 1980 of £4,086, admittedly reducing to the figure mentioned by Senator Markey for that period.  I wanted to check the situation in this regard in Northern Ireland; this was mentioned on Second Stage.  At the time I thought I was right in saying that the lump sum there is lower than it is here. I checked it in detail and discovered that, in fact, that is so.  The maximum lump sum in Northern Ireland is only £3,300.</P>
      <P>As you know, the Redundancy Fund is affected by a number of factors.  It is affected by the number of redundancies; the age of the workers concerned; the contributions and how these are meeting the needs.  I have given an undertaking, and repeat this undertaking to the Seanad, that I shall re-examine the method of lump sum calculation at the end of a year's experience.  It would be wise, at this stage, to try that year's experience and see how the Redundancy Fund operates or covers the problem during that year.</P>

    <P>This is something that the Irish <Col N="640" /> Congress of Trade Unions have been advocating. I do not know if they put that proposal to the Minister but it is something I have heard mentioned at ICTU conferences and in the trade union movement in general.  What they are saying is that while you have £5,000 as the earnings, the actual earnings can include overtime payments, Christmas bonuses, holiday bonuses, incentive payments. We have had a problem with this over the years.  All wages are assessed for tax.  When the differential rent scheme was first introduced, every halfpenny that came into the family was assessed to decide what rent the householder should pay.  What we are saying is, if it is good enough to embark on that course of action in other areas, there is no doubt that the actual earnings should be thought of when dealing with the question of compensating somebody for losing his job.</P>

The ceiling would appear to me in those circumstances to be adequate and I believe that the £2,500 improvement, a doubling of the existing figure, represents an adequate improvement in the existing legislation.

      <P>In page 3, line 36, to delete &ldquo;paragraph (b)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;paragraph (b) and (c)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 12, we are talking about the special treatment of people below £49 per week.  We put it in that way.  What we say is:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection an employee who, at the commencement of this section, or at the date of termination of employment, is in receipt of weekly remuneration not exceeding £49 per week (except where, in relation to that employee, the method of calculating the lump sum differs to the advantage of the employee from that in operation on the day before the commencement of this section) shall continue to receive weekly payments as if that paragraph were not enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, we are considering the low paid worker, below £49 per week, because we believe that he will be the sufferer.  There have been arguments put forward that this will not be the case.  All the evidence <Col N="642" /> we can get indicates that there is and will be a loss to anyone below £49 per week. We feel that there should be some exclusion to ensure that the weekly payments are continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, from what Senator Harte has said the aim here seems to be that of preserving the weekly payment entitlement for employees earning £49 or less, even where redundancy occurs after the commencement of operation of this Act.  One of the basic features of the Act, and one with which there has been general agreement on all sides, is the abolition of weekly payments.  The 85 per cent rule operates, irrespective of the level of wage, affecting both low and higher paid workers and tending to affect the lower paid workers more than the higher paid on an aggregation of social welfare payments with redundancy, a lower paid worker is likely to reach 85 per cent of his average net weekly earnings sooner than a higher paid worker reaches £50 through the other limiting factor of weekly payments.  Only by removing the 85 per cent rule could workers in the category covered by the Senator's amendment benefit, if weekly payments were to be retained specifically for such employees.  In view, however, of the disincentive to seek new employment which could result, this course could not be pursued.  This is why the 85 per cent rule was introduced in the first place.  Essentially, what this means is that the abolition of weekly payments will not, in the vast majority of cases, mean a worsening of the position of workers in the lower paid category.  The abolition of weekly redundancy payments will, in fact, be compensated for by improved social welfare benefits, which is why we are abolishing weekly payments in general.  Could I bring the Senator back to a point which he made last week on Second Stage about when there were such very small weekly payments.  Five pence and 10p were the figures mentioned at that time.  I would say the number of workers in the category mentioned, if any, is likely to be very small. As I said earlier, the average industrial earnings at June last year were £72.48.  I would say to the Senator that the abolition <Col N="643" /> of weekly payments was accepted on all sides.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 4, to delete &ldquo;60&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;70&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important for the proper operation of the redundancy payments scheme that there be goodwill and decent behaviour on the part of the employer. Under the existing scheme this was acknowledged by the graded scheme of incentives in the rebate percentage.  In the new Bill the Minister has reduced the maximum rebate percentage from 70 per cent to 60 per cent.  I acknowledge decent behaviour on the part of the employees in giving the longest possible notice of redundancy to employees we should retain the maximum percentage, namely, the 70 per cent.  The Minister has said that past experience has been that 60 per cent turned out to be the average percentage rebate.  Notwithstanding this, I feel it is important that we should have the benefit of the maximum notice possible in the circumstances and should encourage employers to give this.  I move the amendment that we retain the existing percentage rebate figure of 70 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Markey raised this point of increasing the level of rebate from 60 per cent to 70 per cent on Second Stage.  Under the present schemes, rebates vary, with notice, from 55 per cent to 70 per cent and experience has been that 60 per cent is just below the average rebate paid out to employers at present.  In the UK and Northern Ireland the rebate is set at 41 per cent.  An important feature of the <Col N="644" /> rebate level is that, by placing a significant cost on the employer, it helps to ensure that the scheme is not abused by collusive redundancies.  It is generally felt, therefore, that 60 per cent is a reasonable rebate level and I would ask the Senator to accept that.</P>

      <P>That is more an argument that it should be 70 per cent rather than 60 per cent.  Obviously, there are quite a number of applicable cases over the 60 per cent and I feel that it would help the operation of the scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to get people back to alternative employment as quickly as possible.  Anything that would help should be done and I think this higher percentage rebate to employers would help in that respect.</P>

I have no information that it is widespread, but, on the other hand, the higher the rebate, the more danger there is.  The other points I made to you, that the 60 per cent is just below the average rebate at present, seems to me to be more appropriate in the circumstances and it is accepted as reasonable also in the discussions that have been held.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 19, to delete &ldquo;two weeks on the expiration&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;period (being not less than two weeks)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the best aspects of this new Bill is the two-week periods of notice for redundancy purposes given to employees and their right to obtain paid time off within that two-week period to seek a new position.  This is a most welcome innovation; one of the most frustrating aspects, for a person who knows that he is going to be laid off in a couple of weeks' time, is to find himself still working away at his workbench and knowing that he could be perhaps utilising that same time seeking a job or having an interview to obtain alternative employment.  In the light of experience, <Col N="647" /> where there has been more than two weeks' notice given by employers and, under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, there can be right to notice of dismissal of up to eight weeks&mdash;could we not contemplate a situation where paid time off would be given in that period of notice of four weeks, six weeks or whatever.  The time off has to be reasonable.  The employee cannot, within that period of notice, come every morning and afternoon of every day seeking time off to attend interviews and so on.  Going back to the philosophy behind the redundancy scheme, the idea being to get people back to work as quickly as possible, the more and the earlier the opportunities to have interviews and to seek alternative jobs which are available to an employee threatened with redundancy in those few weeks in which he would be in a position to have interviews, the better.  Unfortunately, the experience of the redundancy scheme has been that it is far more difficult psychologically for older employees who are laid off to gear themselves to seeking alternative employment in the short period of notice they might have at their disposal, particularly up to now.  It would be particularly beneficial to the employee in this category if he had a little more time in which to attend interviews and seek alternative employment.  It would be beneficial generally, and would hasten the rate of re-employment of redundant workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make an observation on that.  The wording proposed by Senator Markey is certainly much more positive.  It is quite clear, in reading the section, that the employee can get time off during the two weeks but it is not spelled out as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 7, as the Senator says, the employee has a right to time off to look for work or training and that right is confined to the two weeks ending on dismissal date. This equates the period during which the right subsists with the period of statutory redundancy notice.  In cases <Col N="648" /> where an employer gives more than two weeks' notice, the right will be confined to the last two weeks of that longer notice.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides for a right to reasonable time off during that period of notice, irrespective of this link, but not less than two weeks.  This is a new and generally welcomed feature of the redundancy scheme.  The inclusion of such a provision was strongly opposed by the employers' side.  Two weeks strikes a reasonable balance between the demands of trade unions and the objections of employers.  It should be adhered to.  The Minister, especially a Minister for Labour, has to try to create a balance between both sides.  As the section reads, it is an innovation and, indeed, in this House as everywhere, it was welcomed.  I would ask the Senators to accept the section as it is, on the two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct to say that the average length of notice given in the past has been something in the region of, say, four or five weeks, rather than two weeks?  If that has been the situation, it strengthens my argument that we should consider giving the threatened employee some positive help for that longer period of notice, which has been the average experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between this Bill and the original redundancy Act was that at that time one did not have the Minimum Notice Act which necessitates and sets down specific periods of notice required, depending on the length of service.  This, as you may remember, is one of the reasons why this statutory notice for redundancy is now two weeks but, having discussed it with both sides and having listened to the demands on one side and the objections on the other, I have certainly come down with a fair balance, as acceptable as it can be, of that reasonable time off.  I believe it is very desirable and useful to the people on whom redundancy notice is served, that during that two-week period, they have reasonable time off. There were objections to it; it was not accepted by all sides but I have come down with a reasonable balance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 4, after line 39, to insert the following new subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), an employee who has not been given a notice under this section shall be deemed to have been given a notice and shall be deemed to have been allowed such time off as the Tribunal considers reasonable.</P>
      <P>(7) The Tribunal, on the application of the employee (where it appears to the Tribunal that the employer is in liquidation or insolvent) may order that any amount (or any part of it) ordered to be paid under subsection (5) shall be paid to the employee from the Redundancy Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the &ldquo;time off to look for a job&rdquo; section.  We want to ensure that employers do not avoid their obligation.  There is no penalty for not giving notice; it is a question for the tribunal. The tribunal can make an award but cannot fall back on anything.  There is a problem there and the amendment would solve it.  The Minister introduced a welcome improvement in the scope of <Col N="650" /> the Redundancy Act but he did not make any provision to ensure equality treatment for all employees.  For example, some of them may have to appeal to the District Court after an award has been made by the tribunal.  A worker who gets an award by the tribunal against an insolvent firm must take his chance like others.  That is not correct. The amendment seeks to deal with the serious defect in section 7, on the question of qualifying for time off on pay to look for another job.  Many employers do not wish to draw attention to the fact that they are running down their workforce or are in any difficulties and because of the way the section is phrased they could get away with not giving notice under the Act.  I do not think there is any way the section, as it is framed, can help somebody who is given an award by the tribunal against a firm which is in liquidation.  Such a person should be able to fall back on the Redundancy Fund in some way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage, Senator Harte maintained if an employer did not give notice he could evade obligations under section 7 but I believe this ignores the fact that a dismissed employee has also to be given notice under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, notice which in all cases of redundancy entitlement would equal or exceed two weeks.  I do not have to explain to the House why that is so: it is simply because two years means two weeks.  It will have to be the 1973 Act.  Under the Act with such minimum notice the employee would be entitled to compensation <i>in lieu</i> of notice.  Where no notice is given, and where the employee is made redundant on the spot he will not be at a disadvantage and then, of course, he will be totally free to seek work or pursue any claims he may have under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of an employee accepting payment <i>in lieu</i> of notice he would get his wages and would be completely free to spend all his time looking for work.  It is not right to say that there is not a penalty.  There is a penalty on the employer because under the rebate <Col N="651" /> system in the new Bill it can mean a difference of 20 per cent in the rate of rebate paid.  For example, in a figure of £2,000 it would cost the employer £400 which is a substantial penalty in that situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1) Without prejudice to the generality of section 9 of the Principal Act, an employee shall be entitled to terminate his contract of employment in circumstances of uncertainty in <Col N="652" /> which it is reasonable for the employee to anticipate dismissal for redundancy (whether or not he has received notice of dismissal or protective notice of dismissal or lay-off) if it is reasonable for the employee to expect that his remaining in the employment would seriously prejudice his prospects of obtaining suitable alternative employment which became available and was unlikely to remain vacant.</P>
    <P>(2) Where, in the circumstances specified in this section the employee has received an offer in writing from the employer and on a reference to the Tribunal it appears to the Tribunal, having regard both to the reasons for which the employee seeks, or sought, to leave the employement and those for which the employer requires, or required, him to continue in it, to be just and equitable that the employee should receive the whole or part of a redundancy payment, the Tribunal may determine that there shall be paid to the employee&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the whole of the redundancy payment to which the employee would have been so entitled, or</P>
    <P>(b) such part of that redundancy payment as the Tribunal thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to allow a person to accept a new job without getting himself into any serious trouble. Unless section 7 is backed by this amendment which would enable an employee to accept a new job employers generally, especially Government Departments and public authorities, may seek to defeat the objectives of the section by insisting that the employee who accepts the new job also leaves his employment, so disqualifying himself from redundancy payment.  That is not the desirable thing.  An important new principle has been promoted by the time off section of the Bill under which employees are to be given time off to look for another job.</P>
    <P>That happens in all sorts of circumstances but particularly when a firm are running down the workforce.  If a worker <Col N="653" /> finds another job and wishes to accept the firm, under the 1967 Act, are entitled to claim that if he accepts the job which he has discovered he is not entitled to compensation on the grounds that he had voluntarily left his employment. Likewise, if a firm wish to prevent a person looking for a new job they can do so by giving notice under section 7.  We want to see this section operating in practice.  If a worker discovers another job and the Act has conferred a right on him to look for that job he must be allowed to accept that new job without running the risk of being treated shabbily. The section appears to confer a benefit which is not a benefit at all.</P>

It attempts also to deal with contingencies related to such vague terms as &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo;, what the expectation of the employee might be and the likelihood or otherwise of other employment remaining available to him, whether the firm will or will not survive and so on.  I could visualise a situation where a rumour would spread about a firm with a workforce of 100 or 200 people and because of that rumour there is employment available in the immediate neighbourhood.  Under this amendment, that workforce could be attracted away from a firm about which, perhaps, there were rumours of threatened problems and as a result of that the future viability of that firm could be very severely affected. The firm might well survive provided the workforce remained.  That amendment could create problems that do not exist at present under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I cannot see that the amendment serves any purpose.  An employee put on statutory short-time has the right to apply for redundancy after four weeks of such short-time irrespective of the number of hours, or how reduced they are, involved in that statutory short-time.  The statutory short-time must, however, be less than half his normal hours but an employee on statutory short time can claim redundancy at any time, even years later.

      <P>&ldquo;(2A) Where an employee who has been offered suitable employment and has carried out for a period of not more than four weeks the duties of that employment, refuses the offer, the temporary acceptance of that employment shall not solely constitute an unreasonable refusal for the purposes of this section.</P>

    <P>Section 11 does not provide for the problems arising from a change in the place of employment.  There is great difficulty <Col N="655" /> in grasping the meaning of the section mainly because of the legislation by reference to the amendment of section 15 (2) (a) which should have been included in the Bill.  The trial period of two months in the Act of 1971 has caused considerable trouble and hardship.  Section 11 proposes to enable an employee to accept temporarily a change in pay or hours of work for 12 months without entering into a new contract and this we accept as a significant improvement.  However, there have been hardship cases under section 11.  The alternative job was offered to somebody in England.  A person actually worked for 11 months in England and that lost him his right to compensation.  The problem is that section 11 does not give any relief when a worker accepts temporary work in another place or even if he accepts any sort of a position on a temporary basis.  The section does not give him any relief and we feel that the amendment would cover it.  The worker sent from Dublin to Galway or Cork is not covered by the section.  It would, however, apply to a Cork worker offered short-term work in Cork or Dublin.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 19 seeks to incorporate into section 11 of the Act an existing provision, as the Senator said, section 15 (2) (a) of the Schedule to the 1971 Act.  As far as I can see its incorporation into section 11 is apparent from amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23.  Regarding amendments No. 21, I do not see the reason for this amendment.  The amendment is appended to the provision giving employees on a non-statutory short-time 52 weeks in which to claim redundancy. The amendment does not appear to have a connection with section 4 (2) which lays down the minimum number of normally expected hours of work for qualification purposes.  The fact that an employee has temporarily accepted reduced working hours, even below 20, does not affect his right to claim redundancy under section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 22, the intention here seems to be to make the provision about non-statutory short time, that is <Col N="656" /> allowing 52 weeks to claim, retrospective to employees who are on non-statutory short time at the commencement of the Act for more than 52 weeks and who, therefore, could not claim redundancy even under the new Act. Some might possibly have been already on non-statutory short time for more than two years to claim redundancy.  I do not believe that the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 which deals with the situation where employers and employees may agree to a trial period of any length in respect of an offer of alternative to employment.  At present the trial period is four weeks, which is a reasonable time within which employees should know whether the offer of alternative employment is suitable or not. The situation does not appear to demand the amendments as suggested, particularly because of the substantial improvements in the non-statutory short-time where the provision of the period within which he can apply is increased from four weeks to 52.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) are an attempt to expand and amend section 15 (2) of the principal Act.  Section 15 (2) deals with written offers of renewal or re-engagement by the employer in cases where there is a change in conditions of the employment contract.  The proposed paragraphs would introduce the concept of a compulsory trial period already defined as potentially open ended by agreement specifying in detail the circumstances surrounding a trial period and the particulars in relation to it being given in writing.  The main objective in the Bill is to simplify what had become an extremely complicated scheme.  This amendment would complicate the position further.</P>

      <P>We may be at crosspurposes here but nevertheless the Minister has got the meaning of my case.  The amendment, and the related ones, would not have involved any change.  They were not intended to involve any change.  The amendment is intended to insert a subsection so that the scope of the amended section may be readily seen and understood.  Amendment <Col N="657" /> No. 23 seeks to facilitate the acceptance of employment for a trial period.  It is because the absence of procedures in the trial period have resulted in a lot of disputes and problems for the tribunal that the amendment was tabled, to try to clear up the situation.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to repeat the relief given in similar circumstances under section 8 of the 1971 Act where the employee loses an appeal.  I have explained the difficulty of trying to grasp the meaning of section 11.  I see them all as inter-related.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Senator is aware that, in response to an amendment tabled by Deputy Ryan in the Dáil on Committee Stage, I introduced on Report Stage an amendment to cover a number of cases for which I had a certain amount of sympathy. It appears that the Senator is going further.  As I read amendment No. 24, it concerns decisions given by the tribunal since 1 April 1975 relating to short-time working, both statutory and non-statutory short-time working.  If effected this would, in effect, allow cases already decided on on these issues over <Col N="658" /> the last four years to be reheard by the tribunal.  That step goes too far.  I introduced in the Dáil an amendment to this section which will allow the tribunal to take account of the new provisions contained in sections 10 and 11 in reaching decisions on a number of clearly defined appeal cases brought before 1 January 1979 but not yet decided on because of the uncertain nature of the existing provisions of the Acts.</P>
      <P>The Senator is proposing to re-enter cases for hearing which may, in fact, have been decided over four years ago. The Acts already provide that the decisions of the tribunal on any question referred to it are final and conclusive, save that any person dissatisfied with the condition may appeal therefrom to the High Court on a question of law.  I believe it would be stretching this Act very far to take account of cases that have been specifically decided on and disposed of.  The basic difference between that and the situation in the amendment I referred to was that there were a number of cases where a decision had not been finalised and because of the uncertain nature I had some sympathy with the situation.  In fact, I introduced an amendment on Report Stage to cover those.  The difference here is that decisions have been taken and, in some cases, over four years ago.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to effect the consolidation of a number of important provisions of the 1967 Act, namely section 7 which deals with scope; section 16 which deals with disentitlement; section 24 which deals with time limits and rules 4 to 7 of the Third Schedule which deal with continuous employment.  We hope the amendment in the way it is framed will help to clarify the situation in those areas and will bring about the necessary consolidation.  It is an area where problems can arise for trade union officials and for the tribunal.  As I said on Second Stage, one can get leaflets on booklets but that is not very satisfactory or helpful.  No matter how much it is explained, there will be difficulties.  We hope the amendment will stimulate discussion on whether in its present form it will do the job that it sets out to do.</P>

      <P>Amendment 27 is to introduce a consolidated Second Schedule, set out in amendment 38, which in turn consolidates sections 7, 15 and 24 of the Principal Act as well as part of the Third Schedule.  It is our intention to consolidate the Acts, not just individual sections, when this Bill is passed, and to produce a comprehensive guide book. Accepting part of what the Senator says about the importance of consolidation and a guide book, I am convinced that a well prepared guide book is of extreme value to individuals to enable them to interpret and understand clearly what is <Col N="660" /> involved in any legislation, especially legislation affecting workers.  On the grounds that general consolidation will be attempted later, it is proposed that these two attempts at consolidation in the sections would not be desirable at the present.  Consolidation should not be attempted lightly.  Careful preparation and examination is necessary to ensure that the law remains as enacted.  This is in no way a criticism of the Senator's amendment but it illustrates my point.</P>
      <P>The attempt at consolidation that the Senator has submitted is wrong in that it includes subsection (3) without the amendment carried out in the Schedule to the Bill, at section 15 (3).  The only reason I am saying this is that I fully understand how any of us can slip into a situation like this.  It indicates what I said, that careful preparation and detailed examination is necessary to ensure that consolidation is properly tackled and, when it is attempted, that it is in respect of the entire legislation.  It is something that should not be taken lightly. It is our intention to consolidate the Acts and to issue a guide book.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 20, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20.&mdash;Section 10 of the Act of 1971 shall have effect as if the following paragraphs were inserted after paragraph (c):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(d) The date of commencement of a person's employment shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be the date given in evidence by the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> (e) If it appears to an employee that insufficient compensation was awarded by the Employment Appeals Tribunal by reason of a deficiency in an employer's records, a claim may be made by the employee to the Tribunal for an amending Order within twelve months after the date of the Tribunal's decision, and the Tribunal shall, at its discretion, amend or confirm the decision previously made.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to extend the presumption already enacted for the benefit of employees under section 10 of the 1971 Act.  It is to enable the Employment Appeals Tribunal to amend an award if an employee is at a loss due to deficiences in the employer's records. Certain presumptions are made as regards the question of continuity of employment.  They are not very satisfactory to the tribunal.  They need quite a lot of modification.  As I said on Second Stage, some of the evidence is stranger than fiction.  That does not help the person who is in trouble.  Our officials are regularly engaged in trying to get around this even though the tribunal are very helpful and have solved a lot of problems in this area.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately employees do not have verification of the evidence before the tribunal make a decision.  That is why the section needs amendment.  Disputed parts of service and so on comes into it and the employee is at a great loss which arises out of a deficiency in the employer's records.  The amendment would ensure that employers would not be in breach of statutory duties by not giving notice.  The employee would be able to make his claim properly to the tribunal, particularly if he had verification of his evidence.</P>

      <P>The aim is, as Senator Harte has said, that in the absence of records the employee's word should be taken as regards the commencement date.  First of all, I am not aware that this problem causes any real difficulties.  I believe, and it is felt generally, that in cases of this nature, it is best left to the tribunal to decide on <Col N="662" /> the merits of the case.  In fact, the amendment as worded could, in some instances, be unfair to employees.</P>
      <P>As regards (e), it is felt the decisions of the tribunal must have some degree of finality.  Decisions of the tribunal are final and conclusive and should remain so.  In any event, in a doubtful case, the hearing may be adjourned for detailed investigation and this is not uncommon. The tribunal have all the necessary powers to examine evidence and records. The number of cases where problems would arise because of the deficiency of employer's records would be insignificant and it would not warrant an amendment of this nature.  To be fair to the tribunal and the experience they have, they have gone to great extremes to help in these cases and I am not aware of it having caused many or serious problems.</P>

      <P>As a result of an amendment introduced by Deputy Ryan on Committee Stage in the Dáil, I introduced on Report Stage, an amendment to take care of where I believed the greatest hardship could be created in this situation.  In other words, we have implemented 90 per cent of what is in this amendment as a result of the Dáil amendment.  This is now incorporated in paragraph 4 (A), column (2) of Schedule 3.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan's amendment sought to have any period of notice which an employer had failed to give under the Minimal Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, allowed as reckonable service for redundancy purposes.  From an examination we made on this, the most serious problems of redundancy entitlement arose where an employee failed to qualify for redundancy payments because he just fell short of the 104 weeks' qualifying period.  This is where our sympathy lay.  The amendment now included in the Bill takes care of these cases by allowing the employment appeals tribunal to hold that the period of statutory minimum notice not given to such an employee shall be included as continuous service for the purpose of the entitlement.  I do not believe there is need for that service to be reckonable for qualification purposes. The factor in the total service period is so minimal that it does not justify this amendment.  The hardship was created where somebody did not qualify because he had not the 104 weeks.  I am sure that meets 90 per cent of what the Senator wishes.  The other 10 per cent, with the time factor being so small, would hardly justify an amendment.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;If an employee is absent from his employment by reason of any of the following&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a question of harmonising the 1967 Act with Schedule 1 of the 1973 Act.  The existing rule in the 1967 Act is seen by many people to be unfair to employees who are absent from their work due to illness, particularly during a business failure.  I can see the point they are making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not aware of any great problems being caused in this regard.  As I understand it, the argument behind this amendment is that the word &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; is two-sided, so that an employee who leaves because of, for example, sickness or lay-off, must resume work before he can claim redundancy. Should an employee be dismissed within defined periods while out sick or on lay-off, and the firm subsequently <Col N="665" /> closes down before resumption of work by the employee, that employee would have no redundancy entitlement since his continuity of employment is broken at the point of dismissal and he could not, or did not, avail of the provisions of the Act to enable him to negative the dismissal and re-establish his continuity by resuming work before the closure.</P>
      <P>The provisions in question enable a man who has been dismissed in certain circumstances to resume work with the same employer and thus preserve continuity notwithstanding the dismissal.  It is not clear why the legislation should come to the aid of a man who accepts the dismissal as final and does not take steps to negative it.  I am not sure why the Senator wants to do that.  If a man does not take steps to negative the dismissal that is sent to him, I am not sure why we should try to protect it here.  If the employee feels he was dismissed because of redundancy and has not been paid a lump sum, it is open to him to bring his case to the tribunal.  Where the tribunal finds in his favour he will be paid directly from the fund, should his firm be insolvent.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;12A. If the continuous service of an employee is not broken for the purposes of the Minimum Notice and Conditions of Employment Act, 1973, it shall not be broken for the purposes of this Act.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment harmonises the rules on continuous employment in the Acts of 1967 and 1973.  It provides that if service is not broken for minimum notice, it is not broken for redundancy payments. There is so much overlapping between the minimum notice, the unfair dismissals and the redundancy measures in the day-to-day dealings of trade union officials that it is necessary to draw attention to the problems in this area.  If this amendment is inserted after paragraph 12, it will harmonise the Acts.</P>

      <P>The concept of continuous employment is spelt out in great detail in the Redundancy Acts as against a few lines in the Act dealing with minimum notice.  The Redundancy Acts have provisions in relation to continuity far superior to anything in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act and the necessity for absolute conformity is not accepted.  The continuous service aspect in the Redundancy Payments Acts is far more comprehensive and advantageous to beneficiaries than is the Minimum <Col N="667" /> Notice and Terms of Employment Act.

      <P>This amendment is similar to amendments put down by certain Senators, in particular Senators West and Martin.  It is related to other amendments that have been mentioned. Its purpose is to enable sea anglers to be registered in the same way as trout and coarse fish anglers.  That is the spirit of the amendments of Senator West and Senator Martin.  We have met this by the Government amendment.  I agree that sea anglers should be included on the Register of Trout and Coarse Fish Anglers on payment of voluntary subscription. It was an omission in the first instance, and following publication of the Bill we received representations from the Federation of Sea Anglers.  I am glad to be able to accede to the suggestion and the amendments that define sea anglers as having a similar right to be included on this register on payment of a voluntary subscription will entitle them to their voting rights to the regional boards in the same way as trout and coarse fish anglers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1) (b), line 25, to delete &ldquo;(including administrative policy)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (1), reads:</P>
      <P>(b) The Minister shall from time to time give to the Central Board directions containing general policy (including administrative policy) for the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of fisheries or for the protection of molluscs, and the Central Board shall, if so directed by the Minister, as soon as may be, communicate to every regional board any direction given by the Minister under this paragraph.</P>
      <P>It seemed to us that the Minister should give generously to the Central Board control over their own internal working with regard to staff and with regard to day-to-day arrangements.  The subsection by and large is unexceptionable. The Minister is seeking too rigid a control, too large a role, too minute a supervision when he says that he shall:</P>
      <P>... from time to time give to the Central Board directions containing general policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is fine for the management of conservation, but when he says for</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" />&mdash;&mdash;general policy (including administrative policy),</P>
    <P>that seems to get very close to the small day-to-day, minute workings of the central board.  Senator West and I would feel happier if that parenthesis &ldquo;(including administrative policy)&rdquo; which seems obtrusive as it stands and does not even help the syntax of the section, were deleted.  Why is the Minister so jealous of that opportunity to intervene?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I studied this amendment since it was put down by Senators West and Martin and am inclined to the view that Senator Martin expressed, that it really is superfluous and sticks out needlessly.  The Minister has sufficient power in the global introduction of subsection (6), that</P>
      <P>... the Minister shall from time to time give to the Central Board directions containing general policy for the management, conservation, protection, and so on.</P>
      <P>It should not include administrative policy.  That should be a matter for the board.  Accordingly, I am willing to accept the amendment to delete the three words in parenthesis &ldquo;(including administrative policy)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to sound churlish, having regard to the manner in which the Minister has met the amendment, but the Minister is not taking away from the section by deleting the words, because when he retains power to give directions containing general policy for the &ldquo;management&rdquo;, that obviously lets him into the administrative field in great detail.  This sub-paragraph gives to the Minister undue powers over something that the Commission intended to be autonomous or almost autonomous.  I can see that the Minister who has the role of big brother in this whole area, might feel the need to retain some legal powers, but it shows a lack of confidence in the boards that are going to be set up to run their own affairs. They should have autonomy, as was <Col N="673" /> recommended by the Commission.  I criticise the entire paragraph on the grounds that it retains for the Minister powers of excessive control and interference in the workings of the Central Fisheries Board and through the central board, the regional boards.  Has the Minister anything to say as to how, if at all, he sees this power being excercised? Is it just there as a back-stop in the unlikely event of the central board not discharging their functions in the way we all hope they will?  Will the Minister just have this power in reserve, to come in and keep up their operations?  Is that the spirit in which the Minister has included this paragraph in the Bill, or does the Minister mean to lay down policies for the Central Fisheries Board for the management, conservation, and so on? Is the Minister going to tell them in advance how to do their business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This kind of point comes up in every situation where one has to strike this balance between the Minister and whatever board or authority is being set up under the Minister.  I envisage this board being very much an autonomous board that will make their own policy and will operate in conjunction with the local feeling as it comes through the regional boards.  This should not preclude the Minister for Fisheries of the day from giving directions to the board concerning general policy about management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of fisheries from time to time, as an additional function.  For example, a situation which arose last summer may rise this summer, that is, the question of co-ordinating the Garda Síochána and the Naval Service with the various protection staffs throughout the country in the protection of our salmon stocks and in dealing with illegal fishing. That is obviously an area where the Minister for Fisheries would have to co-operate with the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice to ensure that certain directions were given to the central board and through them to the regional boards to ensure co-ordination and co-operation between the various State forces, in ensuring the conservation of a certain species.  I envisage a <Col N="674" /> situation arising from time to time where the Minister of the day should, in the interests of fisheries development and conservation, give the required directions to the central board, but I envisage such functions being exercised very much in a supplemental capacity.  The board would be, largely, the maker of their own policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What would be the position in the event of disagreement between the board and the Minister in regard to a direction?  I know that the Minister has power to change the board, but as they will be elected that might not be so easy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>All that the subsection envisages is that such direction be conveyed by the central board, if directed to do so to every regional board.  In the last analysis, the Minister has financial control of the Estimates and so on, and, as Senator Cooney said, of removal.  That sort of thing is unlikely to arise.  It is not intended that it should arise, but it is important that this should be there so as to ensure that where the central board is incapable, by reason of its structure, as in the case I just mentioned, the Minister can come in and tell them to tell all the regional boards throughout the country that the Naval Service and the Garda are co-operating in X manner in fishery conservation during a certain period and to make sure that the staffs are ready at particular points to co-operate in this sort of operation.  In the last analysis there are only two controls, the removal of the board and the withdrawal of finance.  But one should not approach what I regard as a constructive measure in that way.  They are the kind of eventualities which I hope will not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more consistent, perhaps, with the explanation the Minister has given of this power as a supplemental one, if he would agree to change the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the first line to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; implies, as far as I am concerned, that the Central Board is dependent on the receipt of directions from the Minister.</P>

      <P>The deletion of the last three-and-a-half lines in subsection (b) (i) would give something positive to the board.  Having had the consultation with the Minister and a direction from him with regard to policy they could decide on what basis they would carry out their policy subsequently in relation to the regional boards.  The Minister will see the desirability of this.  The central board, in accordance with its constitution as drafted in this legislation, will be a board of people with very great expertise, who are involved in and have a deep interest in the fishing industry and will be people in whom this Minister or, indeed, any Minister will have the fullest confidence. It is somewhat unique that there should be control to the degree that the section here would dictate.  I am sure the Minister would agree with that.</P>

I will consider making that overall direction requirement discretionary by introducing &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  That is a better way to deal with it rather than the way Senators Moynihan and Robinson suggest.  What they are asking me to do <Col N="676" /> in their amendment is to delete the conveying of this direction to the regional boards, so that the direction having been conveyed to the central board would not be conveyed by them to the regional boards.

An annual development programme may not make a lot of sense, as much of the work that must be done to develop fisheries would be more appropriate to a policy or a programme extending over a longer period than one year.

      <P>It is not really necessary to incorporate the point of view expressed here in a section of the Bill.  Much of the programming necessary with regard <Col N="677" /> to the development of inland fisheries is, by its very nature, long term or medium term.  That goes without saying.  That would follow as a matter of practicality. Putting in any period, such as a three-year or a five-year period, actually adds if anything to the restrictive nature of it. The very nature of the planning and programming involved is either medium term or long term.  Any annual programme that will be submitted will be a programme which will take into account the medium term and the long term. There is nothing in the section as it stands to preclude medium term and long term planning.  Within that context an annual programme can be submitted. I really do not see the reason for what is envisaged in the amendment, as that can take place within the scope of the section as it stands.  The annual submission of a development programme will in effect take account of the medium and long term aspects involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister would see his own role being fairly benignly remote from the inner workings of the central board.  To the layman it looks as if having to submit a yearly plan, would really be holding the central board accountable in a very schoolmasterly way.  It would almost seem as if it were policing the operation very closely.  From what the Minister says I gather that he would not wish to exercise that kind of draconian surveillance over the whole operation.</P>
      <P>The board would perhaps operate more creatively, if it were not held accountable in a short-term way for what they were doing but given a chance to initiate programmes which would begin to bear fruit in a long-term rather than a short-term way.  That is the spirit behind the amendment.  It is not an amendment that I would press with any great force; indeed, it is not an amendment that would occur to me at all if I thought that a Minister of the noted benignity of the present Minister could be perpetually envisaged in the role.  Would the Minister not agree that less charismatic people may come in his place and it might be better to have a three-year rather than a one-year programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the <Col N="678" /> case for the amendment when he said that most of the programmes would have to be designed to cater for medium-and long-term fisheries interests rather than annual or short-term ones. Presumably, the central board will produce an annual report.  In that report the ordinary year-to-year problems or ideas that might emerge can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to hear that Senator Martin is now hesitant about pushing the amendment.  We feel it is a very good amendment because, particularly so far as inland fisheries are concerned, the great numbers of people interested are ordinary people who will not be that involved in programming of any sort if it is done on a very regular basis.  If people, particularly fishery clubs around the country, know that the fisheries board have a policy or a programme designed for a three-year or five-year period they can make their contribution and work to that.</P>
      <P>For that reason it is important that so far as programmes for development are concerned, instead of having something which might develop into a stop-go policy, certain fundamental policies are laid down in a programme that everybody knows will last for three years or five years and everybody can work to that.  The Minister said it does not matter whether it is three years, five years, or ten years.  I accept that.  We can speak in terms of three years or five years, but to make it annual makes a farce of the programme.</P>

      <P>There is not much between us.  We all agree, of course, that we cannot carve up fisheries development or planning into a 12 monthly cycle as it were.  At the same time, I would suggest there must be some degree of accountability or discipline involved if only to get the necessary finance each year, which is an important aspect, and to make the necessary financial case.  What I would envisage here is an updating or adjusting of a continuing on-going programme or plan.  I envisage that sort of programme.  We are not dealing here with consumer products, or anything of that kind.  We are dealing with a basic, living, continuing thing.</P>

      <P>Each year the programme for development will be updated, adjusted, changed, and new ideas will be introduced as a gloss on the programme.  Really the important aspect is the financial aspect.  Each year the Central Fisheries Board will be looking for money and, in order to obtain money, the plan will have to be updated, adjusted, modified, switched, or approved, and these changes may involve cost and money may be required.  It is in relation to the actual accountability and financial requirements of such a programme being presented each year that I envisage the yearly aspect.  It certainly should not preclude what I referred to as the medium- and long-term planning which is the very essence of the sort of work that will be involved here.  I would envisage something like a ten-year programme which could be drawn up fairly quickly by the existing personnel within the various organisations like the Inland Fisheries Trust, and so on.  I would imagine that the first task of the new Central Fisheries Board would be to prepare such a long-term plan with medium-term variations and as a necessary discipline in order to secure the necessary finance from the Minister of the day, they could come forward within that overall umbrella planning with their financial requirements to fit in with the forward planning in each financial year. In the context of making sure that there is discipline in regard to planning and that the case will be made properly for the necessary finance each year, the section as it stands meets both points of view.</P>

    <P>This amendment is intended to give greater powers to the Central Fisheries Board with regard to research.  It is desirable that their research function should be quite clear, that they should have full powers of research and that the present work being done by the Inland <Col N="681" /> Fisheries Trust in that area should be continued untrammelled and possibly expanded by the central board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree to this amendment.  I want to make it quite clear what we are trying to do here.  We are trying to avoid any duplication with regard to research.  As everybody knows, research work of any kind is very difficult to control.  It is expensive and it is a most important area in which there should be some control and co-ordination.  As it stands at present, as far as the administrative structure within my Department is concerned, marine research work and experimental work are within the scientific section of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  I had the pleasure of opening an excellent new laboratory concerned with fish biology and pathology at Abbotstown recently.  It is a fully staffed modern research scientific laboratory concerned with marine biology, marine pathology, marine life and the various species of marine life.</P>
      <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust are doing a different job.  They are concerned with inland fish as against marine fish.  They have laboratory, scientific and research facilities available at their headquarters. The new Central Fisheries Board will subsume the operations at present being carried out by the Inland Fisheries Trust in this area.  What I am providing is a clear line of demarcation for what the new Central Fisheries Board will do, that is, continue to develop and expand the work of research and experimentation which heretofore has been carried out by the trust.  Work in regard to various species of trout and coarse fish now being done by the trust will be done in future by the Central Fisheries Board. Marine fish as a species will remain separated from that and continue to be under the division where it now resides in a division of the Department of Fisheries.  That is the purpose of the section as it stands.  The amendment would lead to the danger of an obvious duplication where the new board will be going away from fresh water experimentation and research and into marine research and experimentation.</P>

      <P>Between now and the next Stage the Minister might think a bit about that again in the light of what normally goes on in any organisation and who does what.  The Minister has defined the best way of handling it, but I am told that some forms of sea fish which have no commercial value but are very good from a tourist point of view have been getting some development work from the Inland Fisheries Trust, fish such as shark, tope and skate.  I should like to be sure that, when something is being passed from one Department to another, any existing work of this kind would be continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment in regard to inland waters the trust and the new board have got laboratory facilities and specialists who can deal with various species of trout and coarse fish. That is fair enough.  The inland waters or fresh waters are within their ambit and control.  When you are into the marine area, you are into a different area altogether.  The trust go in for the sporting side of sea angling and, consequent on the amendment in the names of Senator Martin and Senator West which I have accepted, sea anglers will now be incorporated into the Bill in the same way as coarse and trout anglers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research and scientific investigation into sea fish is a far different discipline because you literally cannot corral them in inland waters and tanks to the same degree.  There is a different discipline and a much more complicated discipline. The Inland Fisheries Trust do not intend to go into that area, nor will this board try to do so.  We have a very highly specialised professional staff dealing with that within the scientific division of my Department.  They are fairly independent. They are located in a specific premises in Abbotstown.  They work in regular conjunction and consultation with their professional colleagues attached to similar divisions of marine departments throughout the world; members of such international organisations as ICES, and so on.  They are, in the scientific terminology and discipline, regarded as being two separate areas&mdash;the marine and the fresh water, <Col N="683" /> not just nationally but internationally. They are two separate areas and the disciplines are separate and the methods of going about the job in scientific terms are different.</P>
    <P>I have looked into this from the administrative point of view.  The two are there as separate organisations at present. The new board will be taking over one of them, the fresh water one, from the trust.  It will be subsumed in the new organisation.  The other marine side is a highly specialised international area.  The findings and investigations carried out with regard to marine experimentation and research are world wide.  what happens off the coast of Ireland happens off the coast of Greenland or Japan, and there is a mutual exchange of information, research, knowledge and so on. They are two separate areas in this field of biology and scientific research.  The inland and the sea are two separate areas, two separate disciplines.</P>

It is half marine and half fresh water.  It is <i>sui generis</i>, a case on its own.  The sort of work in which they will be engaged is a different type of work, with a different type of concentration. There is no conflict at all.</P>
      <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust personnel concentrate on their investigations into the development of coarse fish and trout in fresh water.  They are quite happy with that.  They will be subsumed in the new board.  The marine side is embodied in the scientific division of the Department of Fisheries located in Abbotstown. That is a separate division concerned with marine shellfish and salmon life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask one question in relation to section 7 which sets out the functions the Central Fisheries Board will have in the future.  It seems to me that, of all the functions given to them, one of the most important functions they should have is authority to deal with the present pollution problems that exist in some rivers.  Does the Minister envisage that the central board will have any such powers?  A short time ago legislation was passed giving the local authorities such powers, and very great powers in the area of pollution. At that time many people made the point that local authorities are quite frequently themselves the creators of pollution disasters.</P>
      <P>A new board like this should be concerned about pollution.  We can talk about research and development, and conservation and poaching, but surely the greatest problems in our inland fisheries today arise from pollution and the absence of good quality water in our rivers.  In view of the doubts in some people's minds about the responsibility of local authorities in this respect powers should be given to the central board and, through them, to the regional boards and they should have an important say where private businesses or local authorities are guilty of polluting our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that.  It is a very important point.  It is unquestionable that, over the past five, six or seven years local authorities have been successfully prosecuted for polluting inland waterways.  What Senator Molony raised is a little oblique to the amendments Senator West and I have tabled.  I am happy with the Minister's answers to these amendments.  I am graeeful to him for accepting one of them in particular. <Col N="685" /> On the question Senator Molony has raised, will this board have any statutory powers, any role at all in relation to local government and the operations of local government or their agents in the whole area of the pollution of inland waterways, fisheries and so on?  Will it have teeth of any kind in that connection? This is a very timely inquiry from this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I add to the Minister's problem by adding to the query?  If the central board have power to prosecute for pollution, does the discharge by a local authority of raw sewage into, for example, the Shannon at Athlone, constitute pollution and enable the board to mount a prosecution against the local authority?  I should like to know that because that type of pollution is taking place all over Ireland.  It has to be stopped.</P>

      <P>This discussion is more relevant to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, which I have here to hand and which has been passed, as everybody knows.  There is no point in going back over-much on that Act.  The fact of the matter is that for good or ill we have decided here&mdash;and enshrined it in legislation&mdash;to give the enforcement powers to the local authorities.  If you like, it is an act of faith in the hope that the poacher turned gamekeeper will work out.  Undoubtedly, as has been said by Senators, local authorities have been polluters over the years, unfortunately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about that.  They now have extensive powers under this legislation.  Practically all of them have set up specific units to deal with water pollution, with an engineer in charge in each local authority throughout the country.  They have specific powers to deal with this problem and they have the function of implementing the Act.  There is provision here in the Water Pollution Act for close liaison between the county councils and the boards which will be established now and which will stand in the place of the <Col N="686" /> boards of conservators.  Without having a complete debate on the rights or wrongs of placing this responsibility on local authorities, I do not see much point in following it up here.  That decision has been taken for good or ill.  Hopefully it will work.  I could talk here for an hour on the terrible wrongs of pollution.  The hope is that the local authorities will now get to grips with the problem.</P>
      <P>The various interested fisheries bodies, including my Department, are represented on the overall council, the Water Pollution Council who act as an advisory council to the Minister for the Environment and serve as his watch-dog in seeking to ensure that the Water Pollution Act is fully implemented.  Beyond that, there is very little I can say about it on this measure.  That has been decided in the Act passed by the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to rethink this area because everybody accepts that local authorities cause pollution. The Minister was careful to say over the years rather than currently.  It is happening currently.  I did not know it happened in Athlone, but I know it happens in many places throughout the country.  I doubt that the local authorities needed the saver they have under the Water Pollution Act.  I would imagine that on the same reasoning or apparent logic, one local authority, Dublin City Council, could pursue Dr. Martin, Chairman of the mediaeval Dublin group, for costs and damages to save the taxpayers' money.  By the same reasoning they could not prosecute themselves for doing damage because the damages would come from the taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board will be primarily responsible for the development of our fisheries.  The number one hindrance to proper development in fisheries is pollution.  We have problems with poaching and problems with research that should have been carried out before.  Those things may all be done but, unless proper control of pollution is brought into effect straight away, many <Col N="688" /> of our rivers will be completely without fish.  Then there will not be any reason to have a central board or regional fishery boards.  Between now and Report Stage would the Minister seriously consider giving powers to the Central Fisheries Board to prosecute where necessary, anybody causing pollution whether it be a private interest or a local authority?  If they have not got some power in that regard, their other powers are superfluous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice strenuously to that.  This aspect has emerged in the discussion on the section. When we give our assent to it, it is gone.  But, of course, the Report Stage does arise.  I could almost sense in the Minister a certain anxiety about this.  It is admirable to have a Central Fisheries Board.  All the functions and ministries that have been granted to them, and all the amenities they will grant us are very reassuring.  They would seem to me to be seriously stripped of essential power if in going about their daily business they were frustrated by the pollution of the waters by a noted agent of pollution, the local government authorities.  That they should suddenly become immune from prosecution by the Central Fisheries Board seems to me to emasculate the powers of that board very considerably. There is a perplexity here and I sympathise with the Minister with regard to it.  There is a definite problem here and it has to be faced.  Poaching and pollution: I do not know which of them is the more grievous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act is quite specific and all of us here and in the Dáil who participated in the debate on the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill remember that a major issue in the debate on that Bill was whether the local authorities who were such dreadful sinners in this respect should be given the job and the burden of dealing with water pollution and enforcing the very stringent regulations and licensing arrangements under what is now the Act. The balance of decision as come to by the previous Government&mdash;and indeed I agree with them in this respect&mdash;was that the local authorities, by reason of where they are situated and the personnel available to them, the engineering personnel in particular, were the people best equipped to deal with this job.  Time will tell whether or not that was a right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, the local authorities have been very active in recruiting staffs for this job and are setting up units or departments within each county council and corporation area specialising in pollution matters, and the type of misdemeanour they committed in the past should disappear under this administrative thrust.  It is hardly practicable for me in this Bill to incorporate an amendment of a separate piece of legislation.  If we were discussing the Water Pollution Act it would be hardly right or proper to have a situation where the actual enforcing body, itself given by law the whole task of enforcement in regard to water pollution, could be prosecuted.  In other words, a prosecution would lie with any other body in the <Col N="690" /> State against the actual enforcement authority.  When you examine it the whole way it does not appear to make sense that the people who are charged with the responsibility of enforcing the law would in effect be open to prosecution themselves.  The Water Pollution Act removes the right to prosecute the local authorities but retains the right to the regional board or the central board, replacing the old boards of conservators, to prosecute anybody else other than the enforcement body.</P>
    <P>If the central board or the regional boards make a case of pollution known to a local authority, and the regional boards will have the staff who will know when a river or lake is being polluted, they make it known to the officer in charge of the enforcement authority, that is, the county council.  They make it known to the engineer or the officer charged with responsibility for dealing with pollution under this Act that a particular body is polluting a particular stretch of water.  One can take it that in that situation the officer in charge of enforcement will take the appropriate action. Otherwise, the whole situation would be absolutely mad.  That is the situation.  There are two separate schemes in the legislation, one dealing with water pollution, and the other dealing with fisheries administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>In Athlone if the local authority are causing pollution by letting raw sewage into the River Shannon, what is the point in the Central Fisheries Board writing and saying: &ldquo;We know you are doing this now and you know it&rdquo;?  In the past when people complained that local authorities were polluting rivers, and the local authorities took no action, a prosecution had to be brought. In many instances, I believe that even after the prosecution pollution continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand why the local authorities were given those powers initially. In the structures that are being set up now under this Bill, an opportunity arises to improve on the position.  I favour the fisheries regional and central boards having full power in this field.  I accept there might be administrative difficulties involved in doing that.  There is <Col N="691" /> one blind spot, that is in relation to the local authorities being immune from prosecution.  They had to be immune from prosecution or they would be prosecuting themselves.  Why not give the power to the Central Fisheries Board or the regional boards in this measure to deal with that blind spot and tighten it up to the extent that we might save some of our waters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the matter examined between now and Report Stage.  I will consult with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, who is charged with the responsibility of enforcement in this area.  I will come back to the Seanad on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very forthcoming on this matter and I do appreciate the difficulty in which he finds himself; it is not for him to legislate for another Department.  To anticipate slightly, surely the question that will arise in section 10 might be asked before we close this section&mdash;the question of submitting a yearly report to the Minister?  A very effective way around the difficulty would be for the board to have the right to publish that yearly report.  Such yearly report could be turned to very good effect, if not to prosecute, if it were possible, in this report, to put the finger on whoever was, in fact, polluting or in any other way endangering our fisheries.  In default of being able to bring an action in court it would be very useful if the central board could publish a report yearly in which they could, in fact, either accuse, condemn, or criticise what local authorities were doing in the whole area of pollution.</P>

      <P>Excuse me one minute.  It is almost 7 <Col N="692" /> o'clock and on ordering business at the beginning of the day it was agreed to take Item No. 6&mdash;that is the EEC motion&mdash;at 7 p.m.  Is the section agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to make a few brief points.  Section 7 (1) (ii) says that the central board shall ensure:</P>
      <P>that any fishery, hatchery or fish farm which is in its possession or occupation is managed, conserved, protected, developed and improved....</P>
      <P>This is an important power being given to the central board.  That power, however, is limited by the section to waters in the possession or occupation of the central board.  There must be many miles of trout river and coarse fishing rivers, and many thousands of acres of lakes&mdash;coarse fishing lakes in particular&mdash;which are not in the possession or occupation of the board and are unlikely, at any stage, to come into their possession or occupation.  Consequently, the board will have no power to manage, conserve, protect or develop the fish in these particular waters.  The board should have power to improve the fishing in waters that might not necessarily be in their possession, or waters to which the title would be obscure or, indeed, to which there would be no title in any identified person or corporation.  If the ambition of the commission report&mdash;to improve fishing generally throughout the country&mdash;is to be achieved, the powers of the board cannot be limited to waters within their possession or occupation.  That is the first point I would like to make to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The second point again arises from the non-implementation, if you like, of the recommendation of the commission; the commission had in mind that a single authority would be provided for the State.  The Bill, as we know, sets up a central board and there is power for the Minister to set up regional boards and to define the areas in which they will operate.  It would be more efficient, and less administratively wasteful, if one body were to be given control for the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always apprehensive when I see regional boards being provided for; there <Col N="693" /> always follows a certain inevitable duplication of administrative procedures. Inevitably, Parkinson's Law has a fertile area in which to operate in that sort of situation.  There should be a single authority, one that would enable more mobility to be achieved in relation to the staff serving the board.  If there are regional boards there will be staff for them who will not be anxious to move outside their regions.  You could have administrative blocs with less efficient operation.  This would be avoided if there were a single authority and a single staff, with the mobility which that would give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with Senator Cooney's points.  First of all, with regard to 1(a)(ii) of section 7 to which the Senator referred, that is not an exclusive power.  The subsection states that a central board shall ensure that any fishery, hatchery or fish market in its possession or occupation is managed, and so on.  That does not exclude the far wider power which is included at (c), where the central board shall, each year prepare and submit to the Minister for consideration an inland fisheries development programme prepared under this section, and so on, and it may contain recommendations regarding the conservation of such fisheries, and so on.  The board has a very positive function under that subsection in relation to fisheries that it does not actually possess or occupy.  That is the wider and more important power and function of the board, and I agree with Senator Cooney that it would have to have such a wide and important power or function in relation to fisheries, not just in its ownership or occupation but over the area of fisheries as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point that Senator Cooney mentioned is, of course, a fundamental one.  It is the question of whether or not the board should be regionalised in the manner in which it is; and, on balance, I am in favour of regionalisation.  There are arguments for what Senator Cooney says; there will, however, be mobility of the central board staff who would be there to do research, development and promotional work on a nation-wide scale, in that the Inland Fisheries Trust staff that is now there will be, in effect, <Col N="694" /> the staff of the new central board.  They will do research and development work across the board in all the regional areas. The regional areas, as such, would be largely concerned with protection work on the ground, which by reason of its police nature, can be done better by a regionally organised body containing, in a particular river catchment area, staff with local knowledge and the local know-how and information to deal with the prosecution or enforcement side of the protection aspect.  That requires local or regional management, I would suggest, but the overall national development work and research work, much of which is done by the present Inland Fisheries Trust, will now be absorbed into the structure of the new central board that will operate on national basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on the Commission's Communication concerning Forestry Policy in the European Community.</P>
      <P>This is an aspect of policy which, perhaps, it would be easy for us to let go almost by neglect.  This is not, perhaps, relevant to us; we have only a very small area of forestry in this country; relatively few people are involved in forestry; we do not have a timber industry of any significance or magnitude. I would suggest, however, that it is, perhaps, precisely because of these reasons that we should be taking a very close look, indeed, at the European Community proposals regarding forestry.  There is also, the fact that forests throughout the world are a very rapidly diminishing natural resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the Indian sub-continent, through Asia, through most of Africa, now through South America, forests are <Col N="695" /> being depleted at an enormous rate. They have been depleted at the sort of rate from which we ourselves suffered over the past few centuries.  This is having very major effects, both in the availability of timber and forest products throughout the world and many other ecological effects that could be of considerable significance.</P>
    <P>Another very little realised but major aspect regarding forestry and timber products is that next to oil and hydrocarbons, the major import of the European Economic Community is timber and forest products, amounting to something in the region of 8,000 million units of account in the last year for which records are available.  It is the second major import, both of the Community as a whole and of every single individual state within the Community, including this country.  The imports have doubled over recent years.  They are steadily increasing as each year goes by and, as technology develops, the likelihood is that dependence on timber as a natural resource will increase rather than diminish as new uses are found in the manufacturing industry generally and in the chemical industry, as well as in the more usual aspects of construction business and so on.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing world-wide shortage which has been largely neglected.  Just as, up to eight or nine years ago, we took oil and our sources of it for granted, in the same way there is an approaching crisis in supplies of timber and forest products.  We are, perhaps, the worst situated of any of the countries in the Community in relation to this.  We have made major efforts in recent years to increase our acreage of forestry, which is good.  We have also attempted to develop some timber industry. This is also good and is something we have to look at very closely.  Indeed, there are aspects of our timber industry which are very relevant to this resport which the commission is putting forward and which the Joint Committee and sub-committees have been considering.</P>
    <P>Our reasons for requesting this debate are the great importance of the subject and its particular relevance to this <Col N="696" /> country, and certain special problems that are specific to this country.  The official title of the commission's communication is Forestry Policy of the European Community and it was dated Brussels, 1 December 1978.  In it the commission indicate their intention to propose the development of a common forestry policy.  They are not suggesting uniformity of forestry policy but are suggesting that there should be a common policy.  The report reviews Community action in the forestry area to date.  It considers the actual structure and ownership of forests and there are very marked differences between the situation in this country and in other countries of the EEC <i>vis-a-vis</i> State ownership and private ownership.  These differences in ownership present certain major problems to this country.  The report also goes into such matters as conservation, protection of the environment&mdash;to which we are paying so much more attention nowadays&mdash;the access and recreation matters, wildlife management and so on.  It also goes into some slight detail on the actual legislation regarding forestry, taxation proposals, information and such like matters&mdash;the general instruments of forestry policy.</P>
    <P>The report is basically a statement of aims rather than the design for specific action.  It has two very specific draft proposals.  One is that there be a Council resolution concerning the objectives and principles of forestry policy.  The other draft proposal is for a Council decision to set up a permanent forestry committee representing the EEC.  Incidentally, there is some slight doubt as to the actual entitlement of the EEC Commission and Council to involve themselves in forestry policies.  I do not think this was specifically covered under the EEC treaties and agreements.  However, it is generally accepted that forestry is, and should be, allied to, and considered in the same light as, agriculture.  I am sure we in this country would wish to do so. We do not wish to see good agricultural land being turned over to forestry, or any conflict between land used for forestry and land used for agriculture&mdash;there is no need for such a conflict.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Another relevant aspect is the implications of forestry policy <i>vis-a-vis</i> regional policy.  It would be our view that these two should be considered in a single context and this particular aspect is very relevant to certain developments which appear to be taking place.</P>
    <P>Forestry in the Community generally is a major industry.  No less than 21 per cent of the total land area of the EEC is in forests.  We tend to think of Germany as being the main forest area but France accounts for about 45 per cent of the total.  A table on page 11 of the report gives details of the forest area in hectares. Very substantial areas of Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and even of the UK and Luxembourg, are covered in forest.  The only very small percentage of land area relates to this country.  No less than 32 per cent of the Luxembourg area has forest; 20 per cent of Belgium; 29 per cent of Germany; 25 per cent of France, and even Denmark, which tends to be regarded as treeless, has nearly three times our forest area, and the Netherlands and the UK have twice the percentage.</P>
    <P>Despite all the excellent efforts that have been made over the last few years, we are still very far behind when one related these to the opportunities for forestry in Ireland and the ravages which have occurred over the last 200 or 300 years in relation to this very important and increasingly valuable natural resource.  At present only about 5 per cent of our land area is covered by forests.  Of this, about 670,000 acres are in State forest and about 202,000 acres in private forest.  It is given in much detail, in the report of the Minister, for the Forest and Wildlife Service, which indicates that direct employment in the State forests at present is about 2,530. There is a very interesting point that, despite the small percentage of forest in Ireland the actual rate of growth per hectare, per acre in Ireland, is the highest in the Community.  Certain areas of land, which are not suitable for agriculture, have better potential for forestry than anywhere else in western Europe and are probably among the best in the world.  The trees grow rapidly and yet they do not suffer from the softening <Col N="698" /> which occurs in other areas of rapid growth, so there is timber which grows relatively rapidly and which is of very high quality.</P>
    <P>The actual details of the objectives and principles of the forestry policy, which are being proposed by the Commission, are in terms of general principles. Page 72 of the report states:</P>
    <P>Forests should be protected and managed as a renewable resource to supply products and services which are essential to the quality of life in the European Community now and in the future.  The main objectives should be: a sustainable increase in the economic production of timber, the conservation and improvement of the environment, public access to forests for recreation and, where practicable, these objectives should be pursued in conjunction with one another by multiple use management, the weight to be attached to each being varied according to ownership and the particular needs at a given place and time.</P>
    <P>In general, we would agree with that. The fact that our forests are, very largely, State forests means that there is good public access.  I am sure many Senators have taken advantage of the many improvements for which the Forest and Wildlife Service have been responsible in making our forests easily accessible and excellent recreation areas.</P>
    <P>The commission suggest that forestry policy should recognise the long-term nature of forestry, which renders sudden major changes in policy undesirable and shall take account of distinctive characteristics and complementary roles of private forests.  State forests and other publicly-owned forests, and seek to create conditions in which efficiently managed woodlands are economically viable.  Again, we would agree with this general statement of principle and policy.  Fortunately, there has been a tendency in the Community to give almost total priority to private forests, which suits all the other countries in the Community except, perhaps, ourselves. We have had to rely&mdash;and I am all in favour of private forestry&mdash;basically on State forestry.  We must be very careful <Col N="699" /> that any support which the commission give to the development of forestry will also go to State forests; otherwise we will lose out badly in this respect.</P>
    <P>The report also states:</P>
    <P>The third general principle is that forestry policy measures should be formulated and implemented with due regard to other national and Community policies especially those concerned with land use, agriculture, wood-using industries, regional development including employment and standards of living especially in economically less forward regions, urban and rural development.</P>
    <P>Again, I am sure we would agree with these statements and suggestions as regards policy.  There are many aspects within this.  This is a non-party report by the Joint Committee and it has strong support, right across the board, from all three parties.  Although these principles are ones which we could support, we would have reservations on whether, in practice, they are really being implemented by the Community at this stage, or whether the actions which are taking place really bear out the suggestions regarding, for example, regional development, or regarding wood-using industry.  I shall come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>The fourth general principle is, conversely, that agricultural and other policies with forestry implications should pay due regard to the functions and effective management of the forests.  That is a general principle within the limits set by national legislation; whereas donors should be free to manage their forests, if they wish, forestry policy measures should be co-ordinated at Community level to the extent necessary to achieve common objectives.  This last one may sound very well but it is a suggestion which we must regard with a considerable degree of caution and care.</P>
    <P>The commission goes on to discuss the actual forest estates in various respects, the wood production itself, the various human, national environment and public aspects, what protects us, wildlife management and instruments of forestry policy.  We would all, generally, <Col N="700" /> accept these, and there have been many such developments in this country; in fact, we are well ahead, as the Minister would agree.  On instruments of forestry policy, in general terms, I am sure we would like to see tax incentives for forestry and appropriate forestry legislation. We will support research and development in education and training, in general terms, information, consultation and so on.  The Joint Committee are a little worried that this is not necessarily what is happening in practice.  First, there is the question of State forests <i>versus</i>private forests.  State forests are of major importance in this country and we must take care, in any agreements we come to, or any acceptance of the commission proposals, that private forests do not get an undue degree of support or, more seriously, that the State forests are not excluded from EEC support.  We will have to be very careful about this.</P>
    <P>We must look at the degree of limitation of Community aid.  I know that the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund gives support.  There have, however, been some suggestions emanating from that direction that the commission is considering amending previous suggestions; the effect of such amendment would be to limit Community aid to disadvantaged areas and this would have very serious implications for us.  It is something that we should be very careful to ensure is not accepted by the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>A specific matter is the question of our chipboard factories and in the Joint Committee's report we devote one specific area to this.  It seems strange that, despite the extreme dependence of the European Community on timber imports&mdash;an independence which, as I have mentioned, is second only to its dependence on oil and which is, despite the very large forests existing in France and Germany, becoming greater and greater&mdash;this very small but important industry in this country, the first we have effectively developed relating to forest products, is experiencing difficulty in remaining viable.  These are only two small factories involved and yet they are having considerable difficulties; not because of any lack of efficiency; not because of any lack in how it works, or <Col N="701" /> initiative on the part of management or workers; but basically because of low cost imports from Third World countries, imports may well be very transient in nature and may well become extremely costly.  It is, in the committee's view, difficult to understand how the EEC could continue to allow the situation to develop.  It says in paragraph 12:</P>
    <P>In the committee's view it makes little sense to allow existing factories to go under if the need is for making the Community less dependent on imports.</P>
    <P>We must look very carefully at this situation.  The committee specifically recommend that this matter be pursued with the Commission.  I hope it will be pursued very vigorously, and I am sure it will.</P>
    <P>We have, in forests, an important natural resource.  It will also, I hope, in this country be, as well as a natural resource, a national resource&mdash;one of growing importance and growing value over the years.  Let us not neglect forestry, particularly at this early stage when decisions are being taken and which obviously are likely to have very long-term effects for forestry.  It will be very difficult in five, ten, 15 or 20 years, to try to change policies.  Of all industries, the forestry industry is, perhaps, the most susceptible to long-term change and the least susceptible to sudden alteration, or compensation for past failures.  I would hope&mdash;and I am sure it is the view of the committee&mdash;that a very firm and a very considered attitude be taken towards the commission's proposals.  I would like to commend the Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on the Commission's Communication concerning Forestry Policy in the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the reference to this report.  I note that the communication of the commission states that its intention is to propose the development of a common forestry policy, but only in the sense of having some clearly defined objectives and principles of national forestry policy, common to all member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> The report makes it clear that the committee, and also the commission, would be against any overall harmonisation of laws.  I suppose what is intended is to have a series of objectives and that member states that can do so would honour them, but there would be no question of enforcing them.  Quite obviously, each member state must be left to its own devices on how it runs its forestry policy because that policy will depend on the particular circumstances of each member state.</P>
    <P>As Senator Conroy points out, and as the report mentions, this country differs considerably from the other countries of Europe in that almost all the forestries here are State-owned.  It would be a good thing if there were a common policy with regard to certain matters such as public access and recreation, conservation and wildlife management.  The other matters, such as structure and ownership and what is to be done with the subsequent forest product and the detailed national instruments as far as policy, legislation, taxation and so on are concerned, are matters that will have to be left to the individual countries.  If the commission were to seek to give directions in those areas, I think that would be wrong and perhaps inappropriate.  I think the influence of the commission will have to be restricted to what one might call the environmental area, generally.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, forests are mostly in the ownership of the State. There has never been any large-scale private planting in this country because there has not been proper awareness of the importance of timber as a commercial crop.  Studies were done which showed that large areas could be taken over and would be suitable for planting. Those studies showed that the owners of the land in question could be given an annual income from the beginning and that it would be economic to do so because of the ultimate return from the timber crop.  What needs to be encouraged here is not large scale planting of that kind where people are removed from their land but increased emphasis on private planting in a small way.  I am not sure what the present minimum area of land must be in order to qualify for a grant; it used be one acre and not many farmers <Col N="703" /> would have waste acres which they could set aside for forestry, but they would have a couple of roods.  If the present minimum grant area is one acre it should be looked at again and reduced to one rood or a half a rood.  That would encourage quite a lot of planting of trees throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the present position is with regard to the activities of the Forestry Division of the Minister's Department.  I do not know whether the annual planting target has been achieved or whether the annual land acquisition target has been achieved.  I get the impression that the acquisition of land for forestry is slowing down fairly considerably. The Minister might be able to help us on that, indicate the reason for it and indicate if the planting target is falling behind.  He might also indicate what the policy is with regard to the cropping of timber.  There is considerable dissatisfaction among our timber merchants with regard to the policies of cropping and selling the timber.  I have heard it said that the methods of sale are so geared that they are driving up the price to a figure which is not merely just profitable for the vendor, the Department, but is extravagantly profitable and is having an adverse spin-off effect in the subsequent use of that timber, whether it be for building or other uses.</P>
    <P>The present system of selling is by tender.  There is a limited amount of timber and a fair amount of willing purchasers so that when the sale is by tender there is hot competition and the price tends to become inflated.  I understand that the policy of cropping timber is unduly conservative and that the Department could sell a greater amount of timber each year.  However, I can understand their reluctance to do so if their reafforestation programme is beginning to fall behind.</P>
    <P>If the reafforestation programme gets further impetus and is increased, I urge that great care be taken when planting in scenic areas.  There are many instances where careless planting has cut off vistas of considerable significance or, if it has not already done so, as the trees mature it will do so over the next ten to 15 <Col N="704" /> years.  There has to be great sensitivity in planting where there are wide vistas available for passing motorists.</P>
    <P>I agree with the views of the committee that forestry should be regarded as part of agriculture.  It is land-use and should be regarded by the Community in that context.  Aids, development and encouragement incentives should be available for forestry as for other agricultural activities.  It is right to emphasise that, because our forests are State-owned we should not, therefore, necessarily be excluded from any aid that may be made available for the development of forestry.  Some part of regional policy could be directed towards increases in forestry because it is very often a suitable activity for disadvantaged areas.  I note with interest that the IAOS are interested in developing a co-operative forestry scheme in the west. I hope this pilot scheme will come to pass and that this debate may be of assistance in arranging that.  The wildlife management being carried out by the Forestry Division has been excellent and I would like to commend those who have been involved in it.  It should be intensified and, with it, the educational booklets that are available and the educational programmes that are carried out by that section of the Department should be expanded so that the coming generations will be totally aware of our wildlife heritage and sensitive to the need to ensure its complete protection.  There is nothing in the report with which one could disagree.  One would have to agree with it all but I wonder how real it is for the Community to recommend a common forestry policy and, at the same time, recommend that there be no harmonisation of legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome this report in that it gives us an opportunity to discuss our forestry position even though we may only think about it.  We know that in the EEC 21 per cent of the land is covered by forestry.  One important matter is that the import of timber from outside the EEC in money terms is equivalent to the deficit on the oil position. A second important point is that although planting or production is increasing by 1 per cent per annum, the <Col N="705" /> demand for timber is increasing by 2 per cent.  Therefore, we have a net drop in the EEC overall of 1 per cent.  In view of that position, I agree that we should support any study or any committee that the EEC may appoint to go into this on policy for the Community.  Our position appears to be different from the average of the EEC.  We will have to look at our position carefully before we join any common policy until we are sure that that policy is to our advantage.</P>
      <P>During the period 1914 to 1918 this country was almost denuded of timber and when we became an independent State we had to start from scratch.  We had to put a lot into our forests for years before we got any output.  Therefore, we are probably getting the output now. The Minister will possibly tell us what the present position is with regard to this.  From the figures on what we are planting at the moment, it appears that we are gaining at about 2.5 to 2.8 per cent per annum on our planting.  Based on the fact that we have only 5 per cent of our land under forest, it means that if we were to supply ourselves with our own timber we would want about 8,750,000 acres under timber.  At the rate we are increasing, I do not think any of us will see the day when we will have that.  As Senator Conroy said, we have to be very careful.  Our agricultural land is very important to us and we do not want to start growing trees on land which can, economically, give us a better product than timber.  However, that may be possible in some of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>We must remember that we are a developing country.  We joined the EEC on that basis.  There is an EEC Regional Development Fund and if the Community feel that there should be development of Irish forestry to benefit the Community as a whole our policy should be such as to benefit under that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the EEC there is 60 per cent private forestry, 20 per cent State and 20 per cent other public bodies.  We are 77 per cent State, and I do not know if EEC membership will make any difference but if we have to consider making changes to get money to develop we must do so.  We all know that in the early thirties we developed our bogs very <Col N="706" /> well under a State-sponsored body, Bord na Móna.  I do not know whether it would be of any benefit to us to do something similar in forestry, but as the EEC is about to look at this problem, and probably bring out a policy on it, we should have a general look at our policy on forestry so that we can either develop our policy and go ahead or row in with the EEC policy if it is a development as far as we are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and note that it arises out of the report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. The debate is very much in context in that at present there is a very serious position, not just in Ireland but in the Community generally, in relation to the timber processing industry.  The matter is being considered seriously by the commission following representations from a number of Community countries.  We are not the only people who are suffering from this; the Community is suffering from an upsurge of low-cost imports from third countries that have put the timber processing industry in jeopardy.  That includes the timber processing industry in such strong economies as the Federal Republic of Germany and in France and Ireland.  Despite the immediate difficulties which will be surmounted when the Community devises some way of dealing with these imports, the problem is essentially a short-term one.  The long-term prospects for timber products are good.  Demand will tend to out-run supply in the type of market situation that will exist.  I am talking very much in the long run ahead to the year 2000.  There will be constant erosion of the supply situation and an enhancement of the demand situation.  That means that the investment we have already made in forestry is a good one.  The investment over the years is now coming on stream as far as we are concerned and the cycle of meaningful and viable development of our timber products is coming to hand in that the first real draw on our timber products for industrial development will start about 1982-1983 on present forecasts.  In regard to timber, one of the <Col N="707" /> advantages is that one can plan ahead in this manner.</P>
      <P>The short-term difficulties which apply across the board throughout the Community, have affected the Irish timber processing industry.  There have been difficulties in the Athy hardboard factory, in Munster Chipboard in Waterford and in Scarriff, County Clare. There are other outlets, such as the Clondalkin Paper Mills, that are going reasonably well but the real difficulty has been in chipboard production.  Due to a combination of factors, to one of which I referred already, and Senator Conroy referred to it&mdash;the importation from third countries&mdash;I have been impelled to the view that what is required in regard to our timber processing industry is an overall rationalisation or national plan in regard to the existing plants. With that in mind, discussions were initiated&mdash;they are at an advanced stage at present&mdash;in regard to the future of the two main chipboard enterprises, Waterford and Scarriff, with a view to rationalisation taking place in regard to production and marketing from these two firms.  Interest has been expressed by certain major firms in moving into such a rationalisation programme that will involve these two existing chipboard enterprises.  I cannot say any more at present because negotiations are at an advanced and delicate stage and I hope they will prove fruitful.  The rationalisation proposals which have been encouraged by a committee composed of the Department and the Industrial Development Authority were incorporated in a special report which we have to hand from A.D. Little, consultants, and have been adopted as the <i>modus operandi</i> which will be followed if and when we reach a successful conclusion in our negotiations by the firm involved in taking over these chipboard enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have more serious difficulties in regard to the hardboard enterprise in Athy but discussions are taking place with a view to a take-over in that industry also.  I mention those aspects because the Department is closely involved for one important reason, in order to ensure mature timber coming <Col N="708" /> on stream from about 1983 onwards on a regular basis.  In order to ensure that that continues to take place in regard to mature timber it is essential that we have an outlet for our thinnings.  The whole essence of the harvesting of timber in a proper way is to ensure that there is proper cropping of thinnings until timber reaches maturity.  In regard to an outlet for thinnings this is where the woodpulp industry, particularly chipboard, is an important factor.  From the point of view of properly cropping and harvesting our mature timber resources it is essential in that operation to have an outlet for thinnings. That comes down to a proper woodpulp outlet along with outlets, such as saw-logging, for more mature timber products.</P>
    <P>We have also commissioned a report, which has just come to hand and which is currently being examined by the Government, one into which my Department and the IDA made an input, on the long-term development of timber products generally, apart from the outlets for thinnings.  The future of the whole timber processing industry requires a more sophisticated degree of timber processing than we have gone into heretofore.  I am speaking of advanced paper products such as newsprint which we do not manufacture at all; all our newsprint is imported.  For the more sophisticated forms of timber production, beyond certain forms of paper, packaging paper, hardboard and chipboard, we have not gone into any more sophisticated added-value form of timber production.  There is a definite lacuna there in our industrial arm.</P>
    <P>We are talking about expensive and sophisticated equipment in which energy input is very high and expensive.  Such a project is being considered at present.  It will have to be financed to a large extent by the State and, possibly, operated as a co-operative venture with either existing or other private enterprises not here at present or with one of the existing private entrepreneurs.  Such an operation would add a new dimension to the whole timber processing area, bringing us away from the immediate added-value involved in chipboard, wallboard and rough paper, and into a more sophisticated form of paper and <Col N="709" /> newsprint production.  We have not tackled that area yet and in that area the State will have to take a positive lead, either by way of direct or indirect involvement in ensuring that such an industry is established.  It is essential to establish it in order to provide an outlet for timber products which will be coming on stream in the middle of the next decade.</P>
    <P>As far as involvement with the Community is concerned the important aspect that we must emphasise&mdash;it has already been referred to and is highlighted in the committee's report&mdash;is that as far as the Irish situation is concerned, any Community aid that may be devised must be made available to State forestry as well as to private forestry. The European view in this respect tends to emphasise private forestry and the need to help private forestry.  Our position is unique by reason of the very high proportion of our land devoted to State forestry rather than to private forestry. We must ensure that whatever aids or means are adopted by the Community, under whatever heading, to help forestry production that will be made available to State and private forestry.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, it is important that the Department should play an active role in this area because of the control they can exercise by reason of their pricing policy <i>vis-á-vis</i> the raw material. Certain criticism has been voiced in regard to the pricing policy operated by the Department.  The Home Grown Timber Merchants Association criticised the whole method of sale of sawlog timber to them and I propose to meet them to discuss how best we can agree on a quota and pricing system that would be reasonable.  Similarly, whatever emerges from the rationalisation proposals I have spoken about with regard to the chipboard industry, our pricing policy and methods of delivery are all-important.  I want to assure the House that I have made a thorough investigation of this area and it is one on which the Department are concentrating to ensure that no policy, whether in the way of the provision of timber or thinnings or in the way of price, will be allowed to impede what we regard as a national development in this area.</P>
    <P>We will build in a reasonable pricing <Col N="710" /> policy as an integral part of the processing industry.  We cannot look on this in a narrow way of the Department selling timber or thinnings in order to gain the best price possible.  We must look at it on a broader basis than a mere pricing policy as such.  We do not want to give away our timber resources for nothing but we must fit the price into the national requirements and into a national plan with regard to outlets for our timber products.  The price must be such as to take cognisance of the highest added-value utilisation of timber and the highest degree of employment in added-value occupation.</P>
    <P>The pricing policy to be operated by the Department in the future will be subsidiary to the main objectives I have mentioned, the enhancement of the added-value aspect of our timber industry and the ensuring by that enhancement of greater employment in the processing side.  This is tremendously important because as far as the future is concerned we have built up the natural timber resource.  Any extra employment we will secure in this area will be in the processing rather than the actual production area.  We have reached a steady level of production of around 10,000 hectares per year in our planting programme.  That planting programme &mdash;and the planting programme that took place heretofore&mdash;will be sufficient to supply our requirements, as far as we can see, in the years ahead.  Our challenge is to ensure that we have a properly organised processing arm to go side by side with the production that is coming on-stream and that is available, and will continue to be available, by a turnout of about 10,000 hectares per year.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the difficulties we are having in regard to the acquisition of land.  This, of course, has been an inevitable development since our entry into the European Economic Community. Land for planting purposes is very difficult to obtain because of the extra revenue now being obtained from the agricultural use of land.  As a result of the escalation in land values people, for any and every reason, are unwilling to give land for forestry or any other purpose because land is a bank at present. <Col N="711" /> There is a lot of good sense in that; that is a fact of life we must compete with with regard to the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>One other aspect I should like to mention is in regard to private forestry. While it is very much the Cinderella of our forestry development programme, I have recently nearly trebled the grants available for private planting.  One effect of that has been a new display of interest by the co-operative movement on tree farms.  Tree farming was referred to already by Senator Cooney.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with the IAOS and, through them, with the farmers' association in north Connacht.  They have come forward with a proposal, based on private planting grants, under which a number of farmers would come together in a group enterprise to engage in tree farming.  They would make use of the grants and would be financed by a leading finance house.  We have had several proposals from banking houses to back this enterprise but we have not yet selected a particular proposal. They have shown an interest in backing similar type enterprises that may be organised on a co-operative basis by groups of farmers in the future.</P>
    <P>The institutional interest by the finance houses is, quite practically, a financial one.  They believe that investment in this sort of group enterprises is secure.  The development of such land on a co-operative basis with farmers holds out a prospect as far as the finance house are concerned of securing their own reward in the form of the loan advanced to the particular group.  I hope to have more details on this very shortly. The first such co-operative finance-backed enterprise is about to get off the ground.  I hope to see similar ones being developed with the help of other financial groups who have shown an interest in that type of co-operative development of tree farming on a practical remunerative basis.</P>
    <P>There is much more I would like to say in this area but as the Seanad can gather, there is much in the pipeline that is being considered at present and plans have not yet reached fruition.  I hope to be more positive in the near future particularly in regard to the processing area. <Col N="712" /> The joint report of the IDA and my Department is now to hand and is being considered by the Government.  Hopefully that will deal with the proper construction of a processing arm which we do not have at present.  Even though the debate is mainly on Community aspects in regard to forestry, the fact of the matter is that the answers to this problem will largely lie with ourselves.  We have the timber coming on-stream into production.  We know how much is there and how much we are likely to have over the next 20 or 30 years.  We must now plan how to absorb this production to the fullest and most beneficial extent as far as highest added-value content and the highest degree of employment are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Senator Conroy and myself, I thank the Seanad for taking this motion and the Minister for contributing to the debate.  We believed, in the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, that when this report went through it would provide an opportunity for the Minister to expose some of his policy thinking at this stage.  Perhaps one of the things reports from the Joint EEC Committee can do is stimulate a few ideas which would enable us to think of how we are getting on at home in terms of what the EEC might have to offer us.</P>
      <P>The first serious job that I had in life was when I went to London to work as a young engineer for a company, Standard Telephones and Cables.  We were brought in to have a sherry with the managing director.  He came over when he saw me, as the only Irishman of the group, and said: &ldquo;Mulcahy, I remember when I visited your Parliament some chap got up and said in a forestry debate: &lsquo;Why should we be wasting our time talking about this, what did posterity ever do for us&rsquo;?&rdquo;  I never thought that I would contribute to a debate in the Oireachtas about forestry or thank my lucky stars that whoever was speaking at the time when the managing director listened to that debate did think about us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 and 1984 we can now look forward to a solid output of timber being <Col N="713" /> available for processing.  We have problems about how we are going to do it but these are the kind of problems we like to have.  As the Minister said, when it comes to forestry, trees give one a chance to plan.  One has some idea of growth rate and one knows what the production will be.  One has time to think.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised in the debate and I should like to advert to one or two of them.  The EEC are looking at the notion of harmonisation.  They see a value in having common objectives and that is being drawn out.  There is general agreement about that.  A few facts were highlighted.  The EEC are short on the supply of timber.  It is the second highest import compared to oil.  There is a 40 per cent shortfall.  There is something like £5,000 million going out of the EEC to provide this resource.  We brought out the point that in Ireland we have mainly a State forest operation whereas in the other countries there is a big private investment. The Minister was able to tell us that he is encouraging private investment by increasing the grants and that the IAOS are developing some projects in this regard.  That sounds very interesting.</P>
    <P>I was not too sure about the interpretation of disadvantaged areas in the EEC report.  Perhaps this might be in our favour.  Given that we have a low percentage of afforestation we might be considered as a disadvantaged area and any money that is available might come in our direction.  I am sure the Minister on his visits to Brussels will keep an eye on that and will get whatever is going for us.</P>
    <P>The Minister also gave us information on various reports and I am glad to see that his Department and the IDA are looking at the downstream possibilities. Hopefully this will provide employment for the eighties.  I was delighted to hear the Minister place great emphasis on added-value as the objective of it all.  In that regard he referred to the point that was raised on the Rodney Rice Hour about the pricing problem.  I am glad to see that he is dealing with that.</P>
    <P>In countries like Sweden, because of the taxation procedures and structures that operate there, people are encouraged <Col N="714" /> to invest in timber.  If individuals want to make an investment and do not necessarily want to put the money into the bank or into a high-risk investment, would the Minister consider selling some of his forests to them and in that way generate money for the State? We would still have the output ready to go into whatever downstream processing plant would arise.  It might be a mad idea but, at the same time, there might be something in it because it releases money.</P>
    <P>The Minister took the opportunity of telling us about the chipboard problem at present.  The House would be very pleased to hear of some rationalisation at Scarriff and Munster and that there would be a possible purchaser to help to bring that about.  From my assessment of that situation there is no way that this State could allow those two companies to go down.  The Joint Committee mentioned that and recommended accordingly in their report.  It strikes me as being strange that when we are dealing with our own resources we very often bring foreigners in to look after them for us.  In this case, local indigenous raw materials were being processed by companies that had a foreign base.  This can be a good thing but it also can be bad. We have grown up now and it is time that we did it ourselves if necessary.  If private industry will do it, whether it is foreign based or not, well and good but if there is any question of their not doing it, we should go ahead ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that the opportunities for more sophisticated type of paper output from wood products were around the corner.  As part of this there might be an output in the soft tissue area.  Recently some Scandinavian companies have taken an interest in companies using that type of product.  There is room there for some partnership in the future.  I am sure that will form part of the examination made in the report the Minister referred to.</P>
    <P>There is one other area from which we can learn something.  On the Continent it has been established that it is possible to construct a line of houses much quicker if they are timber framed.  I hope that this may give rise to large-scale kiln drying of our timber.  There was a fear in the <Col N="715" /> construction industry that anything made of wood was going to go on fire and we tended not to encourage timber construction in housing.  Given the Minister's interest and responsibilities for timber, he might promote timber construction in houses.  It has been shown that it is possible to build faster and, therefore, cheaper if one does that.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council are also looking at some aspects of the forestry industry.  I gather that some studies which have been prepared for the council might very well see the light of day in the near future.  It is all coming onstream.  In the Joint Committee <Col N="716" /> report, which was the stimulant to get this debate going, the EEC committee is mentioned.  It is being set up to look at what is going on in the EEC countries in the light of the principles and objectives which might emerge.  It is important for us to be well represented and to keep our eyes in Europe focused on the opportunities for this country.  I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate and the Minister for attending.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 21 March 1979.</P>
