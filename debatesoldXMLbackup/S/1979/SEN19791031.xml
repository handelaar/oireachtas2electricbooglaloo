      <P>I have notice from Senator West that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he propose to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay in the payment of postgraduate grants by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to item No. 18 on the Order Paper which is a motion noting the annual report of the Employment Equality Agency and it also notes that that report contains specific reference to the fact that the agency felt constrained in their activities in the period under review by the limitations imposed upon them by the insufficient Exchequer grant under which they operated.  In view of the fact that this is the first annual report of the Employment Equality Agency and that it contains the specific reference to the fact <Col N="3" /> that the agency consider themselves to be inadequately funded, we are very anxious to have an early debate on this motion, before the budget in January.  I appreciate that the Leader of the House has been facilitating Members in turn in providing times for motions to be debated and I ask him, if possible, to treat this motion as urgent so that the House might debate it before we rise in December.</P>

      <P>While not wishing to conflict with Senator Robinson and Senator Hussey, I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether the placing of No. 8 at that point on the Order Paper means that it is proposed to take that motion, which stands in my name, at an early date?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Elections of Conservators (Postponement) Order, 1979,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on the 27th day of September, 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are aware, elections to boards of conservators, which under the Fisheries Acts would <Col N="4" /> normally be held every five years, have been deferred by amending legislation since 1974.  As October is the month in which these elections must be held, an order deferring them for a further period is now required.  While the order is technically needed its effect on this occasion will be marginal because the Fisheries Bill, 1979, which provides for a new administrative structure for inland fisheries, will it is expected, be enacted shortly.  That Bill, as Senators are aware, was passed by this House earlier this year.  The Bill has passed its Second Stage in the Dáil and the Committee Stage debate there is scheduled for 13 November.</P>
      <P>The order which I propose to make postponing elections must, in accordance with statute, be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and a motion approving of it must be passed by each House before it can be made.</P>
      <P>Boards of conservators have been in existence for over 100 years and while they have given great service for many years their structure was not designed and is not suited to cope with the problems of present day fishery management. The system of election to the boards is particularly unsatisfactory in that it permits multiple voting and allows for occupiers of fishery properties valued at £50 or over to hold <i>ex-officio</i> seats on boards.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Bill, 1979, as Senators will recall, gives effect to the main recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission including the abolition of boards of conservators and consequently no further elections in their regard will arise when the Bill is passed.  I hope to have the Bill enacted before the end of the year and to set up the new administrative structure, which is provided for in the Bill, as soon as possible afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express again my personal and my Department's appreciation of the great work done by the boards of conservators and by their staffs.  This is all the more praiseworthy when one considers <Col N="5" /> that members of boards give their time and energy voluntarily.</P>
    <P>I am especially appreciative of the co-operation which I have received in recent years from members of the boards who have continued in office well beyond their normal term.  I look forward to the continuation of this co-operation until the new structure is set up.  I have no doubt that when the new boards come to be constituted, we will see included in them many of the people who have given such loyal service down the years.  I accordingly recommend to the House that a resolution be passed approving of the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>While willing to approve this order postponing the election of the boards of conservators for yet another year for the reason given, I wonder if the Minister could use the opportunity in this House to give us as accurate an assessment as possible of when the new provisions will be in operation and when the elections will take place under that scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage that the law will be enacted finally before the end of the year.  I will straightaway appoint new regional boards for seven regional areas and a central board and they will come into existence for a year starting, it is hoped in December or January.  During that period of a year arrangements will be made for the new elections which it is hoped will be held before the end of next year.  I will appoint the regional board structure directly.  During that interim period of roughly a year the various arrangements for elections will be made. The elections, which will be on a panel system representing the various fishery interests, will be held in the seven regional areas and they will then have their chairman of the central board together with nominees of mine.  This work will take place early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Faoi mar a dúirt mé nuair a bhí an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta os comhair an tSeanaid tá deis eile á tabhairt don Teach chun na socruithe do na toghcháin don Údarás a phlé.  Is mian liom dul ar aghaidh anois agus an chéad toghchán a chur ar siúl roimh Nollaig. Nuair a bheidh an rún seo rite beidh ar mo chumas na rialacháin féin a dhéanamh agus an lá vótaíochta a cheapadh don toghchán.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin le Seanadóirí gur trí thoghlach atá leagtha amach san Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, agus gur mar seo a leanas a bheidh na comhaltaí le toghadh iontu: beirt do Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall; triúr do Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe, Mhaigh Eo agus na Mí; agus beirt do Ghaeltacht Chiarraí, Chorcaí agus Phort Láirge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach na comhaltaí sin&mdash;seachtar acu&mdash;a bheith tofa, beidh seisear eile le ceapadh agamsa.  Beidh lá le hainmniú chun an tUdarás a bhunú, Gaeltarra Éireann a dhíscaoileadh agus feidhmeanna, dliteanais agus foireann Ghaeltarra a aistriú chuig an Údarás.  Is é an chéad lá <Col N="7" /> den bhliain seo chugainn atá ar intinn agam chun na críche sin.</P>
    <P>Is eol do Sheanadóirí gur ritheadh an tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla agus tá beartaithe agam na Rialacháin seo a dhéanamh sa dá theanga chomh maith. Tabharfar faoi deara, áfach, ón Sceideal a ghabhann leis na rialacháin gur i nGaeilge amháin a bheidh an páipéar ainmniúcháin, an páipéar ballóide agus an cárta vótaíochta.  Feicfear freisin nach bhfuil i gceist ainm aon pháirtí polaitíochta a thaispeáint ar an bpáipéar ainmniúcháin ná ar an bpáipéar ballóide. Sílim go n-aontóidh Seanadóirí liom nach cóir go mbeadh sé le rá gur spreag ceachtar den dá pháipéar sin daoine chun cúrsaí polaitíochta a tharraingt isteach sa toghchán don Údarás.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go nglacfaidh pobal na Gaeltachta go fonnmhar leis an deis a bheidh acu go luath anois chun ionadaithe cumasacha a thoghadh i dtreo go mbeidh an tionchar ceart acu ar ghnóthaí an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Is maith a thuigeann pobal na Gaeltachta an córas daonlathach faoina mbeidh na hionadaithe le toghadh acu mar is ar an mbealach céanna a thoghann siad comhairleoirí contae. Níorbh fholáir mar sin na rialacháin seo atá á bplé againn a bhunú ar na Rialacháin um Thoghcháin Áitiúla.  Má tharlaíonn aon uair go ndéanfar leasuithe tábhachtacha sna Rialacháin sin, beidh i gceist iad a dhéanamh sna rialacháin seo chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Is ar rúnaithe na gcomhairlí contae sna contaetha Gaeltachta a bheimid ag brath chun na socruithe don toghchán a dhéanamh ar an láthair agus is iad atá le bheith mar chinn chomhairimh agus leas-chinn chomhairimh.  Bhí cúpla cruinniú againn leo agus tá na réamhullmhúcháin ag dul ar aghaidh cheana féin ar bhonn neamhfhoirmiúil. Is mór agam a gcomhoibriú agus is mian liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl dóibh go poiblí arís.</P>

      <P>Os rud é go bhfuil Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta rite againn cheana agus gur gá rialacháin a dhéanamh anois chun an tÚdarás a cheapadh, sílimse gur ceart an obair sin a dhéanamh a luaithe agus is féidir.  Tá a fhios againn uile go bhfuil gá le údarás chun cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a stiúradh agus iad a chur chun cinn.  Táimid go léir ar aon intinn faoin obair sin agus is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil cuid mhór den obair sin déanta cheana féin ag an Aire.</P>
      <P>Tá difríocht tuairime idir daoine go bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil taithí acu ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta.  Tá a fhios agam féin go bhfuil an tAire eolach ar an nGaeltacht agus go bhfuil sé de chuspóir aige feabhas mhór a chur ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta a luaithe agus is féidir leis.  Ach tá daoine eile ann a deir gur mór an trua nár thug sé níos mó cumhachtaí don Údarás agus nach bhfuil sé scríofa san Acht go bhfuil cúrsaí oideachais, cúrsaí cuartaíochta, cúrsaí iascaigh agus rudaí eile den tsórt sin faoi chúram an Údaráis.  Deir an tAire go mbeidh sé de chumhacht ag an Údarás nuair a bheidh sé ceaptha féachaint isteach sna scéimeanna sin uilig, breith a dhéanamh, agus iad san a chur go dtí an Rialtas agus go mbreithneofar go báúil ansin iad.  Is é a cheapann an tAire gurb é sin an módh oibre is fearr, agus tá mé cinnte go ndeachaigh sé i gcomhairle le daoine go bhfuil a lán taithí acu ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta, go ndeachaigh sé i gcomhairle le státsheirbhísigh agus daoine eile a thuigeann na fadhbanna sular thogh sé an módh seo oibre.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil an breith ceart déanta aige ach tá beagán amhrais agam faoi. Mar sin féin, tá súil agam go bhfuil an módh oibre ceart tofa ag an Aire agus go rachaidh an obair ar aghaidh go maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá daoine eile den bharúil nach leor seachtar le toghadh ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Is é an plean atá ann ná go n-ainmneoidh an tAire cathaoirleach agus cúigear eile agus go dtoghfar seachtar.  Tá daoine den bharúil, agus aontaím leo, gur cosúil nach dtoghfaí duine ar bith os na Gaeltachtaí beaga.  Sé mo thuairim féin gur mór an trua é sin. Cuir i gcás, Gaeltacht na Mí, tá difríocht <Col N="9" /> an-mhór idir an Gaeltacht sin agus na Gaeltachtaí eile os rud é gur aistríodh na daoine atá i nGaeltacht na Mí ón a gceantair dúchais agus cuireadh iad isteach i gceantair fior nua.  Déarfainn go bfhuil tuiscint faoi leith acusan ar na deacrachtaí a bhain lena leithéid sin de scéal agus deacrachtaí a bhí ag cur isteach orthu agus ag goilliúnt orthu.  Is é mo thuairim go meallfaidh an tÚdarás duine ó cheantair mar sin a bheith ina bhall de.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine den bharúil freisin gur trua nach mbeidh éinne ar an Údarás ós na Gaeltachtaí beaga eile, Gaeltacht Phort Láirge agus Gaeltacht Chorcaí mar is cúis iontais dúinn an dóigh inar mhair siad agus inar chosain siad iad féin os na cúrsaí a bhí ag brú isteach orthu ó gach taobh.  Is cúis iontais linn gur éirigh leo é sin a dhéanamh agus táimid buíoch gur éirigh leo.  Ach tá daoine den bharúil gur ceart ionadaithe óna leithéid sin de Ghaeltachtaí a bheith ar an Údarás agus go gcabhródh siad san le obair an Údaráis.  Admhaím nach bhfuil sé simplí agus gur deacair an rud i gcóras daonlathach ionadaithe a thabhairt d'áiteanna ina bhfuil an líon daoine anbheag. Admhaím é sin agus déarfainn gur rud é a bhí ar intinn ag an Aire ar feadh tamaill sular bheartaigh sé ar an chóras seo.  Tá seans ann, dar ndóigh, go n-ainmneoidh an tAire duine éigin os na Gaeltachtaí sin chun bheith ina bhall den Údarás.  Rud eile, sílim gur trua nár leathnaigh an tAire an córas postvótaíochta.  Tá fhios againn uile go mbíonn a lán daoine i bhfad óna gceantair toghcháin nuair a thagann an lá agus go bhfuil sé deacair orthu teacht ar ais chun vóta a chaitheamh.  Tá fhios ag gach duine atá ag gabháil dá pháirtí polataíochta gur rud mór é na daoine a bhionn as baile a thabhairt abhaile an lá sin agus go mbíonn a lán costais ag gabháil leis.  Deir an tAire ina ráiteas nach n-ainmneofar na páirtithe polaticiúla ar an bpáipéar ballóide agus aontaím gur maith an rud é sin, ach mura mbíonn na páirtithe polaitíochta ag glacadh páirt an-mhór sa toghchán, cé íocfaidh an costas chun na daoine sin a bhíonn as baile a thabhairt go dtí an t-ionad toghcháin?  Sílim gur trua nár <Col N="10" /> leathnaigh an tAire an córas sin postvótaíochta.  Mar sin fhéin, tá mé den bhárúil go bhfuil a lán oibre déanta ag an Aire cheana chun an t-Údarás seo a bhúnú.  Tá fhios agam go maith go dtuigeann sé na fadhbanna agus na deacrachtaí atá ag cur isteach ar na Gaeltachtaí le fada an lá agus tá mé den bharúil go ndéanfaidh an tÚdarás seo obair mhór chun na Gaeltachtaí a chaomhnú agus a fheabhsú agus má éiríonn leis an Údarás beimid go léir buíoch díobh agus den Aire, ach muna n-éiríonn leo ní meath ar na Gaeltachtaí a bhéas ag déanamh imní dúinn ach bás na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá súil agam nach dtitfidh a leithéid de rud amach lenár linn nó ina dhiaidh sin.  Sé an focal scoir atá agam ná go bhfuil súil agam go n-ainmneoidh an tAire daoine go bhfuil suim mhór acu i gceist na Gaeilge agus go bhfuil taithí acu ar an saghas oibre a bhéas ag teastáil chun obair mhaith a dhéanamh, agus freisin go mbeidh suim an-mhór ag muintir na Gaeltachta féin ins an toghchán agus go n-éireoidh leo daoine maithe a thoghadh chun an obair fhíor-thábhachtach seo a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa a rá go bhfuil áthas orm bheith anseo agus fáilte a chur roimh an ráiteas atá déanta ag an Aire linn go mbeidh an toghchán seo á reachtáil go luath an mhí seo chugainn agus go mbeidh Údarás na Gaeltachta le feidhmiú ón lú lá den bhliain seo chugainn le cúnamh Dé. Sílim gur céim an-mhór ar aghaidh í sin agus sílim go bhfuil moladh agus buíochas mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus mhuintir na hÉireann ar fad tuillte ag an Aire as ucht an méid atá déanta aige agus an méid atá tugtha chun críche aige leis an aidhm sin a bhaint amach ó tháinig sé i gcumhacht mar Aire na Gaeltachta.  Ní chaithfidh mé i bhfad ag caint mar níl aon aighneas ag baint leis na rialacháin seo.  Baineann siad le rud is ansa linn ar fad.  Rud is ansa linn an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a athbheochaint agus go mór mhór an Ghaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí a choinneáil beo agus saol mhuintir na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú agus a thabhairt chun cinn.  Sin é a thug dúinn ó thosach go bhfuilimid <Col N="11" /> ag plé na ceiste seo go dteastaíonn ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin níos mó dá dtoil féin agus níos mó dá ndúthracht féin a chur isteach i saol na Gaeltachta agus in obair na Gaeltachta, agus dá bhrí sin, mar a dúirt mé, nil aon aighneas ag baint leis an gceist sin agus is maith an rud é sin.  Tá cúpla rud beag, mar sin fhéin, ar mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh.  Tá an-áthas orm gur i nGaeilge amháin a bhéas na nithe a bhéas scríofa ar an bpáipéar vótaíochta agus ar na páipéir eile a bhaineann go dlíthiúil leis an toghchán seo, mar measaim nár mhaith an rud é go mbeadh Béarla ar na páipéir sin.  Measaim nach bhfuil aon chall leis agus tá an-áthas orm go ndearna an tAire an cinneadh sin. Lochtaítear an tAcht seo anois de thoradh rud eile freisin, nach bhfuil dóthain cumhachta ann, cuir i gcás, agus dá bhrí sin nach mbeidh aon tionchar romhór aige ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar an nGaeltacht féin thar mar a bhí cheana.  Sin mar atá sé b'fhéidir de réir mar atá leagtha síos go dlíthiúil san Acht, ach tá sé ráite san Acht féin agus tá sé ráite ag an Aire linn, má cheapann an tÚdarás am éigin dá shaol reachtaíochta nach bhfuil dóthain cumhachtaí acu le haghaidh cúrsaí oideachais, cúrsaí pleanála agus nithe eile a bhaineann le saol na Gaeltachta, go mbeadh sé de chead acu an moladh sin a chur i láthair an Aire agus i láthair a Roinne agus go mbreithneofar na moltaí a thiocfaidh uathu agus go ndéanfar na leasaithe dá réir.  Níl aon dabht agamsa go ndéanfar amhlaidh agus go mbeidh an chumhacht sin le fáil acu má lorgaíonn siad é agus má cheaptar gurb é leas na Gaeltachta é agus leas na Gaeilge freisin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lochtaítear an tAcht ar thaobh eile chomh maith, is é sin, deirtear go mba cheart go mbeadh níos mó daoine le toghadh agus níos lua daoine le ceapadh ag an Aire.  Ní aontaím ar fad le sin, agus nuair a bhí an Seanadóir O'Brien ag caint dúirt sé go raibh chuile sheans ann nach toghfaí aon duine ó na Gaeltachtaí beaga.  B'fhéidir gur mar sin a tharlóidh, ach más mar sin a tharlóidh nach <Col N="12" /> mbeidh sé de sheans ag an Aire, agus nach maith an rud go mbeadh an seans sin aige, duine nó daoine as na Gaeltachtaí sin a thoghadh, daoine fiúntacha agus daoine a mheasfaidh sé a dhéanfas an gnó a bhéas le déanamh acu go maith, agus measaim dá réir sin gur maith an rud é agus gurb é leas an Achta agus leas na Gaeltachta agus an aidhm lenar cheapadh an tAcht seo a thabhairt chun críche, go mbeadh na ceapacháin sin le déanamh ag an Aire, ceapachán an chathaoirligh féin agus na daoine eile a bheidh le ceapadh aige.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile ar mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh de, agus thagair an Seanadóir O'Brien arís dó agus tagraíodh dó sa Dáil ag Teachtaí nuair a bhí na rialacháin á bplé ansin de réir tuairisc na díospóireachta sa Dáil.  Is é sin, cead vótála trí an phost a bheith ins an Acht seo.  Deirim, agus deirim é le fonn agus le dáiríreacht, go bhfuil an-áthas orm nach bhfuil an cead sin san Acht agus gur seachnaíodh é mar measaim nuair a triaileadh é cheana féin&mdash;sé sin vótaíocht tríd an phost&mdash;gur baineadh mí-úsáid as an vótaíocht sin agus go raibh mí-chothromaíocht agus go ndeacthas thar fóir le vótaíocht trí an phost nuair a cheadaíodh é.  Is féidir liom a rá anseo, i gceantar beag amháin toghchánaíochta&mdash;is é sin an rud ar a dtugtar i mBéarla local electoral area&mdash;fuair iarrthóir amháin sa gceantar sin 10 vóta a tugadh trí an phost agus fuair iarrthóir eile ceithre scór agus deich vóta.  Caithfidh sé go raibh mí-chothromaíocht éigin ansin agus caithfidh sé gur thárla rud éigin nach raibh cóir, ís é sin le rá, nach bhfaigheadh duine amháin as vótaíocht trí an phost&mdash;agus toghadh an duine sin nach bhfuair ach 10 vóta&mdash;agus an duine eile níos mó ná ceithre scór.  Bhí rud éigin míchothrom ann, agus deirim aris, buíochas le Dia, nach bhfuil vótaíocht trí an phost ceadaithe anseo.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom chomh maith nach gceadófar páirtithe polaítíochta ar na páipéir vótála, mar ní dóigh liom gurb é leas na Gaeltachta nó leas na ndaoine dár ceapadh an tÚdarás seo go mbeadh polaitíocht ag baint le ceist na Gaeilge. Dá bhrí sin, measaim go ndearna an <Col N="13" /> tAire an rud ceart nuair a cheil sé an cead sin go mbeadh ainm páirtíthe polaitíochta ar na páipéir vótála.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, tá áthas orm go mbeidh an toghchán ann go luath agus go mbeidh Údarás na Gaeltachta ag feidhmiú ón lú lá den bhliain nua, le cúnamh Dé.  Molaim an tAire agus a Roinn dá réir.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte, mar Sheanadóir neamhspleách, roimh na rialacháin seo agus aontaím leis an Seanadóir O'Brien agus an Seanadóir de Brún go bhfuil na rialacháin anchiallmhar, go mór mhór an socrú nach mbeidh aon cur síos ag bhaint le lucht poilaitíochta sa toghchán.  Is oth liom mar sin féin nach bhfuil níos mó daoine le toghadh.  Measaim go bhfuil an iomarca daoine á n-ainmniú ag an Aire, ach is dócha nach í seo an ócáid chun an cheist sin a phlé.  Ach aontaím leis an Seanadóir O'Brien nuair a dúirt sé go raibh dóchas aige go gcuimhneodh an tAire nuair a bheadh sé ag déanamh na gceapacháin seo ar leas na Gaeltachta agus go gcheapfar daoine go nglacfar leo ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Is rud é sin a bhaineann le discréid an Aire; is dócha nach féidir leis a insint dúinn anseo anois díreach conas a toghfaidh sé na comhaltaí ainmnithe.</P>
      <P>Is mionphointí iad sin go léir.  Fáiltím roimh céim eile chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Más maith an rud é, is ro-mhithid é.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní dúirt mise riamh go raibh mé sásta go raibh na cumhachtaí ar fad san Acht ba mhaith liom a fheiceáil ann.  Tá a lán deacrachtaí le Bille úr den chineál sin, ach mar a dúirt mé sa Dáil, tá cumhacht san Acht seo nár tugadh in aon Acht cheana, is é sin, go bhfuil solúbthacht ann a thabharfaidh deis do bhaill an Údaráis nuair a thoghfar iad teacht ós comhair an Aire, agus ansin tig leis an Aire teacht ós comhair an Rialtais agus <Col N="14" /> na cumhachtaí breise a shílfeas an tÚdarás go dteastaíonn uathu a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Beimid ag súil go dtoghfar mar bhaill ar an Údarás daoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeltacht, agus tá mé cinnte go mbainfidh na Gaeltachtaí iad féin úsáid agus tairbhe as an deis atá acu anois le daoine maithe a thoghadh ar an Údarás.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh daoine ann a thuigeann ceist na Gaeltachta agus go dtiocfaidh siad go dtí an Aire, cibé Aire a bhéas ann, agus go n-iarrfaidh siad na cumhachtaí sin.  Ní bheidh siad ag baint lán-tacaíocht as an Acht féin mura ndéanfaidh siad é sin.</P>
    <P>Aontaím ar fad leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir O'Brien faoi na Gaeltachtaí beaga agus cuireann sé iontas orm féin an chaoi ar mhair cuid acu chomh fada seo.  Tá siad mar a bheadh oileáin i gceartlár ceanntair nach bhfuil iontu ach Béarla, agus is mór an chrediúint atá ag dul do na daoine ins na Gaeltachtaí beaga seo a sheas chomh tréan ar son na Gaeilge san am atá caite is atá ag seasamh i gcónaí leis an gcultúr agus leis an dúchas atá chomh tréan sna Gaeltachtaí beaga sin.  Agus déarfainn an méid seo.  Ón méid a fheicim i láthair na huaire, agus tá sé seo ráite agam go poiblí cheana, is fearr atá siad ag seasamh in aghaidh an bhrú atá ann ná cuid de na Gaeltachtaí móra.  Tá mé cinnte nach ndéanfar faillí orthu nuair a bhéas baill an Údáráis dá dtoghadh.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir Ó Murchú ceist cén chaoi a dtoghfaí iad nó cén chaoi a gceapfaidh mise na baill a bhéas le toghadh agam.  Bhuel, caithfimid cuimhniú agus beimid ag cuimhniú ar na Gaeltachtaí beaga más rud é nach bhfaighidh siad ionadaithe, sin rud amháin a bhéas ar intinn againn, agus caithfimid cuimhniú chomh maith go mbeidh an tÚdárás anseo ag tógáil na páirte anois a bhí ag Bord Ghaeltarra cheana maidir le caiteachas na milliún punt airgid agus caithfimid cuimhniú ar dhaoine a mbeidh eolas acu ar chúrsaí gnó agus gnaithe ag guí go mbeimid in ann meascán ceart a fháil de dhaoine a thuigfeas cén chaoi ar cheart geilleagar agus cúrsaí eacnamaíochta a chur chun tosaigh sa Ghaeltacht chomh maith leis <Col N="15" /> an gcultúr, agus an dúchas a chosaint agus a chaomhnú.  Sin iad na rudaí a bhéas im aigne-se nuair a bhéas mé ag iarraidh na daoine is fearr a thoghadh i gcóir na náiteacha sin.</P>
    <P>Do luadh ceist postvótáil agus arís tuigim go rí-mhaith go bhfuil cuid mhaith de mhuintir na Gaeltachta a bhíonn scaipthe thart in áiteacha b'fhéidir ar fud na tíre, is corruair trí imirce imíonn siad, fágann siad an trí.  Ach níl sé sin ag tarlú chomh mór is a bhíodh agus tá níos mó acu ag fáil fostaíochta sa nGaeltacht anois i láthair na huaire agus le blianta beaga anuas, agus déarfainn i dtaobh an chuid is mó de na daoine a bhéas i dteideal vóta a chaitheamh, go mbeidh deis acu na vótaí a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht féin agus dá bhrí sin nach mbeidh an oiread sin gá le postvótáil.  Chomh maith leis sin, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir de Brún, sílim ón triail a baineadh as, agus chonaic mé i mo chontae fhéin é, ní bheadh sé róshásúil agus sílim go mb'fhéidir gur mó an dochar a dhéanfadh sé dá dtabharfaí isteach é.  Ach arís mar atá ráite agam cheana, más rud é go síleann an tÚdarás féin go mbeidh gá le rudaí mar sin feasta, beidh deis acu na moltaí sin a chur os comhair an Aire agus os comhair an Rialtais san am atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom gur glacadh go fonnmhar leis na rialacháin seo agus tá súil agam go mbeimid anois in ann an toghchán a bheith againn go luath in Mí na Nollag agus go mbeidh, mar atá ráite agam, an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú ar an lú lá den bhliain seo chugainn.  Táimid chun deiridh leis sin.  Shíleamar go mbeadh sé ann níos luaithe ná seo, ach ar aon nós beidh sé ann, le cúnamh Dé, ar an lá sin agus beidh sé ag feidhmiú, agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh muintir na Gaeltachta iad fhéin sásta an tÚdarás a fheiceáil. Beidh deis acu anois iad fhéin daoine a thoghadh a bhéas in ann cur ar a son agus is gnó dóibh mar sin na daoine is fearr a thoghadh leis an obair sin a dhéanamh dóibh.</P>

      <P>Is é príomhchuspóir an Bhille seo ná feidhm reachtúil a thabhairt do mhéaduithe a rinneadh ar rátaí na ndeontas faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) ón mbliain 1972 i leith.  Is iad seo a leanas na gnáth-uasdheontais atá i bhfeidhm faoi láthair:&mdash;£2,000 chun teach a thógáil; £750 chun teach a fheabhsú; £360 do chóras uisce; £300 do chóras séarachais; £600 do sheomra folctha le huisce te; £170 chun córas uisce nó séarachais a fheabhsú; £810 chun trí sheomra do chuairteoirí a chur le teach, agus; £600 chun sealla saoire a thógáil.</P>
      <P>Is le tithe nua arna dtosú i ndiaidh 26 Bealtaine 1977 a bhaineann an £2,000 agus baineann na deontais eile le hoibreacha arna dtosú i ndiaidh 31 Deireadh Fómhair 1977.  Is méaduithe móra iad uile ar na deontais a bhí i bhfeidhm cheana agus tá siad ar fáil d'iarratasóirí cáilithe gan aird ar an teacht isteach a bhíonn acu.  D'oibreacha lena mbaineann na deontais sin tá deireadh le deontais fhorlíontacha ó chomhairlí contae.  Tá deontais níos mó fós ar fáil do mhuintir na n-oileán Gaeltachta amach ón gcósta: 50 fén gcéad breise anuas ar na deontais atá luaite agam in alt 8 den Bhille.</P>
      <P>Tá forálacha sa Bhille seo freisin do dheontais a bhí i bhfeidhm cheana ó 1 Meitheamh 1972 agus 1 Eanáir 1973 ar aghaidh.  Ní miste a lua go raibh an Coiste um Chuntais Phoiblí ag gearán nuair nár tugadh isteach na forálacha ina leith i bhfad nios luaithe.  Tá dúil agam go mbeidh gach uile dhuine sásta leis an mBille cuimsitheach atá anois againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> D'fhonn deacrachtaí faoi mar a bhí i gceist ag an gCoiste um Chuntais Phoiblí a sheachaint feasta, tá prionsabal úr amháin in alt 9 den Bhille seo: is é sin go bhféadfaidh Aire na Gaeltachta, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, &ldquo;méid aon deontais is iníoctha faoi na hAchtanna a athrú ó am go ham le rialacháin.&rdquo;  Ar ndóigh, beidh aon rialacháin a dhéanfar le leagan faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas sa ghnáthshlí.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis na forálacha a bhaineann le méid na ndeontas, b'fhéidir nár mhiste tagairt ghairid a dhéanamh do thrí alt eile: cuirfidh alt 5 ar ár gcumas deontas a thabhairt chun foirgneamh a oiriúnú mar bhrú; faoi alt 6 beimid in ann&mdash;taobh istigh de sheacht mbliana ó íocadh deontas&mdash;deontas eile a thabhairt chun cúlchoire nó gléas eile a dhófaidh crua-bhreosla a chur isteach d'fhonn uisce te a sholáthar; agus féachfaidh alt 7 chuige go bhféadfar iasacht a thabhairt le haghaidh sealla saoire ar chóimhéad leis an deontas&mdash;mar atá i bhfeidhm ó thús&mdash;gan méid na hiasachta nua a shonrú gach uair a dhéanfar leasú ar an deontas.</P>
    <P>Ón mbliain 1929 i leith tá Achtanna speisialta i bhfeidhm ar mhaithe le cúrsaí tithíochta sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Bhí géarghá leis an Acht bunaidh a ritheadh sa bhliain 1929 i ngeall ar an drochbhail a bhí ar thithíocht sna ceantair Ghaeltachta an t-am úd.  Le himeacht ama, ar ndóigh, tháinig an-fheabhas ar thithe sa Ghaeltacht le cabhair na ndeontas speisialta i gcaoi gur beag ceantar tuaithe eile sa tír anois ina bhfuil tithe níos fearr le feiceáil.  Cabhair chun tithe nua a thógáil nó seantithe a fheabhsú a bhí le fáil i dtús báire faoi na hAchtanna ach cuireadh leis an raon deontas ó thráth go chéile&mdash;mar is léir ón liosta atá tugtha agam cheana.</P>
    <P>Tá an obair thithíochta ag dul ar aghaidh i gcónaí.  Dá chomhartha sin cuireadh críoch le breis agus 2,000 teach nua le cúnamh faoi na hAchtanna ó thús na seachtóidí agus íocadh deontais ar mhaithe le hoibreacha feabhsúcháin, seomraí breise, seomraí folctha, saoráidí sláintiochta i dtimpeall 10,000 cás eile.  Ó tharla gur i mBéarla a ritheadh an tAcht bunaidh leathchéad bliain ó shin is i <Col N="18" /> mBéarla atá an Bille seo le rith freisin. Mar áis do Sheanadóirí sa díospóireacht seo, áfach, tá leagan Gaeilge den Bhille curtha timpeall chomh maith.  Is ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta agus le leas na Gaeilge atá cabhair bhreise le fáil faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  Is deimhin liom go dtuigeann Seanadóirí ar gach taobh den Teach an gá atá leis an gcabhair bhreise sin.  Ta dúil agam, dá bhrí sin, go nglacfar go fonnmhar leis an mBille atá á mholadh anois agam don Seanad.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua go mbeidh mionleasú amháin le moladh ar Chéim an Choiste: níl i gceist ach míniú ar &ldquo;Acht 1953&rdquo; a chur isteach sa chéad alt.  Is amhlaidh a cuireadh alt 6 isteach sa Bhille trí leasú ar Chéim an Choiste sa Dáil agus luaitear Acht 1953 ann.  Níor tugadh faoi deara ag an am, áfach, nach raibh tagairt don Acht sin in alt 1&mdash;rud a bheidh le leigheas sular rithfear an Bille.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille.  Is cúis bhróin agus imní dúinn uile an meath a tháinig ar na Gaeltachtaí leis na blianta.  Tá fhios againn gur easpa oibre, drochthithe, droch-bhóithre agus caighdeán bocht beatha a chuir an ruaig ar na mílte daoine.  Is cúis áthais dúinn anois é go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar shaol na Gaeltachta agus tá súil againn gur ag dul i méid a bhéas an feabhas sin agus nach fada uainn an lá go mbeidh an caighdeán beatha sna Gaeltachtaí ar aon chéim leis an chaighdeán sa chuid eile den tír.</P>
      <P>Is maith liom a chloisint go bhfuil na deontais á n-árdú agus á dtabhairt do na daoine chun tithe a thógáil agus iad a fheabhsú, chun córas uisce, agus an córas séarachais a chur isteach, na córais sin a fheabhsú agus seomraí breise do chuairteoirí a chur le tithe agus chun seallaí saoire a thógáil.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil na deontais sin á n-íoc cheana féin agus gur gá an Bille seo chun an obair atá ar siúl cheana a chur ar sheasamh reachtúil, mar a déarfá.  Is cúis shásaimh dom leis go bhfuil breis deontais á dtabhairt do mhuintir na n-oileáin. Mar a dúirt mé cheana cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille agus tréaslaím an tAire as ucht é a thabhairt isteach.</P>

      <P>Ní bheidh mórán le rá agam.  Arís, ba mhaith liom a rá gur Bille é seo a bhfuil fáilte roimhe in ngach cúinne den Teach agus i ngach áit san Oireachtas.  Níl ann dáiríre ach Bille le feidhm dlíthiúil a thabhairt do rudaí a bhí á ndéanamh cheana féin, sé sin deontaisí a cheadú a bhí á dtabhairt cheana féin.  Nuair a bhí mé ag léamh leis an Aire an ráitis a bhí sé ag déanamh bhí mé ag cur na ceiste orm féin an mbeidh feidhm iar-ré leis,&mdash;níl mé ach ag déanamh grinn anois&mdash;an bhféadfadh feidhm iar-ré a bheith leo siar go dtí 1972, cuir i gcás, agus go dtí na blianta eile atá luaite ins an mBille.  Tá, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir O'Brien an-áthas orm fáiltiú roimh an mBille.  Is céim mhór ar aghaidh é i saol mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil na harduithe móra seo ceadaithe maidir le feabhas a chur ar thithe, tithe nua a thógáil agus na riachtanais eile a bhí tuillte acu agus atá tuillte acu a chur ar fáil dóibh. Cabhróidh sé, ní amháin le muintir na Gaeltachta féin, ach le munitir na hÉireann i gcoitinne agus go deimhin leis an gcóras reachtaíochta ar fad.</P>
      <P>Is cinnte, de thoradh an fheabhais tiocfaidh feabhas de thoradh na n-arduithe seo, a thiocfas ar na tithe agus ar an gcóras maireachtála i gcoitinne san nGaeltacht, go dtiocfaidh feabhas dá réir ar chuartaíocht agus ar thurasóireacht chun na Gaeltachta.  Ní miste a rá, agus mé ag caint ar sin, gur sa nGaeltacht is deise, is dócha, atá an tír, gur sa nGaeltacht atá na sléibhte, na lochanna agus na radharcanna is áille atá le feiceáil agus gur orthu sin is mó a bhíonn triall na gcuairteoirí.  Tá rud eile, freisin, i gceist anseo.  Ní le deiseacht tíre amháin a thagann cuairteoirí chun na tíre ach le dul i measc na ndaoine, leis an nós saoil a fheiceáil agus le fáil amach cén sórt daoine iad agus cén chaoi a maireann siad.  Is dóigh liom gur mór an rud é sin freisin i gcás na Gaeltachta go mbeidh tithe maithe acu go mbeidh na fearais agus na córais acu atá riachtanach dóibh.  Fáiltím roimh an mBille agus molaim an tAire dá bharr.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist bheag agam le cur chuig an Aire go hindíreach, <Col N="20" /> ceist a eiríonn as tobar m'aineolais féin ar na cúrsaí seo.  Cuir san áireamh go bhfuil na deontais cuíosach mór ar fáil agus cuir san áireamh chomh maith, de réir dealraimh, nach dtugtar aon aird ar an teacht isteach a bhíonn ag na hiarratasóirí.  An bhfuil aon bhaol i dtaobh daoine ag teacht isteach ón taobh amuigh agus tuilleadh tithe samhraidh a bhunú, cuirim i gcás, an bhfuil sainmhíniú cruinn ar iarratasóirí cáilithe, an muintir bona fide na Gaeltachta iad?</P>

      <P>Caithfidh mé mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí a labhair. Sílim nach bhfuil ach rud amháin b'fhéidir, le freagairt, sin an cheist a chuir an Seanadóir Murphy ansin. Caithfidh cónaí a bheith ar iarratasóir sa Ghaeltacht nuair a cuirfidh sé isteach iarratas i gcomhair deontais.  Tá an Roinn féin an-dian maidir leis an riail sin a chur i bhfeidhm.  Fiú amháin i mo chás fhéin mar a luaigh mé sa Dáil, cuireadh ceist mar seo chomh maith.  Bím ag troid leo go minic mar is iomaí uair, san am atá caite ar chuma ar bith, a théadh duine b'fhéidir go Sasana nó go Baile Átha Cliath nó ag obair taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht le cuidiú leis fhéin saothrú beag a fháil go dtí go mbeadh an t-airgead aige leis an teach a thógáil.  Fiú amháin i gcás mar sin duine a rugadh agus a tógadh sa nGaeltacht agus atá cáilithe ar chuile bhealach ó thaobh na Gaeilge dhe, mura bhfuil sé ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht nuair a chuireann sé isteach an t-iarratas ní bhíonn sé i dteideal an deontas a fháil.  Chomh maith leis sin daoine de bhunadh na Gaeltachta arís a bheadh ag obair taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, daoine le postanna maithe b'fhéidir a bhéadh in ann láithreán nó áit tí a fháil óna muintir féin, is ioma uair a thagann siad ar ais chun teach úr a thógáil.  Arís ní bhíonn siad i dteideal an deontas a fháil.  Caithfidh siad a bheith lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht nó bheith ina gcónaí ann go lán-aimsearach sula bhfaighidh siad an deontas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá feabhas tagtha ar shaol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta de bharr an fheabhais a tháinig ar thithe san am atá caite, agus caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil <Col N="21" /> muintir na Gaeltachta ag baint úsáid as na deontais seo lena saol féin a fheabhsú, go mór mhór daoine a bhíonn ag plé le cursaí turasóireachta, leis na cúrsaí samhraidh agus rudaí mar sin.  Agus de bharr go bhfuil siad ag baint lán-úsáid as na deontais seo tá siad ag cuidiú leis an saol eacnamaíochta sa Ghaeltacht féin agus ag cuidiú leis an teacht isteach atá acu féin.  Is maith liom go bhfuil siad ag glacadh go fonnmhar leis an deontas seo.  Sílim gur maith an rud é gur luaigh an Seanadóir Murphy an pointe seo, mar go ndéantar ráitis phoiblí go minic agus fiú amháin ag muintir na Gaeltachta iad féin, a thabharfadh le tuiscint uathu in amannaí go dtig le strainséaraí teacht isteach agus na deontais seo le haghaidh tithe a fháil sa Ghaeltacht.  Faoi mar a dúirt mé, ní mar sin atá sé; tá rial ag an Roinn agus cuireann siad an rial seo i bhfeidhm an-láidir ar fad, agus ní ghlactar ach le daoine atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht nuair a bhíonn an t-iarratas á cur isteach.</P>

      <P>Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1979,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 24 October, 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Housing Act, 1969, was to prevent the unwarranted demolition or change of use of habitable houses <Col N="23" /> which was depleting the housing stock at a time of difficulty in keeping pace with housing demand, particularly in Dublin city.  The Act was intended to be a temporary measure, due to expire on 31 December 1972, but provision was included in section 13 to continue it in operation after that date if the conditions so warranted.  In fact, as the Seanad may be aware, it has been continued in force since by the Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Orders, 1972, 1974 and 1977 and will expire on 31 December 1979, unless continued by an order made by me after it has been approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Act requires generally that the permission of the housing authority must be obtained for the demolition or change of use of any habitable house.  In determining an application for permission under the Act a housing authority must have regard to the state of repair of the house to which the application relates and to the adequacy of the supply of dwellings in its functional area.  An authority may either refuse permission or grant it with or without conditions.</P>
      <P>While the powers made available by the Act have been utilised by at least 38 housing authorities, in practice most use of the controls has been made by Dublin and Cork Corporations.  Statistics furnished by these two authorities of applications made to them and of their decisions thereon indicate that the Act has helped to preserve a considerable number of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 30 September 1979, a total of 2,021 applications for permission had been made to Dublin Corporation. Permission was refused in 886 cases and granted subject to conditions in 1,135. Of the 257 applications received by Cork Corporation in the same period 181 were granted, 61 were refused and 15 were withdrawn.  However, these figures do not of themselves show the full measure of the Act's effectiveness. Account must also be taken of its deterrent value and of the number of replacement dwellings provided or capital contributions made to local housing authorities where permission for <Col N="24" /> demolition had been granted subject to these conditions.</P>
    <P>Where a housing authority have refused permission or granted it subject to conditions there is a right of appeal to the Minister.  By the end of September this year, 802 appeals had been submitted. Of these, 48 were not received within the statutory period, 112 were withdrawn, 585 were determined and the remainder were under consideration.</P>
    <P>Despite the upward trend in housing output in recent years and the substantial number of houses which have been preserved in a habitable condition or improved with the aid of Government incentives, a case can still be made for some form of control over the change of use or demolition of habitable houses in order to facilitate commercial or industrial development which, due to economic factors, can often be financially more rewarding, especially in major urban areas, than retaining existing houses for residential purposes.</P>
    <P>In November 1977, when a motion proposing to authorise the continuance in force of the 1969 Act for a further two years was being debated in the Seanad, the Minister for the Environment indicated that the drafting of permanent provisions for the type of control exercised under the Act was being considered. The matter has, in fact, been reviewed in some depth and, while I am naturally concerned to ensure that controls are in existence which would help keep the loss of residential accommodation to a minimum, I am not sure that permanent legislation on the lines of the 1969 Act is the best way to deal with the situation.  Also, I have some reservations about the form and extent of the controls, the degree of flexibility to be allowed and the question of compensation where a refusal of permission or the imposition of conditions might give rise to genuine hardship.  It is possible that the objectives of the 1969 Act could be achieved by modifying the present planning code, in the process simplifying the adminstrative controls to which an intending developer is subject at present.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am reluctant at this time either to allow the Act to lapse <Col N="25" /> at the end of the year or else to proceed with the enactment of permanent provisions without being fully satisfied that they are warranted.  I propose, therefore, before deciding what future policy should be adopted in relation to the controls, to have a detailed analysis carried out, in consultation with housing authorities and with other Government Departments concerned, of all the cases dealt with under the Act so far.  This will take some time.  In the interim I feel that it would be desirable to retain the existing controls.  The draft order now before the House proposes to continue the 1969 Act in force for a further two years to 31 December, 1981.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend opposing this Motion, but only just, because I think the objective of the Housing Act, 1969 has been, so far as I can judge, correctly stated by the Minister of State in his opening speech as being concerned with any depletion of the housing stock in keeping pace with housing demand.  In so far as the type of controls in this Act which this order is proposing to continue serve in any degree that purpose and in the absence of any alternative before the House, my party will agree to the motion.  Let us appropriately concentrate on what the Minister of State has correctly stated to be the object of the Act and which is being continued, that is, the prevention of the depletion of the housing stock.  To some degree, perhaps at some cost to the nature of the controls contained in the Act, economic, social or environmental, cultural if you like, this Act has done something to prevent that depletion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand, from a study of this Act and of all the different codes which apply to the matter of the provision of houses of which one of the most important is the fiscal code, what is the overall policy of Government on this matter.  I submit to the House that the object of housing policy should be to house people, not to build houses, particularly if the overall effect of the different codes is to let fall into disrepair through lack of maintenance, through <Col N="26" /> lack of activity in the matter of maintenance, existing stock which could be available to house people or be more efficiently altered to house people and to build houses in green fields instead.</P>
    <P>The order proposes that we should continue the Act for two years.  In the meantime, two years having passed since we continued the Act already, consideration is to be given to the alternative set of structures to replace this particular item, which is only one item in all our legislation and policy with regard to this vital human matter of ensuring that our economic resources are applied with a real priority for the people and with the greatest efficiency and justice for the people.</P>
    <P>I look forward to being here when this order expires.  If I am here and if another similar order comes before this House I shall be merciless in judgment of the Executive who would dare present it to us.  I am just about patient with regard to the order.  It is only fair that not merely the Minister, the entire governmental system, the bureaucracy or whatever, but everyone should have an opportunity of studying the very comprehensive review which is being made by the ESRI of housing policy.  The number of the publication escapes me.  It is because I am against hasty decisions, because I think the change here should be made in terms of an overall policy and because I think there are reasons other than those specified by the Minister for controlling change of user, reasons of a cultural character, for example, and indeed for some reasons given by the Minister, that I do not oppose the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not find Senator FitzGerald's patience justified, having regard to the record of the attempts to renew by motion for further periods this Housing Act, 1969.  The fact that the Minister of State is here today reflects an abject failure by the Government to come forward with a proper housing policy in this area, and it is all the more astonishing because in 1977 when a similar motion was before both Houses to continue the Act in force for a further two years the Minister for the Environment <Col N="27" /> at the time gave assurances that this legislation would be forthcoming.  I think it is worth putting these points on the record of the House and Senator FitzGerald should be merciless when he hears what was said at that time by the Minister.  He said, in introducing a similar motion in the Dáil in December, 1977 as reported at column 865 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The circumstances which give rise to the need for the controls in the Act still exist, and are likely to continue in some areas.  Accordingly, it is considered necessary that with some amendments, there should be permanent provisions for the type of control in the 1969 Act.  The drafting of such provisions is at an advanced stage and I hope to include them in a forthcoming Housing Bill.  In the meantime, I consider it essential that the existing controls should not lapse at the end of 1977.  The object of the draft Order now before the House is to continue the 1969 Act in force for a further period of two years up to 31st December, 1979, by which time I am confident permanent legislation will have been enacted.</P>
      <P>Later on in the debate at that time in December, 1977, when Deputy Ruairí Quinn had criticised in very effective terms the deficiencies of the 1969 Housing Act, the Minister replying made it even clearer that there was legislation practically ready to be introduced into the House.  He said at column 883:</P>
      <P>In my opening statement I said that legislation of a permanent nature would be brought in in the near future. Even though we are looking for a two-year extension it is not anticipated that we will require that extension.  It is our intention to introduce the legislation next year and make it effective next year.  We decided to look for two years to be absolutely safe lest anything might delay this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet this afternoon we have the Minister of State coming in and introducing this motion but seeming not to have any idea <Col N="28" /> of where he is going.  He is reluctant, he is not sure, he wants more time, he wants to continue thinking.  That is because there is no housing policy in this area, because the Government have failed in the two-year gap which we gave them very reluctantly in 1977 to come forward with a proper policy in relation to protection of housing stock, to the whole question of control of vacant houses.  Despite the number of houses that are lying vacant in Dublin at the moment when we have the worst housing crisis in the history of the city, the Minister is much less certain of where he is going now than the Minister for the Environment was in December, 1977.</P>
    <P>I must say that I would ask Senator FitzGerald to re-consider his patience on the matter and to be merciless, because nothing else is warranted where there is concerned a Government that made a firm commitment that legislation would be brought in to improve the deficiencies of the Housing Act of 1969&mdash;and it is deficient.  It has a very one-dimensional approach to the protection of housing stocks, a protectiveness in a statistical way.  It does not meet the needs of people who need housing.  It does not protect the social residential character of neighbourhoods.  It does not prevent the erosion of the housing stock in real terms in Dublin and it has had very little real beneficial effect.  The figures bear this out to a considerable extent, because the Minister by putting together figures up to 30 September, 1979, says that there was a total of 2,021 applications for permission under this legislation made to Dublin Corporation but the figures that were given by the Minister for the Environment in December, 1977, show that at that time there were 1,710 applications which had already been made.  So effectively between December, 1977, and September, 1979, there were only a further 311 applications of which 155 were refused by the Corporation.  Some of these would have been granted on appeal.</P>
    <P>This shows that what is being achieved is very minimal in this particular legislation.  It is a very limited protection to housing stock to require <Col N="29" /> that it be replaced by the provision of alternative accommodation.  There are grave defects in that provision of alternative accommodation, because even if an applicant gets permission to demolish on the condition that the applicant will provide alternative flats, for example, there is no requirement in the legislation that that accommodation be let.  There are examples in the city of where although flats have been built to satisfy the conditions under the 1969 Act they have not been let and they remain idle, some of them on the top of blocks owned by State-sponsored bodies.  It is deplorable and shocking that a Government have so little concern for the huge housing crisis in the city of Dublin that a two-year period would be allowed to pass in this way, and we move from a Minister who appeared to know what he intended by way of replacing this defective legislation which does not protect housing stock in the full sense, which does not form part of a progressive housing policy to ensure that people are housed in the areas where they grew up, where they have social links, where they want to be housed and which does not ensure that we do not have the scandal of so much unoccupied housing in the city of Dublin which is lying vacant and on which it is hoped that in the future the developers will be able to make speculative profits.</P>
    <P>Given the extent of the housing crisis in Dublin, given the fact that there are 6,000 families on the housing list and a further 2,000 on the transfer list, it is very hard to be patient in taking part in a debate when the Minister of State shows this completely ineffectual capacity to tell us what he is going to do.  He wants another two years in this area.  Are we to see further deterioration of the existing housing stock in Dublin?  Are we to see more houses left vacant until they deteriorate to such an extent that it will be easier to get permission to develop them?  When are we to see a certain leadership in this area which will make it possible for the local authorities, for the Dublin City Council, to play their part in reversing the present trend, in trying to come to grips with the housing list as it <Col N="30" /> exists at the moment?  When are we in Dublin to have a housing list which allows us to house people who are ordinary families, because that does not happen any more in Dublin?  You have to have chronic illness or chronic problems in order to have enough points to be allocated a house, and therefore I find it very difficult to be sympathetic to the Minister's request for a further two years because there was no evidence as it happens that when a further two-year extension was given in 1977, the Government did a single thing about this very important part of the housing problem.  It is only part of it but it is a very important part of it.</P>
    <P>We do need proper planning legislation effectively to ensure both that the housing stock is maintained in a physical sense and that people are aware that the housing policy which is being implemented is one which places their needs and their needs for housing in the areas where they wish to be housed as a priority and that it is not possible to evade the intention of the 1969 Act.  One of the gravest problems of the 1969 Act is that it can be evaded, that it has a number of defects, that it does not solve the worst of the housing problems. Therefore, as Deputy Quinn did in 1977 in the other House, I oppose a further extension of this Housing Act of 1969 because I believe the Government have done nothing at all in the two-year interval about this most important social problem, and I am absolutely staggered that the Minister of State is less sure of where he is going now than was his Minister in December, 1977, on one of the most serious social issues facing the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I hope the word goes forth from this House that the Government, having assured us that there would be permanent legislation before November 1979, now come into the House looking for a further two years because the Minister of State does not know what he is going to do.  He is uncertain; he is reluctant; he is unsure; and he needs more time to think about it.  There is not any more time to think about the deterioration in the housing <Col N="31" /> stock in Dublin, the crisis that faces so many families in Dublin, and the lack of an overall housing policy which will enable the housing authority, the Dublin City Council, and the Dublin County Council, to meet their commitments to the people who desperately need housing. Therefore, I intend to oppose this measure.  It is a disgrace and a defeat for the Minister to come in looking for a further two year extension of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it appears that, despite what Shakespeare suggested, the quality of mercy is becoming rather strained, I will just make a few brief remarks.  Anything that can save habitable houses is to be commended at any time.  As the Minister for State said.  &ldquo;The purpose of the Housing Act, 1969, was to prevent the unwarranted demolition or change of use of habitable houses which was depleting the housing stock at a time of difficulty in keeping pace with housing demand, particularly in Dublin city&rdquo;.  Of course, I am not very familiar with the local scene in Dublin.  I know a fair amount about it in a general way, but I do know something about housing throughout the country. All one needs to do in passing through the various counties of this State is to keep one's eyes open to see the enormous strides being made in the matter of housing.  It is fair to say that possibly no other Government have done more, are doing more, or will continue to do more for housing than the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further problem has come to light within the past few months.  We felt it was there all the time, but now it has been proved beyond all doubt, and neither of the two previous speakers made reference to it, that is, our increasing population.  The recent census returns show that the population is increasing at an enormous rate, faster than in any other country in western Europe. Together with that extraordinary increase in the population, thousands of people are coming back here to take up employment and to live here.  They prefer to live here than elsewhere.  They <Col N="32" /> are coming back not by the hundreds but by the thousands.  So the housing problem is getting bigger and bigger, and no matter how fast we can build houses, we cannot build enough.  We can never have enough houses built.  If the extension of this order helps in any way to ease the problem then if we are sincere in our anxiety to have people housed, we should be unanimous in commending its extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald queried the overall housing policy of the Government.  I should like to inform him that such a policy exists and, in general, it follows the criteria suggested by him, that is, to ensure that people are properly housed in appropriate accommodation, at a cost or a rent they can afford.  This is to be achieved not only by new buildings&mdash;and the number of new houses being completed has been rising&mdash;but by conserving existing houses.  This conservation is being secured not only by negative controls like those under the 1969 Act, although these are important, but by schemes of grants and loans which are more generous, more wide-ranging, and more flexible than any schemes operated by any previous Administration.  In 1977 my Department allocated, 11,211 house improvement grants.  Last year the total was 24,496.  So far this year 37,000 applications for grants have been submitted to the Department.  Combined with the negative controls under the 1969 Act and the planning code, this great volume of work must make a tremendous impact on the quality of the national housing stock.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson suggested that the 1969 Act has been largely ineffective in preserving houses in Dublin.  She based her criticism on statistics of applications to the corporation for permissions under the Act.  I should like, however, to draw her attention to the comment in my opening statement that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>these figures do not of themselves show the full measure of the Act's effectiveness. <Col N="33" /> Account must also be taken of its deterrent value and of the number of replacement dwellings provided or capital contributions made to the local housing authorities where permission for demolition had been granted subject to these conditions.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also stated that I do not know where I am going in relation to the conservation of existing stock.</P>

Before a firm decision is taken the analysis to which I have referred must be carried out in full detail.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I should like to thank the Senators for their contributions and to say it is clear from the points made during the debate that the motion now before the House should be carried.  I said in my opening address that housing output continues to increase.  This is true and, while it must be accepted that new houses are essential, it is important also that the existing housing stock should be preserved where possible, not only for social and economic reasons but also because it contains much architectural merit.  I should like to assure Senators that any constructive suggestions made during the debate will be borne in mind when future policy on housing controls is being determined.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister one question?  He has given us very interesting figures for the increased number of grants in response to applications for money to conserve the existing stock of houses.  I will not make another speech, but these are figures essentially indicating public expenditure for which the taxpayer has to pay.  This is my question.  Is there in the local authority code authority given to local councils to go into the business of acquiring existing houses, whether rented or not, for the purposes of maintaining them, altering them, doing whatever is required of them, to rent them?  If there is such a provision, perhaps the Minister would tell me what it is, though I know this is a jungle.  If there is such a provision can the Minister say if the policy is applied anywhere of operating it in the code?</P>
      <P>There is an alternative which would not cost the taxpayer money.  It could be a profitable venture for Dublin Corporation, for example, if we take a city which is so hard-pressed with this problem, to buy rent controlled dwellings and wait until the unfortunate protected tenants' interest expired, and meanwhile maintain the premises and make them available to other people at a profit to the corporation and not at a cost to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator FitzGerald, housing authorities have authority under the Housing Acts to purchase houses, to renovate them and to lease them to tenants.  Generally speaking, it is not the policy of housing authorities to do so for a few reasons. Dublin Corporation tidied up Sean Mac-Dermott Street on a few occasions, but it was not very successful.</P>

They would be in competition with private enterprise.  We all know how <Col N="35" /> the price of houses could be pushed up if it were known that local authorities were interested in the purchase of these houses.

In 1977 the Minister for the Environment said there was a Bill at an advanced stage to provide permanent controls such as those under the Housing Act, 1969.  It appears that the Minister of State here today is indicating a change of Government policy.  Is that correct?  Has there been a change of Government policy in this area, or what has happened to those proposals which were at an advanced stage in 1977?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an enabling measure.  The purpose of the Bill, in simple terms, is to empower the statutory road authorities to make schemes for the application of tolls to appropriate road facilities and to enter into arrangements with private entrepreneurs for the provision, financing, maintenance and management of such toll facilities.</P>
      <P>The concept of financing certain types of road facilities by a toll charge on the users is widely understood and is applied in countries with such diverse wealth, resources and levels of development as the United States of America, France, Italy, Brazil and the Philippines, as well as our nearest neighbours, the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>It is public knowledge that interest has been expressed by the private sector in the provision of new road and bridge projects on a toll basis in this country. The Government have indicated that they are open to the idea that, under the aegis of the road authorities, suitable projects might be provided on a toll basis in which private enterprise may participate. At present there is no statutory power whereby the provision or the use of a public road or bridge could be subject to tolls.  This Bill is intended to provide the statutory framework within which such developments could take place.  It does this by supplementing the power and functions which the road authorities have under existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> The underlying principle of the Bill is that the existing statutory road authorities will continue to be responsible for the provision and maintenance of the public road network, including bridges.  There is no question of bodies setting themselves up to provide and operate toll facilities independently of the road authorities.  But, as already stated, local authorities will be able to enter into agreements with private entrepreneurs, where they consider it appropriate to do so, in the development of suitable projects.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that it will be the statutory road authorities&mdash;and they alone&mdash;who will decide whether any toll projects might be undertaken under the terms of the Bill.  The Bill provides that the making of schemes for the institution of tolls and of by-laws for the operation of toll projects, and decisions to enter into agreements with private interests and the making of agency arrangements with other road authorities, will be reserved to the elected members of the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>There are specific provisions in the Bill to protect the rights and interests of individuals.  Notice of the making of a toll scheme, together with an explanatory statement, must be published in the press; the public will have at least one month to consider the scheme, the explanatory statement and the relevant maps.  A further period of at least two months will be available in which persons may lodge objections.  In the event of objections being lodged, a local inquiry must be held before a decision is taken to proceed with a scheme.  In addition, a new subsection was inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil under which road authorities drawing up toll schemes will be required to give special consideration to the question of granting exemptions from tolls to pedestrians, pedal cyclists, invalid carriages and vehicles specially adapted for use by physically handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>Publication last May of the Road Development Plan for the eighties has shown clearly that the Bill does not herald an era of widespread toll charges on our public road network.  The <Col N="38" /> Government have already demonstrated their intention to provide for an increasing level of investment of public funds in the country's road infrastructure over the coming decade, and the plan puts the concept of tolls into perspective.  I quote paragraph 8.7 of the text which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government hope that the private sector will respond to this opportunity to participate in the development of the country's road system. The availability of private finance for road projects and/or the institution of tolls will not alter the general plan to any significant extent.  The schedules of major projects to be undertaken will remain the same, but the timing of some of them might be advanced.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary, at this stage, to detail each section of the Bill. However, I would stress, again, that it is an enabling measure and one which will provide an additional option to road authorities for the financing of particular road facilities, such as river crossings, which are necessary in the general traffic and transportation interest.  It will do this by:</P>
    <P>(a)  enabling tolls to be charged: section 2 provides the general power to levy tolls; section 3 stipulates the conditions which must be fulfilled before a toll can be instituted, and is intended primarily for the protection of the public from any proliferation of tolls; section 5 provides for the making of by-laws relating to day-to-day operation, or management, of a toll facility, and,</P>
    <P>(b)  enabling road authorities to enter into agreements with private persons or companies in relation to the financing, construction, maintenance and operation of toll facilities.</P>
    <P>All the major decisions, schemes, by-laws and agreements will accordingly be made by the elected members of the statutory road authorities and, as an additional safeguard of the public interest, the approval of the Minister will also be necessary.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This is a very unhappy Bill.  It is insufficiently justified either by the language of its sections or the contribution of the responsible Minister in the other House, or the Minister here present.  We have a very serious problem of traffic congestion. Everyone knows that.  I should have thought the Minister would have felt it desirable to inform the Oireachtas of the dimensions of the problem.  It may be that the reason why he has abstained from doing this is that, although this Bill is described as the Local Government (Toll Roads) Bill, 1978, it &ldquo;ain't&rdquo; any such thing.  It is a Bill to enable a particular thing to be done, a particular entrepeneurial proposal to be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>We all know&mdash;anyone who has suffered the discipline of the law or a belt of it knows&mdash;that local authorities cannot enter into contracts beyond their powers. None of us wants to prevent a worthwhile scheme going through, through some absence of legal power on the part of the local authority to make the appropriate contract for that scheme. That may be the reason for the absence of an outline of the nature of the problem from the responsible Minister or the Minister of State.  I see no reason why specific authority for specific operations should not be sought from the Houses of the Oireachtas and given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the utilisation of private enterprise, if you like.  In fact, I have a great belief&mdash;not in private enterprise, because that is not the term&mdash;in the desirability of free enterprise, the term which alone, I think, properly justified it.  Certainly on no ideological principle would I object to authority being given to enable what is understood to be a particular project to go ahead.  Then we could look at it and if a particular bridge is to be built, we could ask ourselves questions about the effect on the overall flow of traffic towards the bridge. It obviously would have an effect on the flow of traffic both to and fro, with some social consequences, some economic consequences.  All this could be discussed, and the Houses of the <Col N="40" /> Oireachtas would be the appropriate place to do so.  Maybe this is why we have not had what we should have in a Bill which is supposed to be generally applicable to all local authorities, that is, a description of the nature of our problems.</P>
    <P>If I understand it correctly, a higher percentage of passengers and freight go by road in this country than in any other country in Europe, and this has been increasing overall at the rate of six per cent per annum.  Passenger and freight traffic has, therefore, doubled in 12 years.  The main source of that increase is private traffic, but, from 1970 to this year, there has been an increase of 55 per cent in the capacity of heavy commercial vehicles using our roads.  While there has been a rate of increase of six per cent in the period given in the overall use of roads, there has been an increase of only 1.5 per cent in real terms in expenditure on these roads.  We have reached the stage where the cost of road construction is not less than&mdash;and on the most up-to-date calculation it may be much greater than&mdash;£1 million per mile.  The nature of the problem then is high congestion caused by increased urbanisation, caused by and now impeding economic development with a low level of financial provision.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about this?  Certainly we are not doing anything about it in this Bill that would make sense to me, but maybe I am wrong.  It is reasonably clear to me that there is no way in principle in which tolls should be excluded.  In fact tolls have at least the advantage attached to the rate demand note, that the taxpayer, the user of the road, could relate his payment to the service he was getting.  However unjustified the structure of rates may have been, there was that merit in the notional Road Fund which is now among the unlamented dead.  Therefore road tolls may be a method.  There are arguments for and against them.  Which roads?  Presumably the major primary roads, by-pass roads, perhaps roads to tourist areas or something of that kind.  This is a matter for very deep debate and consideration, and if the figures I have been giving are <Col N="41" /> correct this debate should have been taking place years ago, or at any rate much earlier.  There are disadvantages to tolls, for instance, on the one hand if the effect of the proper road system from an industrial point of view is that the producer or the exporter has no choice but to choke up the city with more traffic and would be glad to pay the price of avoiding that by getting on to a by-pass road.</P>
    <P>Obviously the rate of the tolls has to be considered on a national level.  It is not that there is going to be one price in one local area and another price in another.  It is not true that toll roads do not always pay for themselves.  I am informed, I hope correctly, that the State of Connecticut, before the Federal Government in America went into the business of providing money for national road financing, issued bonds in connection with the financing in an appropriately sized area&mdash;not a county here or there or a bit of a local authority with its lap before or behind it, but with a size justifying the operation&mdash;and giving the choice to the people in particular areas of the state paying tolls to get more quickly to some place or of people getting off the toll road and paying the cost of using roads that perhaps are not as good and on which they certainly would be slower.  That enterprise was so successful that the State of Connecticut is now seeking to repay the bonds and the bond-holders are not wanting their money back because they have a continuing interest under the terms of issue in the profits of that enterprise.</P>
    <P>The state of central finances of this country are such that nobody with any sense of responsibility is going to go roaring for more expenditure on anything but the most acutely urgent type of priority, but how do we justify this?  In this Bill I do not find any provision giving power to the local authority to borrow for this purpose.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell the House tonight that the road authority&mdash;to use that expression rather than local government, words which were used in the Bill&mdash;have express power to borrow.  I have in front of me a <Col N="42" /> photostat of a page, and the person who sent it to me is known to be entirely reputable, but unfortunately I am not able to assure the House that the writer is, as I believe he is, Street, but I hope he is.  The words that I will have to quote from this writer are to be found on page 101.  The page is entitled <i>Application of Enactments Order, 1898.</i>  It may be a modern edition:</P>
    <P>It has been submitted elsewhere by the author&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Indeed it must be a modern edition because of the next reference where he quotes himself on the subject of <i>ultra vires</i> in 1930, which obviously he was not doing in 1898, page 162 citing authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that a corporation may borrow only under express power, that the business of a public corporation is never such as to warrant borrowing as a usual proceeding, that where express power is given no further power can be implied and that to contract any borrowing in excess of power is void and curable only by statute.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the UK market prejudice against local issues, a prejudice which infects the Dublin market or has been infected perhaps by the Dublin market, a suitably framed modern type of issue in relation to a national project might get just the kind of money we want from the private sector.  If this be so, this is an opportunity, if anything is missing in existing legislation, to give the necessary express power.  If the Minister is going to inform me, in reply to this debate, that there is express power I would be grateful if he would give the House the explicit reference to it.  The Minister's answer may be, &ldquo;Well, we can always come again.  There is no borrowing proposed in what we are now going to do.&rdquo;  It may be, &ldquo;I am not going to say it but you are right; this Bill is not really what it pretends to be.  This is to get Dublin Corporation or whichever authority are involved through a project while we are thinking deeply about the whole horrible problem, and in due course, having lived with it, we are <Col N="43" /> prayerfully going to be speeded into quick action.&rdquo;  It is going to be very relevant that authority be given in modern terms relative to the modern financial market taking all the advantages that are there in terms of merchant bank and so forth advice so that the public sector, whether it be central government, local authority, regional authority and so on, has all the ability to get money that otherwise has in some way to be collected out of and added to the public deficit.</P>
    <P>There is another point relevant to what I have just said.  If any succeeding sentence of mine happens to be relevant to the one that preceded it, it is a happy accident for which I am always grateful. We ought not to become too obsessed with the size of the regional fund, believing that they have only a miserable amount there and we are going to get only so much out of it anyhow and why should we be bothered?</P>
    <P>On this question of the physical infrastructure, if we are sold on continued high rate of industrial and economic development, let us know that the physical infrastructure of which roads are an enormously important element, carry the cheapest and most economic type of transport necessary to make our production internationally competitive. A very good case could be made for assuming that on the Continent of Europe are people who are not total fools, that there are some people who take an overall view of this European situation and who, looking at the European situation, would say to themselves: &ldquo;Would that not be a worthwhile project?&rdquo; Would it not return not merely to the people who are being put off their normal means of transport to their bathing boxes, not merely to the residents of that country?  It may be good for us, thinking of the I-you business and us, to allow for them to be as bad as ourselves with open ideas and to see that whatever is good in the overall European idea would be served by projecting money in here.  We may be failing to go really rapidly and efficiently ahead with cohering our thoughts about improving our transport and cheapening the cost of <Col N="44" /> delivering the goods which we have to produce at a particular cost anyhow. The cost of the goods is what it costs the consumer to get them.  It is no good having them cheap a hundred miles from him.  They must be cheap at his door and getting them there is the vital thing.  This is the critical path which we have to take in making up transport terms in terms of our development.  We should move away from the reserved functions of local authorities type of concept.  Policy is required. A proper approach to this could assist even the procurement of long-term capital which will be needed for a type of high-cost priority and which would be justified on that high-cost priority basis. All this really permits piecemeal, construction-delayed type of activity.</P>

      <P>My objection to the Bill is much more simple and fundamental than Senator FitzGerald's.  He said that he had no objection in principle to the intrusion of what is euphemistically called free enterprise in this area.  I have every objection to the intrusion of private enterprise in this area.  Why should entrepreneurs make profit out of such a basic feature of human life as movement and transportation? Why do the local authorities themselves not do so if there is a need for a toll system?  Why can the public authorities, either at national or local level, not administer this system?  Given the road development plan of the 1980s which is referred to in the Minister's opening statement and which puts the stress on public development, why is it necessary to introduce an element of private enterprise at all?  The Minister, quoting the road development plan, said:</P>
      <P>The availability of private finance for road projects and/or the institution of tolls will not alter the general plan to any significant extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why then is it necessary to introduce into this area of a public service the seamy element of private enterprise which is concerned only with profits? The same private enterprise is to a large extent responsible for much of the evils in our road system at the moment.  It is <Col N="45" /> the greed of the entrepreneurs who want to make the maximum profit which accounts for the existence of the monster articulated trucks which both are dangerous and abuse our road resources without any regard for the public good.</P>
    <P>I have my doubts also about a situation where, as I understand the Bill, a local authority are in the business of granting to or withholding a licence from private enterprise.  That would seem to set the scene for all kinds of lobbying and intrigue in the best Irish political style.</P>
    <P>My simple objection to the Bill is a central one.  The notion of introducing private enterprise into a road system is regressive and, indeed, is a measure of how far the party from which this Government were chosen have departed from their populist origins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1979 is designed to amend the existing Defence Acts so as to provide in an express way for the enlistment of women into the Defence Forces, the appointment of women as officers of the Defence Forces and certain other connected matters.  It is, accordingly, the fulfilment of the Government's undertaking to establish a Women's Service Corps, the organisational basis of which I now propose to outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only specific provision in the Defence Act, 1954, for the admission of women to the Defence Forces is that which establishes the Army Nursing Service. While this service is an integral part <Col N="46" /> of the Defence Forces its members do not serve in the mainstream of military life as they are not, for obvious reasons, required to undertake ordinary military duties and are not subject to the military code of discipline.  The Bill now before the House is, therefore, the first legislative measure in the history of the State designed to admit to the Defence Forces a body of women soldiers who will have the same legal liabilities as men and will be integrated with their male colleagues in forming the modern Army.</P>
    <P>Since this will be such a radical departure from tradition it was desirable that the most painstaking examination of all its aspects should be carried out.  Accordingly my Department have given the most careful consideration to the question of how women might best be introduced into the hitherto exclusively male military environment.  As a result of this examination, in which I have taken a very personal interest, I have come to the conclusion that it is only by offering women a career which will allow them to participate in the fullest possible way in military life and activities that they will be enabled to find a level of career satisfaction commensurate with their aspirations and their undoubted abilities. I intend, therefore, that, subject to their exemption in normal circumstances from combatant status, women will be employed in a most comprehensive range of military duties.  Important and worthwhile appointments are available for them and there is absolutely no intention of adopting a policy of employing women in obscure areas of activity or on tasks which might be regarded as menial or subservient.  I would be most concerned that this assurance is clearly understood by all women who are interested in joining the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As regards entry to the forces and conditions of service generally the position is that enlistment will be open to both married and single applicants and with, one important exception, the conditions for enlistment and discharge will be the same as those which apply to men. The exception I have mentioned is a recognition of the importance which our society attaches to family life and the <Col N="47" /> care of children and will take the form of a provision in Defence Force Regulations that women who wish to do so will be allowed to terminate their military service on marriage or pregnancy or for related domestic reasons.  Paid maternity leave will be available to female personnel on the same basis as applies elsewhere in the civil service.  There will be no differentiation as between men and women in rates of pay and allowances.  I intend to provide an attractive uniform and I will ensure that there will be a good standard of accommodation available. This will be done either by adapting existing buildings where practicable&mdash;and work has already commenced in this area&mdash;or by erecting new buildings as part of the ongoing programme of providing better standards of accommodation for Defence Force personnel generally.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that there will be well organised facilities and personnel to look after the reception, training and welfare of the first general intake of recruits it is envisaged that a small number of specially selected women officers will be appointed initially and given a period of familiarisation and training.  If it is possible, the intention is that some of these will be women with previous military experience who will fill the key appointments of director and training officers. The appointment of this initial group will be undertaken as soon as practicable following the passage of the Bill and general recruitment will be initiated as soon thereafter as circumstances permit.  It is firmly intended that, with the minimum possible delay, the presence of women throughout the Defence Forces will be expanded to a significant degree.  According as numbers increase, deployment of women to appointments in every one of the four Commands will be stepped up.</P>

      <P>It is not appropriate for me to start developing any generalised views on the whole question of women in anything, but specially and expressly I welcome this Bill as a remedy against one of the injustices imposed on women by many societies.  But I regret having to say to the Chair and to the Minister that I find it a little condescending for the Minister to say of the career proposed that it is one which will allow them to participate in the fullest possible way in military life and activities and that they will be enabled to find a level of career satisfaction commensurate with their aspirations and their undoubted abilities.  Glory be to God, are we still at the point of thinking that, whatever the differences between male and female, the physiological aspects are capable of being developed to different degrees of eloquence by different Senators?  The psychological factors are very real also, but the nature of the injustice in the treatment through many centuries in many societies is such that I find I can adopt the words which I take from a recent publication by a German theologian, who was good enough to write it in English for me:</P>
      <P>A most harmful power in the world is male power or sexism.</P>
      <P>If I may go on to quote, on the Defence Forces Bill, he proceeds:</P>
      <P>As early as the Book of Genesis we are shown that the domineering attitude of man over woman is a result of sin and alienation and continues to embody sinfulness in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, Genesis, verses 3 to 16.  It is important to say this.  I am glad to note the reference, in the last words of the Minister's speech, to the Countess <Col N="49" /> Markievicz.  I do not think it necessary to remind the House of the earlier and very much greater Joan of Arc whom Shaw said had the realism of Napoleon and the capacity to maintain her intent until the other fellow was beaten every bit as real as Napoleon had.  I do not wish to harp upon it, but it is a little condescending to be talking of the careers of women being commensurate with their aspirations and their undoubted ability. One female Senator has been described as the best Senator in this House by somebody.  I was present when the words were used and I felt it like a flash of pain upon my back.  But if there is any serious competition for placing her there it comes from her own sex.  So much for the male reference to the female's undoubted abilities.  I trust that the policy of adjusting this matter&mdash;I have a point on that which will apply not merely to this Bill but to many other situations of this kind, that there is a general's baton, or whatever is the modern equivalent to the marshal's baton, in every woman's knapsack&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy can be very funny sometimes, but not always.  I do not find that funny because men carry handbags, very sensibly, in certain places when there are a lot of unpleasant other men around and unpleasant women too.  Let us not get this wrong either.  I hope that the highest places in the Army are available in the manner in which this is constructed.  I do not understand the reference to the exemption from combatant status.  I do not see the necessity for this, I wish immediately to say that it is not merely a question of simply what they call family life.  It is the infinitely more precious thing of the relationship between the mother and child, the closest unity known psychologically to man, that must be borne in mind in relation to combatant status or any other thing that woman is free to choose to do.  I would like to end with a repetition of what I intended to be a compliment to the Minister in relation to this Bill, the direction <Col N="50" /> in which it is going.  I am glad that Senator Robinson has just come in.  It would be inappropriate on her arrival to quote Kipling that the female of this species is more deadly than the male.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the House's attention, please, to the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and the first four letters in that word &ldquo;j, u, s, t,&rdquo;. These letters are, I believe, exactly the same letters and have the same meaning as the letters &ldquo;j, u, s, t&rdquo; which appear in &ldquo;adjustment&rdquo;.  I would like to put the view that the correction of injustice is a question also of timing.  It is a question of how quickly do you make an adjustment? If you decided at 12 midnight that all the clocks should be put back by four hours you would have to wait for a few hours to do it.</P>
      <P>There is always a time for doing things.  There is always a matter of judgment involved or the question of the speed of change.  All you can do is recognise something to be wrong.  The cost of putting it right is to be borne.  Let us see how to judge how this cost should be borne.  After the enactment of this Bill we do not need a new Countess Markievicz to take over the Army.  Long before compulsory literacy Joan of Arc was able to wield very astonishing power.  I dare to say that in the presence of Senator Murphy.  Therefore, the timing of any changes is important on the matter of doing justice.  We should recognise the injustice of sexism.  We want to put it right.  We must know that it is a cultural matter, there is a cultural carry forward and a psychological structure in other people affected by that, who will not understand because there is limited understanding.</P>

There is, as the Minister has said, a long tradition in this country of women playing a role in relation to Cumann na mBan and also the Minister has mentioned Countess Markievicz.  Recently we have had the nursing service which has integrated so <Col N="51" /> well as part of the Defence Forces.  In today's conditions particularly, where you have very modern, very sophisticated equipment of all types, not just sheer physical sloggery, there is no reason why women should not play an effective role if they so wish and it is on a volunteer basis that we are talking.  Women are taking their part in every other aspect of national life.  It is just and appropriate that they should have, if they so wish, the opportunity of playing a role in relation to our Defence Forces as well. I am sure that it will be a very beneficial and very useful role.</P>
      <P>There are many examples elsewhere. In Britain there is the Women's Royal Naval Service, the Royal Army Corps and the Women's Royal Air Force.  They are an integral part of the British defence forces serving both in Britain and with British overseas forces.  As well as that, they have the nursing services and women members of the forces, the same as men, have the opportunity of serving up to 22 years either on active service or on the reserve.  Women are involved both in the regular army itself and in the territorial army as volunteers as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into all the details but taking, for example, the Women's Royal Army Corps in Britain, women's employment extends right across communications, motor transport as well as the sort of clerical and catering duties which the men do and should do as well. They also occupy intelligence positions and they take part in the staff headquarters matters.  They play a role right through the armed forces in Britain and this role is constantly being enlarged.  I was glad to read the statement on the Defence Estimates for 1979, paragraph 404, which emphasised the progress which has been made in integrating the organisation, training and employment of members of the Women's Royal Naval Service into the Royal Navy and in equalising their conditions of service as far as possible.  They have an ongoing study on the wider employment of the Women's Royal Army Corps which is nearing completion and as part of this and in continuance of the policy of employing <Col N="52" /> women as widely as possible in the Royal Air Force, present policies are under examination with a view to permitting them into the Army and Royal Air Force for defensive purposes only. The Royal Navy have no plans for arming the Women's Royal Naval Service. Male nurses are to be incorporated into the RAF nursing service.  This is just an example of what is going on in Britain.</P>
    <P>In the States, of course, there is a very large component.  The authorised women's establishment in the US Forces is over 48,000 and very few practical problems have arisen.  They are recognised now to have played a very valuable role both at home and overseas. This role includes the US Navy, where women now serve in many of the technical branches of sea-going vessels. Again, there is no reason nowadays, when many sophisticated pieces of apparatus exist, that women should not do these jobs as well as men and have the opportunity of doing so.  Where women have been given this opportunity they are certainly showing that they are more than capable of doing it perfectly well.</P>
    <P>There are many other examples elsewhere.  The Minister will know from his recent visit to the Middle East that in Israel there is compulsory service for women.  Single women from 18 to 26 years undergo compulsory military service and they remain on the reserves until they are aged 34.  Again, there have been very few problems and the women in the Israeli army have played a very valuable role which has encompassed all military duties other than direct combat responsibility.</P>
    <P>A more extreme example is the Soviet Union where during World War II women played quite a major combat role although this is not perhaps fully recognised.  I am sure we have no intentions in that regard but I hope, other than that, the Minister will see that women officers and women soldiers in our Army have every possible opportunity to compete on equal terms with men both for posting and for promotion. I hope that our women soldiers have the opportunity also of serving overseas just <Col N="53" /> like the men.  I am delighted to welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to steal my colleague's thunder, here on my right, but I just want to say a few words.  What strikes me about the Bill is that it is extremely vague.  It tells us very little indeed and the Minister's statement tells us a great deal more.  Why is that so?  For example, there is no reference in the Bill, as far as I can make out, to the question of combatancy or non-combatancy nor is there a reference in the Bill to the Women's Service Corps which is mentioned in the first paragraph of the Minister's statement.  It is very difficult to talk about the Bill itself because it tells us so little about what is actually proposed.  Of course, one welcomes the general principle of the introduction of women into the Defence Forces but as has already been pointed out there is a certain tone of condescension in the statement and I am sure women are very concerned as to how far this condescension will be translated into hard realities, cash, promotion, and so forth.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of combatancy, I see no reason whatsoever why women, if they want to be involved in the part of a real army, should not be willing to undertake combatant roles.  As has already been suggested, it is an historic tradition before modern man perhaps began to relegate woman to what he deems to be her proper place.  It is a fine heroic Irish tradition stretching all the way from Queen Maeve to Granuaile and on to Countess Markievicz and to the various formidable women who were to be found mostly, I am afraid, on the anti-Treaty side in the revolutionary period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of combatancy is a serious one, not, indeed, that one hopes that any member of an Irish Army will ever be engaged in any kind of aggressive combatancy, that we would ever be committed to making war on our fellow men and women.  To the extent that frontline risks exist for our soldiers in peace-keeping operations and in security operations within the State then I see no reason whatsoever why <Col N="54" /> women should not undertake these roles as well as the more perhaps stereotyped roles envisaged for them.  Here is the crunch point, of course: can the women really be integrated into the Army?  The phrase is used in the second paragraph of the Minister's speech.  Can the women be taken seriously by their male colleagues in the Army unless they have the opportunity of fulfilling all roles which are open to them in Army life and unless they are paid and promoted accordingly? There is the crunch.  Are the women under this legislation to form a sexist regiment of their own or section of their own?  Is their eligibility for promotion to stop short within their own terms of reference or are they going to have an equal crack at all levels of promotion which are now open to men?  It is with some reservations and with these questions in my mind that I welcome in principle the introduction of women into our Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LadyGoulding" hpid="Lady Goulding Lady Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Lady Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I am talking as the only woman in the Oireachtas who has been in an army in another nation from private to commissioned rank seeing sights which I hope nobody else will see.  We were non-combatant.  At first I thought when this Bill came that it was a good idea that women should be non-combatant but I must say now, thinking over my four years in the army, that probably what I was doing was as bad as pulling the trigger of a rifle.  In fact, I was letting a man go to the front and I was taking his job at the back.  I was on a searchlight site adjoining an anti-aircraft site.  We were trying to find the aircraft and the men next to me were trying to shoot them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel in all conscience that that really is a comedy.  I welcome this Bill very much.  I am certain that this women's army will be as good as any other army in the world and as good as the army that I was in.  I am still not sure about combatant and non-combatant status, but I want to say that this army will be a model army, and it will not be as it was 30 or 40 years ago when you actually saw what you did to your fellow man when you pulled a trigger or helped to <Col N="55" /> pull a trigger.  I would not want anyone to see what I have seen of bodies being blown to bits or people screaming with wounds in their stomachs.  You could easily say that that is a brutalising thing but it brutalises men as well as women and maybe women have more sympathy to the sights that they see.  I can say that seeing these horrors did not brutalise me. I am just as worried as I was before if I run over a dog or hen on the road.  I am just as squeamish and just as likely to faint or be sick.  I feel that if this women's army are to be a real army they should be, if necessary, combatant.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up just one point, though, that Senator Murphy referred to. He said that if they were non-combatant perhaps they should not be paid as much as the men who are combatant.  May I say that during that war in another place there were ten men who were non-combatant to the one who was in the field fighting and there was never any hassle about whether one should be paid more than another?  The corporal doing the stores got the same as the corporal who was actually in the firing line and fighting.  I do not think that is a very good point Senator Murphy made.</P>
    <P>I am really thinking on my feet as I did not know that I was going to speak today.  I feel that this women's army should be a full army and being full army means that they will pull the trigger.  Nowadays it is not so much pulling the trigger, it is pressing a button and hoping they will not see the disaster they are causing.  Hopefully this women's army will never be needed for anything like that but if they are the women could and should be fully combatant. It will not make them any more masculine, if men are frightened of that, it will not brutalise them.  When you come out from that war, you come home never wanting to shoot a bird or hunt a fox.  You never want to hurt anybody or anything because you have seen too much and, therefore, I ask the Minister to think about it.  I welcome this Bill because it is very necessary.  Women can play a full and proper part.  I believe they will get an even chance.  I am certain that <Col N="56" /> after a year or two the men in the Army who may not be liking this very much will understand that women are equally able either to take up arms or do a job to release a man in the field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, very briefly, like to welcome this Bill and indeed to wish the new ladies' corps every success.  Many very important points already have been made in the debate.  I look forward to seeing the fair sex play a very leading role in the defence of the nation. The only place that I have seen lady soldiers is in Israel.  I met them there driving tanks and lorries a couple of years ago.  They seem to be able to undertake every task with the same ability as their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be a little more generous when it comes to designing and providing smart uniforms for these girls. It is a crib in the Defence Forces, in the FCA more than in the permanent forces, that successive Governments and the Department have always been rather stingy when it came to providing the finance to provide good quality and smart looking uniforms for their personnel. If we are to have a ladies' section this detail will have to be attended to.  We have the very smart uniforms of the Irish Army nurses who were all commissioned. They served the country and the forces well, as previous Senators have said, over the years.  If we are to have all ranks, privates and corporals, the Department will have to come up with the finance and perhaps the style to equip these young ladies so that they will be able to be not only an asset to the force but a decoration to the force as well.  I can see, once these young ladies get established, a great rush to join the armed services.  I wish the Minister well in his recruitment drives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill itself is not very informative. The Minister does not go out of his way to point out the actual tasks the Department or the Minister has in mind for the first batch of recruits.  He does not say whether they are to be stationed in every camp.  I had the opportunity of visiting a number of Army camps in 1969.  I know that at least one new camp has been <Col N="57" /> provided, but the services and facilities available up to a few years ago were not great.  I hope that the Department will be in a position to provide the proper services. I remember being involved in a hassle to get the Board of Works to provide more than one wash hand basin for the entire nursing staff in the Curragh.  That is only two or three years ago.  If we are now going to embark on bringing a new ladies' corps into the Army at least we have to provide all our soldiers, whether male or female, with at least hot as well as cold water in the washrooms.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill about that. I see nothing in the Estimate for the Department for the provision of new facilities.  The Minister should have given the Members of this House an opportunity of looking at the facilities across the country to see how suitable they are to take on any lady members of the forces, and how suitable the existing services are.  There should be hot and cold water in every washroom in the State for the ordinary privates, corporals and every rank.  When it took three years' agitation to provide a second wash-basin for the entire staff of nurses in the Curragh hospital I have my doubts whether or not the Department see any urgency in providing 1980 standards for members of our permanent Defence Forces.  Nothing is being done to attract young girls into the permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I am hoping that the Minister will be able to give the House an assurance that the facilities and the services available to these new recruits are up to modern standards, to the standards that people expect&mdash;indeed the standards they enjoy in their own homes.  With those few reservations I welcome the Bill and I wish success to those who will opt to serve our country in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words of welcome for this Bill.  I feel that I was somewhat responsible for the inclusion of the suggestion of this legislation in the policy document of some years ago.  I congratulate the Minister on putting into operation some of the items <Col N="58" /> that were outlined in that discussion document and indeed in the manifesto.</P>
      <P>In this area there are many important items that have not been touched on. Many of the speakers have tended to speak about the role of the women's corps which is going to be an evolving role in any event but we should examine also the question of recruitment, of conditions of employment and, indeed, the question of retirement.  We should have a look at some aspect of the situation in relation to each of those factors.  Then we can come to realistic grips with the problem.  The first consideration&mdash;and this was in my mind at the time the document was formulated&mdash;was that there would be a positive career structure. We have the advantage of knowing what has been the experience in other countries in which women have been engaged in the defence forces.  One speaker here who has been a member of such a service could be of great assistance in the development of the service as a whole.  It is important that there be a positive structure on which people coming into the service can base their future.  It was all too sad to see people coming into the Defence Forces at times when the career structure was not as positive as it might have been, but that situation has changed.  The career structure aspect has been modified and updated, with great credit to the Minister in the short period that he has been in the Department of Defence.  People must know exactly what their opportunities are and how far those opportunities will go during the course of their service.  We must ensure that during the course of their service there is the availability of technical training, of educational facilities and of leisure training and that there is scope for the fulfilment of whatever academic or cultural attachments recruits may have.  We must think in terms of a much wider basis than, for instance, the pulling of triggers.  There must be far more to this women's force than just the pulling of a trigger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cultivation of a career structure followed by periodic assessments will be necessary in the evolution of this service. The role of the service will evolve over a <Col N="59" /> period, and in that period we will have to take all these positive factors into consideration so that on retirement women will be able to enter the labour market with positive updated trends to meet the requirements of the labour market in the future.  It is not just as simple as saying &ldquo;Bring them in, train them and let them out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be very concerned about the whole procedure from the day that people are brought into the service to the day they retire. Women can perform a very important and very practicable service in the force. Some aspects of that service have been outlined here today, but there are a great number of areas where women can participate in the future.  One of the speakers mentioned the highly sophisticated equipment that is being brought in.  We are moving into a computerised situation now in armed service, not alone here but elsewhere.  In the future there will be highly-sophisticated, computerised armies both here and elsewhere.  It is well on the cards that the boys in the Pentagon and in the Kremlin will be looking at the next war on television and directing the situation from the underground areas.  There is the situation of the development equipment and the technical knowledge that will be required and of where women can play a very effective and positive role.</P>
    <P>When we examine all the guidelines that have been laid down, or can be or will be laid down in the future, we will say that we can have something positive and something that we can be proud of to offer to the women who join the service. Women have many technical skills and are more adaptable to many areas than are the men who are in the Defence Forces.  I could enumerate very many, having examined this matter in some detail in the past, but I am not going to bore the Minister.  He is a practical and dedicated man and I know that he will take into consideration every problem that is presented to him and indeed every idea that is presented to him in the formulation of this force and in its evolution in a very positive way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> It is not only to make women trigger-happy that this service is being developed.  It is being developed as a very practical unit, and we are going to give all the facilities to the occupants of the force that are necessary and desirable and within our reach.  I was sorry to hear Senator McDonald speak in some of the terms in which he projected his views.  They were not that complimentary. I visited almost every military barracks in the country and I found that the facilities had been increasing over the years, thanks to successive Ministers for Defence.  I am glad to say that in a recent time I was in a barracks at which the Minister himself saw to it that major developments in order to meet modern requirements were speedily implemented.</P>
    <P>When we have this type of situation with members and indeed Ministers there is no need for us to get excited about an odd situation that one may find in the entire military field where there may be some problems.  There are problems, too, in Dáil Éireann, in Seanad Éireann and elsewhere.  There are problems among parties, problems among people and problems among families.  We all have defects in some ways.  When we all have personal defects, apart altogether from party defects and family defects, we are bound to find some defects in some barracks in the country, but it is unfair of Senator McDonald to pick out one situation.  If he presents that situation to the Minister, I am sure it will be speedily rectified.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other aspects of the women's corps&mdash;the area of training&mdash;the question of the development of their skills and the attainment of higher educational awards, where necessary, will play a large part in the future.  There should be facilities for anyone who might wish to further her education while serving in the force.  The officers have the opportunity of attending universities in various places, and I hope that the Minister in due course will spell out that these opportunities will be available also to those who join the women's corps.  In the area of physical education, too, it is important <Col N="61" /> that the women will be able to avail of the full range of facilities in order to enable them to attain the highest possible performances in the sport of their choice or in the area of their choice in relation to physical education.  There are such opportunities for existing members of the Defence Forces but we now have a new opportunity to perfect even more mature and more sophisticated physical training courses.  Indeed, it has been pointed out that some members of the Defence Forces are on the verge of Olympic distinction. There is no reason why other members also should not be on the verge of Olympic distinction.  I think that with the facilities, the training opportunities and a future properly planned and understood, we can meet a situation in which there is a vacuum at the moment. The overspill will certainly help the defence forces.</P>
    <P>Members of the force must be encouraged, too, to develop their artistic or cultural inclinations.  It would be regrettable that women joining the force would neglect any area of artistic or cultural activity in which they had been interested. They should be given the opportunity not only to develop whatever talents they may have but to pass on such talents to others.</P>
    <P>In the area of career welfare, members can play a very important and involved part.  I will mention just one or two such areas but I will communicate with the Minister further in this regard.  I am confident that he will consider all ideas put to him in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are sadly lacking in the area of career welfare.  Perhaps it would be more advantageous to have women rather than men advise the wives of service men on the many problems that one encounters in the performance of military duties.  This is an area where women who have had specialised training in the welfare field can contribute much.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas, too, where the service can and must get full recognition.  The question of apprenticeship and job training is important.  As we have the apprenticeship schools in Casement and in Naas, there is no <Col N="62" /> reason in the future for not having an extension of these schools or having other schools to cater for the needs of the members of the force.  In the past it was all too sad to see many ex-service men ending their days working on petrol pumps.  It was a sad reflection on the State that this should happen to men who served this nation so wisely and well.  That is why we must be in a position to equip the Defence Forces with the additional knowledge and skill to meet an ever-changing labour market.  It will be important that women in the future who have spent a considerable period within the Defence Forces would have at the end of their service an updating and a training to meet the technical changes that will take place in the labour market.  In this way we can ensure that when they retire they will be able to find positions way up the ladder which would be their rightful place having served the nation.</P>
    <P>It is all too sad to see so many people who are written off as failures, having completed their service to this nation.  I hope that this attitude will change.  We now have an opportunity to do something very positive to ensure that there is a positive link between recruitment and retirement that there are suitable job opportunities at the end of the period of service.</P>
    <P>I would see nothing wrong with members being given the additional opportunity of on-the-job training outside for industry or elsewhere for possibly the last six months or so of their service so as to give them the type of recognition and the type of assistance that we would all like to see them have.</P>
    <P>There are very many areas indeed that one could teach on.  The equitation school has been mentioned.  In the Nation's Cup and in various other competitions there are just as many females now participating as there are men.  I hope that the equitation school will not be closed to the lady members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The whole question of women needs consideration in relation to other problems, too, because women have problems that are quite different from <Col N="63" /> those which men have when it comes to military service.  There is the question for instance of married women being eligible for service.  There is the question of the assistance that will be given in relation to educational training to dependants of members of the Defence Forces who are either killed, die or are injured in service.  We have to take a very positive responsibility here.  If we are to attract married women into our defence forces, we must have regard to these other responsibilities that would follow.  A woman may be married or widowed or her husband may be disabled. There may be a number of different groupings but we will have to sort out these and ensure that whatever problems develop, particularly in relation to family upbringing, we will cover them the same as they are covered in many other areas.  We have many responsibilities that we should be undertaking in relation to service now, responsibilities that we have not taken account of in the past.  We have the opportunity now of doing something in a very positive and real way, in developing a force and in projecting a role and a policy in relation to that force that we can all be fully proud of.</P>
    <P>From time to time there should be assessment to find out how weak or how strong are the members in various areas so that they would get assistance and guidance in order to ensure that they could equip themselves to meet the future in a very positive and real way.  If they have defects or if they have difficulties, we should ensure that, having given their service to the nation, we would lend this helping hand to ensure that these difficulties are overcome.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the speed with which he has brought this measure forward.  I know it is a measure which requires in-depth thinking and investigation. Indeed, the Minister has been moving right along such lines since he assumed office.  I look forward to an enthusiastic response to the recruitment drive for women to join the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual to welcome <Col N="64" /> Bills which are considered, as is this one considered apparently by all Senators, to be non-controversial.  I have to admit that I have such mixed feelings about it that I could not possibly give it an unqualified welcome.  On the one hand, as a woman I resent the exclusion of women from any area of activity in which they wish to engage.  On the other hand&mdash;and this is the source of my great hesitation about this Bill&mdash;I feel no attachment of any kind to any Army.  I also have suspicions as to the motives for the introduction of this Bill, and I am inclined to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and say that high among his motives would be to undo a wrong that has been done to women in the past in excluding them from this area.  However, I also understand there is a grave shortage of manpower in the Army and that there is dissatisfaction among the men with doing lots of jobs that have to be done. That might be another motive.  The Minister will have to forgive me for suspicions like this, because women have become a very suspicious lot of people in this country and have had good reason to be so.</P>
      <P>I am glad that this Bill recognises the injustice of keeping women away from a job which they may or may not want to do.  It is indicative to me of certain attitudes towards women that a lot of Senators seem to have difficulty in using the word women.  There is only one person in this House who might be properly described as a lady and the rest of us are women or females, and I have noticed this again and again.  There seems to be great difficulty in calling a spade a spade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the permission which is now going to be given to women to join the Army I hope they will not want to join the Army.  I hope they will not flock to the jobs that will be available to them because I believe, to use the Minister's words, that &ldquo;the male military environment&rdquo; has very little to do with women or very little to offer to women.  It never had.  Women were never part of that scene, despite the so-called glorious history of Maeve and Grainne and Countess Markievicz.  We can remember <Col N="65" /> them because they were the exceptions, but women were never as a rule engaged in that kind of aggressive activity. Despite the fact that our Army is certainly not cast in an aggressive, imperialistic, combative role, the Oxford Dictionary definition of an army is &ldquo;an organised body of men armed for war&rdquo;. That is what an army means, and war is legitimised violence.  It is destruction which is given legitimacy.  It is about death.  War has always been a man's business.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding in her excellent, too short, but absolutely excellent contribution demonstrated the schizophrenia which we all feel about armies nowadays and in particular about what armies actually do and what they are there for. Senator Goulding spoke about feeling that she was combatant.  She spoke about the fact that beside her were people pressing buttons or pointing guns to bring other people to their death.  She spoke in very feeling terms about the things she had seen and which she hopes none of us will ever see, but the fact that we do not see them does not mean they are not happening.  The new and modern weapons make them happen to far more people, often in even more horrible ways that they ever happened before.  That seems to me to be a sort of double think that we all have about the role of an army, and I would question a situation of women wanting to subscribe to the values which spend such incredible amounts of the world's wealth on warfare, on weaponry and on the whole manpower for military purposes.  It might be no harm to remind women who may consider volunteering for this corps that four days of the world's military spending could feed 2,000 million of the world's undernourished children for a year.  We must keep that figure in our minds.</P>
    <P>In this extraordinary rush and perennial aggressive army combat business the underdeveloped countries are now rushing to spend, and many of them are spending up to 40 per cent of their GNP on armaments.  The spending on these armaments is totally detrimental to the social development of those countries, <Col N="66" /> and to even feeding their own people.  I question whether the military aggression which makes one country build up an army because other countries have armies is a game that women want to get into.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke to the United Nations last year he denounced the arms race, and he said that nations who build up destructive armaments in an effort to secure national security did not succeed in doing so because it was illusory. One country which builds up an army damages her own situation because other people have to build up armies to cope with it and the crazy spiral goes on.</P>
    <P>I am quite aware that our own Army could not be cast in the role of the United States army, which may be at the point where sometime it might happen that somebody will press a button and finish us all off.  Our Army would not be able to do very much about that.  We must re-think what we are talking about. Women should watch the television advertisements which are encouraging men into the Army at the moment.  These advertisements have been mentioned earlier this evening.  They are very glamorous advertisements which have obviously been designed with all the skill of the expensive advertising agency.  We have Beethoven's Fifth jolting out of people all jazzed up and the aeroplanes and the tanks and the guns and the men springing into action.  My ten year old thinks it is absolutely fantastic, and he wants to be in there as part of the game.  His sister regards it as an extension of his war game that he plays and is amused by it. What are those advertisements telling these young boys?  Are they telling them that they may be emptying the dustbins if the dustbin services break down, a very important service but hardly resembling the advertisements; that they will be patrolling the Border which is a long, dark boring sort of job with very little to do with combat?  Are they telling them that they will be guarding various installations which are essential to the security of the country and that they will be keeping people in military custody, which is something that we should not be <Col N="67" /> having anyway, acting as prison guards? The role our Army has does not resemble what the advertisements portray.</P>
    <P>For a variety of reasons I feel that, I for one, cannot welcome this Bill as ending discrimination against women, because I feel that women who thoughtlessly do so are forgetting that in the search for equality and in the search for self-fulfilment which is what basically the women's movement is about we do not wish to turn into men and that we do not wish to take on the less admirable features of male society as well as the those features that we may consider admirable.</P>
    <P>What exactly is the training of soldiers in the Army designed to do?  Which element of it is designed to make them aggressive?  Which element is designed to knock the softness out of them, or to knock the corners off them, or to make them conform to a certain idea?  I was interested recently&mdash;I say this in all seriousness and I do not wish to raise any hares&mdash;to notice in a recent publication by the AIM Group that they mentioned the fact specifically that they were perturbed by so many Army personnel figuring among the statistics of battering husbands.  It jumped out of the page at me.  I was wondering, since it was so extraordinary, could it have anything to do with the training these people get in the Army.  I am not saying for one moment that training makes men violent and therefore they go home and beat their wives.  We have to ask those kind of questions when we are talking about introducing women into an army who will get similar training to men.</P>
    <P>Sweden has recently introduced a law which prohibits the sale of any war toys of any kind in any shops on the grounds that, if you talk about universal peace while you simultaneously place facsimiles of deadly weapons in the hands of children, you are suffering from a general schizophrenia.  They have banned the sale of all facsimile toys of offensive weapons.  What would they think of our advertisements encouraging young people into the army?  I do not <Col N="68" /> have the answers to all these questions about the Army's role, about women and their role.  I feel that they must be asked. Our peace-keeping input with United Nations forces is an admirably and totally suitable field of operations for any people to be involved in.  That is a very good part for our Army.  However, it does not necessitate the very large facade which it seems to me we have of a combat trained, armed force.  We should examine the role of the Army.</P>
    <P>Women may wish to join the Army.  I hope they will not.  I will not be encouraging anybody I know to do so, but if they wish to join the Army, we certainly must make sure that they will do so to fulfil whatever role they feel they want to fulfil in that Army.  There certainly are suspicions arising from some of the wording of some of the statements that have been made, particularly, I am sorry to say, by the Fine Gael spokesman in the other House to the effect that if men do not want the jobs, or if it would be easier to get women to do jobs to free men for work that the men really want to do, then by all means, get the women in.  There has been that kind of thinking in public statements outside the Oireachtas and inside it.  That is extremely regrettable.  We know that the Defence Forces are excluded from the Employment Equality Act.  Therefore, it is extremely important that the rights of the women who go into the Army will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to safeguarding the rights of women who will want to go into the Army.  The Army does not seem to me to be designed to be an offensive force.  It has a rescue role, and a public service role, and it has a role of training people in a very wide area of technical knowledge and skill.  The Minister has already made it clear that women will be given full equality in the training for those skills, and I welcome that very much.  We need to know a little more about the problems which will arise on the question of married quarters and the equal treatment of married women and married men in the Army.  Differences are quite often made there based on the assumption that <Col N="69" /> a married woman's needs are somehow less than a married man's needs, and she gets less favourable treatment.  The Minister mentioned maternity leave.  I am very pleased he did so, but what about paternity leave?  This is an aspect which is left out of equality legislation. When maternity leave is mentioned, nobody ever mentions paternity leave. Every child has a mother and a father and it is very important to remember that.  We have not mentioned either the question of married women soldiers who have children.  What creche facilities does the Minister envisage?</P>
    <P>There is a situation in which ex-Army men are allowed to have paid leave with allowances for periods of annual training for whatever work they take up after they leave the Army.  We must ask the Minister will this also apply to women. Will they also be given that sort of facility to have annual leave from their jobs for training periods on an annual basis?  Many Senators and, indeed, many Deputies went into some detail about the protection of women and the opportunities for women if they decide to go into the Army.  I agree with all that, and the Minister is so aware of it already that I will not go into it any more.</P>
    <P>I will conclude simply by saying that Irish women may not want to go into the Army as we know it because of the deception and the schizophrenia and the problems we all face about what exactly the Army is.  I wish to emphasise their right to go into the Army and I hope their rights will be fully protected.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few points only.  In welcoming the Bill, I view it first of all as a constructive step in providing new career opportunities for women in the mainstream of our modern Army.  Secondly, to those who would like to see more in the Bill at this time, it should be emphasised that it is a first step, and only a first step.  By carefully monitoring progress it should lead to employing women so as to maximise their contributions throughout the full range of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, certainly I do not share Senator FitzGerald's opinion that the <Col N="70" /> reference by the Minister to enabling women &ldquo;to find a level of career satisfaction commensurate with their aspirations and their undoubted abilities&rdquo; is condescending.  Too often, it seems to me, in both male and female employment, the nature of work involved falls far short of people's capabilities, especially in modern industrial employment. The subject matter of this Bill provides a new and valuable opportunity to provide fulfilling and meaningful careers for women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would extend a very qualified welcome to this Bill.  I share a number of the reservations Senator Hussey expressed.  The reality is that we have an Army.  The Constitution entitles us to raise and maintain an Army and in the foreseeable future we will have an Army.  Hopefully we will have it for defensive purposes and for purposes of peacekeeping in both an Irish context and abroad where this is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Bill the Minister introduced today is worrying because it does not contain any real control over the kind of role women will have in the Army.  It is very much of an enabling measure which achieves the basic objective of ensuring that there will not be sex discrimination in recruitment, that it will be possible to recruit women into the various grades in the Army.</P>
      <P>What worries me is that in the Minister's contribution on the Bill in the other House he had very detailed and very specific proposals relating to the creation of the Women's Corps.  It seems to me as though he has discovered or ascertained a shortfall within the Army, decided that there are a certain number of places, and that this will coincide with the number of women to be recruited to the Women's Corps.  I am not saying this is the only reason he is doing it, but there seems to be a great deal of coincidence between the places which he identifies as being suitable for women, as he puts it, and the number he will recruit.  I will make that specific by referring to the Minister's contribution in Volume 316, column 515, of the Official Report of 23 October where he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I should like to tell the House that 233 existing appointments for noncommissioned personnel and 39 for officers have been ear-marked as suitable for women.  An additional six new officers and one NCO appointment will be required for administration. The only addition to the existing establishment within the force is the creation of six new posts for officers and one new NCO post.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to identify where the appointments will be centred:</P>
    <P>The 279 appointments will be allocated throughout the commands along the following lines: in the Eastern Command, which includes Army Headquarters and the Air Corps, 116; in the Curragh Command, 84; in the Southern Command, 39 and in the Western Command, 40. The six new officer appointments consist of a director, a training officer and four command welfare officers.</P>
    <P>Later, at column 516, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Of the 279 women it is intended to recruit into the force 45 will be officers, 103 NCOs and 131 privates.</P>
    <P>It is all worked out to a very specific degree.  The Minister may say it had to be very carefully thought out and worked out but the emphasis is on identifying posts which will be &ldquo;earmarked as suitable for women&rdquo;, whatever that may mean in practice.  These are new posts being created.  There is not a positive decision to create a new Women's Army Corps which involves the creation of new posts side by side and on equal terms with posts already existing in the Army for the manpower which the Army has at the time of the decision.  It is a question of filling gaps, of placing people in positions that are already there but vacant.  What worries me about that is that the intention seems to be to recruit women into the Defence Forces to fill a need felt at the moment in the Defence Forces, that there will not be much opportunity for the women who respond to the advertisements and seek a <Col N="72" /> career in the Army, whether as officers or as ordinary members of the Defence Forces, to have much say in what kind of career they would like in the Army.  It appears they will not have an opportunity of expressing a view on whether they should be combatant or noncombatant forces.  That is foreclosed by a decision of the Government.</P>
    <P>To what extent has there been any attempt to allow a Women's Service Corps to evolve as the kind of defence corps which women applying to join the Army want?  The Minister referred to their career structure, but he does not seem to be opening up a career structure.  He seems to be filling defined positions already allocated and to be doing it very specifically.  There is nothing about this in the Bill.  The Minister could give more details in his reply as to how he intends to go about this.  How does he intend to achieve the position of having a number of women officers who already have military experience?  Will they be Irish? Where will they have got the military experience? He said in his opening speech: &ldquo;the intention is that some of these will be women of previous military experience who will fill the key appointments of Director and Training Officers.&rdquo;  Perhaps he could explain how he intends to recruit these, or if they are already recruited, and how, in turn, it is intended to recruit the applicants for what are obviously known places already.  It is not a general recruitment on the basis of creating new posts, but rather to fill posts which exist apart from the six new officers.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to comment even briefly on the Bill without referring to accommodation and the kind of provision that will be made.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I intend to provide an attractive uniform and I will ensure that there will be a good standard of accommodation available.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to accommodation, particularly married accommodation, in the Army.  I can only speak for the Cathal Brugha Barracks married quarters.  The accommodation <Col N="73" /> there is deplorable and very little has been done in the past four or five years to improve it.  Anybody who goes there gets one long saga of misery.  Most of the families there seem to be on the housing list for a very long period of time.  The view expressed to me from door to door in the married quarters is that the only way to get rehoused is for the husband to leave the Army, and apparently this is contributing to a substantial drop-out rate, partly because of the pressure of the housing problem.  I do not want to exaggerate this problem, or to undermine morale, but with my own eyes I have seen, and with my own ears I have heard of, the unhappiness of the women and their families in the married quarters in the Cathal Brugha Barracks.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Minister has in mind for that specific barracks.  I know there are plans and I know the Minister visited there not so long ago but nothing seems to come of it. Meanwhile, the women there who have large families have no facilities for young children.  There are no play and no preschool facilities within the barracks. There is a lot of ground there but it is not organised for these children.  The women seem to be very depressed because they do not feel they can speak out about the bad conditions in which they find themselves. They are dissuaded by their husbands from complaining about the conditions. I understand that when a number of women came to Leinster House to complain to the Minister, their husbands were made to feel that if this ever happened again it would cause trouble for them.  In this atmosphere of depression, and a feeling that it is not possible to voice complaints, can the Minister deliver on his commitment to ensure that a good standard of accommodation is available?  I appreciate that this has to be a gradual process, that there are problems involved, and that there is a major housing crisis in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I still feel that if the married quarters in Cathal Brugha Barracks are typical of married quarters for the Defence Forces, they are not being well accommodated or well served by us as a people.  We should be taking much more radical <Col N="74" /> steps to improve the standards of the quarters and also to improve the community surrounds of those quarters. Many women and children are there all day while the men are engaged in their Army duties.  They are alone and bottled up with their problems.  They are depressed.  The children seem to have a very high rate of illness, of continuous visits to doctors and hospitals, and there seems to be a cycle of depression and despair which they do not appear to be able to break out of.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about accommodation for women who will be either officers or members of the Army this will require a great deal of thinking about.  It seems to me&mdash;and a number of Senators mentioned this&mdash;that a good deal of the general accommodation would not be very suitable for a mixed force, if I could put it that way, and presumably there has to be a considerable amount of physical adaptation for this reason.</P>
    <P>I would welcome further information from the Minister as to how the recruitment of women will take place given that, certainly initially, in building up the women's corps it is, if I understand his contribution in the other House, to fill posts that are already there and vacant, what the rate of filling these posts will be, and how they will go about it, and so on. On the question of equality of basic pay, this appears to be secured by the Bill before us, but there can be a very great difference between basic pay and overall remuneration, which can be greatly augmented by the possibility of security duties.  It seems to me that the most important views to be sought on the question of taking part in security duties and getting additional pay for that are those of the women who will be recruited.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister why the decision was taken to exclude women from security duties right across the board, and whether he is open to reconsidering this if the women who apply to join the Army have a completely different viewpoint themselves, and if they feel that it is in itself a discrimination which confines them to a certain number of what he described as posts earmarked as suitable for women.  There can very <Col N="75" /> easily be discrimination if you start earmarking posts as suitable for women and taking a fairly small quota of women into an existing army.  So, as I say, there is a danger that these would be jobs that were not easy to fill within the existing resources.  There is a danger that they will be a particular type of job, despite the Minister's strong affirmation that he does not intend that.  I welcome his own strong views on the matter.  There are dangers in practice as to how it will work out, and we really see no particular controls in this Bill.  All we see is the removal of discrimination on the basis of sex, the opening up of the positions in the Army to the possibility of women being recruited, but all the rest is at an administrative level.  It is to be administered within the Army.  It will not come before this House, so all we can do is ask questions at this stage to ascertain what the position is and hope that the Minister will give us the fullest information on the matter.</P>
    <P>I extend a qualified welcome to this Bill.  So long as we have an Army, so long as it is the approach of countries that it is necessary to maintain a standing army, then it is right and proper that it should be open to both sexes.  I am worried about the approach here when I read the details of what the Minister said in the other House about it, and I would welcome further clarification from him.</P>

    <P>I welcome this Bill very heartily and commend the Minister on bringing it before us.  This is, indeed, an historic occasion for each and every one of us. Reference was made to our Army as being an Army of aggression.  Just look at the name of the Army.  We do not call them an Army of aggression.  We do not even call them an Army.  We call them the Defence Forces.  They are there to defend our rights.  We will be recruiting ladies or women.  Did somebody call them spades?  I do not think so; maybe it was a misunderstanding.  At any rate nobody can object to the word mná. When the mná are recruited there will be a far better tone in the barracks.  They have a wonderful influence where men are concerned.  There is no doubt about <Col N="77" /> that.  At all the ages you can see that happening.  They are well able to acquit themselves in discipline and in the use of arms, if necessary.  I am sure nearly everybody here follows with great pleasure the adventures of Charlie's Angels from time to time.  I certainly do and I enjoy them.  They are three commendable young ladies.</P>
    <P>What is badly wanted in every walk of life in this country is discipline.  One of the ruinations of this State at the moment is the want of discipline in all areas. You cannot beat the sen-fhocal: &ldquo;Ní bhionn an rath ach mar a bhionn an smacht.&rdquo;  If they never learn anything else, young men and women in the Army will learn discipline.  That will stand to them for the rest of their lives.  I was thinking of the various vocations for women in the Army.  I refer to the Army bands.  I should like to see young women soldiers and officers taking part in the Army bands and in other such activities in the Army.  I appeal to the Minister to do anything he possibly can to cultivate and make provision for more and more music in the Army.  What we get from them is excellent.  We are very grateful for that and I am sure the Minister will bear my suggestion in mind.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House any longer, but I must commend the Minister again. This is an historic occasion and I am very glad to have the privilege of speaking in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join other Members of the House in welcoming this Bill.  As I understand it, the approach to this matter by the Minister and the Government is that women should be recruited to do the same kind of jobs, to have the same status, and to be paid the same as existing members of the Defence Forces.  The approach is that there are certain duties to be carried out, certain functions to be carried out, and that it is appropriate at this stage that women should be asked to play a part in carrying out these duties.  I disagree with what I understand to be Senator Robinson's observations in the suggestion that there should be a new women's corps to do a new kind of job, <Col N="78" /> who would carry out certain functions which are not at present being carried out by the members of the Defence Forces.  This would introduce an artificial women's corps.  Senator Robinson seems to complain that the Minister is merely looking at the present position in the army, finding that there are certain jobs for which men are not available, and recruiting women to do these jobs.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach to the creation of a women's corps is proper and valid.  It will mean that women will be doing jobs at present done by men and having the same status and the same remuneration for doing so.  It will, of course, mean that eventually there will be greater opportunities for women. Although specific numbers may be recruited at this stage, as women become integrated into the army there is no reason at all why extra women should not be recruited and why we should not in due course have a much bigger percentage of women in the army compared with what is envisaged at this time.  This approach will mean that there will be far greater opportunities for women as time goes on if they prove to be suitable for the jobs which will be given to them initially. I have no reason at all to doubt that they will prove to be eminently suitable for the duties to which they are assigned.  I welcome this innovation and I have no doubt it will be extremely successful.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Senators who have spoken and in particular those who have welcomed the Bill.  My experience in the other House was that there was unconditional support for the proposal to introduce a women's corps into the Defence Forces, and I am somewhat surprised that the welcome is less in the Seanad and has been qualified, and even more surprised that those who have qualified their welcome are two lady Senators who I thought would have supported my Bill which opens up opportunities <Col N="79" /> for women in an area which had been denied to them since the State was founded.  I would at this stage like to pay a special compliment to Senator Dowling who played a very large part in the decision of my party to bring forward this legislation.  It was part of the Fianna Fail Election Manifesto in 1977 under the Defence heading, and for that reason also it gives me satisfaction that we are implementing that aspect of the manifesto on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald, speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, whether he was serious or not, felt that my opening comments were in some way condescending to women.  I challenge that, and I would deny flatly that anything that I said was in any way condescending. I am seeking to provide an area of opportunity for women which has not been available up to now.  I am not aware of any previous speeches by the Senator urging that this area should be opened up to women.  I find it disturbing that he should seek to slight my comments and my work in this regard.</P>
    <P>Whatever limitations Senators see in the proposal, let them at all times remember that these are only the initial steps.  This is an introductory step and, naturally, we will gain in knowledge from the experience which will be obtained in the initial years.  The reason why the Bill itself is so short and contains so little is that it requires only the legislative change to enable the enlistment of women.  There was no need to provide any sections in the Bill other than changes in the Act which had been designed for a Defence Force which catered solely for male personnel, if one excludes the nursing service which does not have any military commitment.  The administrative arrangements which will be necessary to implement this proposal will be done by way of regulation under the various Defence Acts, principally the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>I sought in the reply to the debate in the Dáil to give some detail so that the House and the Oireachtas in general would have an idea of the direction in which we were moving.  I mentioned certain <Col N="80" /> positions which had been earmarked or which would be deemed suitable for the women's corps when it is established merely to illustrate that quite a lot of thought had gone into the establishment of the corps prior to the legislation being brought forward and in anticipation of the Oireachtas accepting the legislation. Nothing that I said limits in any way the proposals in the future with regard to the appointment of women in various posts in the Army.  The limitations that I see are purely the physical ones, and the policy decision at the moment is not to introduce women into a combat role, but this legislation has not barred them from the combat role.  I am stating that it is not the policy of this Government, at this time, that women who will be enlisted into the Army will be employed in a combat role.  It is, of course, possible to change that policy at any time in the future.  Therefore, Senator FitzGerald need not have any fears regarding justice to the women members of the Defence Forces when they are enlisted.  I made it clear in my introductory remarks that they will be subject to the same military code as men and will have equal opportunities of advancement.</P>
    <P>As time goes by and knowledge and experience grow, the corps concept itself may be dropped.  Again, it is merely the device by which we are introducing women to the Army.  It is not intended that the women would be corralled in this corps and would be separate beings. I am seeking to integrate them throughout the Defence Forces as far as practicable in a complete equality situation. The training, as far as possible, will coincide with the training of recruits and of cadets.  Whatever differences will exist will be to accommodate the physical difference involved which the House will have to accept.</P>
    <P>As regard the question of the combat role, for every solider in the field there are at least two soldiers acting in a supplementary role, and in some armies the ratio has been known to go as high as nine or ten.  The Irish Army structure is on a one-to-two ratio where the numbers trained and available for arms operation and a supplementary role is <Col N="81" /> approximately one to two.  That relates more or less to the type of structure obtaining in most modern armies throughout the world.  I expect that at least in the initial stages in the part for which I am responsible women will play a valuable role with the men in this supporting role.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy and Senator FitzGerald questioned the decision not to involve women in a combat role.  A lot of thought was given to that, and on full examination the decision was made and that is the decision at present.  It also happens to be the decision in most other conventional armies that where women are enlisted they are not employed in a combat role at all.  I am not aware of any army where they are employed on that basis at present.  We would be indeed the exception rather than the rule if we were to seek to introduce them to that role now, especially in the initial stages.  I hope that it will never transpire that it will be necessary to involve them in an aggressive role in operations under arms.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy also queried why the Bill did not say more about the women's corps and the non-combat role and I have explained that it was not necessary to state in the legislation itself that that is a matter of policy and regulation.  We are only enabling the enlistment of women and that is all that is required in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to the question of the uniform and was very scathing in his criticism of Government in regard to the type of uniform which has been made available for enlisted personnel both in the Permanent Defence Forces and An Forsa Cosanta Aitiuil and was critical of the uniform.  The Senator may not be aware that the FCA uniform is to be changed and substantial improvements are being made in it.  The uniform available to serving Permanent Defence Force personnel has not been the subject of criticism in recent years as far as I am aware and as the Senator was not specific I cannot follow him down that road any further.  Certainly I agree that the FCA uniform is most unsuitable.</P>
    <P>The same Senator referred to the conditions <Col N="82" /> in some of the barracks around the country and implied that conditions were very very bad, quoting some incident regarding a washhand basin in the Curragh.  In the Dáil debate his colleague Deputy Creed also displayed ignorance of the conditions in the Defence Forces as they exist today.  The invitation can be extended to any Member of the Oireachtas who wishes to avail of it to come and visit military establishments provided the appropriate permission is sought beforehand from the OCs of the barracks who would be very pleased to show Members of the Oireachtas the conditions which are obtaining.  Maybe in that way Members of the House might become more acquainted with the substantial improvements that have taken place in barracks throughout the country in recent years.  Of course a lot of work still remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to one area where I would agree wholeheartedly, with regard to the married quarters at Cathal Brugha barracks.  She knows that I visited the barracks and that there are plans.  She went on to say that nothing seems to come of it.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>The plans for the replacement of the married quarters at Cathal Brugha barracks have been finalised.  There is a difficulty in implementing the replacement programme all at the one time.  It has to be done on a phased basis so as to facilitate the construction of replacement dwellings on the same site.</P>

      <P>The work is at an advanced stage.  I have not had advance notice of the question but I could get the information for the Senator.  The first block is about to start or has just started.  It is at a very advanced stage, and that programme will continue.  I admit that I was indeed shocked at the conditions I found at Cathal Brugha Barracks and certainly it is my intention to ensure that these married quarters will be demolished and in the shortest possible time be replaced with modern dwellings.  For three-and-a-half years the Senator supported <Col N="83" /> a party in Government and joined that party in Government which tolerated these conditions and that is nothing to be proud of.  I am glad that she agrees with what I am doing.</P>

      <P>It is being done.  There are a number of other locations where I would consider the accommodation as most unsuitable and I have stated on a number of occasions that it is my intention to seek to replace all unsuitable married accommodation in all barracks throughout the country, and a very extensive building programme has been undertaken. The planning of the replacement is well under way.  Construction of a lot of new houses has already commenced and plans for others are in the pipeline.  I see over a period of five years possibly the fulfilment of that commitment on my part to the replacement of all unsuitable married accommodation. It is probably a question of Members of the Oireachtas not being fully aware of what is being done, and I would be happy at any time to supply Deputies or Senators with information if they seek it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised this question in the context of my commitment that adequate and suitable accommodation will be available for the women's service corps when women are being enlisted. This is a matter which needs very full and careful consideration.  One of the few problems that face a Minister seeking to include women in the Defence Forces is the question of accommodation. They are entering into an environment which has been male orientated over the past 40 or 50 years, and all of a sudden we have to seek to provide accommodation for women.  Without going into very great detail, which I doubt the House wants, I give an assurance that this aspect of the work is being attended to and a lot of preparatory work has been done on it.  Locations where accommodation will be required have been identified throughout each command <Col N="84" /> and they have all been listed and all of the OCs either have already taken steps or are about to take steps to make provision for the enlistment of women and the accommodation for them in their barrack areas.</P>
    <P>The main recruiting will take place at the Curragh Camp, and there will be new billet and ancillary accommodation provided there for the training of women recruits.  Work on that new building is expected to commence next year.  Some Senators have queried why provision was not made in the Defence Estimates for this.  I am sure Senators will realise that it is not possible to make provision in the Estimates in advance of legislation. I have tried to anticipate legislation and, as far as I can, to advance the matter prior to the legislation being passed, but it would not have been possible to have made substantial provision in last year's Estimates.  I have sought and have obtained the authority from the Minister for Finance to proceed with the planning, and the planning in all cases is at a very advanced stage.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators queried what type of employment would be available. Again, there is not a final commitment about any decisions that have been made or any indications as to where the members of the women's corps might be employed. The matter has to remain flexible and I have a very open mind on it.  I did mention in the other House that there is a very large number of appointments in the Defence Forces and that 80 per cent of them would be suitable for women. Without going down through the long list, one could say that maybe all of them are suitable, provided that they are non-combatant type appointments.  I certainly have no hang-ups, ideological, chauvinistic or otherwise, as to what is suitable or unsuitable for a woman.  The only criteria that I am applying is that at the moment the policy is not to employ them in a combat role.  I have mentioned some posts which have been identified, and these could be changed later on.  Examples are military police, driver, printer, radio operator, cine-projectionist, groom, the equitation school&mdash;there is absolutely no reason why some of the <Col N="85" /> women's corps should not be employed in that school, photographer, air traffic controller, telegraphists; the list goes on. I want to convince the Senator that it is not the intention that these women will be brought in to do the cooking which unfortunately a lot of males seem to think is the ideal type of employment for these women.  Initially I will be overseeing this to ensure that nothing of that kind happens in the early stages.  I will assure that there will be a fairly good spread of different types of appointments.</P>
    <P>Even though the women will be attached to a corps, it is the intention to assign the members of that corps to different appointments in different commands throughout the country.  Appointments will be available at Army Headquarters in Dublin, at Collins Barracks, Griffith Barracks, Cathal Brugha Barracks, Clancy Barracks, McKee Barracks, Baldonnel and Gormanston, all in the Eastern Command.  In the Southern Command women will be appointed to posts at Collins Barracks, Cork and in the Western Command at Custume Barracks, Athlone and Dun Ui Mhaoiliosa, Galway.  At the Curragh women will be appointed to positions in Ceannt Barracks, Clarke Barracks, McDonagh Barracks, the Military College, Plunkett Barracks, Devoy Barracks, Naas, Kildare Barracks, all in the Curragh Command area.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowling referred to the educational opportunities, and I assure him and the House that the educational opportunities available to cadets and to the non-commissioned ranks will be without distinction as to women members, as also will be the opportunities for technical training which are associated with military service.  Therefore, women having been recruited, passed out and appointed, will be in a position to avail of a variety of courses, some for a few weeks, some of which last for several months, in the same way as other recruits or young non-commissioned soldiers are availing of them up to now. In the case of cadets the entry educational requirements will be as laid down for male cadets, that is five subjects <Col N="86" /> in the leaving certificate including two honours and two of the five subjects must be mathematics or maths/physics on the one hand or English or Irish on the other.  It is the intention that the lady cadets will be able to go on and avail of third level education.  Up to recent years it had been the practice that the cadets would do their third level education courses at University College, Galway.  I have changed that in the sense that I wish to open up the educational opportunities to a much wider sphere of activity than the courses that are available in Galway.</P>
    <P>It would be a retrograde step to continue to have a large number of BAs and B Comms as against the odd one doing engineering, science or other courses. There are courses in the Limerick College of Physical Education and in the regional technical colleges and I do not see any reason why cadets, if deemed suitable and they are agreeable, should not go on and do courses in those colleges.  Already we have some cadets attending the college in Limerick and that may expand.  People might be surprised that I am taking people away from the Galway college but it is for the benefit of the Army and it will, in the long run, prove very valuable.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowling made reference to welfare duties.  It is the intention to provide initally four additional officer appointments, one to each command, and the main task of these officers will be to cater for the personal welfare needs of military personnel, both male and female, and their families.  The initial intake of officers mentioned in the Dail debate was two.  I would like to change that now to possibly four, certainly the two that I mentioned, one to be the director of the women's corps who will hold the rank of commandant and one to hold the rank of captain and to be a training officer, plus two other training officers.  Therefore, the initial intake of mature experienced officers on a short-term commission would be four.  There may be difficulty in obtaining these people, but certainly it will be very beneficial to the proposal if we are able to enlist four such persons at an early date. <Col N="87" /> Naturally if they are to have had military experience it will be necessary that they come from abroad, unless there is some lady living in Ireland at the moment who has had military experience and is of the rank or capabilities required to help initiate the women's corps.  In the main, we expect that we will have to seek these people from abroad and so special conditions of employment will have to be drawn up initially just for them.  Once that early stage is overcome there will be an intake of cadets who will integrate into the male cadet class.</P>
    <P>Consideration is being given at the moment to putting four young cadets on a 12-months training course abroad so that we will have four experienced people appointed on a short-term basis. We will have four cadets with a certain educational standard who will be able to go abroad, do a 12-months course, come back, be commissioned and take up their role in the women's service corps of training and otherwise.  As well as that there will be the introduction of female cadets into the ordinary cadet class.</P>
    <P>The House will understand that if lady members of the cadet class were to come in next September they would not be available to the force for possibly four to five years.  They would have to complete their commissioning course, their cadet course at the Curragh, and if they opted for third level education they could be away for a further three years.  The implementation of all will obviously be slow.  Once we have the initial training officers there will be no difficulty in starting off with the first recruiting class of around 20 recruits to be followed at the end of that training period by a further 20 recruits, so, within the first year, we should have possibly 50 members of the corps already enlisted.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey does an injustice in a number of the comments she made.  She was not very generous in her comments. She said she owed no allegiance to any army, she has no attachment to any army.  I am not too sure what she means, but I hope that all Members of the Oireachtas, and indeed all citizens, <Col N="88" /> would appreciate the valuable role of the Army in modern society.  I hope that Members of the Oireachtas, in particular, appreciate the absolute necessity for an efficient and loyal Army at this time.  I would have hoped that Members of the Oireachtas would have some understanding of the onerous duties that members of the Army are asked to undertake, not just now and again, not just on a monthly basis but on a weekly basis and on a daily basis, so that the rest of the community can proceed about their business and that peace may reign in this land.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all Members of the Seanad are aware of the dangers there are to democracy in this country, of the existence of subversive groups whose one ambition is to destroy the State that has been so carefully constructed since the State was founded.  To ensure the continuance of the peaceful democracy we have come to know and love it is necessary for members of the security forces to do very onerous duties.  In other words, when the community is in its bed there are men in the Army out on patrol who would be just as pleased to be at home with their families like the rest of the community.  This is the reason why I have had to embark upon a recruiting campaign in recent months.</P>
    <P>With the general improvement in the economic and employment position and the attraction for members of the Defence Forces to take up positions outside the Army on completion of their fixed period&mdash;the minimum period is three years&mdash;there has been a substantial increase in the numbers opting out. The overall strength of the Army was dropping.  The further it dropped the more onerous the tasks were on those who were serving.  That could lead to an absolutely intolerable situation.  I appeal to those Senators who have an attachment to the Army, and to those who do not have an attachment to the Army, to recognise the importance of having men in the Defence Forces who are prepared to undertake the vigorous and rigorous duties they are called upon to do in order to ensure the community can carry on its ordinary day-to-day business in peace <Col N="89" /> and without fear.  It is a sad reflection on society that this is necessary.</P>
    <P>Ours is a defence force.  We have no imperialistic, aggressive intentions, and it is a force that is there to protect the community against external aggression.  It is important that we maintain an efficient force as a deterrent against possible aggression from outside.  It can be seen in the society in which we live today, small though it may be, and it must be contained.  Our Army have succeeded successively, with the Garda force and the security forces in general, in containing a situation which could have been explosive, which could have led to disastrous results for this country.  I would, therefore, make a personal appeal to all Senators to support the recruiting campaign, whether it is for males or females and that in any contacts they have with groups of people, whether they are young or old, they will at all times speak favourably about the Army, the conditions, display pride in it and encourage young people to join.  Some are very anxious to make the Army their life-long career, and there are great opportunities for young men and now for young women to have a military career in the force.  There are others who can give very valuable service on a short term, either for three years or for some other length of time.  They can decide at the end of three years if they want to stay on.</P>
    <P>Happily, the pay situation has been improved very substantially over the past two years and the allowances, which are also available, particularly for security duties and other special duties, now ensure that those who serve in the Defence Forces are paid a remuneration which compares very satisfactorily with anything that is available outside of the Defence Forces.  I am happy that that is so.  If there are any Members of the House who are in some doubt about the conditions in the barracks I would be happy if they would come forward and I would certainly arrange for them to have a look.  There are places where there are bad conditions, but they will be shown that there are plans for improvement.  In the main, the conditions are excellent, <Col N="90" /> and that goes across the board, food, accommodation, clothes and the general facilities available.  If there are any suggestions as to how they can be improved I would only be too pleased to know of them and to seek to implement them.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch mentioned the Army School of Music.  He will take it from the general tone of what I am saying that it is not intended to debar women from any of the various appointments available in the Army which are of a non-combatant role.  The Bill, as it is being presented to the House, will permit of the enlistment of women into all sectors of the Defence Forces including the Army School of Music.  When that will be done will depend on developments and how the corps develops.  There is no question that they will be debarred from joining.</P>
    <P>I am quite disturbed with Senator Hussey's contribution where she said she hoped that no women would join, but then, maybe I should not put too much weight on the words of one Senator, although I would have hoped for unanimity in this matter.  If it is any discouragement to her, I would like to inform the House that I announced in the Dáil last week that there was a great interest among women.  We had about 850 inquiries from women who wanted to know more about it and who expressed an interest in joining when recruiting started.  Since I made that comment another 150 have made inquiries, so the figure is now 1,000.  That would fill the establishment figure more than three times over.  I am satisfied that we will be able to meet the establishment figure I have mentioned in the initial stages.  Obviously there is plenty of room for growth.</P>
    <P>Something new was mentioned, paternity leave.  I am sure this is something we would all be very interested in.  It must be accepted that in fixing the conditions of service of military personnel it is standard practice to take cognisance of the conditions that exist in other public service employments.  Paternity leave, unfortunately, is not available elsewhere in the public service.  Until such time as it is <Col N="91" /> available, it would be inappropriate for Senators to suggest that it would be introduced in the Army.</P>
    <P>An interesting point was raised by Senator Hussey in regard to attendance at annual training.  It is a requirement of those who are members of the Reserve Defence Forces, that they come up for annual training.  They are paid the going rate for whichever rank they hold during their period of training.  This facility will, of course, be available to members of the women's service corps because, as provided for in the Bill they may be enlisted in the reserve Defence Forces and would also have that facility.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with one point that Senator Robinson made.  She implied that I had surveyed the Defence Forces and identified a number of vacancies that already existed, which might be suitable for members of the women's service corps, that I then earmarked these and decided that we will have a women's corps so that we can fill these vacancies. I fail to understand how anybody could make that point knowing that this commitment to establish the corps was in fact contained in an election manifesto and whatever vacancies existed back in 1975-76-77 would not necessarily be the same vacancies that would obtain now. A feature of Army life, with the availability of short-term enlistment, is that people who are serving today may have completed that service in three to four years' time and others may be occupying the positions that they held. There is a very big turnover of personnel. The vacancies which exist today do not necessarily exist tomorrow.  I made the point in the Dáil to illustrate the fact that I was sincere or genuine about my proposal to bring the women in on an equal basis and to integrate them as far as possible.  I would not go along with the suggestion made here that the women's service corps should be set up as a completely separate structure with a whole series of new appointments identified and allotted to it different from anything that already exists.  That would be creating a kind of freak group within the Army who happen to be women and <Col N="92" /> who could never succeed in gaining the confidence and the admiration of their colleagues in the force because they would be recognised as people who were being treated separately and differently. My plan and intention are that all will be treated equally as far as is practicable and there are positions, which are occupied now by men, which will in the future be occupied by women, that there will be an inter-action between these vacancies and that there will not be positions identified as women's jobs and others identified as men's jobs.  I would rather see the situation, as far as is practicable, where the women and the men would inter-change between these positions, that they would be recognised as appointments in the Defence Forces, not male appointments or female appointments, that that distinction and designation would not be made.</P>
    <P>I have covered many of the points that were raised.  I would like to thank the Senators for the general tone of the debate.  I had only one or two criticisms. These may be helpful and there may be some things that need attention in the future.  I will certainly have a look at the other points that I may not have dealt with and deal with them in the best way possible.  Again, I would like to thank the House for the reception given to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  As the House will know, on the Adjournment one can raise minor administrative matters, one of the rules being that extra expenditure is not proposed.  I do not propose to advocate extra expenditure.  This is a minor administrative matter of extreme importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will not stop me from making extra expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted, but I do not suppose even the Minister can refer to that in his reply, otherwise he would be out of order too.  I recognise the fact that there has been some movement in this regard.  The matter is an administrative one, it does not cause extra expenditure because the expenditure is already accounted for and agreed.  It is of extreme importance to that small but highly-important group of people who are in receipt of post-graduate awards for research in pure science and engineering.  These people are all postgraduates. They are a highly important sector of our community.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Higher Education Authority have recently set aside money for a large increase in our technological education, and everybody is well aware of the importance not only of the primary degrees in technology but also of the post graduate work.  I would like to emphasise this.  Everybody knows now that in these areas, where knowledge is moving at such a pace, it is just not sufficient to end one's training at the first degree level.  The good students are encouraged to go on to learn more and to develop techniques to become expert in certain areas of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has recognised the importance of this by making awards to people who are studying for research degrees in pure science and engineering.  Those who are the holders of first class degrees or upper second class degrees in pure <Col N="94" /> science and engineering are eligible for awards which are paid out to the Department of Education.  This scheme started back in 1970-1971 and the level of the awards at that time was £350 for the first year and renewal being £400.  In 1978-79 the first award was £540 per annum and the renewal for second or third years, upwards of three years, was £600 per annum.</P>
    <P>I wish to protest about the failure of the Department of Education to pay these grants in time.  The situation, as it stands at the moment, is that students who are eligible for these awards are paid from 1 October monthly in arrears. The normal practice has been for the first two or in some cases three months to go by without any payment being made to these students.  This is purely a matter of administration.  It does not involve any extra expenditure and it is something that could be overcome by a very simple bit of pressure from the Minister on his Department to ensure that grants are paid at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>Students in the last few years have had to wait sometimes until Christmas. In one case, in one year, students were studying for three months before the grant was paid.  They were taking their courses from October to December and the grant was paid late in December. What are these unfortunate students meant to live on?  A grant is meant to be paid monthly in arrears, so the first payment should be made at the end of October or at the very least at the very beginning of November.  The practice has grown up that the first payment is not made before the end of November, sometimes the beginning of December, in one particular case, the end of December. For three months in that year these post graduate students had to exist on bread and water.  In fact they had to go to the bank, get a loan and pay the exorbitant rate of interest the banks charge for lending money.  The banks are only too delighted to have student loans.  It is currently Government policy to cut down our borrowing requirements and to encourage people to restrain their borrowing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except for productive purposes.  This might be regarded as productive purposes but it is an administrative lacuna that they have to go to the banks at all.  I do not think there is any reason for this, particularly in the case of students who are continuing. There may be a reason for a delay in the students who are being signed on for the first time if they are late in getting a supervisor or late in getting acceptance. For those who are continuing, who have done one year with two years to go, have done two years with a further year to go of their post-graduate training in research in pure science and engineering, there is absolutely no reason for the late payment.  I want to protest most strongly on behalf of these students who are a highly important sector of the community.</P>
      <P>The grants are not very high.  The Minister has acknowledged this.  He is doing the best he can to rectify this situation. In view of that there is absolutely no reason why the grants should not be paid on time.  An unfortunate practice has grown up in the Minister's Department by which the grants are paid one, two and sometimes three months late. That is a scandal.  I am not advocating increased expenditure, I am just advocating that the grants be paid on time. I am asking that the practice by which grants are paid two or three months late be terminated now and the people who are entitled to these awards get paid on time.  Of course, the obvious comparison is with Northern Ireland and Britain.  In Northern Ireland and Britain once a student is registered by the universities for these grants the grants are available.  The university is given the grants in advance, the grants are available and once a student is registered he can be handed the envelope over the counter.  I do not see any reason why we could not adopt a similar practice here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I am only able to touch the tip of the iceberg but, of course, there are problems at the undergraduate level.  However, since these grants are paid in that case by local authorities they do not come directly under the Minister.  There is a serious problem there.  There again the Northern Ireland Government have the envelopes ready.</P>
      <P>Something similar happens with English students who are studying in Ireland.  In the case of the post-graduate students the Northern Ireland grants are paid on the nail.  There is not this long delay.  I do not see, as a matter of bureaucratic administration, why this cannot be done in our situation.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate people have had to go to the banks.  They have had to take out loans.  This costs them money.  This could be avoided.  It is Government policy to avoid this sort of thing.  All I am asking the Minister to do is to give me an assurance that this year and from now on the grants will be paid on time. As of yesterday, the forms which are used by the students for application for these grants had not arrived, at least in the university in which I teach.  Of course, the Minister may have sent them out many weeks ago.  It may be the fault of his colleague further down the road who is responsible for other administrative delays.  The situation is the grant forms have not arrived.  If the forms have not arrived, applications cannot be made and the grants cannot be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> I will not accuse the Minister of wanting to cheese pare in this area.  He is not saving much money by holding on to these grants for a couple of months.  He is not that sort of person.  He is making a few bob in interest if he has the money in the bank, but the individual student, who is entitled to 540 in his first year and £600 in his second year, has to borrow money from the bank to survive the first couple of months.  That is an absolute disgrace.</P>
    <P>I would ask in the most pressing manner I can that the Minister look personally into this area, that he take the necessary steps to revive the procedures. I am sure that the third-level institutions will be only too happy to help the Minister and his officials in dealing with the administration of these grants.  I know that the Minister has a good relationship with the institutions involved and there is no reason why they could not work out a satisfactory procedure by which the first payment of the grants would be paid, at the very latest, at the beginning of November to students who register in the beginning of October.  I would urge the Minister most strongly to alleviate the position that these students find themselves in.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom ar dtús a rá go bhfuil fhios agam go bhfuil na deontais teach an-thábhachtach agus go bhfuil na micléinn a dheimheann iad an-thábhachtach i leith forbairt na tíre.  I agree with Senator West that these are very important students and that the research grants in pure science and engineering are important not merely for the students but for the whole country and the development of it.  I am a little puzzled because of a reference that the Senator made to the possible fault of a colleague of mine, because the payment of the grants this year will be at the very same time as they were each year since the scheme was initiated. Consequently there is no specific blame attaching to any colleague of mine.  The scheme to which the Senator refers&mdash;the post-graduate training scheme and research&mdash;is operated on the basis of the academic year.  The <Col N="98" /> current academic year has only just begun and it is difficult to see how any complaint of delay could be justified at this stage.  The allowances under the scheme are paid monthly by my Department to all suitably qualified applicants&mdash;the first class honours and the second class honours, too&mdash;and the first month for which payment is due is October 1979.  Payment for that month will be made in the normal way in November.</P>
      <P>The payment of the allowances is subject <i>inter alia</i> to confirmation by the university authorities of date of commencement and total income from all sources in respect of the students concerned, so that the actual bureaucratic work does not rest with my Department alone. There is also certain obligation on the institutions of higher learning concerned. The latter information is required because there is a maximum level of permitted income from all sources and if this limit is exceeded the grant is reduced accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About October of each year the relevant forms are sent to the university departments for certification in this respect, and the Senator has told me&mdash;he was very coy about naming it&mdash;that in an institution which he knows well, giving us all 14 guesses as to which one it is, the forms have not arrived.  I cannot understand what has happened.  I must find out and if necessary, by special courier, they will be delivered to his institution tomorrow.  There is a relatively simple procedure in relation to renewal students, that is second and third years, and the Senator adverted to this.  Applications for first year grants have to be considered by an advisory committee, bringing in more people than my Department.  The universities themselves and the higher education authority act on those advisory committees.  For this year I understand the committee will meet shortly.  It is not always easy to get the various institutions together, the date that would suit one would not suit another, but they will be meeting shortly to review the current year's applicantions. In the case of renewal students approximately 50 of 160 forms sent to the <Col N="99" /> universities have so far been received back in my Department.  This may be explained by one institution not having received these forms.  Arrangements are being made to have the grants paid early in November to students in respect of whom the appropriate forms have been returned to my Department.</P>
    <P>This is the normal course of action and it cannot be expected that students will be paid for the month of October until the actual month has expired and it is known that they have completed the month's research.  There seems to be a principle there of delivering for the work done.  It has therefore been normal practice to pay the grants for renewal students in November for the month of October and this practice has been adhered to by my Department in so far as the relevant information has been made available to us.  Accordingly, in the case of renewal grants there has been no delay whatever and payments will be made shortly as in the previous years, but I gather from Senator West that he is not merely referring to this year but is making an attack on the system as it has obtained since 1971.</P>

      <P>As regards first-year students the question of delay in payment could not arise at this stage as such grants are normally paid in December and the procedure in relation to the awards for such grants under the scheme is the same this year as in previous years.  The scheme was advertised in May 1979 and the latest receipt of applications was 31 August 1979.  These applications are then verified with the universities, and as some of them relate to results in the autumn examinations this process cannot be completed until October.  The advisory committee to which I have referred already then come together to review the applications and <Col N="100" /> awards are made in the light of their recommendations.  A meeting of the advisory committee to review this year's applications will be held very shortly and it is expected that payment of the first moiety of the grant will be made as usual in December.  The scheme is one to which I attach great importance.  I agree with Senator West that these students deserve all our consideration and I have indicated that in very practical ways since I took office.  In 1977 the values of the grants were, first-year students £450, second- and third-year £500 and for the total income level £1,100 was permitted by way of earnings outside the grant. From January 1978 the grants were increased to £540 for first-year students and £600 for second- and third-year students. From October 1978 the permitted income level was increased to £1,450.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be in a position now, if Senator West allows me on the rules of the House, to announce a further improvement in these provisions which will be offered from 1 October 1979 as follows: for first-year students there is an increase from £540 to £640, for renewal students there is an increase from £600 to £700 and the total income level&mdash;the Provost of Trinity College mentioned this to me as one point which was concerning him and so did people in other colleges&mdash;increased from £1,450 to £1,700.</P>

      <P>One does not want to be doing the buail an sciath bit but one in entitled occasionally to beat the drum.  I will see about the forms, as I have already mentioned and also if there is any way that the scheme can be tightened up I undertake to do so.</P>
